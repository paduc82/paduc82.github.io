    <title>Corrupted User Account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Corrupted User Account</h2>
                    I've already a recent corrupted profile, and I fixed the problem by creating a new one. The problem is that I have a very important document on my new one, and was simply testing it out to see if it worked. Now, this one is corrupted and I can't make a
 new user profile using the other account because it's not an administrative account. My account, the one that is now corrupted, doesn't have a password, so when i'm asked for permission and i just click OK, nothing happens. I want to know if there is any way
 i can create a new user account without the need of confirming an administrator password. If not, then how do i change that, when my corrupted account doesn't even want to let me log in?

<p>You really need to find out why you're getting all these corrupted accounts. Profile corruption can be caused by malware, by file system corruption because of repeated improper shutdowns, and by hardware problems. For the immediate problem, enable the built-in
 Administrator, log into it, create a new extra administrator user (or change the account type for your new user account from Standard to Administrator). Then back up your data to external media (USB hard drive or thumb drive). After the data is safe, troubleshoot
 to find out why you're getting all this profile corruption. To enable the built-in Administrator, boot with your Vista installation DVD.<span>Select the default language, then choose "Repair your computer". Then select "Command Prompt".
 At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:yes [enter]<br />
<br />
[Note: Do not type the brackets!]<br />
<br />
If you don't have a Vista installation DVD (only have a recovery disc), the computer mftr. may have given you the Vista System Repair option (not a System Recovery!) on the diagnostic menu. This diagnostic menu is the same one where you can choose Safe Mode.&nbsp;
 Or you can&nbsp;make a bootable Vista Repair DVD from the file at this link:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</a><br />
<br />
Note: All the Neosmart recovery disc downloads are torrent files. There is a good explanation of torrent files at the Neosmart website. You will need a torrent client such as<a href="http://www.utorrent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">muTorrent</a> to get the files. The torrent client
 will download the .iso file with which to create the bootable DVD. You will need third-party burning software such as Nero, Roxio, or the free ImgBurn (<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.imgburn.com</a> ) to burn the .iso as an image, not as data.<br />
<br />
</span>Now remove the rescue CD/DVD you made, reboot the system into Windows, and log into the built-in Administrator account you enabled.</p>
<p>Make sure the computer is virus/malware-free:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a></p>
<p>If the computer is clean, test the hardware. Start with the RAM and the hard drive.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Hardware_Tshoot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Hardware_Tshoot</a></p>
<p>Once you get things straightened, create an extra administrative user per the recommendations below. Log into it and disable the built-in Administrator again for security purposes.</p>
<p>Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: cmd<br />
When cmd appears in Results above, right-click it and choose "Run as administrator" [OK]. Now you will get the command prompt. At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:no [enter]<br />
<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
<br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP and all other modern operating systems, Vista is a multi-user operating system with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, and Guest. These accounts should be left alone as
 they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Vista because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily work and that
 account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it may be more work than you want to do. Best not to get into a bad situation to begin with.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. Running as a Standard user is best practice for security
 purposes and will help protect your computer from infection. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).<br />

<h3> &#39;captain dunsel&#39;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fresh Windows 10 install with VMWare Fusion</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an iMAC user OS 10.11.5. I am also running VNWare Fusion 8.1.1</p>
<p>I have successfully upgraded A VM&nbsp;from Windows 7 to Windows 10 with the free upgrade using&nbsp;Digital Entitlement which replaces a product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is - If I want to do a fresh re-install of Windows 10 to a VM (meaning skip the Windows 7 install)&nbsp;will the previous activated Digital Entitlement recognize the VM as the same hardware thus allowing the install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have no need to re-install but I want to understand the process in case&nbsp;I ever need to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to anticipate potential problems before the happen such as - Maybe a major upgrade to VMware Fusion&nbsp;or MAC OS will cause a fresh Windows 10 install to&nbsp;believe the VM is on new hardware?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you</p>
<p>Al</p>

<h2>            Child needs to see remaining screen time</h2>
                    <p>I am using thr family features of Windows 10 ans having several heartaches leading to family drama:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. There does not appear to be a way for my child to easily see/track how much screen time is left in Windows 10 so they can plan around it</p>
<p>2. When i get a request to add more time, and I do, it is not cumulative ‚Äî it is always from that moment and does not take into account what was remaining. Eg lets say my child has 14 minutes left and asks me to add 15 more. I click that link and now he
 has 15 from when i clicked it, not 29.</p>
<p>3. Most urgently and frustratingly, the PC does not pick up on the added screen time quickly. This was working well a few weeks ago, but today it intermittently slow, and combined with #1 leads to the PC getting shut down in the middle of a game even after
 ive added more time.</p>

<p>Come on Microsoft! This is very basic feature. I jumped to W10 recently after 10 yeas on iMac. iMac parental controls allow the kid to see the remaining time left by clicking on the time on top bar. Make it work the same way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And iMac also allows the parent to add extra time when the time ends on kid's account by entering the parent's account username and password.</p>

            <p>But to answer your question here 'CountryBoy'....regarding 'Does S&amp;T work for commercial trucks'...the answer is NO...and a 'yes'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's what I mean:&nbsp; NO - S&amp;T does not take into account truck restricted routes (or Hazmat).&nbsp; It also does not allow you enter your truck specific info (height, length, etc.) that also effect your allowed travel routes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a few products that are out there that DO take these into account from a commercial truck perspective....one that comes to mind is ALK CoPIlot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said - there is a large communiy of commercial truck drivers that love S&amp;T.&nbsp; Though it doesn't automatically route you around roads that you might be restricted from - there are add on's (POI files) that allow you to identify things like low bridge
 heights as well as rest areas and fuel stops.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more info on S&amp;T's &nbsp;POI&nbsp; Mega file that includes some truck based info - check out this 6 minute video tutorial on YouTube:&nbsp;

<p>There's also some free training on <a href="http://mypointsales.com/sample.html#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://mypointsales.com/sample.html#</a> that I think you'll find useful for your truck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you get a device to sit on your dash that takes road restirctions into account or not - I suspect you'll find S&amp;T useful anyway.</p>

            Yes, just like the reply above, while Streets&amp;Trips doesn't automatically generate truck-specific routes, it is an EXCELLENT trip planner which allows you to easily modify your routes manually.<br />

<h2>            Surface tablet does not turn on unless its plugged in.</h2>
                    <p>I've informed my company's IT department about this several times and they think I just don't know what im doing.&nbsp; this tablet originally starting having issues within the&nbsp;first few weeks I had it.&nbsp; its been 2 to 3 months now and happens every few weeks.&nbsp;
 really strange.&nbsp; it wont turn on and when I plug it in to charge it shows the battery power meter at 1 bar as if its dead battery.&nbsp; I can then turn it on and use it normally but even after charging it all night or for 24 hrs, it shuts off when its unplugged.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>one note, I do travel wit it and take it overseas where I plug it into a direct 220 outlet.&nbsp;&nbsp; the adapter says it can handle it but I wonder if that has screwed up the battery.</p>

    <title>Xbox gamertag reclaims after 5 years policy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a squirrel73  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox gamertag reclaims after 5 years policy</h2>
                    <p>On 15th October 2016 a new policy came into effect that if an account was inactive for 5 years the gamertag would be reclaimed and released back to active members to claim. However it is still unclear to me whether that means that accounts inactive for 5 years or more before that date would have their gamertags reclaimed or whether the first reclaims under this policy would be in 2021.</p><p><br /></p><p>There is a gamertag that I want however it has been inactive for years and has barely any gamerscore, it did not migrate to Xbox one. Am I going to have to keep checking it regularly to see if it's available or is it still going to be inactive until 2021 assuming it does not become active in that time?</p>

            <p /><blockquote> 
 <p /><p>The account in question shows up with an Avatar on Xbox One (from when it was created on 360)&nbsp;yet when you search it on Xbox.com it shows a blank one and no game history on either Xbox or the website despite the fact it has 365G. Also none of these answered the original question and 2 of them seem to contradict each other... Smwutches seems to imply that the first reclaims will happen in 2021, 5 years after the policy came into effect. Whereas ngocphi seems to imply the reclaims&nbsp;started from when the policy came into effect&nbsp;in 2016.&nbsp;<br />I am aware of the other issues surrounding it to do with accounts not necessarily being inactive and the fact that there is no timetable for releases of old gamertags. It's just frustrating when I know it's not in use and hasn't been on Xbox for many years.&nbsp;</p> 
 </blockquote> <p>so it's a windows 10 account which is required&nbsp;</p><p>Again as mentioned xbox isn't the only system that uses gamertags or avatars&nbsp;</p><p>Blank avatars means they haven't used the editor yet from the windows store or using something else like officd</p>

<p>2. right click on volume icon and click troubleshotting (internet connection required)</p>
<p>3. Reboot your laptop. After that everything should be OK and speakers will works.</p>

<p>
</p><p>https://support.xbox.com/enUS/xbox-one/security/cannot-change-my-privacy-settings</p>

<p>Even not being in a Microsoft Account Family, if the birth date on your Microsoft Account makes you a minor in your region, then it will default certain settings for your account so that Microsoft can cover legal liabilities, and to make those changes you
 would need to be in a Family and have an adult account in that family make changes for your Privacy and Online Safety Settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply removing yourself from a Family Account does not release the restrictions set for a Child account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you would either A) have an adult account add you to their Microsoft Family and make the Privacy and Online Safety Settings or B) if your account birth day is wrong and you don't think you should be a child based on your actual birthday, then you can
 change the birthday on your account to reflect your real birthday, and <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4090292/microsoft-account-age-verification-for-parental-consent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
then perform the Age Verification Process.</a></p>

<h3> xivx fusiionzz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Corrupted Hard drive</h2>
                    
<p><span>My mum sent my hard drive to a friend at her work and he managed to fix it by burning some sort off software to a cd and then inserting it inside the xbox which then fixed the hard drive.
 I had an update error so after many attempts i formatted the hard drive and now i am back to stage 1. I have recently aquired 2 CD's. I am hoping to burn the hard drive fix to one and the update to the other then fixing the xbox 360 console. I am unaware off
 the software he used. Does anyone have an idea off what it could be or could someone give me some help to how i could fix it please ?
</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks </span>

    <title>Access XB360 &#47; XB1 Cloud Saves...without an Xbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hawtshowerz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access XB360 &#47; XB1 Cloud Saves...without an Xbox</h2>
                    Greetings Support &amp; Users,<br />
<br />
What's up guys! Just two questions that may have been spammed already:<br />
1.) I have Minecraft saves on XB360 and XB1 'Cloud save storage'. How do I get them without an Xbox console?<br />
<br />
2.) Alternatively, CAN I ENABLE Xbox Live Cloud Saved Game Storage access via the Windows 10 OS?<br />
<br />
Some additional thoughts:<br />
<br />
Please note that from my perspective, declaring this cannot be done tells me that Microsoft is running a Cloud storage server which, unlike OneDrive, is completely inaccessible by any means other than authenticating via an Xbox machine. If this is true, I personally
 would find it strange, unless it was due to security concerns.<br />
<br />
Any guidance on this matter would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Happy Holidays,<br />
Showerz

<p>Hiya Hawt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Forum support!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you would like to move your saves and levels from one console/device to another, but as long as the content is eligible or has the set requirements then there should be no issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) If you are referring to moving the <strong>Xbo</strong><strong>x Cloud Save</strong> to a Mojang supported Minecraft for pc, then I don't believe there is a way to convert it.&nbsp;I would recommend posting on
<a href="https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Minecraftforum.net/forums</a> for more support on that matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) If you have <strong>Minecraft play anywhere or window 10&nbsp;Edition</strong>, then all saves for Minecraft are automatically saved to the Xbox&nbsp;cloud storage/ Xbox Profile. (Xbox app on pc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>(If you are referring to one device to another then once again, refer to the Minecraft forums as posted above)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p>Hiya Hawt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was very curious if there was any other method to move the content so, after looking further into this information I have found a link to support what was stated above.</p>
<p>Feel free to check out: <a href="https://minecraft.net/en-us/realms/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Minecraft Realms FAQ</a></p>
Can I play on Realms across different devices?
<p>"Yes! Most versions of Minecraft now allow players to get together, regardless of which device they're on. Anyone playing on Xbox One S, Xbox One X, Android, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Windows 10, Windows Phone, Amazon Fire tablets or Gear VR can play together.
 Players of Minecraft Java Edition can currently only play with each other. "</p>

            Greetings all,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your feedback, I will kindly refer to the URL's you've linked to review the info I have available to proceed.<br />
<br />
Yes, if anyone is curious about this, I think what happened w/ me is that - not only did we migrate a Minecraft map from XB1 over to PC, when the new edition came out - but this was in-fact a map which was converted as thus: From XB360 Minecraft version to
 XB1, to the new XB1 version, then hosted on a LAN (I THINK), and somehow ported over to my PC. Or maybe it was a Realm we used.<br />
<br />
At any rate, you can imagine my great vexation when, no longer having a console at my disposal, I find myself quite incapable of accessing the said map....maybe if I borrow a friend's Xbox, idk, we'll see.<br />
<br />
Thanks again, and Happy Holidays!<br />
<br />
Best,<br />
Showerz

                    <p>I&nbsp;have a new HP laptop with windows 10 and am trying to&nbsp;connect my&nbsp;HP P1505 LaserJet printer.</p>
<p>It is connected with the USB cable.</p>
<p>I have downloaded the 64 bit driver from HP.</p>
<p>I have loaded the printer driver&nbsp;thru Control Panel - Printers.</p>
<p>It appears to load the driver into Windows 10 and then fails at the printer test - nothing happens!</p>
<p>Looking for help to solve this problem as the printer is nearly new as does a great job while connected to my desktop PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will welcome any ideas and help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>ok i have to say i hate the forums it took me over 20 mins to post this and im really angery ive had several incidents where ive had microsoft on the phone and wasted money on this system ive been threw 4 xbox ones and i have to say the customer service
 sucks. I purchased games several times and have had nothing but issues and i paid for my xbox live so there is no issue there and calling microsoft was no good because they put the blame on me. so i am really&nbsp;annoyed now because i baught titanfall and now
 i cant even play it because microsoft&nbsp;messed up again way to go team way to treat your loyal customers you know the ones whom put money in your pockets well i am so mad i cant even tell you because ive wasted time money for a company who cant even give anything
 to there customers for the issues wow were all really excited for that. anyways please dont mock me or try to defend because ive been threw this and you would think they want to take care of its customers but its turning to a big mess. anyways anyone else
 feel this way if so we need to be heard for microsoft to do something about it im tired of wasting money</p>

<h2>            How do I stop Tap Provider V9 from asking me to install&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was casually browsing the web on chrome when a popup came by. I clicked don't install and unchecked the " Always trust OpenVPN Technologies, Inc. "</p>
<p>It keeps popping up like 6 or 7 times in a row, I did a little bit of research, but only to find help to those who have inadvertently installed it already. I don'y know if i accidentally visited an infected website.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
The popup looks like this:&nbsp;http://www.2-remove-virus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/TAP-Provider-V9-for-Private-Tunnel.png</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I don't know if this helps but when I brought my laptop to a repairman he said that he installed Office for free, illegally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

            Hi Tori,
<br />
<br />The pirated version of Office has something to do with it. The interface is meant to spoof a KMS server, which is used to activate that Office copy. The easiest route is to take it back to the repairman, and remove that pirated version of Office.
<br />
<br />You can simply uninstall Microsoft Office though and see if the pop-up persists. Keep me posted.

    <title>Surface Pro 2 Errors on device manager. Paint peeling off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pluga69  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2 Errors on device manager. Paint peeling off</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased my first SP2, in January 2014, finding 3 days later, that device manager had reported errors on drivers, (Telemetry driver), then keyboard type 2, will work on and off, WiFi will disconnect at all times, noticed it was getting quite hot,,,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Time to call Microsoft,, explained problems and got a replacement, very quick within 7 days, superb customer service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love my SP2, but then again I was willing to give it a second chance, I received my replacement SP2 512GB, Price TAG $2.000.00 AU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fired it up, install Microsoft wedge mouse, and guess what?,, errors again on device manager,, switches of from time to time, refuses to go sleep or wake up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paint after the 3rd day is chipping away from charging port connector, also kick stand paint is fairly easy to scratch, and peel I guess not a good idea anodized paint....</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is will Microsoft address these problems, or they will just keep replacing units until I get fed up!!. I do not have time to waste resetting or returning devices every week, and finding that the same problem arises.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SP2 was advertised as a tough and powerful tablet, no doubt about being powerful!! what about tough?,, what about problems with drivers?,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we consider that this tablet is to be used outdoors as well as indoors, you would expect something a little more durable to withstand every day routine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, my little advice is consider to check QC. prior of launch, in order to keep customer happy. Don't worry about competitors out there. This is not a race.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Ethic: (Happy customer=Happy sales).</p>
<p>

            <p>I purchased a Surface 2 less than 2 weeks ago. The paint is peeling from the back of the device and it has hardly seen daylight. I recently moved from Apple to Microsoft because of the practicality the Surface 2 provided with regards to Office applications.
 I will be returning this product to the supplier for a replacement. If the new device experiences the same poor quality or I&nbsp;have issues returning the product I will have no hesitation in returning to Apple as their service and quality of devices are second
 to none. Disappointed as was looking forward to a great alternative to Apple. </p>

            <p>My Surface 2 (the RT version) unfortunately is suffering from paint problems as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The paint has started to blister on side after the corners already did let go of some paint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will only be a matter of time before the blisters will becomes chips that will come of the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has top notch customer service, so I will send it back for replacement/fixing one I receive the Surface Pro I ordered.</p>

            Hi, Steve,
<br />
<br />I am an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />Have you verified if the website is down?
<br />Are you using the Pandora App or accessing the website to play music?
<br />Have you tried using a different browser if accessing the website?
<br />
<br />1. Right click on start &gt; Select PowerShell (Admin)
<br />Type ping www.pandora.com &gt; Press Enter
<br />
<br />Is the website responding?
<br />
<br />2. Using App
<br />Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features
<br />Click on Pandora App
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Scroll down and Reset the app
<br />If that does not work, uninstall the app.
<br />Reboot and reinstall the app from Microsoft Store.
<br />

    <title>Films &#38; Tv app showing &#34;Can&#39;t play. Choose something else - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Films &#38; Tv app showing &#34;Can&#39;t play. Choose something else to play. This item is in a format we don&#39;t support. 0xc1010103&#34; error</h2>
                    <p>I tried to play a mkv file using the films &amp; tv app, the file was playing fine but when I tried to use the 'Cast to device' feature so that I could watch it using my XBOX I got an error message saying "Can't play. Choose something else to play. This item
 is in a format we don't support. 0xc1010103".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that maybe the app might support that format on my laptop but not on the xbox for some reason. I then converted the file to a different format and tried again; it still didn't work. I tried converting the file several more times and changing the
 audio codec, yet I still got this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I realized it couldn't possibly be the file so I tried to play two other files that I have already watched by casting the video to my Xbox, however these files were suddenly giving me the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the troubleshooter for windows apps (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/69e76f90-d54c-44cf-9851-c2d1542790db/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps) it said the windows store cache and licences may be corrupt. When i try to
 resolve the problem it then tells me the Windows store cache may be damaged and it's not fixed....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea if this is what's causing the problem or maybe it's an update that's been installed (or I need to install an update) but this was the easiest way for me to watch videos from my laptop on my tv and I'm annoyed that it's just suddenly stopped
 working :(&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reiterate, the videos play fine on my laptop using the films &amp; tv app, the problem only occurs when I click 'Cast to device' and then select my Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any idea how to fix this I'd really appreciate it!</p>
