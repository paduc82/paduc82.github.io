<h2>            Injustice 2 won&#8217;t let me play it</h2>
                    <p>So, when the free trial for Injustice 2 was active, I installed it and played it until it was over. I later uninstalled it. I recently bought the disc version of the game for a good price compared to the&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;store. After&nbsp;installation, the game wouldn‚Äôt let me play and only said,‚ÄùThe trial of the game has expired. If you wish to play more then buy the full game.‚Äù From there I uninstalled and reinstalled the game with the same results...Help???</p>

    <title>Microsoft Store and Tune Up Service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianboerma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Store and Tune Up Service</h2>
                    <p>I recently read online surface pro owners could make an appointment at a Microsoft store and receive a free "tune up" for their surface.&nbsp; The nearest store for me is an hour and half away.&nbsp; I am writing to ask if someone could share with me what does this
 tune up involve and if this is something I could do from home.&nbsp; I also wanted to ask if Microsoft offers any online tune up or software that can be downloaded to use at home. If not, are there any tune up software packages that are recommended and safe?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance</p>

            As far as I know, the "tune up" includes insuring all updates that are available are installed and a scan for malware/viruses. If you are having hardware or software issues, they will also diagnose and assist with fixing. 
<br />
<br />I don't think you need to make the trip if you aren't having issues. Additionally, Microsoft offers a downloadable Surface Diagnostic Toolkit that you can run to insure everything is updated and working properly <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/403723...</a>

<h2>            I want to know, if my licence is linked to my MS account</h2>
                    <p>Hi, so my PC crashed few month ago and I am thinking about repairing it. But since my MOBO died, I need to buy new one, with newer CPU (newer socket) and RAM (get new DDR4 instead of DDR3). So problem is that quite a lot of HW will be replaced and also GPU
 was replaced earlier. So I think that licence won't recognize the HW. And the thing is, I have my work laptop, personal laptop si I don't want to invest in a new licence for my personal desktop (I will rather throw it away than invest too much money - I just
 want to restore it with low end CPU and MOBO)&nbsp;<br />
So question is, how to know, if my licence key is linked to my MS account or not.</p>
<p>Again, I can't start my old PC to get this information from the PC settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Bye</p>

            HI David.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Sign into the MS account to see if it's linked:  <a href="https://login.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://login.live.com/</a>
<br />
<br />As long as the underlying license you upgraded or that came with WIndows 10 is retail and not factory preinstalled or builder's OEM, then it can transfer since Upgrade inherits the rights and restrictions.  
<br />
<br />But did you buy the key from Microsoft or a major retailer who backs their sales so you know it's genuine?  Any discount key is most likely bogus.  See here How to Tell:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/defau...</a>
<br />
<br />The procedure is here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />It is possible to do yourself if you'd previously signed in with your Microsoft account and it linked to the Digital License as shown in Status at top of the Activation Settings page.  Then when you change motherboard, you'd sign in again and run the Troubleshooter.  We recently learned it will even make exceptions for OEM if all else is proper.  So that's your best bet.  
<br />
<br />Another thing that sometimes works for free Upgrade is to input at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation &gt; Change Product Key   the Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 Product Key that was upgraded from.  
<br />
<br />If not contact Microsoft Support:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi David, 
<br /> Digital license stored in Microsoft account is not a license at all and is valid only for unchanged hardware so need to be renewed by ordinary activation with product key after motherboard replacement. 
<br /> How did you get Windows 10? 
<br /> If it was preinstalled you have no rights to use it after motherboard replacement unfortunately and need to buy new license.. 
<br /> If you bought Windows in Microsoft Store or in local retail store, please call Microsoft support during work hours and ask a help from support person.

            Is you product key from preinstalled Windows or from Windows bought separately from computer? First cannot be transferred to another hardware, the second allow transferring but may require activation by phone.

<p>1.&nbsp; I have a new XBOX, old drive is dead. How do I transfer my licenses so I can download DLC (map packs for Call of Duty, car packs for Forza 3) to my new machine?</p>
<p>2. I do not have a power supply for the Xbox 360 SLIM, but I have an old power supply.&nbsp; I found a conversion cable on EBay that is supposed to allow you to use the old power supply. Does anyone have one of these or know if it works?</p>

<p>All you need to do is recover your old gamertag on the new Xbox 360 S and the license should automatically move over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the converter cable for a Xbox 360 Pro system being used to power a Xbox 360 S system... I wouldn't try it. The voltage may not match what the system itself needs to use to power itself. It may not be safe. May I ask why you do not have a power block
 for the Xbox 360 S system, it should have came with one.</p>

<p>The power supply was lost when I moved, my friend whose XBox died gave me the power supply not knowing they were different now.</p>
<p>I am really confused about the license part though because I remember on the Forza forums many people having a problem getting their DLC, and that they had to go to some website and put in I believe their serial number. I can't find the threads on the Forza
 Forums about it so figured I'd ask here.</p>
<p>Do you know of any such website?</p>
<p>I think I am going to try the conversion cable, there is a youtube video of a guy who hooks it up and uses it, and its only $5. Either way, at the current time I have no video games, if it fries the machine I don't even care as I planned on saving up for
 a new one anyway. </p>
<p>Thanks for your help PO735</p>

Xbox 360 Content License Restoration
What is the license transfer tool?
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://live.xbox.com/ConsoleLicenseTransfer/Begin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">license transfer tool</a>&nbsp;on Xbox.com lets you&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Support/LicenseMigration/FAQ#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">consolidate</a>&nbsp;all of your downloaded
 content licenses to one console. For example, if you downloaded items from Xbox LIVE¬Æ Marketplace on one console, then purchased another console later on and downloaded more content to the new one, your content would be licensed to two consoles. This tool
 lets you download your older content licenses to your new console.</p>
Why did Xbox create this tool?
<p>We are always looking at ways to improve the Xbox 360¬Æ and Xbox LIVE experience. With the success of Xbox LIVE Marketplace, the need for a tool to consolidate content licenses became apparent. &nbsp;</p>
My console was recently repaired; do I need to use the tool?
<p>In most cases, no, you do not need to use the tool. Licenses are transferred automatically during the repair process but you may need to download them again. In a small number of cases, the transfer may not&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Support/LicenseMigration/FAQ#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">complete</a>&nbsp;correctly
 during repair and you might need to use the transfer tool to move your licenses. If, after redownloading the content, you are still having an issue, then using the transfer tool is the right step.</p>
How often can I use the tool?
<p>The tool can only be used once every 121 days.</p>
Why can I use the tool only once per 121 days?
<p>The tool is intended to allow consumers to consolidate their licenses they purchased on multiple consoles to a primary console. It is not intended to continually move content between multiple consoles.</p>
Why can't I move licenses to multiple consoles?
<p>Most customers have a single console. However, they may have downloaded items to multiple consoles over time. We want to provide a way for these customers to consolidate their licenses on their current console. You can still use your content on other consoles
 while signed in to Xbox LIVE.</p>
What licenses are&nbsp;<em>NOT</em>&nbsp;transferred by the tool?
<p>Due to licensing restrictions, movie rental licenses are not transferred. Make sure you watch your movies before using this tool.</p>
I've finished the process on xbox.com, now what do I need to do?
<p>You need to download the licenses to your new console.</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Support/LicenseMigration/FAQ#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">a hard drive</a>&nbsp;or memory unit.
</li><li>Turn on the console. </li><li>Sign in to Xbox LIVE with the gamer profile that originally downloaded the content.
</li><li>Press the silver Guide button on your controller to open the Xbox Guide. </li><li>Go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<strong>Account Management.</strong>
</li><li>Then select&nbsp;<strong>Download History</strong>. </li><li>Repeat step 5 for each item in your download history. </li></ul>
What happens to my content on the original console?
<p>The content is no longer licensed to the old console. You can delete it, or you can use it while signed in to Xbox LIVE.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
Have you updated your display/video or other major drivers lately - check in Control Panel -<br />
Windows Updates to see if a driver has been loaded there. Use the generic troubleshooter below<br />
and when you get to the driver section use the methods in the next message and then return to<br />
the troubleshooter as needed. In rare cases the antivirus/antispyware/security programs can<br />
cause this error.<br />
<br />
Also check with System Maker and Video/Display adapter's&nbsp;Support as there could be known<br />
issues -&nbsp;also check in their forums.<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode : 116&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000116</strong><br />
<br />
The VIDEO_TDR_ ERROR bug check has a value of 0x00000116. This indicates that an attempt<br />
to reset the display driver and recover from a timeout failed. <br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 116&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000116&nbsp; &lt;-- read this<br />
</strong><a href="http://www.faultwire.com/solutions-fatal_error/Attempt-to-reset-the-display-driver-and-recover-from-0x00000116-*1275.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.faultwire.com/solutions-fatal_error/Attempt-to-reset-the-display-driver-and-recover-from-0x00000116-*1275.html</span></a><br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The inclusion of the 116 error code in the troubleshooter is only coincidence and holds no<br />
specific meaning (other than driver caused bluescreens do occur with some frequency).<br />
<br />
Look in the Event Viewer to see if anything is reported about those.<br />
<a href="http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/vista/vista_event_viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/vista/vista_event_viewer.htm</span></a><br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />

BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />

<p>or in this format :</p>

Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

<h2>            Cannot enable Windows Media Center feature in Windows 7</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>My initial problem was that the media streaming feature would not turn on. &nbsp;I tried to disable and enable Windows Media Center and Windows Media Player in windows features.</strong></p>
<p>I was able to turn Windows Media Player back on, however, &nbsp;Windows Media Center fails to install with the message, "An error has&nbsp;occurred. &nbsp;Not all the features were successfully changed."</p>
<p>I tried disabling start-up items and non-Microsoft services with msconfig but it did not make a difference. &nbsp;I also ran sfc /scannow. &nbsp;Nothing I've tried works. &nbsp;Any ideas?</p>

<p><span><span><span>Hi Mr. Blueshirt,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>What is the result of the SFC scan that you have run on your computer?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Probably the file might have gone bad for Windows Media Center. You might have to perform an In-Place upgrade of the Operating
 System and check if that works fine for you.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Configure the machine in clean boot state. You can follow the given steps:</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The steps to be performed in clean boot are given below:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original
 Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently
 delete all restore points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>For further information on clean boot please follow the below given link:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>NOTE:</span></span></strong><span> To perform
 an upgrade or the ‚Äúin-place Upgrade‚Äù you must roll back to whatever Service Pack is on the installation DVD i.e. if you have no Service Pack on the DVD, and there shouldn't be any Service Pack on the machine before trying these steps.&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>To upgrade the current Windows operating system on your computer to Windows 7, follow these steps:
</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start the computer and make sure that the current version of Windows has started.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Start and then click on Control Panel.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Program and then click on Turn Windows Features On or Off under Programs and Features.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows DFS Replication Service</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once done, restart the computer and follow the rest of the steps.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insert the Windows 7 DVD into the DVD drive and then close the drive tray. Wait a moment for the Setup program to start
 automatically.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Setup program does not start automatically, follow these steps:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Click Start and then click Run.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Type Drive:\setup.exe and then click OK.

    <title>Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 doesn&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dristvaan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I have a Microsoft Natural&nbsp;Ergonomic Keyboard 4000, which I bought about two months ago.</p>
<p>First, it worked perfectly, then it started not being recognized, but unplugging and plugging it back always fixed the issue.</p>
<p>However, now it doesn't work at all.</p>
<p>(I am trying to use it with a Dell Latitude E5530 vPro, Windows 8.1.)</p>
<ol>
<li>It is not recognized during boot - nothing happens when I press any button (Del, F12, F8)</li><li>If I unplug it and plug it back, one of the following happens, but whichever happens, the keyboard doesn't work.
<ul>
<li>All the toggle key LEDs are green</li><li>The Caps Lock LED flashes and then goes out</li><li>Num Locl, Caps Lock and Scroll Lock LEDs flash</li><li>No LEDs are green</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>Troubleshooting steps I've tried so far</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstalled Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center - same issue</li><li>Reinstalled <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-in/p/natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000#support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center</a>&nbsp;(the only driver I could find for this keyboard)&nbsp;- same issue</li><li>I have a powered USB port - plugging&nbsp;the keyboard&nbsp;into it doesn't help</li><li>Plugged the keyboard directly into a port on the laptop - same issue</li><li>Rebooted the computer to go into safe mode - can't do because F8 does nothing (since the keyboard is not recognized during boot, either)</li><li>Tried it with a desktop (Dell OptiPlex 990, Windows 8.1) - during boot, it actually said that there is not keyboard connected (even though it was plugged in), after booting, all LEDs were green and keyboard was not recognized.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I see not much&nbsp;point in trying with a Windows 7 machine as it already doesn't work during boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all these in mind, should I safely assume it is a hardware fault and bring it back to the&nbsp;shop or is there something I can still try?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Forums. I understand how inconvenient it is when such a thing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate all your efforts in troubleshooting this issue. You have performed mostly all the logical troubleshooting steps to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By checking the troubleshooting steps, I would suggest you to try the keyboard with another computer, as you suggested, a Windows 7 computer. By this we can come to conclusion if the hardware itself if faulty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the keyboard does not work in another computer, you may go to the store and get it replaced if it is under warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information was helpful.</p>

    <title>Constant BSOD &#40;Critical Process Died&#41; errors after Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopher-v  say:</h3>
<h2>            Constant BSOD &#40;Critical Process Died&#41; errors after Windows 10 update &#40;version 1607&#41;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the "anniversary update" was applied to my previously stable windows 10 PC I have been experiencing contant, BSOD stop errors. (Critical Process Died). There were no hardware changes or driver updates before the issue arose. It is no longer possible
 to leave anything unsaved or any webpage open as I am forced to reboot several times a day.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The PC is an HP Desktop model Pavilion 6520f with an AMD Athlon II x4 635 2.90 Ghz processor and 12 MB of memory.&nbsp; The PC is from about 2010 but the 1 T hardrive, memory ,added video card (NVIDIA) and power supply were upgraded&nbsp;about a&nbsp;year ago before
 the installation of Windows 10. I performed a clean install of Windows 7 on the newer harddrive and then upgraded to Windows 10 Home edition. Until this week's update to version 1607 the system had always been stable and there were no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is so unusual about this problem is that it only seems to occur when the computer has been idle for a while and no DMP error logs are created. It boots normally into the OS (every time) and functions without problems or error messages&nbsp;of any kind.
 Although I haven't sat and watched, it&nbsp;seems to crash only when the computer goes to sleep after a few hours of inactivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; After I disabled automatic reboot the same screen appears every time:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " The PC ran into a problem and needs to&nbsp;restart.&nbsp; CRITICAL PROCESS DIED "</p>
<p>
</p><p>The data collection on the stop error remains frozen at 0%. There is no notification that Windows experienced a critical error at the next reboot. There are no critical system errors recorded in&nbsp;Event Viewer&nbsp;and no minidump or memory dump files are collected
 ( Neither minidump or MEMORY.dmp can be found even though the computer experiences a stop error several times a day every day since the installation of the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I have tried running SFC scanner. No errors are found. It is likely that I could temporarily fix the problem by using system restore to remove the anniversary update but since Windows 10 forces you to intall all updates what would be the point?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was an update available for the NVIDIA video drivers which I have applied but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate any advice or help anyone might offer but based on what I've been reading about other CRITICAL PROCESS DIED erros&nbsp;on Windows 10 systems,&nbsp;I don't have much hope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that I must get used to turning off my computer and starting fresh every time I walk away from it. Incredibly frustrating. Happy windows 10 anniversary Microsoft.</p>
<p>

            <p>&nbsp; Thank you very much for your reply. I really appreciate your offer of help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked out the web page you cited but like many&nbsp; others I found referencing "Critical Process Died" there was nothing helpful to my situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the eight suggestions 1, 4, 5 and 8 were not relevant since my computer is not experiencing any problems booting and&nbsp;after several scans including SFC, CHKDSK,&nbsp;I&nbsp;found no errors&nbsp;among the system files and no bad sectors on my hard drive. I also updated
 the few drivers that were not already current. So I've basically already tried the other suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; The only variable seems to be the cumulative update to Windows 10 OS which Microsoft apparently rolled out without thoroughly testing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I have high confidence that using System Restore to roll back the update would indeed stop the blue screen errors, I am mystified as to why anyone would offer this as an ostensible solution to a&nbsp;Windows 10 update problem since there is no option
 to opt out. The problem update would only be reinstalled within 48 hours and I'd be back to where I started.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Other observations: </p>
<p>
</p><p>While the overwhelming majority of the&nbsp;stop errors on my system&nbsp; reference "Critical Process Died"&nbsp; I saw two other stop errors in the last few days: one "Kernel Data Inpage error" and one "Unexpected Store exception". My hopes were raised when I noticed
 that a new cumulative update for Windows 10&nbsp; was installed on October 11th but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I've found that it does not always take several hours for the errors to appear. They seem to come at random intervals but never when the OS is loading or in use but only when the computer is idle.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course if no solution is found then system file corruption will become a self fulfilling prophecy. It seems inevitable if my system is crashing a few times every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have also ran a memory diagnostic which found no problems with the installed memory.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still in need of help if anyone has any insights. I would especially be interested in hearing from someone from Microsoft.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Thank you so much for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The DMP files do not exist. There were not there when I looked before and they are still not there.</p>
<p>I even changed folder options and enabled "show protected system files" ( "show hidden files" was already enabled) and checked again. No DMP files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Following the instructions on the link you provided under the "Write debugging information" header (which was enabled) I switched to "automatic memory dump". I don't know if that will help when the next stop error occurs.</p>

<p>

            <p>Thank you for your advice. Although it did not work, I think you're on the right track. It must be some software conflict with the system update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I completely uninstalled the Nvidia drivers and performed a clean install. In addition, a system update for version 1607 was installed today. My hopes were raised because there were no crashes overnight after I reinstalled the video drivers and software,
 but came home to find another CRITICAL PROCESS DIED stop error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Since there are still no .DMP files being created, can you glean from the system info file any other potential sources of conflict?</p>

<p>Hello Cliff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to better assist you, have you tried checking if there's an error reported under Windows Update from the Settings app? If not, refer to the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong><em>Windows key + I</em></strong>, then select <strong><em>Update &amp; Security</em></strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong><em>Windows Update</em></strong>, then click on <strong><em>View installed update history</em></strong>.</li><li>Check for any error messages. </li><li>You can visit this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-hk/help/10587/windows-10-get-help-with-upgrade-installation-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article
</a></strong>to get help with Windows 10 upgrade and installation errors.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Another way to check for errors is to view the <strong>WindowsUpdate.log</strong> in this directory:
<em>C:\Windows\WindowsUpdate.log</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check the articles below to help you read Windows Update logs.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3036646/how-to-read-windows-update-logs-in-windows-10-version-1607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>How to read Windows Update logs in Windows 10 Version 1607</strong></a></li><li><strong><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/charlesa_us/2015/08/06/windows-10-windowsupdate-log-and-how-to-view-it-with-powershell-or-tracefmt-exe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10, WindowsUpdate.log and how to view it with PowerShell
 or Tracefmt.exe</a></strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile,<span> let's troubleshoot the issue on Windows Update by performing the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1: Run the Windows built-in troubleshooter</strong></span></p>

</p><p><span>1. </span>Press <strong><em>Windows key + I</em></strong>, then select <strong>
<em>Update &amp; Security</em></strong>.</p>
<p><span>2. Click on Troubleshoot. Under Get up and running, select Windows Update.</span></p>
<p>3. Click on Run the troubleshooter button<span>, then click on <em><strong>Next
</strong></em>and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If that didn't do the trick, proceed to method 2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2: Manually Reset Windows Update Components</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue might also occur due to corruption in Windows Update component files. We suggest to manually reset the Windows Update Components, refer to the steps on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article.</a></strong></span></p>

<p>When I ran the Get-WindowsUpdateLog command in Powershell as an administrator, I did not see any messages indicating Input or listing .etl files.&nbsp; Instead I saw a dialog asking me which tool to use to display the results.&nbsp; I selected Notepad.&nbsp; Once Notepad
 was up the Notepad edit area remained blank.</p>
<p>The C:\WINDOWS\Logs\WindowsUpdate folder has three files totaling 36kb of .etl files timestamped for the time the update was trying to run, so it looks like there is .etl content, I just can't see it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It goes pretty quickly.&nbsp; Usually the&nbsp; WindowsUpdate.log&nbsp; will be written to your&nbsp; Desktop.&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably you don't have a file type association for .log files so that would be what that was.&nbsp; It's not clear what you opened with Notepad but what you could try
 is to just press Ctrl-o in it and navigate to that assumed location in your Desktop using Notepad's Open dialog.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. start by typing \U&nbsp; match Users; type another \ and match your account name; type&nbsp;\D and match Desktop&nbsp;and finally a \W and match WindowsUpdate.log</p>

<p>Robert, thanks for your reply.&nbsp; The log files are in C:\WINDOWS\Logs\WindowsUpdate, not my desktop.&nbsp; When I ran the Get-WindowsUpdateLog command in Powershell (as an Administrator), I saw no response in the Powershell Window.&nbsp; I was prompted with a list
 of applications to open which included IE, Wordpad, Notepad and some others.&nbsp; I picked Notepad because it expects the least formatting.</p>
<p>Notepad came up with a blank text area and remained blank for some time.</p>

<p>Hello Cliff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The possible cause of this issue is due to corrupted Windows Update components. We want you to make sure that you have a stable internet connection when installing the update. Installing the update may be based on the speed of the Internet and the performance
 of your PC. In the meantime, let's try performing clean boot in Windows and check if it helps.<span> This is done to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. Also, it helps eliminate software
 conflicts of an update or when you run a program in Windows. Check this </span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">article</span></strong></a><span>
 and look for the steps on how to perform a clean boot.<span>&nbsp; </span>Remember to choose the operating system that you're using.</span></p>

<p>Apparently that is what we get until 1709 is installed.&nbsp; They have changed it so the symbol server is no longer required but is being referenced by the old script.&nbsp; I am still looking to see if there is a reasonable workaround.&nbsp; Message Analyzer might be
 a possibility but so far I only have it working (for this) in 1709 (where we don't need it.)</p>

<p>Thanks for the link.&nbsp; Is there anyway to get the tracefmt utility without downloading and installing such large toolkits?</p>
<p>This is a lot of code to simply find out what went wrong with a windows update, and as soon as this problem is resolved I will be removing the toolkit.</p>
<p>btw, I clicked "I was helped by this reply", and that is true, but I would like the thread to remain open.</p>

<h2>            lifecam studio mounted inverted in ceiling - how to rotate the image&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MS LifeCam Studio that has been mounted up side down in the ceiling at our conference room.<br />
I can not find a way to rotate the image. Everything is inverted at the moment.</p>
<p>Have no other option of mounting the camera, so I must be hanging up side down</p>
<p>I do not want to use 3rd party software such as ManyCam etc that I know can fix this problem.</p>
<p>Any new drivers that might have this option?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I recommend that you do a manual update for KB4462919 . KB4462919 is the latest update (A higher KB has lower KBs within itself)
<br />
<br />1. Right click on Windows Start &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin)
<br />Type following (or copy and paste following) one by one and Enter
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />net start cryptSvc
<br />net start bits
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />2. Type following in Windows Start Search box and hit Enter %systemroot%\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log to something else.
<br />If it doesn't allow you to rename - Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update, SFC etc)
<br />

</p><p>I wonder what "queue" they think that "you specified"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW the others are getting you to do troubleshooting on your Windows Update which is as good as guess as any, without any better clues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, in view of your other symptom, my guess would be that you have WinSxS corruption, which would mean that some DISM and SFC would be appropriate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it would help to know what exactly would be observed; e.g. it looks like the download and install phases are happening; then there would be a Restart.&nbsp; What all happens then before the rollback?</p>

<p>Okay so just about every day sense June i have been trying to do updates that my computer said i needed to</p>
<p>so i would shut down or restart my computer and it would say like preparing updates then it would install updates
</p>
<p>freeze at either 32% or 97% </p>
<p>
</p><p>It would then stop blue screen restart and say </p>
We couldn't complete the updates undoing changes
<p>then it would restart again and it would just pop up in the bottom right&nbsp; in the new notification tab
</p>
<p>&nbsp;i have been doing the trouble shooting </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now all of a sudden the volume notification in the top left is always on.</p>
<p>no when i look at the windows update setting it says thing </p>
<p>
</p><p>Your device is missing important security and quality fixes.</p>
<p>2018-10 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1803 for x64-based Systems (KB4462919)</p>
<p>Status: pending restart </p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting to the point should i just buy a new SSD and install windows and make that my boot drive

<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>That's the specific thing that I thought doing the DISM and SFC commands could help with but they could also help supplement the modifications that the WU troubleshooting would do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise for your update rollback symptom it would help to see the CBS.log (or archived portion) that would be associated with the problem messages, e.g. that time period.&nbsp; See if there is a timestamped message about it somewhere else such as in Reliability
 Monitor or ReportingEvents.log so you will know if the chunk of the CBS.log that you capture would be relevant.&nbsp; Another potentially useful diagnostic would be the Windows Error Reporting section of msinfo32.exe.&nbsp; You can capture the whole .nfo file by running&nbsp;
 msinfo32.exe&nbsp; /nfo &nbsp; In order to share these diagnostics you would have to upload them to your OneDrive Public folder.</p>

<h2>            Files could not be copied into a WD My Passport External Drive because of an I&#47;O device error 0x8007045D</h2>
                    <p>I was trying to copy files from my hard drive into a Western Digital My Passport External Drive. But, as I was observing the progress of the file copying, I noticed that only four files were copied into the external. A large majority of the files could not
 be backed up because of an I/O device error 0x8007045D. I noticed that this is the same error that I get when I shutdown my computer (in this case it says Breakpoint error or something). Dragging and dropping the files didn't work. Later even, my flash drive
 doesn't work anymore.&nbsp; I tried checking my hard disc for any errors but my device came out clear.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 7 Professional 32-bit, E5800 Pentium Dual Core, and an Asus motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get rid of this error because I need to transfer my files specifically into the external drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. I'm not very tech savvy so the simpler the instructions the better.</p>

            Hi @roryheadmav!<br />
<br />
You can try the basic troubleshooting steps in such cases - first try to connect the drive to a different USB port of the computer, and if possible with a different USB cable.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully you'll be able to transfer all the data you have, but in case it doesn't work you can also boot into safe mode and try copying the same and check if you can successfully complete the copy operation without any errors. You can follow this KB article
 that describes how to enter Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hope this helps and let me know how it went.

    <title>Windows Media Center is indicating I have a different TV Tuner Card - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Media Center is indicating I have a different TV Tuner Card than Device Manager.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I've been having problems watching TV in WMC. &nbsp;It worked fine for about 6 months, and then it started telling me No Signal was detected. &nbsp;After lots of attempting to re-setup my TV signal, I realized I was no longer being offered QAM as a signal
 option. &nbsp;Upon further digging, I have discovered that WMC thinks I have a Hauppauge WinTV 885 tuner installed, when I actually have a Hauppauge HVR-1250, which is what Device Manager shows I have installed. &nbsp;Does any one know why this might have happened,
 and more importantly, how do I fix it? &nbsp;I have already attempted uninstalling and then reinstalling the tuner card to no avail. &nbsp;Any further suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</strong></p>

<p><span>Hi Smcnerney,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Remap the QAM channels and see if there‚Äôs any go. Also ensure that you have the correct tuner drivers installed. Check with the manufacturer if there
 is any tuner driver updates. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Remap&nbsp;</span></strong><span><strong>clear QAM channels
 in Windows 7 Media Center</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Go to the Windows Media Center install tab in the link given below and scroll down to the bottom of the page.</span></p>
<p><span>You will find a download link that has instructions on remapping clear QAM TV channels in Windows Media Center.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Uninstall and reinstall driver</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go
 to&nbsp; <strong>start</strong> and type <strong>device manager.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 device manager from the control panel list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Navigate
 to the device.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 on it and select ‚ÄúUninstall‚Äù. This removes the driver currently installed.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
The power issue on a laptop would show up in other ways besides the BSOD<br />
issue you have. IF hardware is involved it is likely that the video device is not
<br />
powerful enough to support intense games. Check with the game maker's <br />
support and forums and Gateway as others will be having similar issues. Since<br />
this is no longer likely a Window or driver issue those are your best source of<br />
information.<br />

                    <p>So first I got onto my Laptop, to notice that when i was on the start tab, my documents, music, pictures, library folders weren't working. When I went to Libraries, My Documents were showing up as Documents.library-ms , and the same with the others. When
 I try hitting properties on them, it says this file's properties cannot be opened. I need this fixed like urgently. I already know the path to the real My Documents on the C Drive, but I just need this fixed. I don't to have corrupted files when I go to work.
 I've done various methods, like the restore libraries, that didn't work at all, it just replaced the same library-ms files. It has a White Page Icon as well. Please, Please Help!</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Be sure and test the memory and pay attention to the point made in the troubleshooter above<br />
that memory tests do not catch all errors. Try running with fewer sticks and change the place-<br />
ment order of the sticks to try to ensure faster (even though same specs) is installed in front<br />
of slower.</p>
<p>Did you check out the other Bug_Checks at FaultWire? 1, 1A, FE, 8E, and D1? When you get this<br />
many BSOD's its best to take a very broad based approach to try to narrow down the issues. Which<br />
means update ALL your major drivers, BIOS, and low level chipset drivers. Remove your present<br />
antivirus/security programs and run their maker's Removal Tools. Do the same for others that<br />
have ever been in the machine, not used or uninstalled. See below for recommendations to use<br />
while testing, however permanently would be even better.</p>

If a PC remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory and cables (on both ends when possible)<br />
- actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Clean out the dust bunnies and make sure the<br />
fans are running (when the case is on). Try using a small fan blowing into the intake to reduce<br />
any effects of heat. On a laptop about all you can do is reseat the memory, clean the vents, and<br />
try using a small fan.<br />

<br />
Here is what I use and recommend : (These are all Free versions&nbsp;and very effective.)</p>
<p>Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web, and<br />
Network running.</p>
<p>Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free</p>
<p>Windows Firewall</p>
<p>Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)</p>
<p>IE - Protected Mode</p>
<p>IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)</p>
<p>I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Two versions of Avast are available 5.x and 4.8x<br />
<br />
Avast 5.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />
click the Orange Icon - Upper Right - Settings - click Status Bar - uncheck the Shields you<br />
disabled - click OK <br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</span></a><br />
<br />
Avast 4.8x&nbsp;- Home - Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web,<br />
and Network running. (Double Click&nbsp;Blue icon - details next to OK. - upper left Shields -<br />
Terminate&nbsp;those you do not use.)<br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4</span></a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here<br />
or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.prevx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.prevx.com/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- information<br />
<a href="http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp</span></a>&nbsp; &lt;-- download<br />
<br />
PCmag - Prevx - Editor'a Choice<br />
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp</span></a></p>
<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<h2>            Hey Cortana, What time is it&#63;  NOT WORKING ANYMORE</h2>
                    Since Cortana came out in the previews, I use the Hey Cortana, What time is it function in my TV Room to have Cortana tell me the time, versus walking over to the screen and squinting. &nbsp;This morning I ask it What time is it? and it shows the words as I
 say them, but instead opens a Bing Search page&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=What%20time%20is%20it%3F&amp;input=2&amp;FORM=WNSBOX&amp;cc=US&amp;setlang=en-US&amp;sbts=1441295934250" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="What time is it?">Listed here</a>. &nbsp;My what temperature
 is it still tells me the current temp but not the time. &nbsp;HELP

    <title>Amazon Device randomly showing up on Network. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Amazon Device randomly showing up on Network.</h2>
                    I just read many pages of questions about this phenomenon and found it&nbsp; curious that no comments were from anyone at Microsoft.&nbsp; Does that mean&nbsp; this is one of those mysterious back doors we here so much about in the news?&nbsp; I am not sure what to make of
 it.&nbsp; If it is an unwelcome intruder, why doesn't Defender stop it?&nbsp; It appears as a computer on my network just like my other PCs.&nbsp; &nbsp;In Austin?&nbsp; What am I to make of this if I am trying to operate a secure network?&nbsp; Help please.

            I see several devices under wifi which are not mine, this does not mean they‚Äôre connected but that they are broadcasting their wifi/Bluetooth connection, if you tried to add them they‚Äôd ask for the passphrase/password which you do not have. It is nothing to worry about unless they have access to your PC where they‚Äôd show up under your devices.

            The Amazon device is probably broadcasting it‚Äôs SSID or Bluetooth so will appear so its owner can connect to it but this allows it to be seen by anyone.

            Does your ISP support free wifi to other subscribers? Here Virginmedia allow other VM subscribers to log onto other user‚Äôs router wifi connection as part of their Broadband package.

            If you will not need anything that is stored there then yes you can remove it using the disk cleanup system files option. Windows removes it anyway after a few days.&nbsp; Hope this helps and if you need any further assistance post and we will be glad to help
 you.

            I've found that the best way to do this is use Disk Clean-up. In Explorer right click the volume (C:) that was updated. Select Disk Clean-up and from the list select Update backup files or something. Disk Clean-up does a great job without affecting your
 precious files.

            <p>And how do you delete it when disk clean up doesn't "see" that directory? I have ran that pos several times and not once has it shown that there is a "old" windows install to be removed. I would
<strong>REALLY</strong> like it <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>GONE</strong></em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried "manually" deleting it by following a (incorrect) guideline from a couple of tech sights..(Using something called takedown (that windows doesn't recognize)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do get rid of that useless folder in 8.1?? <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

<h2>            Kinect 2 availability</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p><p><br /></p><p>I am working on a R&amp;D project involving the Kinect V2 (for Xbox One but with the adapter), and I&nbsp;was told by an employee from BestBuy Canada that the Kinect v2 (even the version for Xbox) was discontinued.</p><p><br /></p><p>Is it true? I see I can still buy it from the Microsoft Store, but is it still produced ? And if so, do you know since when there will be support/production for the Kinect v2.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks for your answer,</p>

<p>What I meant in the parenthesis is that the version of Kinect v2 for Windows IS discontinued, but what he told me is that the Kinect v2 for Xbox One was also discontinued. I am not interested in the Kinect version 1. My question was about the Kinect v2 for Xbox One availability.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But apparently it is still available, at least for now. Only the kinect v1 is not available on microsoft website. I had to do some research just to be sure.</p>
