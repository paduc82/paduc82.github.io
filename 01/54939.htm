<h2>            copy and paste drivers&#63;</h2>
                    I just installed a Kingston 120SSD drive.&nbsp; It is now the C: drive.&nbsp; If I boot from the SSD drive none of my drivers show up ie. video card, printer, router, modem, network.&nbsp; None of them.&nbsp; Is there an easy way to copy all the drivers from the old C: drive
 (1 TB internal drive) to the new C: drive (SSD).&nbsp; Or am I going to have to go into the old C: drive and copy them onto a flash drive?&nbsp; Thank you very very much for any help.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
First of all, it's likely the drivers aren't showing up on your SSD because they are on the OTHER hard disk and are installed to that OS. In regards to copying and pasting over drivers? No, do not attempt to do that. Serious possible OS corruption can and will
 occur. <br />
<br />
The reason it's not as easy as copying and pasting is because MANY drivers write to the registry, etc, and it's not just the folder they're installed to in regards to mattering. This is what I would recommend:<br />
<br />
<b>1.</b> Do a fresh / clean install of Windows 7 on the SSD - <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1649-clean-install-windows-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1649-clean-install-windows-7-a.html</a><br />
<br />
** Most SSD's are run in a configuration in which the SSD is the OS drive and the other larger non-SSD drive is kept as storage for games, movies, pictures, etc. The SSD simply houses the OS and its necessary files (and some programs like browser, etc) so your
 can use your computer OS-wise as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
<b>2.</b> After Windows is installed, visit the manufacturers website for all of the latest drivers and install them.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Patrick<br />

    <title>My USB Hard Drive icon wont display on my computer after I scanned it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryan astilla  say:</h3>
<h2>            My USB Hard Drive icon wont display on my computer after I scanned it with an antivirus software.</h2>
                    
<p>This problem starts when I scanned my usb HDD with superantispyware. The program found a lot of infected files and malwares, one of them has a ???VOLUME??? on its name. Without hesitation I clicked the button to removed all the infected files and malwares.
 I unplugged the HDD and after a while I plugged it back. And then it happened. There's light in my HDD and I can feel that it is running and there's a beep sound confirming that it is successfully plugged in but there's no USB HDD icon appeared in My Computer.</p>
<p>I tried to plugged it into another computer but the same thing happened.</p>
<p>What should I do?&nbsp; Is there a chance to recover all my data stored in there?</p>
<p>I'm using Windows XP SP3 and here is the USB HDD specs:</p>
<p>Imation Apollo 25 PHDD-250GB.</p>
<p>I really appreciate your help.</p>

<h2>            I am unable to connect to the internet using my Windows 7 computer via Wi-Fi but it works fine when I am hard wired to the router.</h2>
                    <div>original title:&nbsp;No internet access</div>
Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am currently running windows 7 64bit. At home I use my laptop with an SMC wireless modem, that has a built in router. Have noticed that I can not connect to the internet unless I am hardwired to modem. Wifi shows that it is connected but there is the
 yellow ! saying no internet access. I have since brought my laptop to work as we have several different modems to try with. The only one that will connect properly is a hardline into a docsis 2 moto surfboard. All docsis 3 modems and wifi modems do not connect,
 even hardlined. all say they are connected but with no internet access. Tried uninstalling both nic's, updating the drivers, winsock fix, dns fix, system restore, disabling the firewall, disabling ipv6 and nothing has worked. When I try to access a website
 it says that there is a DNS issue, but can not ping ip's or url's. Obtaining a valid ip address regardless of which modem I am connected to and 127.0.0.1 is pingable. Also it does not work in safe mode.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-Home set-up is dell laptop wifi to smc modem. hardline fine, wifi does not work. 2nd laptop in home connects fine via wifi and hardline</div>
<div>-work set-up is currently hardline to modem, usually use wifi to smc. all other pc's and iphone connect fine to wifi</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be greatly appreciated </div>

    <title>Media Center installation changes product key for windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mlg63  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media Center installation changes product key for windows 8</h2>
                    Can someone explain why installing media center changes the win 8 product key? On the System page, checking Activation shows the key with the last characters for the Media Center download, not the key that is on the invoice for downloading windows 8. What
 key do we need if we reinstall on a&nbsp;replacement hard drive? I have the dvd that I made when I installed win 8. Or would it be necessary to use a System Backup Image to replace a failed hard drive?

            <p>Hello mlg63, <br />
</p>
<p>Not sure why that is occurring. My product key on the system page didn't change to the Windows Media Center pack key. It is still the Windows 8 product key.
<br />
<br />
If you are going to reinstall, you would need the Windows 8 Product Key that came with your email if you purchased it when using the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant. Please be sure you put the Windows 8 product key and the Windows 8 Media Center product key in
 a safe place so you can refer back to it if needed. I would print it off and store it where no one else has access.
<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have any further questions. </p>

            <p>Thanks. I am not reinstalling now, just thinking about the future. This occurred after a Remove everything and reinstall windows recovery that was done after installing Media Center. I had problems with the first upgrade installation (too complicated to
 explain) but the Recovery worked great. Completely wiped the disk and installed a fresh copy of windows 8. That's when I noticed I had&nbsp;a different key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just checked my laptop and the exact same thing happened. The activated product key is now the media center key. So it must be normal with the new activation policies.

<div><br />
<div>Both computers still have windows activated since I did use a diff email for each media center download. The windows key changed to the media center key on both. It's very hard to find any official MS explanation of windows 8 activation policies. I still
 wonder how reinstallation will work if the hard drive needs to be replaced. System Image or install windows 7 and then use the upgrade disk? What product key? Many users never received a windows 7 disk. MS should address this issue.</div>

            Can you confirm that the Media Center Product key will correctly re-activate Media Center if a fresh (re)install is doen after 31st January. I haven't found an concise answer about this.

            <p>The keys were issued with an expiry date of 31st January 2013. I wanted to know what would happen if I needed to reinstall Windows 8 and wanted to add Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've since actually had to do this and I needed to completely reinstall Windows 8 and added the Media Center key. The result was that, on reboot, Windows declared that the product key was invalid and asked a new one. The original Windows 8 key was not accepted
 - presumably it would only accept a valid Windows 8 + Media Center key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The end result was that I had to do the Windows 8 install again and gave up using Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result, I now actually use Debian Linux + MythTV for my media center PCs (I have 3 in different rooms).</p>

            I had the same problem back in April last year when i did a clean install of Windows 8, when i added features and restarted the computer, it wouldn't accept the product key, i rang Microsoft support but i just couldn't get anywhere as, i honestly could
 not understand the accents and they couldn't understand what my problem was. In the end i was forced to use MPC-HC to play DVD's on the computer, but i think this is some incompetence on Microsoft's part as they should have considered the possibility that
 people will have to re-install their OS's.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>All three of my Win 8 Pro machines changed the product key after installing\activating Media Center...</p>
<p>The key now listed is the Media Center key...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you right click on COMPUTER\ThisPC, and select Properties, it should now say Windows 8 Pro With Media Center at the top of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I upgraded the machines from Win 8 to 8.1, I had to again reactivate Media Center...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Media Center is not part of Windows 8 Pro to start with, a reinstall of Win 8 requires that you use the Win 8 key, and then when complete, activate Media Center with it's key...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the January 2013 date... that is the expiration date of the FREE Media Center activation key...</p>
<p>Meaning it's first use.&nbsp; After it is used\registered the first time, it doesn't expire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least this has been my personal experience...</p>

    <title>Xbox One Blu-ray App Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aaron36cf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Blu-ray App Problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have an issue regarding the Blu-ray playback functionality on the Xbox One.</p>
<p>I've downloaded and installed the Blu-ray app but whenever I insert a Blu-ray disc and attempt to play it, I'm greeted with a black screen. I can bring up the playback options to pause and fast forward, but it does nothing. I am DEFINITELY using a compatible
 Blu-ray disc and in terms of regions. I've also been playing Battlefield 4 and Dead Rising 3 using discs so I'm fairly sure it's not a disc drive fault. Could somebody please help?<br />
<br />
Thank you!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorted it.</p>
<p>I run my 360, PS3 and my Xbox One through an Elgato Game Capture HD. It turns out that HDCP is enforced when watching movies and using Netflix so that's what was causing it. I'm an idiot.</p>
<p>I'll just carry on using my PS3 as a Blu-ray player. ^_^</p>

<p>My first xbox one would play games. &nbsp; It would not work with any blu ray movies or dvd's. &nbsp; Error message 0x97d001? &nbsp;The &nbsp;error message would just flash on the screen with only way to stop it would be to turn the console off.</p>
<p>My current console now plays games, commerical blu ray movies and dvds. &nbsp;It will NOT play bdmv blu ray movies that I created on BD-R or BD-RE disc. &nbsp;It is something Microsoft choose to do. &nbsp;(the disc play on Sony's Playstation PS3 and PS4). &nbsp; I wish Microsoft
 would "allow" the bd-r and bd-re disc to work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

Sony (those who built it and support it - including providing any software/drivers you would need to utilize it in any operating system they choose to support it under) has told you to come here and ask, I assume?

<p><br />
Yes.&nbsp; Hardware drivers and software do not come from Microsoft unless it happens to be Microsoft hardware.&nbsp; You asked your question in a Microsoft forum so I assumed that you probably had asked Sony already about their support for their product in Windows 7?&nbsp;
 If my assumption is incorrect - that should be your next stop.</p>
<p>If you want me to help you out further (do your work for you) - sure... I got a spare 5 minutes...</p>
<p>Also - did you search anywhere for more information?&nbsp; For example, I just performed this search:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Windows+7+Compatibility+Center+Sony+Webbie+MHS-PM1+HD+Camcorder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=Windows+7+Compatibility+Center+Sony+Webbie+MHS-PM1+HD+Camcorder</a></p>
<p>It led me to:<br />

<p>Where I see the device <a href="http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/model-home.pl?mdl=MHSCM1D&amp;template_id=1&amp;region_id=1&amp;tab=download#/downloadTab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
requires you download something</a>&nbsp;in order to be compatible with your Windows 7 64-bit system.&nbsp; (That's a link - same as on the web page.)&nbsp; Not surprisingly that link takes you to Sony's web page - where you can select your operating system and download various
 things...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-download.pl?mdl=MHSCM1D&amp;upd_id=7229&amp;os_group_id=6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Picture Motion Browser Software Download Tool</a></li><li><a href="http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-download.pl?mdl=MHSCM1D&amp;upd_id=7542&amp;os_group_id=6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PlayMemories Home™ version 1.3 Update Program</a></li></ul>
<p><br />
There is even a link there that leads you to Windows 7 Compatibility information *from Sony* (those who make and support your Sony camcorder) and they state, on this page:</p>
<p><a href="http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/support-info.pl?info_id=550" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/support-info.pl?info_id=550</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li><b>Drivers:</b>
<ul>
<li>The drivers needed to connect your Sony camcorder to a computer and transfer files are already included in the operating system.</li><li>Install the driver from the supplied CD-ROM to enable the USB streaming (Web Camera) feature with the Windows 7 32-bit operating system.</li></ul>
</li><li><b>Not Supported:</b>
<ul>
<li>The USB streaming feature is not supported with the Windows 7 64-bit operating systems.</li><li>The Windows 7 Starter edition is not supported.</li></ul>
<p><br />
Now - since you asked about the "web cam mode" - which is streaming - its obvious that some time ago (XPish) they made a decision not to support this camera for that in 64-bit operating systems.&nbsp; So you have a choice... You can wipe your system and install
 a 32-bit version of Windows 7 so you can utilize this camera in that mode OR you can get a different camera for such things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essentially it is the 64-bit&nbsp;operating system&nbsp;and the lack of support for that camera under a 64-bit OS (XP, Vista or Windows 7) from Sony that is hurting you.</p>

            Please stop this.<br />
<br />
I did not ask a question; I made a statement.<br />
<br />
Windows brought me here and it seemed to me that it was hoping for a comment so I made one in the hope it might be useful to others.<br />
<br />
First you reply with a totally useless question/comment and when I just answer your question<br />
"Sony ... has told you to come here and ask, I assume?" -&gt; "Windows 7 sent me here after it couldn't find drivers for it."<br />
you go ahead and demonstrate what I stated in the beginning.<br />
<br />
This might have been helpful if I hadn't done the same (searches) before I made the statement.<br />
<br />
So no points for you :-)<br />

            <blockquote>Please stop this.<br />
<br />
I did not ask a question; I made a statement.<br />
<br />
Windows brought me here and it seemed to me that it was hoping for a comment so I made one in the hope it might be useful to others.<br />
<br />
First you reply with a totally useless question/comment and when I just answer your question<br />
"Sony ... has told you to come here and ask, I assume?" -&gt; "Windows 7 sent me here after it couldn't find drivers for it."<br />
you go ahead and demonstrate what I stated in the beginning.<br />
<br />
This might have been helpful if I hadn't done the same (searches) before I made the statement.<br />
<br />
So no points for you :-) </blockquote>
<p><br />
Points.. yay.&nbsp; I did this before someone decided points were the way to determine someone was being helpful - before there was a web forum, when there was a newsgroup and the point system did not exist and outright removal of some material was rarely done.</p>
<p>The original question&nbsp;was not useless, it was to get you to think about where you should&nbsp;actually be going for assistance for your trouble with your Sony product.&nbsp; Truthfully it is a 'statement' as well - just posed in the form of a question.&nbsp; It essentially
 points out the common sense of going to the product manufacturer fort support.&nbsp; Microsoft may have made Windows - but that is not the product you are attempting to get to work - that product works - it is the accessory you are having trouble with.&nbsp; If you
 buy a new accessory for your vehicle and it doesn't seem to fit right - you probably don't call the vehicle manufacturer to find out why - you likely call the accessory manufacturer to find out what you can do.</p>
<p>You also asked me a question - recall, "Anyway, are you trying to be helpful, or what?" and that was what my other response was.&nbsp; You were not the first to come here to ask a question such as this and if Windows actually *did* lead you here - then perhaps
 (doubtful, but perhaps) someone will read this or the hundreds of other, "product support comes from the product manufacturer" responses in these forums and realize that is their next stop - the actual product manufacturer.&nbsp; ;-)</p>

            Well, the info was EXCEEDINGLY helpful to me.
<div>I've been trying to solve the problem of how to use my Webbie as a webcam on my Windows 7 64-bit system for a couple of days to no resolution, and finally resorted to purchasing a Logitech webcam as the answer to the roadblock.</div>
<div>BUT, I still wanted to know why the Webbie wouldn't work and if there was a fix.</div>
<div>Your effort is appreciated and exactly the answer needed to solve my investigation.</div>
<div>(It didn't help the situation with the Webbie, but explained the snafu nicely.)</div>
<div>Much obliged!</div>

<h3> arielarmstrong  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Surface 3 Type Cover Keyboard issue</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have owned a Microsoft Surface 3 with a type cover keyboard for the last few years and I have been happy with the product. Quite recently I have been having issues with the keyboard with the following issues:</p>
<p>1. The numbers 1234567 does not seem to be registering when I press them</p>
<p>2. The CTRL button does not seem to be registering either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am quietly confident that its not a mechanical failure from the type cover keyboard. I have conducted all the necessary steps to troubleshoot the problem in accordance with:</p>
<p>1. removing the keyboard and placing it back on</p>
<p>2. restarting the Surface 3</p>
<p>3. doing the 2 button reset</p>
<p>4. I have gone through the latest windows update process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keyboard would work, then all of a sudden problems 1 and 2 would happen again. Can you please advise on the latest firmware fix and provide a link where I can download it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>
                </div>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>in order to purchase anything again you will have to sort that payment due (expired payment) first.</p>

<h2>            Child email to ask for more screen time does not work</h2>
                    <p>Hi -- The latest Windows 10 update restores the ability for children to ask for more screen time.&nbsp; However, I received an email with such a request to allow increments of 15mins, 1hr, etc. of screen time but clicking the links just takes me to the Account
 Family screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At that screen, I can manually set limits, but no confirmation of the actions of allowing more time immediately.&nbsp; Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p><span>Hello MichaelGerbasio,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forum.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Typically, the device's hardware key contains a
<strong>FailReasonString</strong> value, and the value string is displays an error message defined by the hardware manufacturer. If the hardware key does not contain a
<strong>FailReasonString</strong> value the message above is displayed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to try with
<strong>roll back driver </strong>option initially. To roll back the driver, you may follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Press <strong>Windows + R</strong> on the desktop screen.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Expand the category you want and right click on the driver and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Navigate to <strong>Driver tab</strong> and click on <strong>Rollback driver</strong>.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above option doesn’t work, you can try updating the drivers by selecting
<strong>Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer</strong> option and then you may choose the drivers from the given list.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
To resolve the network adapter issue, you may follow the below steps to check if it works.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1</strong>: Power Cycle your PC.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Completely discharging your PC might fix the unresponsive state of the network adapter. This might shake off any power surges that were registered in the adapter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Unplug your charger, power off your laptop, and remove your battery. If you are using a desktop PC, remove all the power cables.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Hold down the power button for at least 30 seconds and then wait around 10 minutes.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Put the battery back in, with the charger and reboot or plug back your power cables and boot your PC</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Check if this fixed it. </p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2</strong>: Restore your system to a point when the network adapter(s) worked.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Press Windows key + R to open Run</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Type ‘rstrui.exe’ (no quotes) and press enter to open the system restore program.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click next. In the next window, choose the restore point that bares a date before the problem occurred.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click next. In the last window, click Finish to confirm that you want to restore your system to an earlier point.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: Any changes made to the system including installed programs and configurations will be removed. Your personal files, downloads and documents will not be affected.
 Your system might restart a few times during this procedure.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Additional Information</strong>: Also for update issue, kindly check with the article on

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Registry Disclaimer</strong>: The registry is a database in Windows that contains important information about system hardware, installed programs and settings, and profiles
 of each of the user accounts on the computer. Windows often reads and updates the information in the registry.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Normally, software programs make registry changes automatically. You should not make unnecessary changes to the registry. Changing registry files incorrectly can cause Windows to stop working or make
 Windows report the wrong information.</span></p>

                    <p>Hello, after the most recent windows update, I can no longer use my Xbox&nbsp;one controllers&nbsp;on my pc or laptop. I have tried uninstalling then&nbsp;reinstalling the drivers and updating and they haven't helped. The error message I have gotten back is</p>
<p>Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)<br />
A request for the USB device descriptor failed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested the USB&nbsp;ports with other devices and the cable I was using and they all seem to be working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything&nbsp;I can do to get my controller&nbsp;to work again any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Marcus,<br />
<br />
Driver conflict and hardware failure are some of the reasons why you are getting "A request for the USB device descriptor failed" error when connecting your Xbox One controller to your PC. To fix the issue, uninstall the existing chipset driver on your laptop
 and desktop, restart your PC, then install the latest version from the manufacturer's website. Also, connect your controller to another USB port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Keep us posted.</p>

<p>Hello, thank&nbsp;you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming that is one of the drivers listed in the device manager but I'm unsure what category&nbsp;it would be under&nbsp;or name it might have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you tell me what I'm looking for to find this driver?</p>

<p>It would be the Universal Serial Bus controller drivers, however, some manufacturers include these drivers in Chipset Driver package. Please visit the device manufacturer's website and look for the USB driver or Chipset driver specific for your device.</p>

<p>I have tried uninstalling all my USB&nbsp;drivers from the device managers and tried all the resolutions I can find on "https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2654149/error-usb-device-not-recognized-when-you-try-to-access-a-usb-external".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the USB port and cable work with other devices and the controllers&nbsp;I have tried to use will work with there consoles. Please, can you help I'm completely unsure of what else I can try?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Hotspot issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot get the "netsh wlan start hostednetwork" command to work. If I toggle the hotspot manually from the Win10 settings, it works perfectly.</p>
<p>Is there a way to automatically start the hotspot at boot (with or without using netsh)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to rollback the driver, but both versions that were installed don't support the hostednetwork.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

</p><p>I tried it and it doesn't work. It gives the same error as the netsh command (presumably because that's what it does).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you suggest a different application that does not make use of this method?</p>

</p><p>I already tried it in the past. I tried it again now, to the same results (I'm translating the message, forgive the inaccuracy):</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first command says the network has been allowed.</p>
<p>The second command says it can't start the network because the group/resource is not in the appropriate state.</p>

            Ok, thanks,
<br />
<br />Are you sure you run the command prompt with elevated privileges (type cmd in Cortana, then right click on command prompt and choose Run as administrator)?
<br />
<br />If this doesn't work, go to Device Manager (Windows-key  + x + m on windows 8, Windows-key  + x  then m on windows 10), then open the network adapters tree , right click button on Microsoft Hosted Network Virtual Adapter and click on enable, then run again the command.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if any of the above works.
<br />
<br />Thanks
<br />Ugo

<p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/36fa8e16-9957-4a66-b20c-0a668bee81cd" title="CassW1"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">CassW1</span></a> and welcome to the Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please confirm the Skype and OS version of your device so we can look into the issue. If you are using Skype for Windows 10, please make sure that:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>You are signed in to one device only. Users who are signed in to multiple devices at once could experience issues with delay of notifications as the calls might be misrouted.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Your notification settings in the application are enabled. Click your <strong>
profile picture </strong>then select <strong>Settings</strong>. Scroll down and locate
<strong>Notification </strong>and toggle the button for each type. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Check your Windows 10 settings and make sure notification from Skype is enabled. Click the
<strong>Start </strong>menu and then choose <strong>Settings</strong>. Click <strong>
System </strong>and select <strong>Notifications and actions</strong>. Scroll down to Get&nbsp;<strong>notifications from these senders</strong> and make sure to toggle Skype for Windows 10 On.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Use the latest version of Skype available for your device.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, please let us know so we can check it further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

<p>Danida_U, What is the process when there is no toggle available and Skype for Windows 10 is not shown?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 6 items under 'Get notifications from these senders' which are:</p>
<p>Audio, Microsoft Store, Security and Maintenance, Settings, Settings, Suggested</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype does not ring for incoming calls, so the only notification received is Missed Call when someone's call fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried going back to the desktop version of Skype on Windows 10, but the exe will not install and directs me back to the non-working app.&nbsp; I uninstalled and reinstalled the app to try and get a notification option, but that did not help.</p>
