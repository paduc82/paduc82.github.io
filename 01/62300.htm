    <title>Parents Beware&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Parents Beware&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Now I know from personal experience there are ALOT of scammers on Xbox Live, so watch out.&nbsp; Your kid may get a message from someone who promises points in exchange for access to your kid's account/password/friends list, or other personal information. The
 scammers are many, and XBox is lax in their enforcement of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are ways you can get around it (make only friends be able to message your kid), but if you had no idea about those settings, and your kid gets banned, or your credit card gets unauthorized
 charges, be aware that MICROSOFT DOES NOT HAVE YOUR BACK!!!!&nbsp; They will not help you in any way, shape or form, except to sympathize with you when they tell you that you're screwed.&nbsp; Thanks...thanks alot.</p>
<p>You are completely and utterly on your own, and hopefully you have a good rapport with Visa, M/C or whomever your credit card company is.&nbsp; Also be aware that Microsoft has miraculously circumvented the law, by Microsoft applying a legal document (The TOS)
 to a child.&nbsp; Huh.&nbsp; Must be some new law that makes a child legally be able to enter into a contract.</p>
<p>As an added note, I will be adding 2 Xbox 360's/ 106 games/ 6 controllers, with 2 headsets to ebay.&nbsp; I will even throw in my original xbox with 30 games/ 4 controllers/ steering wheel as an added bonus for purchasing the whole kit and kaboodle.&nbsp; I'm so done
 with this company, it's not funny.</p>
<p>Microsoft has lost this family, I guess that's Sony's gain.&nbsp; I work in a major retail outlet, and I'll never recomment another Microsoft product as long as I live.</p>

<p>This sort of thing happens with every sort of service. You'll have to monitor your children and make sure they do not get fooled, as anything that seems too good to be true, like 10000 MS points for example, is never true if they are "giving it away." Also,
 I suggest you reading this:</p>

<p>Microsoft shouldn't be the blame of the scammers, the scammers themselves are the real problem, you shouldn't be mad at Microsoft because of it. Just watch your kids on what they do. Hope it all works out! :)</p>

<p>&gt; Microsoft has miraculously circumvented the law, by Microsoft applying a legal document (The TOS) to a child</p>
<p>Microsoft requires an adult to consent the the (frequent) Terms of Use updates, each of which specifies if you allow a minor to use a credit card, you have consented to its reuse. You've seen the Terms of Use, it was recommended to earlier.

<p>you shouldn't be mad at MS period for that</p>
<p>first and foremost</p>
<p>you are not allowed to trade or ask for services or free ms points</p>
<p>common sense no?</p>
<p>so if it is against the rules for you or your child to &nbsp;be asking for money or free money or a service why would if you break the rules would they help you for breaking the rules?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there is no such thing as free money or cheating isn't right?</p>
<p>you do relieze that is like asking a cop to pay you back the money that you lost after purchasing a stolen car</p>
<p>no matter what if you don't teach your child that there is no free money your son or daughter will probably buy another prepaid sony or whatever service you go with and still fall for scams</p>
<p>and noone will give you money back for that n a unsupported service like trading and in most times its either free money or cheats for 20bucks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there is no way for anyone to take money from your xbox live account unless your child gave away his /her personal details which you should really be concerned about</p>
<p>personal info shouldn't be given by a child fyi</p>

<p>Please do not give MS a bad name, this technique is common with nearly every game and has been around for a while, and it is up to the parents and the common sense of the children to realize that it is a scam and should not be trusted.</p>

<p>So you tell your kids not to accept candy from a stranger, not to get in to a stranger's car, yet every year, there are many kids who still do. &nbsp;So we blame the kid, not the perp?
</p>
<p>Kids are gullible, and at least now I know which side Microsoft is on. </p>
<p>It's fine if nobody agrees with me, but this is what the Microsoft tech guy told me to do on my call to him - complain on the forums- so that's what I'm doing, as it is my only recourse, since they would not refund the money that was stolen from my card.

<p>you dont blame the service that doesn't allow you to do what your child did</p>
<p>trading and solicitation for money or cheats is not allowed or giving out personal info</p>
<p>if your child used the services in a way it is not intended shouldn't that be your responcibility as the parent?</p>
<p>what will happen if your child gives away your personal address</p>
<p>do you really want to wait till that happens?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>noone but you can teach your child not to do that</p>
<p>fyi call support for an unauthorized access case for refund of unauthorized purchases unless your child gave away a ms points card&nbsp; in which case thats upto you</p>

<p>Alright Mama, this has gone on long enough. If your child DID manage to get an account without having your e-mail address tied to their own, that is because they FRAUDULENTLY created an e-mail address stating they were over 18. Since you have to be 18 or
 older to play online without parental permission, a parental account is required for anyone whose e-mail address (which in common society should be monitored by parents due to all the monsters out there) states they are not 18 yet. As such, your legal obligation
 to Microsoft is null and void, as is theirs to you. </p>
<p>Additionally, if you had fulfilled your responsibility, you would have read the terms of use personally to ensure you knew the rules of the game, since you allowed your kid to use said service. It is a family oriented service, but Microsoft cannot be held
 accountable for your lack of first-step reading. The lesson to be learned here is that you should pay more attention to what you allow your child to do, because the company your child has an agreement with can't always make sure they are dealing with an adult.</p>
<p>Before you post a rebuttal, let's review the situation.</p>
<p>1.) Your child has an account. This means you gave your child permission to use the service, and accepted all responsibility for any activity that occurred on said account. It is not MS's job to force you to read the terms of use, but they do regularly prompt
 you to read them so you can be up to speed.</p>
<p>2.) Your child has a credit card on their account. Since the credit card is present, you acknowledged that the child was legally responsible for all transactions that occurred with said card. Also, applying a credit card to an account indicates to Microsoft
 that the account in question is owned by an adult, since a child should not have access to a credit card.</p>
<p>3.)There is no parental address tied to the child's account, or this situation would not have happened. Reasoning? That's one more e-mail address and password that a potential scammer has to acquire, and your child would not know the details to it. As a
 parent, you should be more aware of what your child is doing, considering the sheer number of people they come into contact with every time they connect to Xbox Live.</p>
<p>4.) Rather than attempt to create an unauthorized access case with Microsoft, which would have granted you the refund you seek, as well as cause the person who scammed the account from your son to be banned from the service, you chose to rant and defame
 Microsoft (and the Xbox Program) in their own forums, which indicates to me that there may be more to this story than you are letting in on, since the solution is obvious.</p>
<p>Rant/rebuttal/counter completed. Flame on!</p>

<p>I was playing some Earth Defense Force: IA and I disconnected from Xbox Live, I went to check my router and modem, all fine. I went to my Network Settings and checked Wifi and it said I needed a Network Adapter, which confused me as my 360 has wifi built
 in. I tried to restore to factory settings and nothing. </p>

<p>Random, as shadowman stated above, if you wish to have internal wireless fixed you will need to send your xbox in for repair. Visit
<a href="http://support.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com</a> to do so.
</p>
<p>There is a work around by buying the wireless adopter for the xbox and using this...however I would rather have a fully working 360 if it was me!</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem. Obviously Microsoft won't be getting much business in the next console generation if this is how they're going to operate. Its really quite annoying how quickly their stuff fails.

            There are no official Windows 7 drivers for the Presario C700. Unless the Vista driver for the webcam works, you will either have to use a 3rd party webcam if you need the facility in Windows 7 or revert back to the previous operating system in order to
 use the integrated webcam..

<h2>            MPEG files-how to make them display opening picture instead of MPEG icon</h2>
                    When looking at a group of mpeg files, some of my videos show the opening picture (very helpful) and some of them just show a standard MPEG file icon (not near as helpful).&nbsp; How can I make it so that they all show the opening frame?&nbsp; I have no idea why
 some are and some aren't.&nbsp; I compared their attributes and didn't see anything different about the files.&nbsp; I'm using Vista - the files types show up as .mpg.<br />

            <p>The jumping curse and is often caused by a microphone that is either too sensitive, picking up background noise, or the microphone element at the end of the bone of a headset is positioned incorrectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First thing you should do is run the microphone setup from control panel, speech recognition. If you are using a microphone built into the computer or a web cam these often will pick up background noise and the environment. For best&nbsp;accuracy a USB headset
 will work to optimally for WSR, Windows Speech Recognition. If you are using a USB headset microphone, make sure the microphone element at the end of the boom is at the corner of your mouth not in front. This is because if it is in front of the mouth it&nbsp;will
 pick up inhales and exhales as&nbsp;sounds to be interpreted as words or commands. Finally, if you're using a USB or a microphone that connects to the sound card, try a different input port.</p>

<h2>            Properties shows different sizes of folders and different numbers of folders and files in copy and original</h2>
                    I used drag and drop to copy files from my computer's hard drive to two WD 1 Ter&nbsp;My Book&nbsp;external hard drives and on 1/2 ter external Passport. I tried to use properties to check if all files were copied correctly; however, the number of folders and sizes
 of the folders in the copied batch varied. The two 1 Ter hard drives had the same properties but this did not match the properties of the original or the copy on Passport. Properties showed inconsistencies in the first six files of the batch (of 15) between
 the original and the Passport although comparing the number and names&nbsp;of the files in each pair of folders showed no inconsistency.&nbsp;Since the copies are&nbsp;back-ups, I need to know how to confirm the copies are accurate, and if they are, I'd like to know why
 Properties doesn't show this.

<p>It's not clear if the discrepancies you see are only in the file <strong>sizes</strong> reported or something else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you say that there are "different numbers of folders and files" do you mean that some files and/or folders did not get copied, that some extraneous files and/or folders appeared in the copy destination,&nbsp; or something else?</p>
<p>If you're copying using drag-n-drop, you may get extra copies. This is caused by a shaky hand and/or a too-sensitive mouse.</p>
<p>If you are seeing different file sizes for the same file(s), make sure that you're looking at the actual file size and not the "size on disk."&nbsp; These two numbers are almost always different because Windows allocates disk space using "file allocation units"
 or clusters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Windows XP, the default file allocation size for partitions larger than 2 GB (which should include almost every hard drive today) is 4KB, but this size can be set to a smaller value when the partition is formatted.&nbsp; If a drive originally was formatted
 using the FAT file system and then CONVERTed into NTFS, Windows may have set the file allocation size of the converted partition to only 512 bytes.&nbsp; For more info, see<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314878" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB314878</a> and
<a href="http://aumha.org/win5/a/ntfscvt.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Converting FAT32 to NTFS in Windows XP</a> .&nbsp; If the cluster size on the source drive is different from the cluster size on the destination size, the "size on disk" for the same data could well be different.</p>

            <p>The discrepancy in file count and therefore total folder size are most probably related to Windows Explorer limitation to handle large paths (long file names + long folder and subfolder names).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only reliable choice is robocopy or some third party tool that overcomes that limitation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a diagnostic measure, you can use the subst command for both source and target paths. Then run DIR /S on both subst'ed paths and see if file and folder count, and size, match. Still totals may be LESS than those reported by a more powerfull tool which
 can better handle large paths.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

            Hello Imran &nbsp; :-)
<div><br />
<div>I've no doubt that JohnnyJack will have made <i>lots</i> of changes to his computer over the years!</div>
<div><br />
<div>He posted satisfactorily to the Annexcafe.general.User2User newsgroup using Microsoft Windows Mail 6.0.6002.18197 so the use of Windows Mail itself is not a problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What I'd like to know is <b>why</b> the warning is issued, viz:</div>
<div><br />
<div>"The server you are connected to is using a security certificate that could not be verified. A certificate chain processed, but terminated in a root certificate which is not trusted by the trust provider. Do you want to continue using this server?"</div>
<div><br />
<div>In addition, will it be safe to simply press the [Yes] button and carry on regardless?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Might the problem rest with the server owner? Mr Gregory Gooden is a 'professional' whose main business activity lies here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.annex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.annex.com/</a></div>

<div><br />
<div>I'm still trying to learn about 'computing' - so I wonder if you could help me on another point? I'm not sure if it is linked to the 'Certification' situation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the source code of the <a href="http://www.annexcafe.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.annexcafe.com</a> page, I note this:-</div>
<div><br />
<div><span>script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="http://analytics.live.com/Analytics/msAnalytics.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Can you, or perhaps a colleague, explain why it is included there? As I understand it, Microsoft Analytics 'died' a death a while back.
<a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10201970-56.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10201970-56.html</a>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I've never come across any other web page which includes analytics.live.com in the source code.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Might it cause harm or is its presence irrelevant? I hope you don't mind me asking here. If necessary, perhaps this query can be transferred to a more appropriate place. Regardless, I do hope you can help!&nbsp;</span></div>

<div><span>Have a great day! :-)&nbsp;</span></div>

    <title>Cannot run Windows Performance Recorder on windows 10 x64 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> who1am  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot run Windows Performance Recorder on windows 10 x64</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; I downloaded adksetup.exe from <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=526740" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=526740</a>,&nbsp;chosen "Windows Performance Toolkit" only and installed it. But after I installed it, I can't use Windows Performance Recorder.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; When I type "xperf -on" in cmd, it says:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">xperf: error: The requested operation cannot be performed when running the x86 version of the WPT in WOW64 mode.<br />
Please run a native version of the WPT instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; When I run&nbsp;Windows Performance Recorder(WPRUI.exe), it shows:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bbccea66-be8e-4d9d-bcbe-f14c1c7eda4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bbccea66-be8e-4d9d-bcbe-f14c1c7eda4c" /></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>&nbsp;It seems that I have installed wrong version of WPT, but I can't find where to download the x64 version of WPT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Could anyone help me to fingure out what's wrong?</p>
<p>&nbsp; Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Ramsen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are getting error while you open camera and I will be happy to answer your query. Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you make any changes in the computer prior to the issue?</li><li>What is the make and model number of the camera?&nbsp;</li></ul>
<div>
<p>The issue could be with the camera or the camera app.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>When you start the Camera app, the camera app will display the text “Connect to camera”. Plug the camera into the USB port, if the camera does not connect, unplug and then reconnect the camera.&nbsp;If the camera does still not connect, you will need to install
 or update the drivers for your camera.&nbsp;If a new driver does not resolve the issue, or if a newer driver does not exist, uninstall the current driver so Windows will use the basic driver for the camera.<br />
<br />
If the camera is an older camera, it may not be compatible with Windows 8. Let's try a few methods as below and check the status.&nbsp;</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:&nbsp;</strong>We would suggest you to run hardware and devices troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><div>a) Press the ‘Windows + C’ to activate the charms menu or move the mouse pointer to bottom right corner of the screen and you will get the charms menu.<br />
b) Click on ‘search’ and select ‘settings’ and type ‘Troubleshooting’ and select ‘troubleshooting’.<br />
c) Click on ‘Hardware and Sound’ and select ‘Hardware and Devices’ and click on next to run the troubleshooter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>If the issue is with the camera app, run the app troubleshooter from the link given below:</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>What to do if you have problems with an app</div>

<h2>            Second Process Explorer running under PID 6200&#59; also svchost.exe running under PID 6200</h2>
                    <p>I have found, when using Process Explorer, that a second version of the P. Explorer is also running, but its icon (to the left) is a standard one and not the true P. Explorer icon.&nbsp; This second version was running under PID 6200, which I believe has to do
 with a modem.&nbsp; I have a modem on my Vista machine, but it is not being used (no telephone connection).&nbsp; I went to the folder from where P. Explorer runs and found procexp.chm, and when I tried to open the file, Windows indicated it was a program.&nbsp; To disable
 it, I renamed it, and now I don't see it running.&nbsp; Also, I found svchost.exe running under PID 6200, but with no description, co. name, path or command line.&nbsp; I have been experiencing large reads (over 500 MB), using svchost.exe, from time to time.&nbsp; I think
 I have a virus.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me what I have got and then tell me how to go about removing it from my machine?&nbsp; (Also, I have been experiencing a slow machine, usually after startup.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have two versions of svchost.exe on my machine.&nbsp; Testing for a virus has shown neither to be a virus.&nbsp; I tried to delete the version that is not in folder c:\windows\system32 but am unable to do so.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me how is delete such a file, or to
 replace it with the correct version?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start your computer, while&nbsp;scchost is reading from the disk start Task Manager, find the&nbsp;svchost process doing the reading, right click and choose Go To Services. The services in that process will be listed. Right click -
<em>Stop Service</em>. When you hit the right one it will stop being reading the disk.</p>

<h2>            Can i set the resolution of the surface pro tablet to 800 x 600</h2>
                    I have an application which is developed with lot of images designed for 800 x 600 resolution. when i install that application in my surface tablet, it does not occupy the full screen. To make it work full screen on a surface tablet, i think i have to
 redesign the images for the 1920 x 1080 resolution. To avoid this, is there a way to set the resolution of the surface pro tablet to 800 x 600?. I could see that the minimum resolution of the surface tablet to be only 1024 x 768.

<p>I have a doubt: when I connect my wireless controller to Xbox 360 usb port, the red led reports that the battery pack is still in charge, but I have never seen the led turning from red to green, even after having played for 4 hours with the battery in charge.
 So I wonder: what exactly is the charging time of Xbox 360 battery pack using Play and Charge kit?</p>

<p>3-4 hours sounds about right.I can never tell the difference between the 2 colours myself.I just use the guide button on the controller &amp; go by the little battery icon on the screen.</p>
<p>I've also noticed that the battery tends to get hot once charged but that may just be my battery.</p>

                    hi im getting the error code 0x83860012 whenever i launch subnautica and it tries to sync with the cloud saves. now im wired in to my cable/modem and the steps i have tried is uninstalling/reinstalling the game uninstalling and re-installing my profile
 doing the i call it the soft format cause you keep your games and apps installed and it would take to long to re-install everything.&nbsp; i have even shut off my xbox by pressing and holdong the power and unpluging my xbox from the wall for 5 min and still getting
 the same error with the same codei also looked at my network connection on my one and it sais im connected so i dont know what else to do. and this is happining only on subnautica

            You tried all those steps? And they still do not work? I would say contact the game manufacturer for this issue. Unknown Worlds:&nbsp;https://unknownworlds.com/

<p>
</p><p>If you have given them Remote Access and if&nbsp;you do Internet Banking, contact your Bank, explain it to them and change Passwords.</p>
<p>If you use your Credit Card online, cancel it and get a new one issued to you.</p>
<p>

            Definitely is. &nbsp;I have chrome operating system, I don't even have windows. &nbsp;They have called me 9 times today (1/12/17-and it's only 2:30pm) It's just a recording that goes to my voicemail, but they are harassing me &amp; I'm getting ticked off. &nbsp;I have a
 business phone &amp; I hate to turn it off but I guess I'll have to if I want to stop being harassed.&nbsp;

                    Will you be able to use the XBO and the 360 on the same TV without any problems? But not at the same time though. Like play an Xbox One game then later play a game on the 360.
