<p>If you don't do anything wrong then you have nothing to fear from complaints, at the very least you would have been given a forced name change as your gamertag was referencing drugs.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>When you are banned you also forfeit anything connected to that account. That is all your DLC, Microsoft points and remaining Gold time. Though if the DLC was on your console before the ban and the licenses were in place then it would still work, you'd just
 never be able to delete it unless you were willing to pay on your new account.</p>

<h2>            Sharp AR M257 copier&#47;printer will not print from Windows 7 Professional computer.</h2>
                    Sharp AR M257 copier/printer will not print from a new Windows 7 Professional computer.&nbsp; Per Microsoft the drivers should load automatically.&nbsp; They did not.&nbsp; I have downloaded the drivers from Sharp and the computer now recognizes the printer but will
 not print.&nbsp; Anyone have any luck getting this model to work with Windows 7 64 bit?

            <p>My issue has been solved.&nbsp; I'll tell you at the end how but to answer your questions.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>1. The only error message was to say the print job failed to print.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Yes, I was able to print prior to plugging in the new Windows 7 computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1.&nbsp; The troubleshooter never found any error with the printer.&nbsp; Ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2.&nbsp; Multiple drivers were downloaded from the US and UK Sharp websites.&nbsp; The drivers were also deleted several times.&nbsp; The same issue was there every time.&nbsp; Sharp customer service had no idea.&nbsp; Our local Sharp repair representative had no idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ultimate fix was to turn the copier off then back on.&nbsp; That solved the problem and we have been able to print without any problems since.&nbsp; This should not have been an issue but it was.&nbsp; Thank you for your assistance.</p>

 from the back of the console for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Plug the power cord back in and restart the console.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Yes you can search for a set of coordinates (latitude, longitude) just enter the numbers in the search box separated by a coma and a space.</p>

<h2>            I&#39;ve just bought Halo Wars 2, but can&#39;t see it anywhere in my library, nor the Xbox app&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I've purchased the game Halo Wars 2 for windows and xbox, but it won't show up in my library on the store app or on the Xbox app either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all sorts of fixes to try and get this working. Previously I bought Gears of War 4 on the microsoft store and was able to play that, but now when I search for that, I am getting the "Page not found, try searching again" message, same as when I
 try to look for Halo Wars 2</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone got any ideas? I'm thoroughly at the end here, I've just paid £45 for a game that doesn't even exist in my library!</p>

<p>This is simply a suggestion, but are you actually logged into the store app? For me, I couldn't find my copy of Halo Wars 2 and it dawned on me that I hadn't logged into the store app or the xbox app. After that, when I searched for Halo Wars 2 it popped
 up as owned and was able to then manage where to install HW2 afterwards. Hope this is helpful, even though I'm responding to a post made about 9 months ago.</p>

            so after quite a bit of tinkering here is how you get it to work in windows 10<br />
<br />
install the xbox app from windows store<br />
<br />
if you havent redeemed the code, do it from this app&nbsp; or the windows store website<br />
<br />
open windows powershell in administrator (search power shell then right click and click run as administrator.)<br />
<br />
copy/paste this (this will reinstall any thing windows needs by default for the store and xbox app)<br />
<br />
Get-AppXPackage | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}<br />
<br />
push enter<br />
<br />
restart your computer<br />
<br />
open xbox app<br />
<br />
search for the halo you bought and when you click it, it should now take you to the store and install should be available.

<p>The SD card is not IDE.&nbsp; It is USB.&nbsp; IDE is a hard drive connection.&nbsp; The hard drive was disabled so no Boot location.
</p>
<p>Just thinking;&nbsp; I do not know how you would get Windows up so you could get to Device Manager without a boot.&nbsp; Could it be that if you have another drive with windows on it that you could boot it and then replace the system onto the older disk through doing
 a clone..</p>

            Do you have a friend that could download the Media Creation Tool and put it on a USB.&nbsp; Read the instructions and make the USB for installing on another computer.<br />
Then you could use it to try in his computer to install on your hard drive.

            Hi Alex
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode
<br />Go back into Device Manager and select any device category
<br />Then click Task - Scan for hardware changes
<br />Does Windows reload the IDE ATA/ATAPI driver?
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

</p><p>Thank you for coming to the Xbox forums. Unfortunately, you cannot record your voice using the built in video recording feature. There are some other ways you can achieve this, but it is not possible using the Xbox game clip feature. One way would be to
 use a capture card like an Elgato to record your gameplay or you can stream through Twitch and enable archiving, which will save your videos for 14 days that you can then download from Twitch's website to save on your PC or upload to a storage device. I'm
 not sure how well this works, but you can also try streaming your gameplay to the Xbox App for Windows 10 and then use a streaming software like OBS to record and save your gameplay. All of this should record gameplay and voice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps!</p>

            You can't record voice through DVR, however if your using Mixer for audio why not record video with Mixer as well.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Automatic Driver Update Programs will all eventually fail, often with spectacular results (BAD).<br />
So I do not recommend them. Instead I use DriverView which allows me to easily see which<br />
drivers and versions are loaded. Then I go to each maker's site and obtain&nbsp;the&nbsp;drivers manually.<br />
There probably are other programs that allow you to easily see the driver information. Since<br />
all they are doing is displaying information they do not have an impact on the drivers.<br />
<br />
One day the scanners and automatic update programs will work properly however this is not
<br />
that day.<br />
<br />
For a laptop most drivers will be available at the System Maker's Site though there are often
<br />
even newer versions available at the actual device makers' sites.<br />
<br />

<br />
==================================<br />
<br />
This&nbsp;is&nbsp;my generic how-to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
Run&nbsp;DriverView -&nbsp;set VIEW to&nbsp;Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their<br />
names. Also&nbsp;check for BIOS and chipset driver update at the System Maker's Site.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0072c6">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</font></span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<p>of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<h2>            Cortana, O365 get message &#34;I can&#39;t seem to connect to the service right now&#34;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm using a Surface Pro 4 with Windows 10 1803 (17134.648). We also use Office 365. When I try to use Cortana to schedule a meeting, it takes me to a "Lets get a calendar set up for you"&nbsp;dialog. I select Office365 and it asks me to connect.
 It displays a Microsoft Login and I enter my O365 credentials which appear to work since it asks me if I want to Stay Signed In? I click Yes, an it waits for a bit the displays "I can't seem to connect to the service right now. Try again in a little bit."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried this multiple times over the last couple weeks, so I don't think it will resolve itself, and I have never had it working with this computer. I did verify that Cortana was enabled in O365. It also does the same thing if you go to Cortana settings
 and select "Manage the information Cortana can access from other services".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how to resolve this? </p>

<p>I had Office 2016 Professional installed. When I ran the repair, it failed with an error that I could not install the 32 bit version and actually uninstalled Office.

<p>I reinstalled Office 365 and rebooted. I tried re-connecting Cortana to O365, but I still receive the same error.</p>

            What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
amdkmpfd.sys AMD PCI Root Bus Lower Filter -&gt; check with System/Motherboard Maker and update the BIOS,
<strong>chipset drivers</strong>, and the major on-board and separate device drivers (that is part of the chipset drivers).<br />
<br />
igdkmd64.sys Intel HD Graphics Drivers same as above though you may also need to check with Intel (after the above) for an even newer driver version).<br />
<br />
fltmgr.sys is a Windows component which means something else drove it into Fault.<br />
<br />
Check with Dell Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, diagnostics, and ask in their forums about any known issues.<br />

<h3> carflo1212  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one snap feature</h2>
                    
<p><span>Alright I'm not the greatest at explaining my ideas by writing it but I'll do my best.... So basically what I am asking for for the option to make the xbox one snap feature transparent. I want this feature because I personally
 think the snap feature &nbsp;takes up to much tv/monitor space so with the transparent feature this will basically make it so it won't take up as much space. An example of this feature is when playing a youtube vid it will make it where it places it where the person
 wants like the twitch kinect camera &nbsp;on the top/bottom right or top/bottom left sides of the screen. I personally like listening to music when playing, But I hate how the pandora/youtube/groove music looks, I can't concentrate when I have 25% of my screen
 taken by a stupid side panel.If the transparent snap feature isn't possible I would like for certain apps to be playable in the background such like&nbsp;pandora/youtube/groove music. PLEASE MAKE THIS POSSIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</span></p>

4) see<b>&nbsp;Error Checking<br />

<p><span>Hey curtiskoch,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Using which application did you burn the DVD?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you used Windows Media Player for burning the DVD,&nbsp;the Player creates a playlist that lists the files being burned and then includes the playlist
 on the disc. If your playback device supports playlists, the items will play back in the order in which they appeared in your burn list. By default, the playlist is saved with a .wpl(Windows Media Player Playlist) extension. If you want to play your data discs
 in a device that doesn't support this extension, you can use the .m3u extension instead.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Details here:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Change settings for burning a CD or DVD in Windows Media Player</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-settings-for-burning-a-CD-or-DVD-in-Windows-Media-Player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-settings-for-burning-a-CD-or-DVD-in-Windows-Media-Player</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can check with Sony which formats are supported by the player.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>There is no inbuilt tool in Windows 7 to convert wpl files&nbsp;to mp3 format. However there are many third party video conversion programs that give
 you the ability to achieve this. Use your favorite search engine and browse for one such program.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting
 from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are few updates available for your device. See if you require the update wherein you can go for it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>See:</span></p>

            <p>It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a couple of links on using OneDrive (SkyDrive):</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time</p>

            <p>I've tested the graphics with the 15.10 driver. No luck. Still causing major memory leaks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That link is quite alarming. Any way to test graphics card for defects? I would need to know if it is in fact defective after using the official driver so i can file a warranty claim.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other possible suspects to this problem?</p>

            <p>Are you just having the one issue, the problem with Elder Scrolls Online?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are&nbsp;no other issues then it is less likely the problem is with the card itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To test a graphics card one could use a stress test such as<a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/13081-furmark-gpu-stress-test.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> FurMark</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, try a "clean boot" and see if it makes a difference:</p>

</p><p>To open msconfig&nbsp;in Windows 10: &nbsp;Windows Key + R &gt;&nbsp;type <em>msconfig</em> &gt; OK&nbsp;</p>
