            <p>Please for your own sake do not use any of the myriads of driver download sites on the web.&nbsp; They are bogus and will mess up your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your main source should be the OEM for your computer.&nbsp; Go to their support page and provide your model number.&nbsp; That should lead you to the driver(s) you need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other source may be, if your system is Intel based, the Intel driver update utility you can find by simply Googling it.</p>

<h2>            How do I easily to get my desktop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10. &nbsp;I don't know what I did, but I can't easily access my desktop anymore. &nbsp;I am only able to be on my apps page. &nbsp;The only way I can access things that are on my desktop is if I go to my files under the This PC buttton on the apps page and
 click on the "Documents" and "Desktop" folders. &nbsp;I used to be able to click one of the buttons at the bottom of my screen and access my desktop.</p>
<p>How can I take care if this?</p>

            Hi Karen,
<br />
<br />Open the Photos App in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Drag that window, so it is not maximized and you can also see your Desktop
<br />
<br />Then find the picture(s) you want to upload to Facebook and drag them out onto your Desktop
<br />
<br />This will create a second copy of those photos on your Desktop, that you can then upload to Facebook

<h2>            Is the new DLC worth it&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>as much as I loved Mass Effect 3 (overall package) I kind of stopped playing it around when the last DLC came out ( the first 1 was meh) and wondering is it worth paying 15 dollars for it now or just wait for a price cut like the deals of the week or what
 they did last black Friday?</p>

<p>The 'Omega' DLC (same price) was probably worth half of what we paid for, but this one I felt we got full value, great adventure, lots of fun and humour and closure with the characters that we've come to know and love which was painstakingly absent from
 "the ending", It's not a stretch to say that this DLC is in the Top 5 MASS Effect DLCs...:-)

            Hi Kevin
<br />
<br />You will need to reinstall the right edition to correct the problem. 
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Hi Kevin.  II'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You most certainly never have to buy another copy of Windows to reinstall it, you can reinstall it as often as you want.  To create the bootable media install Media Creation Tool, open the tool and choose Create bootable media.  Make sure you create the licensed version.  
<br />
<br />Then boot the media, delete all partitions to get it cleanest and click Next to automate creating and formatting the needed partitions and begin.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />If you have a retail Product Key you can try inserting it during or after install.  If it fails activation you may need to contact Support due to the hardware change, but you're entitled to move retail Product Keys anywhere you want for their life.  
<br />
<br />If the retail key had converted to a Digital License which is the way things are going now, then here is the procedure to transfer the license to new hardware:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>.  Sign in with the MS Account, run the Activation Troubleshooter, tell it which hardware you want to move the license from and to, and it should activate.
<br />
<br />If not or if the Digial License wasn't linked to a MS Account you can still reactivate by contacting Microsoft Support by one of these methods:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Kevin
<br />
<br />You need to create Windows 10 installation media and clean install Windows 10 Home - it costs nothing to do this . .. 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then before you install Windows 10, you need to force the installer to allow you to choose the Home Edition of Window 10
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose New - Text Document 
<br />
<br />Paste the text below into that document 
<br />
<br />Then choose File - Save Aa, at the bottom of the Save As dialog, change file type to 'All Files' then save that file as ei.cfg (note you must manually add the cfg file extension) 
<br />
<br />Then copy that ei.cfg file into the Sources folder in your Installation Media 
<br />
<br />Then when you begin the Installation, you should be asked which Edition you want to install . . . 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />[EditionID] 
<br />Core 
<br />[Channel]

            Hi Kevin,
<br />
<br />You will need to make a bootable copy in order to do this. Here are some steps that might be helpful.
<br />
<br />What you should do, is first download the ISO file using Media Creation Tool, then use another tool such as Rufus to make a bootable copy. Here is how you do that:
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Create installation media for another PC if you want to download a ISO image or create a bootable DVD or USB thumb drive,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />If you want to download a particular edition or both architectures, uncheck the Use the recommended option for this PC. 
<br />Image
<br />
<br />Click in the Edition list box, choose your edition then click Next.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - contains Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro.
<br />Windows 10 Home Single Language - only select this edition if you are running Windows 10 Single Language, Windows 8 Single Language or Windows 8.1 with Bing.
<br />Windows 10 N - only select this edition if you reside in Europe, it does not contain Windows Media Player. It contains Windows 10 Home N, Windows 10 Pro N.
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Exception: you can double click the ISO (or right click it, choose Open with &gt; Fiel Explorer), mount it and start the upgrade in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />MAKING A BOOTABLE COPY USING RUFUS:
<br />
<br />You can download Rufus, for free.
<br /><a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://rufus.akeo.ie/</a>
<br />
<br />After downloading Rufus, connect your thumb drive, launch Rufus application, click in the Device list box then choose your thumb drive.
<br />
<br />Click in the list box then choose your partition scheme. If you select the ISO, Rufus will automatically select the appropriate options for you. Next, click in the File system list box, then choose FAT32. If your thumb drive is larger than 32 GBs, choose exFAT.
<br />
<br />Leave the default Cluster size then enter a label for your thumb drive.
<br />
<br />Click the choose disk image icon, browse to where the ISO file is located, select it then click Open.
<br />
<br />Click Start to copy the files to the thumb drive.
<br />
<br />If you have any files on the thumb drive, they will be deleted.
<br />
<br />Wait while the files are copied to your thumb drive.
<br />
<br />Close when complete
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer, then launch setup to begin the installation. 
<br />
<br />STILL NOT ABLE TO DOWNLOAD THE ISO FILE?
<br />
<br />Download Windows 10 1809 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1809
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)

<p>Too much casual stuff. &nbsp;Like you said, the gun smith stuff looked cool and I like the look of the implementation of kinect in Mass Effect 3. &nbsp;I'm happy about Halo 4 and the Anniversary remake. &nbsp;But watching another bunch of casual games, played by people
 who act like they've been injected with way too much happy juice, was just too much to bare.
</p>
<p>Now all that's left is to wait for the next few days to pass, waiting for the Battlefront 3 announcement that won't come, then I can finish another year of E3, feeling empty, "meh" and soul destroyed.</p>
<p>I'll look at the NGP, but I can't imagine I'll wanna spend a fortune on a Sony handheld. &nbsp;I'll take a look at the new Nintendo system too, but I'll want a much better lineup than what the Wii has brought to the table. &nbsp;Overall, I like some of the stuff Microsoft
 are doing with kinect, but I want major game titles, not other ways to flail my arms around.</p>
<p>The cool stuff just seemed to be drowned out by Elmo and Mickey Mouse. &nbsp;</p>

<p>To be perfectly honest I wasn't expecting much from Microsoft at this E3, As I said on the old forums all eyes are on Nintendo this year, Kinect sucks for us Hardcore gamers and I wasted a lot of bandwidth watching Microsoft's press conference!!!</p>

<p>I thought it was brilliant. Too many gamers here who think they are hardcore, who don't know the meaning of the word. The xbox isnt just about shooting and cod you know, there are kids to think about, and women who will want the interactive features which
 the Xbox is bringing. I can't wait for that dashboard update. </p>
<p>Thoroughly enjoyed that. You don't get events like this every day so stop being a bunch of miserable bastads and enjoy the insane amount of quality games on the way.</p>

<p>- Open&nbsp;<u>Computer</u> from the Start Menu</p>
<p>- Right-click <u>Network</u></p>
<p>-&nbsp;Click <u>Properties</u></p>
<p>- Click <u>View Status</u></p>

<p>- Turn on <u>Obtain IP Address Automatically</u> and <u>Obtain DNS address automatically</u></p>
<p>- Click <u>OK</u></p>
<p>- Close any open windows.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; Do the above on both systems and you should be set.</p>

<p>ok tienes una buena opcion si tienes las dos semanas con ella</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>ve a la tienda en la que la compraste y cometales tu caso y que ellos te hagan la garantia valida</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>en las tiendas casi siempre te dan 30 dias para la garantia con ellos asi que aprovechala y que te la cambien ya que no es normal en las consolas, y nada que no te la cambian pues estas en tiempo con ellos.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>con lo de tus datos no te preocupes guarda todo en nuna USB y borras todo del HDD</p>
<p>te dejo el tutorial de como se hace</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/es-MX/xbox-360/accessories/storage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../storage</a></p>
<p>con tu consola nueva solo recupera tu GT con el mail y pass con la que la creaste y es todo, no perdiste tus datos, si bajaste algo recupera tus licencias en la consola nueva y taraaaaaaaaan back in the game</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>no dejes pasar mas tiempo y vete ahora mismo a cambiarla, note olvides de llevar tu ticket de compra</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>saludos</p>

<h2>            Battlefield&#58; Bad Company 2 Won&#39;t start - Side by Side Configuration</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>Ok, I have been trying to start up Battlefield: Bad Company. At first, I couldn't install it because Visual C++ 2005 wouldn't install. So I eventually edited to skip the VC++ install, and just install the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now I realize, I needed to install VC++ but it won't install.</p>
<p>I can't install Visual C++ 2005 or the ATL Security Update, but the Service Pack 1 installs fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install the update, I might have to upgrade to Service Pack 2. You may ask, why didn't I update when it was released. Well, that's because a few years ago (beginning of 2008) Windows downloaded an update which put my pc into an infinite restart.</p>
<p>(start up, update, restart, start up, update, restart, etc.)</p>
<p>And now, when I try to update to Service Pack 2, it says "Catastrophic Failure" or "Incorrect Parameters"</p>
<p>I also get errors with Windows Installer 3.1, 4.0, or 4.5 and .NET Framework 2.0 and higher</p>
<p>(Usually 3.0, 3.5 and 4.0 are Windows Installer related errors)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anybody help me out?</p>

<p><span>Hi rebel28,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Step 1:</span></p>
<p><span>You may try to install the Visual C++ 2008 package and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=9b2da534-3e03-4391-8a4d-074b9f2bc1bf</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2:</span></p>
<p><span>After installing Visual C++ 2008, you may try to run the game using Administrator's privileges.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Right click on the game and select run as Administrator and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

<p>Hi, I installed VC++ 2008, it installed successfully, and ran it with Administrator's privileges, unfortunately it still won't start.</p>
<p>Other games which also haven't worked in the past are Bioshock 2 and Sniper Ghost Warrior. My friend, who has Service Pack 2 managed to play both those games successfully, he hasn't tried Bad Company 2 yet.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Using WhoCrashed I managed to pinpoint the error to be coming from qcamain1.sys which is the qualcomm atheros wireless network driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to reinstall the drivers, manually update the drivers, and even use Driver Easy to install the best suited update. But each time I keep getting the same error of Code 37
</p>
<pre><strong>Windows cannot initialize the device driver for this hardware. (Code 37)</strong></pre>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here are my dump files https://1drv.ms/f/s!Aq0N_yh40dP1ziHan7vyeLkITxdz</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do?</p>

<h2>            Printer shows as unknown when printing</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: HP Officejet G85</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somehow I cannot install my HP Officejet G85 in Windows 8. I followed all HP-instructons many times, but no success. When I connect the printer by USB,, the printer does not appear &nbsp;in the list of printers, but in the list "unknown", without having installed
 a driver. When I install the printer according the instruction, the printer does appear in the list of printers, but I cannot print. It looks like the printer and the computer don't match and don't accept each other. What can I do?

            I followed all these instructions several times, but the computer is not able to find the printer, and the printer is not able to find the computer The manual installation itself is no problem and the printer is appearing in the printerscreen. But somehow
 it is not connected with the real printer, and I cannot print. When I install the printer the other way by connecting the printer with the computer, then the printer is installed as "unknown" without driver. What to do?

<p><span>Use the Printer not on list option to start manual installation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;When it asks what port it is on chose local port.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;In
 the Port name dialogue use&nbsp;</span><b><span><span style="color: rgba(155, 79, 150, 1)">\\<i>XpPcName\Sharename</i>&nbsp;</span></span></b><span>from

<p><span>&nbsp;When it lists the available drivers chose Have Disk and navigate to where you expanded the downloaded drivers to.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;It should then list the printers included in the driver package,&nbsp;select the one you need then complete the installation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;This process has worked many times where the automatic installation fails.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the reply.</span></p>

            <p>Uninstall all the HP printer products installed on the computer before following the steps mentioned below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these steps and let us know the results.</p>
<p>Note: This usually works for network printer, but you can also use it to add a local printer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Go to <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong> in <strong>Control panel</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Then click on <strong>Advanced printer setup</strong>.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Select the option “<strong>Add a local printer or network printer with manual settings</strong>” (If this does not work, click on the big Browse button)</p>
<p>4. Now select the <strong>driver</strong> for your <strong>Local/network</strong> printer.</p>
<p>5. Windows should now install the printer. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if this helps to install the Printer driver via Windows Updates.</p>

            This was of course the first thing I did, but it did not work and all other attemps failed. Also the help HP with a special help program did not work. I decided to conclude that Windows 8 is not able or willing to install HP Officejet G85. I tested other
 HP printers without any problem. Now I got another printer (working).&nbsp;
<div>It was one of those suprises of Windows 8, which took me hours (and money) to discover, while Microsoft and HP promisses solutions all the time. No way! There is no solution.</div>

            <p>Hello Showstopper-md:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before trying the two suggestions below&nbsp;be sure to re-run the find devices on both the laptop and the device(s) that&nbsp;you are trying to connect to as the settings may have been lost during the upgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may also need to do this if you try the 2nd step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two suggestions:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Look in the Control Panel for Device Manager (right click on the Windows button while on the desktop).&nbsp;&nbsp; Find the Bluetooth device in Device Manager (Hardware &amp; Sound).&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on it and try disabling.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;click&nbsp;on enable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then see if it is
 working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) On the same tab, right click on the device and select update driver tab.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then left click on the update driver automatically selection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This may take some time.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a new device driver is available, Windows will find and install it for you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Try
 Bluetooth again at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hmm...perhaps it has something to do with updates on Waypoint?</p>
<p>Before I state my theory as to why, could you tell me when was the last time you downloaded/used Waypoint? Or if you can't even interact with Waypoint in general? I last used it before Bungie officially handed it to 343i, and most recently had to go to the
 Waypoint site on my computer and re-confirm that my account was in use in order to interact with my account.</p>

<p>I'm at a loss then really. I haven't looked into it, but perhaps you can contact some off-site support team that can help you. That's how I regained access to my account after I was in a Family Plan Gold and Microsoft disbanded that function, I had to DIRECTLY
 contact support via e-mail. Try doing that for 343i or Halo Waypoint.</p>
<p>I don't know if 343i currently has an off-site support team. Try and Google their e-mail for contact, and send them everything you think they need to know via e-mail. It's the best option you've got.</p>

<p>@Bonez- Nope. Halo Waypoint still is a currently-used interactive experience for members to share and distribute Halo Content. It will soon be REPLACED with the upcoming 'Halo Channel', as from what I have gathered.</p>
<p>As for Activision disbanding Call of Duty: Elite, I must admit I was frustrated. I never used it prior to BLOPSII, but I really wanted to save full-size PNGs of all my custom emblems on other sites. Now you can't do that. Or even interact with other users.</p>

<p>@Bong-...perhaps because he wants to be able to access the content associated with Halo that CAN'T be accessed in game?</p>
<p>The whole point of Halo Waypoint is if you want to immediately launch on-drive games, compare statistics, or watch content while switching &nbsp;back-and-forth between the Halo title you are playing and the app, instead of having to hit the dashboard and launch
 YouTube or Internet Explorer seperately to visit the Waypoint site.</p>

<p>Cool, I think RvB is neat... &nbsp;Youtube is easy access now along with IE....</p>
<p>Lets follow your logic anyway, &nbsp;You want content you can't use in game. &nbsp;OK.... WHY.</p>
<p>If you are in game, What purpose does a video have??? &nbsp;Stats are found with the Pause button &nbsp;either way the gameplay stops... &nbsp; &nbsp;You are not playing well if you are looking at something else. &nbsp;Besides you have to wait for Waypoint to load anyway...- &nbsp;You
 skip 1 step... &nbsp; Nobody needs that info--- &nbsp;</p>
<p>It's just a game my friend.... &nbsp;Manny other devices can be used during gameplay anyway...</p>

</p><p>The REGISTRY_ERROR bug check&nbsp;indicates that a severe registry error has occurred. Something has gone wrong with the registry. This error may indicate that the registry encountered an I/O error while trying to read one of its files. This can be caused by
 hardware problems or file system corruption. It may also occur due to a failure in a refresh operation, which is used only in by the security system, and then only when resource limits are encountered.</p>
