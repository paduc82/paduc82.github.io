<p>
</p><p>One day I turned on the computer and now I can only log in locally as one user. There is no menu at the bottom left to choose a different user. I can use remote desktop to login as another user, but not as the one administrator. Please help.</p>

<p>LED <strong>is</strong> LCD. LED is a type or way&nbsp;of backlighting an LCD display. Rather than the typical CCFL edge lighting, LEDs are used. There are two types of LED lighting... One type lights the edges of the screen just like standard LCD displays, while&nbsp;the
 other uses local dimming, which lights the entire screen,&nbsp;but areas can be completely shut off to produce better contrast &amp; black levels. Local dimming is more expensive, but produces an overall better picture. One downside is that you can get halos around
 bright objects moreso than with traditional LCD sets.</p>

<p>If you're strictly talking about which tech is the future tech, it's LED, and simply for it's power savings. Manufacturers will have to move to strictly LED displays in order to keep up with Energy Star requirements in years to come. Mind you I echo OG Pooh
 on everything he said about LED/LCD and that they are in fact variations of the same system.</p>

<p>Depending on the design of the display though there can be a LED matrix behind for back lighting which is way better than LED edge diffusive and completely eclipses CCFL back lighting. Contrast is better as well as backlight bleeding which can be very apparent
 depending on the display.</p>
<p>Eventually OLED or sets where every sub pixel is an individual addressable LED is the future, but the only consumer sets you can buy are 2-3x what a high end LCD costs and the sizes are still fairly small.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>That's simple, the best one that falls within your price range. Weigh things like inputs, picture quality, warranty, etc. I'd advise you to do research online on models you're considering rather than looking at TVs in stores. Most stores have their TVs in
 "Store Mode" which makes for an awful, and awfully bright "vivid" picture. Some boutique will displays TVs on their Standard setting, which is better but not ideal. Another thing that's important is to ignore specifications. Things like refresh rate, response
 time, contrast ratio, etc. are all basically meaningless. The refresh rate can be somewhat useful but most displays will likely be equal given equivalent price points.</p>

<p>Quite simply, I would look for the most natural picture. If you want my opinion (and that of many consumers, reviewers &amp; other experts), that means Sony. A lot of people will also direct you to Samsung, which IMHO is probably the second best choice. Chosing
 displays isn't really as open to personal taste as something like audio equipment. The picture is either accurate or it isn't. Having personally evaluated many sets over the years, as far as LCD displays go, I haven't seen any that come as close (out of the
 box) to natural as Sony. All that said, I echo Silent Paradigm in saying weigh any set's cost against what you personally need as far as features are concerned and what level of performance you're comfortable with at that price point. There are less expensive
 brands that perform very well. You may want to check dedicated forums though, to see if there are common complaints about any particular model you're looking at. The forums at Sound &amp; Vision Magazine used to be great, but everybody seems to have left there
 for some reason. </p>

<p>You won't find a LCD TV in North America that displays at less than 60Hz natively. I have a 55" 120Hz LCD and I still notice some ghosting on it. I don't have this problem with my 50" plasma display, both from the same manufacturer (the plasma is 2 years
 older). It's hard to find plasmas in the size that you're looking for, if not impossible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's your budget for this display?</p>

<p>With plasma, you will have to worry about burn-in, especially if all you're going to use the set for is gaming. Plasmas are harder to burn-in than they used to be, but the issue will never completely go away. as it is inherent of the technology. If all you're
 going to do is game, the chances that it will burn-in, especially within the first hundred hours or so, is a risk worth taking into consideration. The chances that an LCD will burn-in are about the same as the image of your face burning-in to your bathroom
 mirror. It ain't gonna happen, as LCD can't burn-in. Like Silent Paradigm said... What's your budget?</p>

<p>[quote user="OG Pooh"]The chances that an LCD will burn-in are about the same as the image of your face burning-in to your bathroom mirror. It ain't gonna happen, as LCD can't burn-in.[/quote]In theory this is 100% correct, but I have seen differently in
 some real world cases. I once had to service a customer's TV after they complained about "ghost images" on their LCD. Needless to say I was skeptical, but sure enough when I examined the display that was the issue, or something resembling the same effects.
 It was a LG LCD from maybe 18 months ago. It would retain a ghost image of something displayed on the screen for just seconds even (e.g. a TV guide). Now that display was defective, but it isn't entirely true to say that LCDs cannot suffer from burn-in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please tell us the EXACT text of the error message (including any codes) - it may help resolve the issue.</p>
<p>What is the full file path of the zip file (where it is currently located on your system)?&nbsp; It may be in a location that has permission issues that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>What is the file type of the zip file (the three digit extension that follows the dot in the filename)?&nbsp; Some file types cannot be handled by Vista's uncompression program.</p>
<p>Perhaps you can download, install and try the free 7-Zip program <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.7-zip.org/</a>&nbsp;and it may have more luck unzipping the file without being blocked (though that depends on how and why it is being blocked).</p>
<p>Here's a link to a free zip repair tool if you need one: <a href="http://www.diskinternals.com/zip-repair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.diskinternals.com/zip-repair/</a>&nbsp;to check if your zip file is corrupted and can be repaired.</p>
<p>I hope this helps and look forward to your answers to the questions posed here and above.&nbsp; With those answers, we may be able to assist you much better.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 verification of identity to complete activation.</h2>
                    I have a new computer with Windows 8 preinstalled. In setting it up I used a local email address and not a MS email address such as Hotmail, Live or Outlook. I notice a red X in the notification bar telling me I needed to finish setting up my account.
 This and several tiles lead to a page saying I should be getting a verification email from MS. Never have received this to the local account used in the initial setup. Windows 8 won't let me change this email address identity to my MS one. I can't even login
 to the MS email account from Explorer because of the screen which appears saying I need to confirm my identity with the email I haven't gotten. ( I can access the MS email if I open it in Firefox.)<br />
<br />
I have clicked on resend email several times. Sometimes it says it was successful and sometimes it says it cannot send and try later.<br />
<br />
Is there a solution to this. I've spent several hours looking online to no avail.<br />

                    <p>I installed a new HP webcam 4310 and when I click the little camera icon in a WebEx meeting, it states that participants will be able to see me.&nbsp; However, there is just a black box where the video picture should be.&nbsp; It is as though the camera is not turning
 on when it is supposed to.&nbsp; Am I missing a step to get the camera turned on?&nbsp; I plugged it into a USB outlet on my laptop.&nbsp; I have Windows 7.&nbsp; Any assistance to get this to work would be appreciated.</p>

</p><p>I split your response and created a new thread for you so we can assist you directly and not on an older thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the Atmos symbol popping up randomly when you're playing or using your Xbox? Do you use Atmos for headsets or for a home theatre system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To start off I would suggest a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power cycle </a>to your Xbox.</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Turn off the Xbox One console by pressing the <strong>Xbox</strong> button on the front of the console for about 10 seconds until it shuts down completely.
</li><li>Unplug the console's power cable. Wait&nbsp;5 mins.</li><li>Plug the console power cable back in. </li><li>Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button on your console to turn on the Xbox One.</li></ol>
<p>Give that a try and let us know if the symbol is still popping up on your screen.</p>

<p>
</p><p>We are sorry this issue keeps happening but rest assured we are here to help! We do have an update available for the OS of the consoles so we suggest trying the update! If the console is updated but the issue persists then it could be a bad copy of the update
 so the workaround would be&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">

<p>Hey Japekki thanks for keeping in touch!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand how frustrating this whole thing can be and we appreciate the patience, we need a bit more information. Is the console set to instant on or energy savings? Is the console connected to a power strip or directly to a wall outlet? Keep us posted!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey Lakelad, if you’re interested you can enroll in the Insider Program. There’s a fix in most rings for Atmos cutting out. I have a C7 and it got really annoying for me. I’m in the Beta ring and the recent update fixed my issue. Keep in mind the Insider
 Program is running an OS on your console that is in testing so it may exhibit other issues. No word when the fix is coming to wide release.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> daniellimon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Prevent Lync uses .ost file over Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're using Microsoft Office 2016 and Skype For Business 2016 in an AD/Exchange enviroment for the company, we use Skype for remote support for users presenting desktop and giving control to an administrator. The problem is, if you try to open a process
 that requires admin privileges like: task manager, regedit, device manager, etc., it will take away the control in that computer. We found that you need to run Skype as 'Administrator'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, we were finding a way to run Skype as administrator from the startup, we're using Windows 10 Enterprise x64 Edition for the &nbsp;users and the lync.exe located on 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office16\lync.exe' doesn't have the 'run as administrator'
 option in the propierties tab, we found a way to run it as administrator even for a .bat file or a Schedule Task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything seems cool, the problem is... it seems that if you run Skype as administrator from the start and then Outlook, mail shows an error for another application using the .ost file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to prevent Skype uses the ost before Outlook?</p>

            Hi Daniel,<br />
<br />
We don’t have any official articles about preventing Skype for Business uses .ost file before Outlook. Also, please note, using a .bat file or Schedule Task to run Skype for Business as administrator from the startup isn’t an official supported way.&nbsp;<br />
For your question, we welcome other community member share insights on it.<br />
<br />
Best Regards,<br />
Zoey&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Can I adjust the touchpad area for swiping in Windows 8&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I adjust the touchpad area for swiping in Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    I just bought a Lenovo laptop with Windows 8 installed that has the "Intelligent Touchpad". I'm at a loss as to how to adjust the area in which the charms appear. I want to swipe only the very edge of the touchpad to gain access to charms, etc., but it
 seems that I don't have to be close to the edge at all to get the charms to appear and it's driving me nuts. Is there an adjustment for this?<br />

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Touchpad setting options are specific to the brand of touchpad that is installed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to read the documentation that came with the laptop or ask Lenovo.</p>

<p>Is Mojang ever going to add Herobrine back into minecraft xbox 360 edition?<br />
<br />
I would really love being freaked out by him, it would make the ingame experience so much better..<br />
<br />
For those who say hes not real, if you hit start go to Help &amp; Options&gt;How To Play&gt;What's New&gt; and scroll all the way to the bottom of the updates you will see that it says&nbsp;<br />
<br />
- Removed Herobrine&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            playlist content not showing up on windows 8 phone</h2>
                    
<p>My Nokia Lumia will not sync with my xbox music account so the playlist content is not transported. The albums that I put in the playlist are not showing up either. The playlist headings are there but the content is not. &nbsp;I have made sure that my music is
 in my collection on the xbox web application ( I use a Mac).</p>

<div>Try the following solution</div>
<div>Start Device Manager.Expand System devices. Right-click on Surface Camera Windows Hello, select Properties. Click on Driver tab. Verify the driver date is July 2017. If so, you have the problem driver. Click Roll Back Driver button.

<h2>            Windows Media Player won&#39;t play mp3 or mp4, but Windows and YouTube work OK</h2>
                    When I browse to a media file (.mp3 or .mp4) and click it, I get a message <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows Media Player encountered a problem while playing the file.<br />
<br />
Clicking [Web Help] and following the directions I see that my computer has two devices in the section "Sound, Video, and Game Controllers", both have status "This device is working properly".<br />
<br />
I get Windows sounds normally (startup etc). I can play a videos from YouTube, and videos that I've prepared myself with Camtasia.&nbsp; However the same video won't play when I click on the .mp4 and Windows selects the default program, Windows Media Player.<br />
<br />
How do I correct this?<br />
<br />
Thank you, Robert.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like .mp4 files are not supported by Windows Media Player. </p>

</div>
<div>I've just upgraded from Win7 Starter to Home Premium on my netbook, and one of my motivations was to get my external DVD-RW to work consistently.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now, I'm very disappointed, because it is still not detected. Where can I find help?</div>

<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I can use other USB ports. In fact, I'm using a KVM switch right now.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried Methods 1 and 2, still with no sucess. I have saved the report from Method 2, qhere I can read:</div>

<div><br />
<div>Regarding Method 3, I have a question, before I start. In step d), you say "<span>reinstall the USB controllers</span>". How will I do it? I imagine that the nodes regarding USB controllers will disappear, but
 how do I know what to do after restarting?</div>

<div>I have leaped into the unknown and tried to follow Method 3.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And when I restarted the computer, a list of devices reappeared, but the external DVD drive is still not working on the correct USB port.</div>

<p>Hello boozypasha,</p>
<p>From the Parashara.com website, I was unable to determine for what version of the Microsoft operating system&nbsp;it would be&nbsp;compatible.<br />
<a href="http://www.parashara.com/pl61NewFeatures.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.parashara.com/pl61NewFeatures.htm</a></p>
<p>I suggest you try to install in Compatibility Mode.</p>
<p><span>If the program is not compatible, then you may try to install and run the program in compatibility mode.
</span></p>
<p><span>Use the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on the Program</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Properties</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Compatibility tab
</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Run this program in compatibility mode and select Windows&nbsp;XP or whatever operating system the program was running successfully.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link here: Make older programs run in this version of Windows</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the compatibility is not successful, then try and run
</span><span>the</span><span> Program Compatibility troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the
<span>Start</span> button.</span></p>
<p><span>Then click <span>
Control Panel</span>. In the search box, type <span>troubleshooter</span>, and then click
<span>Troubleshooting</span>. Under <span>Programs</span>, click
<span>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</span>. </span>
</p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>If you cannot install a program, insert the installation disc for the program and, using the troubleshooter, browse to the program's setup file, usually called Setup.exe, Install.exe, or something
 similar. The troubleshooter is not designed to work on programs that have an .msi file name extension.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't help, then I suggest you contact the manufacturer for assistance.</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            AFAIK you need to specifiy the /OffBootDir and /OffWinDir switches when running sfc.exe while in Repair Mode. Typing
<div><br />
<div>sfc /?</div>
<div><br />
<div>will tell you more. Note also that drive X: is a fictitious drive while in Repair Mode. Windows probably resides in C:\Windows or in D:\Windows.</div>

            Your report suggests that the command line parameters you used for sfc.exe were correct. When I run the same command while in Repair Mode on my machine then it works correctly. It therefore seems that something is wrong on your machine. What it is I have
 no idea. You might have to perform a destructive Factory Restore.

                    <p>Greetings community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just recently lost audio on all my thin clients that RDP into our Windows Server 2012 R2 remote desktop server. We have HP thin clients that are properly setup for audio and they all worked fine till this week. Could this have been a recent update that
 broke the audio?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <title>Why can&#39;t I see my desktop wallpapers or any other picture on my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lady adellandra dratianos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I see my desktop wallpapers or any other picture on my computer&#63;  What can I do to fix it&#63;</h2>
                    I don't know how I did it, but on my WIndows 7, none of my original pictures, nor those in my Pictures folder or even thumbnails work.&nbsp; All I see for Wallpaper is black screen.&nbsp; I have tried changing to a Theme that could work, but it hasn't. All I see
 for thumbnails is the writing, not the picture.&nbsp; I have an external HD and those pictures I can see, but not transfer to my Win 7 Desktop Background.&nbsp; Any ideas as to why or how this happened, and what I can do to fix it?&nbsp; I see pictures on websites fine,
 just not on my computer.&nbsp; Please help!<br />
<br />
Edit: It was strange: the files and their names were there, but the pictures were unable to be seen.&nbsp; I fixed it by reinstalling Windows 7 (over the Previous Win 7 HP).&nbsp; Could it have been a corrupted or missing file somewhere?&nbsp; At any rate, I will keep the
 first Answer in mind in case it happens again.&nbsp; Thank you!<br />

            You will need to reinstall Windows to downgrade from the Pro edition to Home. This will delete all of your personal files and settings, so make sure to backup your PC before continuing. Download then run the media creation tool from this page: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />Click "Download tool now" then run the application.
<br />You will need a blank USB flash drive with at least 8 GB of storage space. The media creation tool will allow you to boot a Windows installer from the USB flash drive you selected.
<br />
<br />During the Windows installation, you may be asked for a Windows product key. Enter the product key that you have ready to use, then continue. Windows should automatically activate after the installation when you connect to the internet.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you have any questions.

            Hi Gabe, sorry, but you will have to clean install your legitimate Windows 10 Home, there is no other route to get back to your previous legit version
<br />
<br />Backup your Data before proceeding . . .
<br />
<br />Hi , you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues

<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media
