<h2>            stop error c0000135</h2>
                    
<p>I get this error message that says :</p>
<p>&nbsp;"stop: c0000135 (unable to locate component)</p>
<p>This application has failed to start because winsrv was not found. re-installing the application may fix this problem.</p>
<p>I try to re=install windows xp but every time i restart my computer it just keeps going to this error message. I put the operating system cd in hit f12 and keeps going right back to the error message. How do i start my computer to re-install the missing
 component if all i get is the error message? Thank You</p>

<p>If the STOP error is as I described:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>STOP: c0000135 {Unable To Locate Component}</p>
<p>This application has failed to start because winsrv.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may&nbsp;fix this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see that it mentions a missing winsrv.dll file. &nbsp;You can replace that file using the XP Recovery Console. &nbsp;If that is your only problem, you will be able to boot and then figure out how the file came up missing in the first place. &nbsp;There are several
 files that if they are missing will report STOP: c0000135... Usually, it just takes a few minutes to get running again with these kinds of errors.</p>
<p>Sometimes various antivirus softwares will quarantine (effectively: delete) critical XP system files if it thinks the files are infected (maybe they really are).</p>
<p>You will not boot XP in any kind of mode if some of these files are missing.</p>
<p>Since you have had some action from other CDs, the HDD has been reformatted and an attempt was made to reinstall XP, it wounds a little iffy on what condition your system is in right now. &nbsp;You may have more problems than just a missing file. &nbsp;You may have
 to start all over with a format and reinstall.</p>
<p>Anywho, you should create a bootable XP Recovery Console CD and then you can usually just replace the file, but even that may not work out depending on the current conditions. &nbsp;I will give the same instructions I give when it is just a missing winsrv.dll
 file and you can see how that works out. &nbsp;It may not work out and somebody else may have some other ideas, but this is what I would do first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>

<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</p>
<p>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</p>
<p>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /r</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to
 be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When chkdsk /r completes without error, &nbsp;replace the missing/suspicious file.</p>
<p>The file you need to replace is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c:\windows\system32\winsrv.dll</p>
<p>Once you can get into Recovery Console, replace the file by copying the backup copy from this folder:</p>
<p>c:\windows\system32\dllcache</p>
<p>To do that, from the C:\WINDOWS prompt in Recovery Console you would enter this command:</p>
<p><strong>copy c:\windows\system32\dllcache\winsrv.dll &nbsp;c:\windows\system32</strong></p>
<p>Respond in the affirmative if asked to overwrite the existing file and then you should see a message that 1 file(s) was copied.</p>
<p>You just want to replace the mssing/suspicious file.</p>
<p>Remove the CD and enter the 'exit' command from the Recovery Console prompt to restart your system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD installed and if the CD is drive X, you can expand the file from the i386 folder on the genuine bootable XP installation CD into your c:\windows\system32 folder by entering this command:</p>
<p><strong>expand x:\i386\winsrv.dl_ &nbsp;c:\windows\system32\winsrv.dll</strong></p>
<p>Respond in the affirmative if asked to overwrite the existing file and then you should see a message that 1 file(s) was expanded.</p>
<p>Remove the CD and enter the 'exit' command from the Recovery Console prompt to restart your system.</p>

<p>I tried your suggestions and made a bootable cd and tried it in a computer that worked to test it and the cd worked fine. So now I tried to fix my laptop but with either cd, the one I made or the xp cd that came with the laptop i wasn't able to "boot from
 cd" laptop would always go right to the error message.At this point I thought the hard drive was shoot and i would need a new one. Then I thought of trying something totally different and it worked and I thought you might want to add it to your suggestion
 on this fix for future fixes. While going throught my cd case of cd's i found a xp cd but it was an early version it was xp home edition service pack 1, so i gave it a try and i was able to boot laptop from cd and get to the recovery console and do the chkdsk
 and copy the copy c:\windows\system32\dllcache\winsrv.dll. but it wouldn't let me add the expand file so i put the xp service pack 2 cd in and was able to boot from cd now so i recopied the copy file it copied but the expand file wouldn't it said it was a
 bad file path or something like that so i did the chkdsk and it found bad files i repeated it several times but same results so i had to format the hard drive and reinstall xp. laptop working fine now. Thank You for your help it got me pointed in the right
 direction i guess</p>

            Go to your start button go up to the top and click on your profile name/account then click "change account settings"<br />&gt; in the "your account" tab, just above your account picture there will be an option to select a button saying "log on using local account" or "change log on to local account" (something along these lines)<br />&gt; click this, and it will give you an opportunity to (from now on) log onto your computer using a new password that IS NOT linked to your Hotmail or Microsoft account.<br />You will not lose your information. <br />It does not delete files.

<h2>            computer turns on but wont boot or load bios, my screen acts like it isnt recieving any input from my pc</h2>
                    i just built a new pc and got &nbsp;it up and running on windows 10, while i was in the middle of playing a game on steam an error occured and the pc said &nbsp;it needed to restart after telling me error: DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (storport.sys). after my pc
 restarted i looked up the error and found it said it was due to driver errors, so i went and updated the faulty driver(my water cooler according to what i found at the time. it seemed to be working again for a few moments but then i got the bsod again with
 a different error code: KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED (storport.sys). not i can turn my pc on but neither bios or windows attempts to load. i have tried to connect different hdmi cords to them and even switched from using the hdmi port on my graphics card to
 my motherboards hdmi port but nothing i do seems to change anything. i even removed the graphics card to see if that would make a difference and still nothing. all the fans turn on and the water cooler seems to be working p

<p>&nbsp;im now back to an earlier version but now my issue is i can no longer boot using all four sticks of ram. i have individually checked all my ram and they all work. but when all four sticks are in, my computer no longer boots but works fine with 3 in any
 slot. any ideas what could cause this? or how i could fix this?</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 Issues with Connecting Monitor &#124; Randomly monitor switch off and on while on-game</h2>
                    <p>Xbox Fans Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having an issue that thought to post a threat, maybe someone has same or can assist, would highly appreciate input.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue :</p>
<p>
</p><p>Console: Xbox 360 Elite</p>
<p>Monitor: HP EliteDisplay E243M</p>
<p>
</p><p>While im gaming normally, the Monitor starts turning off and on by itself at random moments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting Done Already :</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I have tested connecting monitor to my laptop, no issues..... (so we can understand that issue is rising from the Microsoft Xbox 360 Console)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further testing needed :</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I have to change the HDMI Cable and see if the issue is from the HDMI Cable (i will try connect the HDMI Cable to the monitor and see if issue persist</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I will try to test different Power Socket too (on xbox and monitor)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Technical Evaluations :</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Maybe there is an issue with the Xbox 360 circuit board, mainly probably something is disconnecting and connecting again, probably deterioration with the connection of monitor to xbox, (i have the xbox for more then 5 years, im assuming its getting deteriorated)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any additional input ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you think is causing the issue ? did anyone encountered similar issues after using same console or similar after several years ? Do Xbox Circuit Boards run into hours of testing to see what is the lifespan of a console ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance, any input is highly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you see "no signal" on the monitor or it just turn off ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If no signal AND if the HDMI cable is ok , its 99.99 % sure that your HDMI out port from the console has a hardware issue.</p>
<p>If turn off AND no red lights on the console, its a sync issue / bad compatibility with the monitor &gt; So you should try the Xbox 360 on a tv ( not a pc monitor )</p>
<p>If red lights , check on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.xbox.com/support</a> and search the error code ( 1 / 2 / 3 or 4 red lights - Flashing … )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<h2>            How do I get Windows 8.1 Product Key after Downgrading to Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a computer that was giving the previous IT group trouble, and I'm stuck.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's an ASUS desktop running Windows 8.1, but was buggy. They didn't have a repair or recovery disk and no disk came with the computers as Windows 8.1 was preloaded. That means I have no access to the OEM Product Key. So their solution was to downgrade to
 Windows 7 because they had the software discs for Windows 7 and a set of Product Keys. They completely wiped the computer, so a brand new factory settings and Windows 7 OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a Windows 8.1 Recovery USB Drive, and I was wondering if I could use that to restore the computer to Windows 8 (without the Product Key because it's somewhere on the motherboard, but I'm afraid it has been deleted). I'm not sure this can work because
 the Operating System is no longer 8.1, but 7. The other option is to just install Windows 8.1, but I don't know where the Product Key is held.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>

 has to be running. So I'd like windows media player always running in backgroung, at least the dlna. is it possible?

            Sorry, I'm positive i didn't explain my problem in the right way. I use a dlna app on my phone, and it works properly. I love I can control my pc without touching it but to make it possible Windows Media Player must be running on my pc, so I have to open
 it before to use my dlna app. What I want is to make Windows Media Player running on my pc always as a service, in background, this way if my pc is on i can control it.

            if I don't launch windows media player I can enter my library and use my files, so I can play for example my music that is in my computer's hdd listening it from my phone, but I cant make my conputer play something using my phone as a controller. I'll
 make an example to make you understand because I know I'm not able to explain it in the right way.
<div>On my phone I installed skifta</div>
<div>It requires 3 teps:</div>
<div>- select the source</div>
<div>- select the player</div>
<div>- select the media from the source</div>
<div>easy</div>
<div>I select the source, it is not important which one</div>
<div>now I have to select the player</div>
<div>if windows media player is open i can select my pc, otherwise the pc is not included in the list.</div>
<div>this is not a skifta problem, it is this way using every dlna device and it is confirmed on microsoft website.</div>
<div>I selected everything in the flow menu in windows media player but it must be running to open the windows media player remote control, if you don't open it you can see your pc just as media source thanks of sharing settings in control panel.</div>

<div>If you are indeed trying to play to another computer/any computer, then yes, WMP</div>

<div>Group.</div>

            exactly, as I said I can select it as a source but not as a player if windows media player is not running and it seems stupid to me because if I have to go to the pc to open it I can select what I want from the pc directly instead to do it with my phone,
 I'm in front it to open wmp. If I put wmp in the startup group it opens the window directly so it works...but I have the window and if I close the window clicking on the x the remote control is again unavailable. What I want is it as a service, running in
 backgroung, it is posible to use my pc as a source, I can open and close everything but I'll have my shared folders and media because it is runnig as a service. I'm asking about the same thing but in the oppositive way. If I close the program (WMP) some services
 can still run. Many programs do it, if I close emule's window emules continue to work, skydrive works even if the app is close, Mail works, because the window is closed but services are open and in some cases you can see the service be

            WMP is not a device but a software inside a device, I don't think this analogy can work because as I said windows is an operative system walking toward smart, share and comunity and WMP is its official software for media services, and however it is like
 to say that skype is a device and if you close the window you don't receive messages, it is crazy, we are talking about a computer and what I'm asking is extremely easy and normal, especially in this period of informatic history where even phones have this
 kind of services. Anyway I understood it is not possible. I really suggest to microsoft to implement this service. I hope they will listen my requests and the requestes of other people.

<h2>            USB Ports slow to respond</h2>
                    <div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p>I have two servers and my laptop doing the same thing. The servers are Windows 2012 R2 and the laptop is Win 10.</p>
<p>I have test the portable drive to other computers and confirm that they are working OK.</p>
<p>When connecting those portable drives to my laptop or server, I will see them appear in File Explorer right away. If I try to open them, files explorer will either take up to 10 minutes to get them open or go Not Responding. If I leave it be, I am generally
 able to access after 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>At that point, if I want to do any transfer of files, speed is normal.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. 
<br />
<br />If those are all on the same network the cause for all could be the same.
<br />Are you running any 3rd party antivirus/security programs? This is the #1 cause of such issues.
<br />
<br />Also be sure all have the latest BIOS, chipset, and any USB support drivers.
<br />
<br />Best to check with Microsoft's TechNet where Server 2012 and connected nodes are supported.

    <title>Windows 8.1 Update stuck in loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> duncan cameron15a  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Update stuck in loop</h2>
                    <p>I have been away overseas for 2 months. Just got home, turned on my Asus Notebook running Windows 8.1, and it starting running Automatic Updates before I could even log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<strong>Keep your PC on until this is done.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Installing update 1 of 33...</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is now 8 and a quarter hours later and the message on the screen is the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would Microsoft please urgently advise how long Update 1 is going to take. Then how long are the other 32 updates going to take.</p>
<p>I would like to use my Notebook apps sometime in the near future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Comments on progress to date</p>
<p>No one really helped me.&nbsp; Responses 6 or 7 days later are useless. The so called Community appears to me to be a poor substitute for proper supplier product support.&nbsp; Given that it is 2014, not 1914, waiting for days for "support" is quite pathetic - no
 other business could get away with this lack of product support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft - you are taking your customers for granted. It is about time you lifted your game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if I will get a response to these comments. My guess is that maybe in 7 days time someone will give me "kudos" for speaking as it is.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In case you are still facing issues with installing update, I would recommend that you try the troubleshooting steps provided in the link below and check if they help in resolving the issue.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the computer is in no boot state then try to boot to recovery options using Windows 8 CD/DVD. Please avoid performing<strong> "Refresh your PC"
</strong>which is provided as Method 4 in the above article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know the status of the issue, so that we can assist you further.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply Naman</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately the system finally freed itself from its system monopolising embrace. After many hours I believe the update was completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be a good idea for Microsoft&nbsp;to advise customers that the update or upgrade will take a huge amount of time before they get stuck I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this computer was used for mission critical business processes I would have been absolutely dismayed that a supplier of software could treat me this way. Not that I am happy about it anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would remind Microsoft that customers buy their products to do stuff - not play system engineers - that for you guys to do</p>

You may need special tools like <strong>Lotus Notes Repair Kit </strong>&nbsp;to undelete the file, if it is possible at all: a Notes database, when not properly handled, gets easily corrupted. One missing block and the file is beyond repair.

<p><span>Next time, make a backup before doing anything drastic... Maybe something on an older backup?</span></p>

<p>Type in the following in the command prompt:</p>
<p>dism /online /cleanup-image /spsuperseded</p>

                    Had a call from one of these scammers today.&nbsp; He was relentless.&nbsp; I was suspicious from the start, somehow not having heard of this scam.&nbsp; While on the phone with him, I "googled" (sorry Microsoft) the URL he gave me AMMYY.com, as well as "unsolicited
 calls from MS".&nbsp; Got the guy off the phone under the guise of an emergency, but not after getting a number for the guy that I could call him back at.&nbsp; 210-888-0671.&nbsp; Is there no legal recourse that can be taken with these ****-#oles?&nbsp;

            <p>hi</p>
<p>it is a SCAM</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>they want either money from you for worthless programs&nbsp;or to do an identity theft on you to get even more money&nbsp;and get your internet banking passwords and credit card information by getting you to download software from them to "fix" or "test" your computer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<u>Microsoft does not make unsolicited phone calls to help you fix your computer</u>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this scam cybercriminals call you and claim to be from Microsoft Tech Support. They offer to help solve your computer problems. Once the crooks have gained your trust, they attempt to steal from you and damage your computer with malicious software including
 viruses and spyware.</p>
<p>Although law enforcement can trace phone numbers, perpetrators often use pay phones, disposable cellular phones, or stolen cellular phone numbers. It's better to avoid being conned rather than try to repair the damage afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>Treat all unsolicited phone calls with skepticism. Do not provide any personal information.</strong></p>
<p>If you receive an unsolicited call from someone claiming to be from Microsoft Tech Support, hang up. We do not make these kinds of calls.</p>
<p>If you think you might be a victim of fraud, you can report it. For more information, see:

            Hi Ande.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Power off for 30 minutes to give it a reset, then power up and see if it continues or rolls back.  If not take note of the key on first screen to press while powering up to run Factory Recovery - e.g. on HP it's ESC or F11.  You can report back your PC maker and we'll find it for you.  
<br />
<br />Otherwise use whichever method works here to access Advanced Startup Options:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />Try running a Startup Repair, System Restore or if those fail do a Reset.  
<br />
<br />You may need to create bootable media to access these repairs, reset or even do the vastly superior Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.
<br />
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair your Computer, then from Advanced Troubleshoot Options try Startup Repair, System Restore, or go back to Troubleshoot options to try Reset.  
<br />
<br />If those fail choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Ande,
<br />
<br />New PC's generally have a lot of updating to do, the manufacturers load a new PC from an image that is sometimes up to 2 years out of date . . .
<br />
<br />Have a look at the hard drive activity LED on the casing of your PC
<br />
<br />If there is intermittent hard drive activity, then Windows is still applying updates
<br />
<br />If there is no hard drive activity, press and hold the Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down
<br />
<br />Then start your new PC again . . .       
        </p>

<p>Why on Earth would Microsoft release for Xbox One FNR4 (2009) instead of the more advanced and more recent FNC (2011)&nbsp;? I'm really curious about this choice.</p>

<p>I don't even know if EA already shut down FNR4 servers on Xbox 360 (I sold this old title a long time ago).</p>
<p>Will it have online multiplayer on Xbox One? If not, I won't get it.</p>

<h2>            MS Lumia 950XL Mobile Phone Issues &#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p><span>25-Aug-16</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>I'm on the my second Microsoft Lumia 950XL Mobile Phone the first one had to be returned as MS Outlook would not work and returned an error code:<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>0x80072efd my current phone also has the same issue and MS are unable to fix it !!</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I'm very close to sending this phone back and getting my money back.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Microsoft has been the worst company I have ever had to deal with for fixing the numerous issues I have had with this mobile phone.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Using Microsoft Support Centre you just get the run around and then told that ".... it’s outside of their technical knowledge base ...." then they transfer you, and you have to repeat everything all over again.</span></span></p>

<p><span>Was told by Microsoft that I needed to reset my phone to factory settings and this would fix the issue, and all my Desktop, Calendar, e-mails, Contacts, etc. information would be backed up - This
 is just not true, if you reset to factory settings be warned you will lose all your calendar information, a lot of your contacts will disappear, your apps may go to pending and take ages to reinstate, bottom line is it will probably take a least a couple of
 hours to get back to where you were before this !</span></p>

<p><span><span>I'm a great fan of the Windows 10 mobile phone but this one has really pushed me to my limit with time wasted talking to Microsoft running into weeks, and some of the stuff they expect
 you to do would give a computer programmer a headache.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>It’s almost like nobody has tested the Beta version of this product thoroughly before it was released, or if they have they were not using it the way

<p><span><span>Microsoft is a big multinational company making huge profits, and letting their loyal Windows phone customers down by not supplying a reliable product and product support service especially
 for the Lumia 950XL phone.<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>Also they are trying to get more money out their customers by not letting you buy the product but having to pay yearly subscriptions !</span></span></p>

<p><span>Not good enough Microsoft get on the case, set-up a department to deal with all these issues

            <p>Hi ! You are not the only one who have had problems with your Windows /Microsoft Phone .</p>
<p>I went true the same with my Microsoft Lumia 950XL phone .First of all . Due to earlier negative experience with Microsoft Store . Especially the Microsoft Support team in Norway . The Norwegian
</p>
<p>support team in Oslo did not take notice to any of my " scream for help " seriously .&nbsp;Let me add .There are&nbsp;a few employees at the&nbsp;Oslo office who&nbsp;should be rewarded for their support&nbsp;. Employees who answered my&nbsp;phone calls and fixed my problems in matter
 of minutes . I ordered my 950XL phone from my phone operator . My first 950XL phone was in use for 2 weeks before the phone almost catch fire .</p>
<p>I plugged in the battery charger for max . 3 minutes .The smell of melted plastic and the smoke got me to act and unplug instantly . I handed in my phone for service at the local phone operator's outlet . 2 weeks later I got my phone back . To my surprise
 I was given a brand new phone . The consumer laws in Norway protect the customers for any expenses in cases like this . Earlier this summer I got my phone blocked for 3 weeks by Microsoft . According to the message on my screen . I had tried to log in with
 wrong pin too many times . Please log in with your Microsoft Hello pin . A service I never had used or activated on my phone . This time I got some help from members of Windows Insider , I also received a mail from Microsoft that confirmed that my phone had
 been blocked . I sent Lumia Help India a tweet about my problem . They answered me back 1-2 hours later with an attachment to how I could unlock my phone . It turned out that a soft restart not worked to unlock my Phone. I did a last attempt to get Help from
 MS - support in Norwegian via chatt with MS online. The operator gave me the same instruction I had tried before . The highlight from the chatt was when I got the question " Have your phone been in use at all ? " Got a mail or two from Microsoft the two days
 that followed . I gave up , and had no other options than use option 2 . Hard reset . that would erase all content , photo , apps , contacts and more . I tried to execute a Hard reset the next days . No reaction at all on my command .My problem was solved
 when Microsoft rolled out their updates for Windows 10 and Windows 10 phones . Finally . A Hard reset took care of the problem . And I was lucky enough to get back some of the lost content I had to delete . Who was to blame for the troubles I encountered ?&nbsp;
 It was 100 % my self who caused my troubles. When you sign up for Windows Insider you are responsible for that things like this can happen .</p>

<p>Hi Ella,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would like to isolate this issue that you're having right now with your device Bluetooth. Have you checked the device manufacturer site for any compatible driver for Windows 10? &nbsp;Have you performed any troubleshooting that I might be aware of? What is
 the current build and version of your OS? You can check it by pressing the <strong>
Windows </strong>key + R and type <strong>winver</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will wait for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards/</p>

<p>Hi Leviozar.</p>
<p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>Yes. I checked with Dell. They told me to download and install the driver R226746.exe.</p>
<p>But when I tried to install, Windows gave an error message, that the driver is not compatible with my version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>It says Windows Version 10.0 build 10240.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Thank you for your response. Let's try to run the troubleshooter on the Settings first and see if this can help us in resolving the issue. You can follow the steps provided from our support site on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/14169/windows-10-fix-bluetooth-problems-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.&nbsp; On the support site given on the link, follow the instruction on the option "<strong>How can I try to
 automatically fix common Bluetooth problems?</strong>". </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we have to get a driver that will be compatible on your device. By the way, what is your previous OS before you install Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Problems with adding additional Keyboards in Windows 10 - biblical - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david_c_ray  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with adding additional Keyboards in Windows 10 - biblical Greek&#47;Hebrew</h2>
                    <p>Hi All.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Windows Vista until recently and enjoyed using keyboard maps from third party providers which enabled easy inputting of biblical Greek and Hebrew from providers such as Tyndale House, Society for Biblical Languages and Logos, which are
 designed with an input map suitable for English speakers:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.tyndale.cam.ac.uk/unicode</p>
<p>https://www.sbl-site.org/educational/BiblicalFonts_FAQ.aspx</p>
<p>https://www.logos.com/support/logos5/windows/keyboards</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded and installed the keyboards on the computer. &nbsp;When I attempt to assign them to the standard Windows Hebrew and Greek languages by removing the 'standard' keyboards (control panel/languages/change your language preferences/options/remove),
 Windows 10 lists these additional keyboards (without being able to preview them) when I drop the standard Windows keyboard off (which is not so useful for inputting), the language disappears completely from the language bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Is there a way of using these third party keyboards with Windows 10?</p>
<p>b) If not, is there a way of adjusting the input maps of the 'standard' windows keyboards?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in anticipation</p>
<p>
</p><p>David</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

            Perhaps not yet but seems that would be something including in future updating of Windows 10. I say this because at least Windows 10 is recognizing the keyboards you uploaded.

            I'm glad you got the SBL keyboards working. &nbsp;I ended up using the Logos keyboards, although the formatting is different. &nbsp;The bonus is that they come with a reasonable instruction manual, so if I really want to know how to type something I can. &nbsp;All the
 best with it.l

                    When I boot up in Windows 10, the keyboard and mouse don't work, and all that is displayed on the screen are background photo, time and date and the icon in the lower left showing no wireless connection. I cannot get into safe mode. By doing a hard power
 off and power on and pressing F12, I run diagnostics and it passes (didn't do memory test). Can't get into Safe Mode by pressing F8 during power up. I'm at a loss as to what to do next.

            I cannot run the <strong>Hardware and Devices troubleshooter </strong>because the PC is not accepting keyboard input by pressing the
<strong>Windows logo +X</strong><br />

<p>Thank you for the reply. We've already tried multiple troubleshooting steps and the same issue still persists. In this case, let's try to troubleshoot the issue by using different keyboard and mouse, connect it to all available USB port of your computer
 regardless if it's desktop or laptop. Then, check if you are able to enter <strong>
safe mode</strong> or run the <strong>Hardware and Devices troubleshooter. </strong>
If the issue still persist, contact the manufacturer of your Windows-based computer, there's a possibility that it's a hardware issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response. </p>
