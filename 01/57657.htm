<h2>            Inconsistant CPU loading data from Task Manager</h2>
                    I am running Vista Home Premium 32 bit, Service pack 2 with the latest patches. My system has a dual core Intel processor. I have noticed an inconsistency in the CPU loading data from the task manager. Viewing the processes under the proces tab shows the
 System Idle Process&nbsp;is at about 80-85%. However, the CPU Usage shown at the bottom of the task manager is about 45-50%.&nbsp; When I observe the system performance with the Performance Monitor (Computer management &gt; &nbsp;Reliability and performance &gt; Monitoring tools
 &gt; Performance monitor) it shows <br />
&nbsp;% Processor time = 50-55% (About 45% privileged mode and 5% user mode)<br />
&nbsp;% Idle time = 45-50%<br />
<br />
What could be causing the inconsistency between the task manager reported system idle process and the CPU usage? Is the system idle process information displayed in the task manager accurate for multi-core processors?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you. &nbsp;

            I have a dual core (AMDx64) with Vista Home Premium 64 bit&nbsp;service Pack 2&nbsp;and my numbers seem to match...~75% Idle 25%Total processor time in&nbsp;Perfmon, the same in Task Manager.<br />
I don't know if the 32 vs 64 bit or Intel vs AMD is part of the difference or not.<br />
<br />
The System Idle Time, Processor Time&nbsp;(and all the other parameters) in Performance Monitor can be&nbsp; displayed for each processor or as a total. They are labled instance 0 and 1 and total.&nbsp;Are all the % you&nbsp;quoted for the totals?<br />
<br />
Also try adjusting the "Update Speed" in the view tab of task manager and the "Duration" entry in the box at the bottom of the Perfmon graph. The usage numbers may be showing different due to the sampleing and averageing rates being way different between the
 two programs.<br />
<br />
Still the 125% total&nbsp;&nbsp;in Task Manager sure looks strange in your case.&nbsp;I don't see how Idle plus Usage&nbsp;(or anything else)&nbsp;could go over 100%.

<div>Hi,<br />
<br />
<p>Windows-based operating systems, such as Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows 2003, Windows XP, and Windows Vista use the generic host process svchost.exe or Service Host process for services that run from DLLs or Dynamic Host Libraries. As the svchost.exe
 processes can run multiple services, there can be multiple sessions of the process running on your system at the same time-with each svchost.exe consuming different amounts of CPU resources and memory. This is the reason why svchost.exe is associated with
 several PC problems such as 100% CPU usage problems, memory error, and excessive power utilization.</p>
<p>Although svchost.exe is usually detected to be the culprit that is eating up your system’s resource, it does not cause much damage. Because, in reality, svchost.exe is just a holder process for other services running on your system. For instance, virus,
 spyware, adware or Trojan programs may hide behind the svchost.exe process and consume a large amount of CPU and memory resources. This is the reason why when you open the Process tab of your Task Manager, you may see the svchost.exe process creating 100%
 CPU usage problems on your system.</p>
<p><em>Note: To open Task Manager, press the Ctrl + Alt + Del combination keys.</em></p>
<p>If on Windows Vista system, you are unable to view the svchost.exe process listed on the Processes tab of Task Manager window, and still your system is showing high CPU usage, then perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the<strong> Show processes from all users</strong> button. </li><li>In the User Account Control dialog box that opens, select the <strong>Continue</strong> button.
</li><li>Now, you will be able to see several svchost.exe processes running on the system and you may notice one of them consuming high CPU resources.
<p>Next, in order to find out the service that is behind the svchost.exe process and is consuming higher CPU or memory resources, you need to do the following:</p>
</li><li>Once you have located the svchost.exe service that is causing the problem, right-click on it, and select
<strong>Go to Service(s)</strong>. </li><li>Doing this, will open the Services tab in which some of the services will be highlighted. These highlighted services will be the ones that are associated with the problematic svchost.exe process.
</li><li>After you have identified the services that are causing the svhost.exe process to eat up system resources, you can carefully go through them and determine the service that might be causing the problem.
</li><li>When you have determined the suspected service, first ensure that no other services or processes rely on this service, then right-click on it and select Stop Service. You can also stop the service by opening the Services Management Console from the Control
 Panel. </li></ol>

            Yes, yes, thank you for your replies! Unfortunately none of the suggestions have resulted in any improvement and I am still unable to get Media Player to work as intended. I have tried 3 different fixits (or at least 3 different file names...in truth they
 all do the same things and are the same size files so despite the different names I don't see that there is any difference)<br />
MicrosoftFixit.WinMediaPlayer.RNP.78254155505871502.1.1.Run.exe<br />
MicrosoftFixit.WinMediaPlayer.FISC.78254068654235843.1.1.Run.exe<br />
MicrosoftFixit.WinMediaPlayer.FISC.78254070866274481.1.2.Run.exe<br />
Me thinks the problem is other than any of the issues addressed by these repairs! I have also uninstalled and reinstalled WMP as per instructions without any different results.<br />
Any additional ideas?<br />

            <p>Here is how I solved the issue for myself:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that you moved your Windows 7 NTUser.DAT file to your Windows 10 enviornment when you upgraded. Assuming that you are an administrator in your Windows 10 system, create a new user and give that user administrative access. This can be done from
 a Command Prompt by typing:&nbsp;<strong>net user &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt; /add</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you create the new user, make it an administrator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sign in with the new user account and this problem will not be present. However, as stated earlier in this thread, you will not carry ALL your stuff over like photos, email, documents, cookies, favorites and the like. I can however, slowly migrate my stuff
 to the new user account and start using it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had another idea of deleting the ntuser.dat file and allowing Windows 10 to rebuild it, but that would cause other issues as well, minor, but still...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have yet to experiment with deleting the NTUser.dat file and allowing the system to create a new one, but I suspect that this will not fix the issue for the account that I brought over from Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you choose close at the bottom it will save the changes, if just click the (X) at the top right it shouldn't save the changes, if it does save the changes, and you don't remember what the setting was, mine is set on microsoft office outlook, if that helps.</p>
<p>I'll add that you can also just use system restore to an earlier time to correct the mishap.</p>

<p>This would work I see but now the problem is : Under the recomended program it lists Windows Contacts.</p>
<p>So I clicked the browse button and Im not sure what other file to put it under.</p>
<p>I dont have Microsoft Outlook. I dont think this program was associated with any program until</p>
<p>I made that check mark. Seems like if you check something you could just uncheck it.</p>
<p>Anyway is the V card a bad thing does it give away any of your personal info?</p>

<p>Unless you made a contacts folder in your email account it would not exist,</p>
<p>The way you make a contacts folder, is to open your email account, click on options and then click on more options in the list, now look for export contacts, in the customizing your contacts area at the bottom, export contacts is listed, click it and it
 should ask you a couple of options, but it will make a file of all of your contacts or just personal....follow the prompt and take note of the name of the folder or file it creates.</p>
<p>I wouldn't worry about correcting the file extension. if you ever do upgrade office word with outlook it will correct the file extension for you.</p>
<p>Odd about system restore though ?</p>
<p>It's more complicated but maybe look into this tool to fix corrupt windows files,</p>

    <title>Dell XPS15 L502X Keyboard not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garywilliams945  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell XPS15 L502X Keyboard not working</h2>
                    Since the November 2018 Windows 10 update my laptop keyboard will not always work. It appears to be only the top row (q-p) that doesn't work sometimes. I have read various articles and tried updating drivers and uninstalling reinstalling the keyboard without
 any success. I know that Dell doesn't support windows 10 on this model due to its age but mine is still lightening fast and exactly what I need. Does anyone have any suggestions other than using an external keyboard ( that works fine by the way) that I can
 try to resolve this issue?&nbsp;

            Hi GaryWilliams945 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor.  
<br />
<br />Let's first rule out whether the keyboard hardware is an issue or not. Can you use Keyboard tester and press keys to see if the keys are working correctly or not? If keys work as intended, then problem is not the hardware of Keyboard.

            Tested on there no issues but this time when I have logged on all keys are currently working. Will restart laptop until keyboard gives error as in my original message it only happens sometimes but is random and can be working ok when I log on but stops
 when been working for awhile.

<p>I have had the error again and tried the keyboard checker and the keys that didn't work failed on the keyboard checker however when I closed the keyboard checker and tried the keyboard again all keys again worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read various articles that state there is an issue with drivers despite toubleshooter showing that the best driver is installed. Dell do not have a windows 10 keyboard driver for the XPS L502x.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply, IE 11 is now working properly, I'm not&nbsp;sure which of the two things, I did,&nbsp;corrected the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Uninstalled <strong>Auto Resolution LG Elect</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Reinstalled <strong>WinZip System Utilities Suite</strong> (which I had uninstalled thinking it may have&nbsp;caused the problem)&nbsp;and performed a scan which found and made some corrections.</p>

</p><p>I have a group of individuals&nbsp;who prefer Skype vs Skype for Business as their preferred&nbsp;method of communication.&nbsp; One of the users asked me to see if there was a way to get Outlook to share meeting/busy status based&nbsp;on the calendar with Skype(Consumer) as
 it does with Skype for Business. I wanted to see if Microsoft has an add-in that would enable this feature.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I want to play The legend of Korra game SOOOOO&nbsp;BADDDDD, however it has been removed from purchase on the Microsoft store, and everywhere else that I have looked so I could play it. Ultimately I am a dissatisfied customer at this point in time and hope this post will spark them to bring the game back, even for just a little while, so I can purchase it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 just won&#39;t install updates after restart&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zer0prime  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 just won&#39;t install updates after restart&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My computer keeps forcing me to restart in order to install updates, which isn't a problem at all, except for the fact that it just won't install them. It schedules the restart about 15 minutes after I turn my computer on, so I get to use my computer for
 around 15-20 minutes and then it restarts again. Repeat ad nauseam. I can't even schedule the update to a later time because in the settings, the option to do so is greyed out. It's pretty freaking annoying, to say at the least.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried just about everything, and nothing's worked. I've clean booted my computer and tried to install the updates, I ran the Windows update troubleshooter (which said it fixed something, but it didn't work.), I've even tried just using the "Update and
 restart" option in the start menu in the hopes that it would work, but nothing has so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition since I've clean booted it, it won't go back to a normal startup... When I go into msconfig and try to set it back to a normal startup and click OK, it just closes out of msconfig and does nothing. I also tried to use the Windows update troubleshooter
 again and it said "A problem is preventing the troubleshooter from starting.". I guess these aren't huge problems for now, but I thought I might as well put them out there, haha.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've tried that, by the time I get to "ren C:\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old" it doesn't allow me to do that for some reason. I'm not totally sure if that would like, cause a major problem or something so I didn't restart my computer and I
 went back and undid the rest of that (started everything back up in command prompt that I stopped).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>             &#34;Error applying security&#34; when changing ownership of folders</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: <span>Downloaded photos from a camera is unable to view by multiple users other than the owner</span></p>
<p>I downloaded photos from my digital camera to my Windows 7 PC to a folder created under C: drive.&nbsp; I use Picasa to download the photos.</p>
<p>Once the photos are downloaded, I am unable to view the photos if I sign as a different user other than the one who downloaded the photos.&nbsp; Even though the folder under the C: Drive has all the necessary access for all the users, I am unable to view it.&nbsp;
 Only option I have is to change the security for each of the files and not at the folder level.</p>
<p>Tried changing the owner of the folder, but got an error "Error applying security" for the files.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated</p>

<p><span>Hey MouliViswanathan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try taking ownership of the whole folder from command prompt.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s how:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)</span></span><span>Go to &gt; Start &gt;
 All Programs &gt; Accessories.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)</span></span><span>Right-click on Command
 Prompt, and then click Run as Administrator.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)</span></span><span>To take ownership
 of a folder, type the following command and press ENTER:</span></p>
<p><span>takeown /f &lt;foldername&gt; /r /d y</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)</span></span><span>Then to assign the&nbsp;<strong>Administrators</strong>
 group Full Control Permissions for the folder, use this syntax:</span></p>
<p><span>icacls<span>&lt;foldername&gt;</span> /grant administrators:F /T</span></p>
<p><span>The&nbsp;<strong>/T</strong> parameter is added so that the operation is carried out through all the sub-directories and files within that folder.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)</span></span><span>To know more information
 about the above commands, run these commands from a Command Prompt window.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>takeown /?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>icacls /?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>That should be it.</span></p>

 not significant.</p>

I don't know what you might have smoked since responded to this thread seven months ago but judging by your prose it appears to be pretty potent stuff. Can I order some from you?

    <title>surface Pro 2 Power Supply - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timimarley  say:</h3>
<h2>            surface Pro 2 Power Supply</h2>
                    I replaced my Surface Pro 2 power supply 3 times before I gave up and decided to purchase a Surface Pro 4 thinking that Microsoft figured out how to make a better power cord by now. I'm now on my 3rd cord for THAT machine! When I was looking up info to
 purchase my FORTH SP4 cord, I saw you were replacing the SP2 cords so I submitted an order for replacement thinking I can now use my SP2 until I can buy the 4th cord for the SP4. Imagine my suprise when I received only half the cord and not the half I need.
 I need a full SP2 cord but Microsoft isn't willing to give the other part and will only sell it for $80! I have no question except why will Microsoft NOT stand behind their products and lost a customer over it? I buy a new computer for myself on my birthday
 (a few weeks away) and I will now be an Apple customer.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I think the problem there is that unlike the other cord, the one that you (and I both) need is permanently attached to the charger, so we need new chargers, not just new cords.&nbsp; I have looked (and pulled a bit) at the attachment on that side but I don't
 think it is removable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The real problem is that there is no other way to charge.&nbsp; E.g. I think we should at least be able to charge via the USB port but that would be useful and usable (and replaceable by generic products).&nbsp;&nbsp; ; ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately I can use the one that came with my Surface RT but it is quite a nuisance having to switch back and forth to keep two devices charged.&nbsp; At least the RT doesn't have to be charged as much as the Pro, especially since W10 1607 came out.</p>
