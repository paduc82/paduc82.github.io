<h2>            Xbox elite controller series 2 built in battery</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone actually want a built in battery?&nbsp;</p>
<p>What pros are there to having a built in lithium as apposed to the usual play and charge kits? The play and charge kits probably last 40 hours as is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a $200 controller I hate the idea that you are buying something that really is only meant to last 3 years. Especially as I just replaced a play and charge battery in my controller I've had since launch of xbone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without sounding like a typical whinger saying I won't buy it unless they change this. I am genuinely asking if there are actually any pros to a built in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not like a phone where making it built in they get to reduce the formfactor of the controller. It is still the same size. And I'm sure there's plenty of empty space in there still.&nbsp;</p>

            Just one more reason not to buy it (I'm agreeing with you).&nbsp; It's more reliance on MS to have to fix it when (not if) it breaks.

            I like the idea of the controller overall. It just means that the battery will get drained out and then it would be a wired elite controller.

            I never had an elite but besides any other pros or cons i would get the V2 just cause hate having to swap batteries and them being able to charge in case will make it very convenient for me as well as protected from the elements lol

            It really just depends on how good the battery is, If it is as good as the play and charge battery then it should be fine.&nbsp;

    <title>Surface Keyboard keeps disconnecting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Keyboard keeps disconnecting</h2>
                    I have a surface keyboard, for my Surface laptop 2(?) when I plug it into my dock. It works fine for the most part, but from time to time the keyboard complete disconnects from my laptop, The Surface Keyboard is unresponsive (the cap lock light or other
 lights won't turn on either or activate), When I go to Bluetooth devices in my setting I can still see the keyboard connected and paired. I usually have to unpair/forget device, then re-pair it for it to work again, its not a BIG issue, but it is still annoying.
 I also don't think its the keyboard, My friend has the same keyboard and we switched for a few days, and it didn't happen to him at all but it still happened to me. I have done some various things like uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers, as well as
 updating them. I've set the computer to be discover-able as well as I read that could help. Anyone have any ideas?&nbsp;

</p><p>Thank you so much for responding in the community forums about your issue. We are very sorry for the inconvenience. As far as you described it and isolate the problem, the issue is leaning to the device since your keyboard (1) Did work to your friends device
 (2) Your device is not working on the same keyboard of your friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for clarification, we would like to clarify if your friends device is also a surface device and if so We would like to know both of the devices Operating System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Gen&nbsp;</p>

<p>I encounter problems with my clear type keyboard.</p>
<p>When the battery of Surface Pro is drained and 0%, after I plug the charger, it starts and the keyboard is working.</p>
<p>After the battery is charged, I shut down the tablet, then I restart and the keyboard is not working.</p>
<p>Be advised, I contacted Microsoft and I was asked to restore and I did so.</p>

 anyway. A screen came up asking me to select OK. I didnt click Ok I just closed it. If I select OK on that screen am I going to be bombarded with Feedback requests or is this option for something entirely different?</span>

<p>
</p><p>The feedback icon that appears on your desktop could be a possible notification prompt. This may indicate a pending action that needs to be taken care of. For us to confirm the item, could you attach a screenshot of the icon prompt on your next post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, check the status of your account under <em><strong>Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Your info</strong></em> to confirm if there's a pending action that needs to be done on your user account.</p>
<p>

<p>1. Someone has found a way to gain access to my outlook account and send out weird emails with dodgy attachments. My account was duly blocked.&nbsp;When trying to unblock it I found out that a rule was created, according to which all incoming and outgoing emails
 were directly sent to the folder Deleted. This Rules have been removed and the password for outlook was changed several times. The account is now unblocked but I was urged to perform a malware scan on my notebook, in order to exclude potential local security
 breach.</p>

<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>2. I used Microsoft Safety Scanner to identify potentially malicious files and malware on my notebook. Indeed, a malware was found - MacTray. According to the scan results the malware files were 'partially removed' by the scanner program. Additionally, I
 have deleted the respectively named files from their pertinent locations and also removed them from the Startup category in System Config. Nevertheless, I performed two more searches with Microsoft Safety Scanner - one finished just now - and I keep getting
 the same results - malware found out and 'partially removed'. Please advise me how I can finally get rid of these malware files for good?</p>

This is a controversial topic, but your choice of AV software may be something you want to take a 2nd look at.&nbsp; I suggest you visit this web site to get a sense of which AV software does the best job, depending on what kind of user you are:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.av-comparatives.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.av-comparatives.org/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
 This is a non-profit that has been around for a long time and I trust their results.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their latest report:&nbsp;The chart on page 3 is the most demonstrative of the differences.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.av-comparatives.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/avc_factsheet2018_03.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.av-comparatives.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/avc_factsheet2018_03.pdf</a></p>

<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
When you interpret these results, keep in mind the difference between a product that detects 95% and another 99% of infections, is actually 5 times more likely to allow an infection.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>

I have good reason for this. Over the years and hundreds of PCs, I‚Äôve learned a lesson well.&nbsp; That it is very difficult to diagnose and fix the problem(s) when components of an Internet Security product are actively working to prevent that diagnosis.&nbsp; The software
 sees the technician (me in this case) as a threat.&nbsp; I discovered that if I uninstalled that software, I am able to much more likely and&nbsp;quickly discover an fix the problem.&nbsp; Antivirus ONLY products do not behave like this.</p>

</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
The other components in these IS products (other than the AV itself) cause more problems than any benefit they bring and mostly work by shutting down the Windows component that does a very good job of that particular task anyway.</p>

Most of the big name suppliers much prefer to sell their all-in products because they can sell them for a higher price.&nbsp; Some do not offer an antivirus-only product.&nbsp; Some push their all in ones and still sell the AV only product, but you may have to look for

<p>Thanks a lot for the comprehensive comment and the suggestions! It all makes a lot of sense, although - to be honest - I feel a bit more confused than before :) The reason - I am not really a tech guy but just a regular user. Still, it feels very uncomfortable
 to realize how vulnerable one is if not competent enough, so I will make sure to get smarter and do so quickly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your advice, I will look for options and act accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last but not least - if you would recommend one particular AV only program against malware of the kind described above, which one would it be?</p>

<h2>            Change Win10 single language version</h2>
                    <p>I bought a laptop in China. It has Win10 single Chinese language. Can I somehow exchange it to Win10 single Russian/English version? I don't need to upgrade it to Home or Pro, I need same single language, but my native language or english. Otherwise I have
 to upgrade it to Pro for crazy amount of money just to be able to operate it normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or maybe if I pay less I can change one version of single language to another one. It's also fine. I just don't need Pro, I need same thing in my own language. My chinese is not that good to be comfortable with chinese version of windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately I tried this as well and it didn't work for me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I press the button Set as default, it says - only one language can be applied, and than that button becomes inactive. I also try to do the same through the "old" Control Panel and when language pack is trying to be installed it says - in this version
 of windows you cannot change language. I can send you screenshots of all that if you need, though it's in chinese. Let me know if screenshots can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe it's because it's Single Language version. But there should be a way to change it since I have a license one and I'm not able to used it (because of the language barrier).<br />

<h2>            Deactivating Windows 7 Licence then reactivating on different computer&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
Earlier this week, i bought a new PC without an operating system to replace my old laptop. at christmas 2009, i got a Windows 7 Home Premium upgrade package for my laptop.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This was retail and not OEM</span>. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
It also isnt the family package</span>. <br />
<br />
My problem is, i would like to deactivate windows on my laptop and put it back to the OEM vista home basic, and put the Windows 7 home premium Licence key onto my new computer. Also, i have installed win 7 already and then upgraded on top of that to avoid the
 error of "the licence is intended for upgrading". <br />
<br />
Will this work with these steps:<br />
<br />
1. Restore laptop to vista basic OEM<br />
2. Activate windows 7 HP on new comp.<br />

You can not use the Upgrade version on the computer with no OS. You need a Full version.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a qualifying version of Windows to upgrade from with a genuine license for the new computer you would need the Full version of Windows 7.

OEM computer manufacturers are required to provide at least one way for you to reinstall Windows if you buy a computer with Windows preinstalled - your computer should have included either a restore partition on your hard drive, or Windows install/restore disks.
 ÔªøMost computer manufacturers also have a feature to make your own install disks.<br />
<br />
If the restore partition is still there and was not removed, it will reinstall Windows 7. There is usually a prompt when you first start the computer telling you what key to press to start the restoreÔªø - check your manual if you're not sure how to. If you have
 install disks - insert them, restart and boot from them to start the reinstall process. Reinstalling will remove any personal files on the computer, back them up first.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Contact the OEM computer manufacturer and ask them to send you an install disk for your computer - they may or may not do it. If they agree to send you one they may charge a small fee.

You are violating the EULA if you install Windows 7 Upgrade with out a qualifying Windows license.<br />
<br />
<br />
Windows 7 EULA:<br />
<br />
15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use the
 software you upgraded from. <br />

If you have trouble activating Windows 7 you can call Microsoft to activate by doing the following:
<br />
1. With Windows running click Start, then in the Search box type:&nbsp; slui.exe 4 <br />

<h2>            How do I update my Recovery Partition to Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to 10 with the free Windows 10 update.&nbsp; If at some point I have hardware or software&nbsp;problems, I may have to&nbsp;go back to 8.1 using the current&nbsp;recovery partition.&nbsp; Then to return&nbsp;to Windows 10 would&nbsp;require another update which
 probably won't be free by then (and be kind of a hassle installing), so how do I update the recovery partition to 10 to avoid a lot of trouble?

    <title>Extremely low microphone volume - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mariuszwysocki1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Extremely low microphone volume</h2>
                    <p>Since version 1803 I'm facing issues with my microphone. As mentioned in the title, the volume is EXTREMELY low, to the point that holding it further than 1cm from the mouth made me almost inaudible on skype or discord. The microphone is zalman zm1. Tried
 several others, the issue remained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it was plugged into Xonar DX I had no access to enhancement tab and boost. The drivers are custom, so the issue is not caused by new drivers changing anything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the time being I plugged the microphone into the motherboard in order to use the boost. However, this is not a solution because boost is artificial and significantly reduces the quality.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any fix to this issue? Pretty much every topic on the matter concludes with "plug into the motherboard, 30db boost and that's it" which is ridiculous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried newest realtek drivers as well as old drivers from Asus for my motherboard, both fail to resolve the issue.

            That is strange, since Cumulative Updates usually averages around 1 GBs or less. 
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is installed? See how to verify:

<br />
<br />You can also try installing it manually:

<p>Thanks. The version was 1607. I as able to install the update manually. </p>
<p>
</p><p>One segment was about 1 1/4 GB; the others much smaller. But when the automatic updater was trying to update, I got an error message telling me that I needed at least 8 GB of storage to run the update. I encounter the same issue with every update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have the computer set to update automatically. It should not cause such problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, each update fills my hard drive a little more. It is now 26 GB MOST of which has been added by updates. (Yes, I delete all downloads and empty the recycle bin.)</p>

            Hi LightYagami1 
<br />
<br />That is a 2nd Gen Intel i3 processor (either the i3-2105 or i3-2125), if you have Intel HD graphics 3000
<br />
<br />The problem you will have is Intel HD graphics 3000 is not supported on Windows 10 version 1803 or 1809, if you are going to install Windows 10, you should install version 1703 which would be stable with your hardware setup . . .
<br />
<br />If you do decide to upgrade to Windows 10 version 1703, this is the video driver you will need:

<br />graphics - ok
<br />cpu - ok
<br />memory - very tight, it does meet the minimum requirements, fine if you don't want to do much more than run windows.
<br />
<br />you should check the manufactures website for motherboard and any other devices you have to make sure that windows 10 drivers are available.
<br />(or tell us the make and model and I will look for you)

            Hi  LightYagami1
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Releases beyond Windows 10 1703 are going to have trouble with your graphics adapter. 
<br />
<br />If its a desktop, you could purchase and install a newer discrete graphics card, but if its a laptop, you are probably better off sticking with Windows 8.1, which will be supported until January 2023. 
<br />
<br />Microsoft is no longer supporting older releases such as 1709 or older. 
<br />
<br />The RAM sufficient, but more is always better and you likely could get away with using Windows 10 32 bit. I noticed the 64 bit versions of Windows 10 tend to love more RAM.

    <title>Link RCA Galileo Pro 11.5 Tablet to Microsoft account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Link RCA Galileo Pro 11.5 Tablet to Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader1">Greetings, On the MS website it states you can add another device to your MS account. However, it doesn't have a place on&nbsp;the said&nbsp;website to add anything besides a Microsoft device. I.e. Windows phone, etc... I also just read on
 another Microsoft website page that you can add an iPhone or Android phone through that particular link or app. I probably have to use that "add phone app" because I'm adding my RCA Galileo Pro 11.5 Tablet with Android 6.0 as my Second device. Why can't I
 add that 2nd device that's Not a Microsoft product? On that 1st website page, they only list approximately 5 Windows devices. To add my Tablet, I shouldn't have to use that add a phone app. It's a tablet for crying out loud. What should or can I do? I mean
 Why do they only have those few Windows devices listed? I can use either Bluestacks or the new Microsoft Edge for iOS and Android to get to the Google Play Store for all my apps in my Google account I've been using for years now. Does anybody out there have
 any ideas at all how to add my Android 6.0 Tablet as my 2nd device?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear Prakhar,</p>
<p>Actually I can't add it with MS Launcher because somebody broke the tablet on me.</p>
<p>However, if I can download the Launcher &amp; add the Tablet with all of it's apps &amp; programs then I'm in luck. I'm not too familiar with the Microsoft Launcher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Greetings Prakhar,</p>
<p>As I stated before, somebody totally broke my Android Tablet so I'm hoping to (in the next hour or two) to start the Microsoft Launcher which I downloaded to my Windows 10 Laptop &amp; see what happens when I follow directions. I believe I can also download
 the MS Launcher to broken Android Tablet through my "Google Account". Not sure if that will work out or not but I will let you know A.S.A.P. You probably already know if it will work out. I'm just now replying to you now, again, because I got that email from
 this Forum so I'm re-replying to you. If it doesn't work, out I think I can at least use the Google Play Store apps through a download named "BlueStacks". However, BlueStacks directions are very hard for me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wish me luck,</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

<p>Hello Again Prakhar,</p>
<p>I'll let you know hopefully by the end of this weekend. Maybe by Monday 1/29/19, I'll have it done? You see a person put a heavy tray ontop of my Tablet &amp; seperated the screen from the backing. I tried getting it fixed but have no way to get to local store
 since I'm waiting for a Liver Transplant in a skilled nursing home which is very far from family &amp; friends. Anyways I tried through my Google Account itmstates 1st: that Microsoft Launcher IS downloaded with all of my other apps in the G Play Store but when
 I go to open Microsoft Launcher with "My apps" it states 2nd: This app has NO devices to download to. As you know via the Google Account it acts like a device. I read uo on BlueStacks 4 app &amp; think I can get ALL my apps opened up on Windows through BlueStacks.</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; I'll let you know soon,</p>
<p>Barry</p>

<h3> benmoser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 create system image error 0x807800C5 with Pipo X9</h2>
                    <p>Just got a brand new Pipo X9 "tv box". This is an odd Windows 10 PC and this may be the cause of the issue. I updated software to Windows 10 with no problems. Made a suggested recovery USB (no issues). But all attempts to make a System Image fail with the
 above error (drive not found). In similar threads I've tried: chkdsk /f the external usb drives; I used 2 different usb disks. I did the sfc /scannow in a cmd with administrator elevation. No errors found. Stil fails with the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have tried acronis 2016 (via bootable EUFI usb) and it only gives a tiny ( &lt; 1 GB) partition to back up. The Pipo X9 has a weird "disk" (EMMC?) with several partitions. I don't understand this. Has anyone found a way to make an image of such a PC?
 I am lost.</p>

 responding and has recovered. It does not necessarily happen only when I am browsing, it just happens anytime while I am using my laptop. So what's the solution to this?&nbsp;

<div>Apart from this I also cannot use my Mozilla Firefox for browsing any longer as the pages don't load? Mozilla used to work perfectly a few weeks ago. I have to use Google Chrome which works fine but I prefer using Mozilla Firefox. So why don't the pages
 load in Mozilla and what is the way to fix it?</div>

<div>Hello there,</div>
<div>I have had similar problem to yours. Following steps can help to speed up your pc and free up some graphic memory (I have 2GB but it looks like, it is still not enough!!!).
<div>Specially if you leave your browser like firefox with lots of addons for long period of time..... it uses large amout of memory and causes your graphic card stop responding specially if your settings are for best appearance in windows ... even the windows
 suggestion thing would not work very well ... therefore I suggest to do followings:&nbsp;</div>
<div>New ways to speed up your PC: (This is based on my experience and since then I never had the problem again)
<div><br />
Go to control panel then click on Ease of Access then click Optimise Visual Display then in Make my computer easier to see in the make things on the screen easier to see section, check the box for Turn off all unnecessary animations (where possible) then click
 apply then OK! </div>
<div><br />
If your graphic card is not fast or good enough then also try this one:<br />
Go to Control Panel again then click on User Account and Family Safety then User Accounts then click on Change User Account Control Settings then move the slider to just above Never notify. the second position from bottom. This will not dim the display anymore
 But it will still notify you! </div>
<div><br />
Go to control panel then click on Ease of Access then click on change how your mouse works then in Make it easier to manage windows section, check both check boxes for activate a window by hovering over it with the mouse and Prevent windows from being automatically
 arranged when moved to the edge of the screen. Then click on Apply then OK! </div>
<div><br />
Go to My Computer, Then Click on System Properties then go to Advanced System Settings then go to Advanced tab then in Performance section, click on Settings button then in Visual Effects either choose Adjust for Best Performance Or if you like to have both
 good looking and performance then click on custom then uncheck all check boxes except the forth, fifth, sixth and last three check boxes then click apply then OK then again OK. You may require to restart or log off for changes to take effect.
<div><br />
After performing above tips, your Windows 7 will run much more faster than before. You will feel it straight away!

It probably because of running too many programs in your start up. Try browsing web or whatever you want to do after performing clean boot see if it make difference?<br />
<br />
Clean Boot:<br />
<br />
Go to msconfig (type in search box in Start menu or run in XP then press enter) then prepare your PC for clean boot by disabling all start up items and NONE windows services then restart your computer. See if it make a difference? if it did then try choosing
 ONLY necessary start up items and services.<br />
If you are not sure, research about them or post here, I might be able to help. <br />
<br />
Try minimizing your start up programs and services.<br />
<br />
Uninstall unnecessary programs. Like the ones you never use or tool bars or anything junk.<br />
<br />
De fragment your hard drive and make sure that it is scheduled to run once or twice a week.<br />
<br />
Uninstall any add Ons that you don't use or trust from Firefox and Chrome.<br />
Make sure that your plug ins are up to date E.G. Java , Flash Player, Silver light etc<br />
Also make sure that your browser is up to date too.<br />
<br />
Make sure that your Windows and drivers are up to date. Check PC manufacture website for driver updates or use their software ... e.g. in Vaios is Vaio update<br />
Specially your graphic driver. <br />
<br />
If all above failed to solve then make sure that your system is clean.<br />

<p>I'm having the same problem.&nbsp;When this happens I have only&nbsp;one page in&nbsp;Microsoft Edge browser open plus usually Outlook. Today it was just the browser that was open.&nbsp;The warning also says it is trying to use Windows 8 graphics driver yet it is a new computer
 working with Windows 10. I went to settings and drivers but it says all are up to date. &nbsp;I'm at a loss as to why this is happening and not getting any help from the computer manufacturer.</p>

    <title>Device Installation Settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> falco1029  say:</h3>
<h2>            Device Installation Settings</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I recently went to try and change the Device Installation Settings in Windows 10 Pro (via Control Panel\System and Security\System &gt; System Properties &gt; Hardware, as well as via searching for it directly), but it wouldn't let me change the option,
 instead everything was grayed out (except the automatically get device app and info provided by device manufacturer), and it said that Some settings are managed by your System Administrator.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, I AM the system administrator, and even when I tried manually activating the built in Admin account and using that, whether in normal or safe mode, it still gave me the same greyed out options. I've googled it, but the closest I've found
 is the more general Windows Update issues, which doesn't help me in this case. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For what it's worth, I can (oddly enough) search the registry with regedit and manually change the option, and when I check back in the window, the grayed out choices reflect the registry, but it's a pain to do that and if I want to change it back later
 I'd like to be able to more easily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps taken so far to try and fix it:</p>
<p>*Using built in Administrator account (no change)</p>
<p>*Booting in safe mode (No change)</p>
<p>*Running control panel specifically as administrator (no change)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, any idea what's going on, and how I can get control of those settings again? Any help would be appreciated, thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Note: I hope this is the right topic, I ASSUME it's a problem with my account)</p>

<p>I'm able to do that as well, but it similarly does not change the grayed out nature of it in the typical options&nbsp; menu. The main issue is I don't want to have to do a roundabout manner of changing it every time I want to.</p>

<p>Recently I came back to my PC after a few days away and upon turning it out it would not boot into windows. I received the srttrail error message "A hard disk could not be found. If a hard disk is installed, it is not responding. So far I have not

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for submitting your query. I understand that your Windows Live Mail is working offline. Possible cause of this issue was because your Internet Explorer was set to work offline. To troubleshoot your concern, please make sure first that your default

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open Internet Explorer browser.</p>
<p>2. From the menu bar, click <font><span style="font-weight: bold">File</span>. (<span style="font-weight: bold">ALT + F</span></font>)</p>
<p>3. Uncheck <span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Work offline</font></span> by clicking on it.</p>
<p>4. From Windows Live Mail, click <font><span style="font-weight: bold">Send/Receive</span> button. If you are being asked to go online, click
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that, please repair your Windows Live Mail to make sure there is no corrupted Mail related files that is contributing to the issue. Here's how:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Press <font><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows</span> + <span style="font-weight: bold">
R</span>, type <span style="font-weight: bold">AppWiz.cpl</span>, click <span style="font-weight: bold">
OK</span></font>.</p>
<p>2. Select <font><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows Essentials 2012/Windows Live Essentials</span>, click
Remove</span></font>.</p>
<p>3. Click <span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Repair all Windows Essentials Programs</font></span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After repairing, reconfigure now your account to Windows Live Mail to refresh connection of the account to Mail. Try following the steps
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-add-email-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case issue persists, I would like to ask some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Do you have any security software that acts as a firewall?</div>
</li><li>
<div>When did the issue started?</div>
</li><li>
<div>Do you remember any changes you made in your computer/Mail prior to the issue?</div>
</li><li>
<div>What is the version of your Internet Explorer?</div>
</li></ul>
<p>We'll wait for your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

<h3> a deaf bat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cheaters on Xbox Live</h2>
                    
<p>If I catch someone using a lag switch or an ip flooder to influence the results of the game or even boot me and others from a game, does reporting that person even do any good?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any justice on xbox live at all? I want to see accounts suspended or put on a black list of cheaters who are forced to play with each other only, so that us honest gamers who want to have a good time aren't getting booted from games, or lagging
 so bad that it's impossible to win.</p>

<p>It does mean they will be looked at. If this happens on Black Ops and looks very suspicious, you can record the clip using theatre and send it to Treyarch and they can take a look at it. People do get banned from it, the proof is in the suspension forum.
