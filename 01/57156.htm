    <title>resetting your pc stuck at 1&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            resetting your pc stuck at 1&#37;</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>Yesterday I performed a pc reset on my brothers pc which is exactly the same specs on my pc. Now i installed win 10 for my brother. He enjoyed it but wanted to have his pc clean with that OS. So i did the pc reset. I was successful. So i thought let me reset
 my pc as well. My brothers pc took 3 hours to complete. My pc was stuck at 2% since 12pm yesterday. I left it over night and it was still 2 percent 6 am today. I decided to turn off the pc. Then i turned it back on. A blue page with tiles showing me options.
 I chose the reset this pc option and selected to remove everything but keep what the pc brought. (Not factory reset) i dont want to lose my windows 10. But its been 4 hours and its stuck at 1%. Why does it keep doing this? What should i do? Im terribly scared.</p>
<p>Edit: my pc came with windows 8.1 I bought it on brandsmart. Which means i dont have no cd to reinstall windows 8 or 10.. I just want to reset my pc to keep windows 10. Just like i did on my brother's pc.</p>

<h2>            How do i create a password protected folder&#63; Also,  how do i change the background inside the folders&#63;</h2>
                    Well my question speaks for its self sometimes you have things in your computer that you dont want others to read or watch.<br />
Used to be you could put a password on a folder to keep others from taking a peek inside.Any clue how to do it again?<br />
<br />
<br />
Used to be when i had windows millennium i was able to change the back ground picture to the folder its self. so when you opened it you were able to have your own personalized folder. But now i have to keep this boring white folder is there still any way to
 do that ?

<blockquote>Thanks but i was hoping to lock said folder yet leave the laptop usable to other users without worrying about them stumbling on my folders and changing all sorts of things in them.<br />
<br />
Im quite disappointed that basic functions have been removed from this version of windows and am wondering if there is some way i can get a hold of the millennium eddition again i know many say that os has major issues but i for one never had problems with
 it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Incidentally what third party soft wear do you recommend to solve this ?</blockquote>
<br />
This "basic" function hasn't been around since Windows XP. The NT versions of Windows are mulit-user versions, unlike the 9x versions that preceded it and as such use file permissions rather than password protection.<br />
<br />
I can't recommend any application because I don't use them.<br />
One answer is to set up a User account for Visitors to use&nbsp; and password-protect your User account.

&gt; <br />
&gt; <br />
<br />
Like WinNT, Win2K, WinXP, and Vista before it, Windows 7's NTFS <br />
file security paradigm doesn't rely on, or allow, the crude and <br />
cumbersome method of password protection for individual applications, <br />
ead, it uses the superior method of explicitly <br />
assigning file/folder permissions to individual users and/or groups.<br />
<br />
As a crude work-around, you can place the file in a compressed <br />
folder, and set a password to uncompress the folder to view/access its <br />
contents. Also, some applications allow the user to password-protect <br />
their specific data files. Read the specific application's Help files <br />
for further information on this capability.<br />
<br />
For your situation, the simplest course of action would be to <br />
create a limited user accounts for anyone else who uses your computer, <br />
and configure it so it doesn't have permissions to access your personal <br />
files.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; Used to be when i had windows millennium i was able to change the back ground <br />
&gt; picture to the folder its self. so when you opened it you were able to have your
<br />
&gt; own personalized folder. But now i have to keep this boring white folder is <br />
&gt; there still any way to do that ?<br />
<br />
<br />
een that capability <br />
with the use of 3rd party applications. Certainly none of Windows 7's <br />
predecessors had that capability.<br />

<p>I'm not sure what is happening in your case... the fact that your computer is showing contents from a drive that has been removed is a bit unusual...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Try rebooting instead of just logging off and see if that helps... </p>
<p>Did you SAFELY REMOVE the drive ?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I know is very strange but that's what is happening. It shows me&nbsp;all the folders of the password protected drive letter (K) even though the drive is not connected to the system and I can't open those folders. And for the other drive it tells me that&nbsp;it is
 not recognized by the system.&nbsp;<br />
I have try also rebooting the system after an eight hour lapse time from the signoff.</p>
<p>I have also try to connect it each time to a different USB port (out of six), the same thing happens.</p>
<p>Yew I have remove it OK. It works perfectly with my WD LIVE TV Player.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't really know what is going on, but I do know that on one of my machines after upgrading to Win 8.1, one of my external drives developed a problem...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My machine has two separate USB 3.0 controllers by different manufacturers...</p>
<p>I changed the driver for the ASMedia controller back to it's original driver from ASMedia, instead of the Microsoft driver that Win 8.1 installed, and the drive then worked on that controller....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other controller was Intel, and I didn't have any luck getting it to work with the drive until I updated the firmware in the drive itself...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The point is that you might try different drivers for your USB Controllers...</p>
<p>Right click on them in Device Manager and select Properties... Drivers Tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select Update Driver... Browse Computer... Select From a List....</p>
<p>Any drivers that have been on your machine will show on the list...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you start, make a note of which one is in use, then try another...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know why one 3TB drive would work and not the other, or why they are dropping out...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you say you started with 32 bit windows and them changed to 64 bit... is this on the same machine or another ?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Yesterday night I install all the Windows Updates (23 + 1). This morning before I start the system I pull out the password protected 3TB drive (K) and connect the other 3TB and started the system.</p>
<p>It displays an icon with the message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Book (K): Tap to choose what happens</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I tap the icon it displays the message: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The disk check could not perform because windows can't access the disk.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Access is denied.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This time the Disk Management table shows me all 5 drives: H, K, E, I, C.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I took out the 3TB disk and connect the password protected one 3TB. it displays me&nbsp;the icon to run Unlock which I did and the drive (K)&nbsp;is working.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>I don't have different USB&nbsp;controllers. All 8 USB 2.0 &nbsp;ports are on my desktop internally.

<p>My PC is:&nbsp; Intel Core(TM) i7 CPU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 920 @ 2.67 GHz</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Installed memory Ram&nbsp; 7.00 GB</p>
<p>Before I install the Windows 8.1 Pro&nbsp;x64,&nbsp; I did upgrade the Ram from 3.00 GB&nbsp; to&nbsp; 7.00 GB and the drive C with the SSD SanDisk 128GB Sata&nbsp;and load windows 8 Pro&nbsp;x64 first and then upgrade to 8.1 Pro x64.</p>
<p>Otherwise&nbsp;the machine is the same&nbsp;as with the Windows 8 Pro x32, when all worked.</p>

<p>They would all be internal, even with two... they will both be on the motherboard....</p>
<p>If you look under USB Controllers in Device Manager, and see anything other than Intel or Generic, you have two..</p>

<p>It sounds like your problem is now solved, or did I misunderstand.</p>

</p>
<p>Under USB Controller Device Manager I see the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp; Intel(R) ICH10 Family USB Enhanced Host Controller (8 times)</p>
<p>&nbsp; USB Root Hub (8 times)</p>
<p>&nbsp; USB Mass storage Device (3 times)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; USB Composite Device</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>No the problem still exists. Windows it does not recognize the second&nbsp;3TB drive.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To me, it looks like&nbsp;the system keeps&nbsp;somewhere an image of the 3TB protected drive and when I connect the other one it expects to see the first one and issues the error that the system does not recognize the drive.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is a very good step by step Tutorial for you to follow to Copy and Paste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"How to Copy, Cut, and Paste in Windows"</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/cut-copy-and-paste-in-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/cut-copy-and-paste-in-windows/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>How to highlight text in a document</u></strong></p>
<p><br />
Before you can copy, cut, or paste text data you must be able to highlight, or select, the text that you want to perform the action on. This is called highlighting and allows you to select all the information in a document or certain portions of it. Once the
 text is highlighted you can then copy or cut that information depending on your needs. An example of what highlighted text looks like is below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.bleepstatic.com%2ftutorials%2fcopypaste%2fselected.gif" /><br />
<strong>Figure 1: Example of highlighted text</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you can use Ctrl + C to Copy and then Ctrl + V to Paste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 network share sporadic problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mathiasbjorkman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 network share sporadic problem</h2>
                    I was working at a client location that have a Workgroup network. The system that holds the data is a Windows 10 Pro (updated) and one of the workstations is a Windows 10 Home (Laptop). The issue that started happening a few months ago is that occasionally
 the laptop loses share connectivity to the mail system. The other workstations work fine. While this is going on it can access other devices. The error that comes up is Network Path Not Found (Error&nbsp;<span>0x80070035). If you wait a few minutes it
 works fine again. I tried to reset TCP/IP, I disabled firewall, I tested wire. Move computers to different switch ports. I can ping the mail machine fine while this is going on. I was thinking it might be some kind of authentication problem but it happens
 with both UNC paths and mapped drive paths. So I need some help figuring this out. I did talk to them about reinstalling the system with a 10 Pro.</span>

</p><p>The error&nbsp;<span>Network Path Not Found (Error&nbsp;</span><span>0x80070035) could be triggered by the firewall or antivirus installed on the computer, authentication problem, or due to network security. Upon searching about this

<h2>            Surface Book 2 feedback from a pen user and software developer</h2>
                    <p>Hi ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For almost 5 years I was an enthusiastic owner of a Surface Pro 3, and I just made the decision to buy a 15" Surface Book 2. I'm using it to develop software for a pen-based application. While I love the Book, I wanted to add my 0.02&nbsp; about the need for
 a kickstand for the screen portion. Since I can't find a specific place for Surface feedback, I thought I'd comment here. I imagine a lot of people are like me in that they want to use the pen for drawing and creative software but also need access to the keyboard
 to navigate&nbsp; and interact with complex apps, (plus switch to email, web, etc.) But currently if we use the keyboard we have to draw on the screen without a solid backing - when doing this repeatedly in a creative app the sensation of screen bounce and lack
 of support is very tangible and distracting, I find I often have to steady the screen with my other hand if I'm applying any kind of pen pressure. A kickstand (or even just an attachable accessory ?) would really help restore that solid drafting feel that
 you can get with a SP3.&nbsp; My thoughts for the Surface book 3 :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<p>I absolutely agree, this is the ONE THING that has prevented me from buying a surface book.</p>
<p>I had exactly the same experience, it was very disappointing.</p>
<p>I am shocked that it doesn't have the surface kickstand.</p>
<p>I cannot fathom why. Surely Microsoft understands the power and popularity of this simple feature&nbsp; it is the signature feature that users love.</p>
<p>As a pen user I rushed to try the SB but was horrified by the screen wobble which put any further exploration to bed, there is no point for me in using this device, despite the power and screen size ( which I long for).</p>
<p>I am still holding back any 2 in 1 purchase until something like a 15 inch SB comes along with a kickstand and pen ( which has 2 buttons!).</p>

            It might be that they don't want to cannibalize Surface Pro sales, I don't know. That would be a nice little application for 3D printing :)&nbsp; I suppose you could also use a Bluetooth keyboard, but that gets clunky (especially to carry around and set up),
 plus you'd want to use the original keyboard.

<p>It is strange, Mr Sketch, I can't understand it, except to assume that they thought the hinge was so amazing that the kickstand would point out its 'weakness'. They can't have that, looking like it was on purpose may be more important than doing it right.</p>
<p>Using that logic, they couldn't possibly change it for the S2 unless people were going bonkers about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'm holding my breath for the next iteration, hopefully, they've come to their senses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two buttons on the freakn pen too MS! :)</p>
<p>I know I said the stand was the one thing, but yep there were two things that prevented my purchase, the dumbed down pen was the other.</p>
<p>They obviously had the wrong advice and the wrong testers, these two mistakes are clearly linked.</p>

            Hi  nikhiljayakrishnan
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Audio Troubleshooting:
<br />
<br />I suggest you to run the Audio troubleshooter and check if it helps.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-sound-problems#v1h=tab03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/f...</a>
<br />
<br />If the issue persists, then try to uninstall and re-install the audio driver.
<br />
<br />    Press Windows  Logo Key+X. Click on Device Manager.
<br />    In the list of hardware categories, look for the device that you want to update, and then right-click on it to Uninstall.
<br />    Follow onscreen instructions to uninstall it.
<br />    To re-install, either you can restart the system or install the driver from the manufacturer√≠s website (recommended as they will have updated drivers).
<br />
<br />For reference:
<br />
<br />Try all the steps provided in the link below and check if it helps. 
<br />
<br />Fix sound problems:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-sound-problems#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/f...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Click the machine name at the top
<br />Click Action menu
<br />Click Scan for hardware changes
<br />
<br />See if the sound controllers appear at the bottom.
<br />
<br />If not, click the View menu then click 
<br />Show hidden devices 
<br />
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Option 3:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select Communications tab
<br />Choose Do nothing
<br />
<br />If there is an 'Enhancements' tab, click on it then check the box to 'Disable all enhancements'. 
<br /> 
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Audio
<br />Double click it then change Startup type to ‚ÄòAutomatic‚Äô
<br />Click Start
<br />
<br />Click Apply then oK.
<br />
<br />Video Troubleshooting:
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.‚Äù 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>

    <title>Windows 8 login problems after upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> armand richard david  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 login problems after upgrade</h2>
                    Windows 8 upgrade has added a password to an account that previously didn't have one and now I can't log in at all! And my windows live ID (which works on the web) won't log me in (it's asking me to reset my password). Any ideas?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Just to add to this: I have now used a third party bootloader to confirm there is *no* password on the main user account, and Windows is still showing that my password is 'invalid'. In addition, the Windows Live login has now been disabled, so I can't
 even try to reset the password on my Microsoft account.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This has turned my media centre into a paperweight, and I really can't bear to go through a rebuild. Any ideas much appreciated.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community!</p>
<p><br />
Based on your post, I understand that you have Password login issues, after you upgraded to Windows 8.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As you have mentioned that you are using a Microsoft account, so,You need to login using old password and then reset to the new password.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As you are having problems signing in or need to reset password, you can refer to the following web site to Reset their password or troubleshoot the issue.

            No, as I said I wasn't being given that as an option. Windows live login is disabled. Have used a boot cd to add an administrator password but looks like the installation was corrupted.&nbsp;

            I have a similar problem...but I have reset my password several times on live.com and have been able to login using my phone but my Win 8 upgrade does not accept the password . I know it is correct. I have changed it twice and been able to login to Live.com
 account but not my Win 8 . <br />
<br />
Btw, I had a smooth upgrade from 7-8. Logged in using my old Win 7 account password and chose to use my Live.com account for windows 8. I fooled around in the new windows 8 and installed chrome and installed quicken . Quicken install asked for reboot and I
 have not been able to get in to my account/computer since.<br />
<br />
I see no way to roll back to WIn 7 and I see not way to delete my live.com login and revert back to Win 7 type admin login.<br />
<br />
Please help. I too have a brick.<br />
THanks<br />
<br />
also, i have been trying to report this issue using my android phone and I am unable to submit on MS support sites using the android OS. I fill everything out and hit submit and a 30% transparent window obscures the submit screen and persists...I got out my
 trusty old laptop to get this incident submitted.<br />

WINDOWS 8 IS VERY WELL DESIGNED BUT WE ARE MAKING SIMPLE MISTAKES. I UPGRADED &amp; HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.
<div><br />
<div>FIRST, UNDER PC SETTINGS = &gt;, YOU GUYS MUST HAVE SWITCHED TO MICROSOFT ACCOUNT FROM LOCAL ACCOUNT.</div>
<div><br />
<div>SECOND, ACCIDENTALLY,, YOU MUST HAVE CHANGED THE KEYBOARD LANGUAGE IN THE BOTTOM LEFT CORNER. &nbsp;FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU SELECTED ENGLISH - US KEYBOARD &amp; THAN ACCIDENTALLY CHANGED TO ENGLISH UK KEYBOARD, THAN YOUR PASSWORD WILL NOT WORK IF IT HAS SOME CHARACTERS
 LIKE @ # % $ * &amp; SO ON. THIS IS BECAUSE DIFFERENT LANGUAGE KEYBOARDS HAVE DIFFERENT BUTTONS.</div>
<div><br />
<div>IT IS BETTER TO CHECK &amp; CHANGE CORRECT KEY BOARD LANGUAGE. &nbsp;AFTER SUCCESSFUL LOGIN, GO BACK AGAIN TO PC SETTINGS =&gt; USERS &amp; SWITCH TO LOCAL ACCOUNT WITHOUT FILLING PASSWORD. &nbsp;SO, YOUR SYSTEM WILL BE PASSWORD FREE ON RESTART.</div>
<div><br />
<div>ENJOY &amp; NO NEED TO RE-INSTALL AGAIN &amp; AGAIN. &nbsp;FOR ALL APPEARING COMPLEX PROBLEMS, IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO HAVE COMPLEX SOLUTION.</div>

            <p>community login stinks!! I bought a new hp with windows 8.1 and all it has done for 8 days is UPDATE!! Over 200 updates and counting and over 5 hrs of sitting and waiting for the updates to finish.</p>
<p>Community login NEVER accepts the password the first time, it takes 2 to 4 attempts to login.</p>
<p>Local login would be great. I was FORCED BY Big Brother to become a part of the Microsoft community and don't appreciate it or like it.</p>
<p>Wish I had my windows 7 back!!!!</p>

    <title>Setting up a Kindle Fire as a Baby Monitor - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Setting up a Kindle Fire as a Baby Monitor</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a busy animal rescuer, and there is almost always a pregnant or nursing kitty in my spare bedroom with her kittens. I'd really like to get my kindle fire set up to use as a baby/kitten monitor so I can check on them when I'm working, or when I'm staying
 at my boyfriend's place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gotten automatic answering up and running, but I can only figure out to get audio, not video. The skype app on kindle doesn't have a "start my video automatically" option, like
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Visual-Baby-Monitor-with-Skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a>&nbsp;article suggests. I'd really prefer not to invest in a baby monitor when I think I can get this setup to work without buying anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice on how to get the video to start automatically when I set up autoanswer on my kindle fire?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
                </div>

<p>Thank for your reply </p>
<p>I answer your questions </p>
<p><span>1. Are you getting any error message or error code when you are trying to connect the computer to the TV?
</span></p>
<p><span>-- &gt; I don't get any error message or error code </span></p>
<p><span>But I get 2 </span>phenomenons of 2 TV </p>
<p><span>- Sony Bravia TV : my tablet Dell doesn't recognize this TV&nbsp;while I plug the cable</span></p>
<p><span>- Panasonic TV : my Tablet Dell recognize TV,&nbsp;but&nbsp;when I control TV&nbsp;source from HDMI Tablet, &nbsp;I saw the Image from Tablet for 2 seconds and the TV is black, The Panasonic TV is disappeared in Tablet Dell .
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Have you tried connecting using different HDMI cables? </span></p>
<p><span>I don't have different HDMI cables, but I use this cable to connect successfully between&nbsp;monitor Samsung and&nbsp;this Tablet Dell .
</span><span>So&nbsp;I think&nbsp;Windows 10 has a problem to connect TV HD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>However, I have tried to update driver from <strong>Device Manager -- &gt; Display Adapter &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>My driver Is Intel HD Graphic Family </p>
<p>- Driver Provider : Intel Coporation</p>
<p>- Driver date : <strong>18/02/2016 </strong></p>
<p>- Driver version : <strong>20</strong><strong>.19.15.4390 </strong></p>
<p>I have pressed button Update driver , but this window informs me : " The best driver software for your device is already installed. Windows has determined the driver software for your device is up to date"
</p>

            <p>Do either one of the TVs have the ability to be a Wireless Receiver?&nbsp; Some TVs do but my Sony Bravia does not.&nbsp; If the TV did work that way you could "Project" wirelessly rather than HDMI cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anytime an HDMI connection is mentioned I immediately think about Digital Rights and whether the TV will receive such a connection.&nbsp; On top of that the quality of the HDMI cable and the version may be involved.&nbsp; Or does the TV have a specific port it uses
 for Computer connections.</p>

<p>You can create a text file with all the entries as follows:</p>
<p>1) Click on Start and type CMD in search bar</p>
<p>2) Right click on the cmd.exe entry in the "Programs (1)" list and select "Run as administrator"</p>
<p>3) At the command prompt which will be: C:\Windows\system32&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enter the commands listed below.<br />
3a) C:\Windows\system32&gt; CD C:\users&nbsp;&nbsp; and press the enter key<br />
3b) Next enter:&nbsp; dir&nbsp;&nbsp; and press enter<br />
one of the entries in the list will be your account name, example: My Name<br />
3c) now enter: CD "My name"&nbsp;&nbsp; and press enter</p>
<p>4) The command line prompt should now be:&nbsp; C:\Users\My Name:&nbsp;&nbsp; where 'My Name' represents your account name.<br />
5) Now enter the following at the prompt:&nbsp; dir&nbsp; /al&nbsp; /s&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; C:\Results.txt</p>
<p>6) Open Windows Explorer and navigate to C:\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you should see the "Results.txt" file you just created.</p>
<p>7) use the content of this file to review all the junction points. None of which should point to files located on the backup drive. Note: Trying to backup files on the USB drive to the USB drive can cause the error 0x81000037.</p>

When I got the X, I gave my youngest son my Xbox One Halo 5 Edition. He has a gamertag but it wants me to pay for his Gold seperately.&nbsp;Can I add a 3rd gamertag to my Family account or do I have to pay for his Gold subscription? Right now, I do not have to pay for my oldest subscription due to being on my family.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This is a nightmare in my opinion I have 2 consoles. I have just one gold membership. I set one console to be my home console, and my sons can use that one. For my second console, they can log on and use it, but have zero gold/online features. If I am also logged on, they are able to access my Gold games, but still no online features. If they want to play together (the reason I bought 2 consoles) the one the second console (not set to my home console) has to use my parent account to have the gold features. In other words, one kid uses his account the other one has to use mine. Awful. Microsoft should really support multiple home consoles. I would pay a monthly fee to establish a second home console so my gold benefits could truly be shared to both my sons.</p>

                    OS: L8inux Mint 17.3, 64 bit, KDE<br />
<br />
Since I upgraded to Skype 8.11.0.4, it does not login automatically when I start my PC. With the previous version, it was just running fine.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I appreciate any comment which solves the problem.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi 52ROSt,</p>

            The statement "Apparently, automatic log in when your PC starts is not supported in the new Skype for Windows, Mac and Linux - you always have to log in with your Skype account credentials." is kind of strange.<br />
<br />
In Settings there is an item called: Automatically start Skype <br />
<br />
This function is switched on even by default.<br />
<br />
Skype also forgets the customization..<br />
<br />
In my opinion, this is the worst Skype version ever published; it is a very green banana.
<br />
<br />
I am using Skype since the very early days and feel that is time to look for an alternative except Skype comes up with sigficant improvements.

<p>Yes, under Skype settings, the&nbsp;option to automatically launch Skype at every boot is enabled by default, but it will not automatically log you in.&nbsp;If you log out from the app prior to turning off your device, in the next boot, you have to put your Skype
 credentials to be able to sign in. </p>

<p>Dear Rhiza_E,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't take my strong comments personally!!!</p>
<p>I am aware that MS only sends you to the front line with unhappy users because MS messed the new Skype up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your reply sounds to me only like an excuse of MS for messing up the new Skype version without omitting that they have bugs in the new Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reasons:</p>
<p>If "Automatically start Skype" does not include an automated loging, what is it good for?
<br />
All old versions I used, automatically login when the related option was set. (I used Skype already since it very days long before MS took over. The auto loging worked even when MS took over until the last version before the new one.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I get the following message after the autostart up of Skype " Oops. there was a problem with Skype. Try signing out and back in ." Thus, Skype tries to automatically to login but failed. This failure is caused by the new Skype; the previous
 could login </p>
<p>
</p><p>And, after signing out and in again. I always get the screen to customize theme and colors. This also shows the new Skype does not work correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, in another post I also stated that my LogiTech web cam doesn't work anymore in the new Skype. I tested the camera as such and it works perfectly fine. On top of this, the microphone built into my camera works fine even under the new Skype. Thus the
 malfunctioning of the video part of my camera in Skype is another Skype bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now an offer to you. Please don't waste your time writing answer without solution. You last reply was a nice attempt to cover up a Skype problem. Please don't write such excuses anymore they don't help. Solutions are needed not excuses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But please get back with an answer as soon as you have a solution or you can make a statement that a bug fix will be distributed in the next xx weeks.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should MS not like to improve the new Skype please give this answer also very frankly an openly. Such a statement is fine with me as well because it clarifies the situation and I will look for alternatives.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a nice weekend!</p>
<p>

            I don't understand why? What could possibly be the motivation for taking that out? What could you change in the code that would cause this as a side effect unless your aim was to make the software less functional? Basically, it appears that MS is giving
 its users the finger by releasing this.

            Hi Evans. 
<br />
<br />Try a Repair Install, creating the media on another PC, transferring it back to the problem PC, open the media or click to mount ISO, right click Setup to Run as Admin. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> If it balks Take Ownership of all folders:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>

<br />
<br />If that fails then you'll save time if you wipe the drive and do the Clean Install:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<p>Yes, messing with things and not knowing what you are doing is a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So on C:\ &gt;&gt;Security&gt;&gt;advanced</p>
<p>who is the current owner of C:</p>
<p>
</p><p>and what users are in the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>did you try and select enable inheritance and apply the settings&nbsp;and restart the pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>can you show me a screen shot of the owner windows with the users in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I probably can help you. Maybe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this process very well of ownership, users and permissions.</p>

<p>Yes, you really did a bad thing. The only possible hope is to use a repair CD to enter the start up options. You should not need to use a user and password this way and maybe you can use system restore or reset PC and save your files and settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download the files for a repair CD or create one on any other windows pc and use it. go to a friends or families to make one if needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would use a CD/DVD if possible instead of a USB</p>

            Are you using a Microsoft Account to sign into Windows 10? 
<br />
<br />Maybe your files are actually being saved to OneDrive, not deleted. 
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer &gt; OneDrive then browse it.
<br />
<br />You might also be logged into a temporary profile.
<br />
<br />Try restarting your computer a few times. Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />At the sign in screen, click the power button, then click Restart. Do this a few times then try signing again. If the desktop still does not show up, then you will need to  create a new local user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Control + Shift + Esc
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Click Add
<br />
<br />Enter a user name
<br />Password, confirm it, create a hint
<br />Click Next
<br />Click Finish
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Sign into the new account.
<br />Open File Explorer on the Taskbar &gt; This PC 
<br />Open the drive where Windows is installed 
<br />Open Users 
<br />Look if your old account old is there with your files 
<br />
<br />If they are, you can copy them over to the new account.

            I haven't seen a case where the files delete in front of the user.
<br />However, it is possible when the computer does a feature upgrade. Is this the case?

<p>Yeah windows 10 is a f*****g joke for doing this. I have always used my windows 10 as a local account, i have just signed in for this problem and to report my files also being deleted. WTF is going on with windows 10. I have had files just disapear when
 I KNOW they were there before. Luckily i do regular back ups so i can recover them, but why is this **** happening???
</p>
<p>I am on Windows 10 Pro v1803 and its happening to me. I thought a few months back that it might of been something i had done, but no, Its def not me its a problem with windows 10.&nbsp; I was hoping Microsoft addressed this issue with an update but since i have
 the latest crerators update it still happens. WHY WHY WHY WHY????</p>

            I use theDashlane password manager and recently have encountered this problem where I install it and after one or two restarts, the EXE file is deleted.&nbsp; I have literally documented it with screen shots step by step and it installs perfectly and works
 fine, then I do a reboot and it still works fine but then another reboot and it is gone.&nbsp; There are no quarantined files in Windows Defender or Malwarebytes (both of which I use).&nbsp; I'm exploring options but still unsolved.

<p>Windows 10 is the biggest joke of an OS I have used! When you do important updates they have deleted the gui of my desktop before! The whole point of an update is to remove glitches not cause them. Windows 10 should of never been released soo soon and all
 these glirches people are reporting is a perfect example why microsoft product pushes instead of focusing on quality software.</p>

            Hi catflap001
<br />
<br />Most likely that got put there by a graphics update in error, that should not be on that rive, but you can assume the original is in the correct location, because you would be having graphics issues were it not.
<br />
<br />Check in this location for the correct file - C:\Windows\System32
<br />
<br />If you find Gdiplus.dll in that folder, you can safely delete that file and leave it in the recycle bin for a couple of days, once you are sure you have no problems with graphics, you can delete that permanently
