<h2>            My internet disconnects when my computer is in sleep mode. How do I prevent this&#63;</h2>
                    I'm running a minecraft server from my computer and I want it to run 24/7. When my computer goes into sleep mode though, my internet disconnects. I would like for this computer to go into sleep mode so that I don't use too much power, but how can I prevent
 my internet from disconnecting? Thanks.

            <p>Device Manager,&nbsp;&nbsp; Network adapter / Power management tab &nbsp;... you can uncheck allow sleep there.</p>
<p>But I don't think it will solve your problem because if your cpu and hard drive are sleeping, I doubt your minecraft will be online.</p>

            Mine is doing the same thing, but it didn't start out this way. &nbsp;There is some kind of computer setting that has changed and I just have to figure out what it is. &nbsp;I remember when I first connected to my network, it asked if I wanted to stay connected.
 &nbsp;Now it doesn't. &nbsp;Hope to find the answer somewhere before I really mess things up by changing my Service settings (already have).

                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm working with my TT eSPORTS Black Element mouse for a year without a problem. After the auto update of the 3/8/12 the mouse stop working. The mouse (in fact 2 new mouses) Just appears in the device manager with the code 10 error and i can't reinstall
 drivers, because is plug and play. There is no Drivers available. I bought a logitech new mouse and it works five minutes after plug the usb connector, and when the system says that it can't install the software for the new device, the mouse stop working.
 But i have an old usb trust mouse(the ball one, not laser or optic) and work fine instantly. I tried to restore to the day of the update, but an error don't let me restore the system. The Mouse TT eSports Works fine in any other PC and the New Logitech G300
 does it too. But in my Pc only work the old (And tiny). I tried to uninstall the device in the device manager and restart the computer, install it again and the same thing. In safe mode the same thing. But If i press F8 and choose Repair. the two mouses work
 fine in the selection screen. When i start windows again Nothing. The two new mouses stop working.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The old Trust has no Cd with drivers and Win 7 instantly detects it and works perfectly.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please, I've a lot of work &nbsp;in my computer and i can't reinstall the os. I need a solution to reinstall the Drivers that comes with windows but without installing windows again.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance</div>

Use system restore and go back to befoe you installed the updates and then control your own updates and install one at a time with reboots in-between and tests.&nbsp; You will either find the culprit or find there is none.

            Hi, thanks for reply.
<div><br />
<div>Like i say before the system don't let me restore because an unknown error. Restore is not an option. I've tried it from safe mode and console mode and is always the same thing. The instalation of the update is the only restore point i ha e, so it is not
 an option. But thanks any way!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think that this have to be with the generic controler for mouse within windows. Or something like that.</div>

            <p>It sounds, from what you say, that your data is not backed up, which is asking for trouble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If system restore doesnt function, then it would appear you have an underlying system problem</p>

            Hi Palcouk,
<div><br />
<div>Searching the web i found some similar cases and only one solved. The way they solved the problem was unplug the computer from power and unplug the Mother board battery too. I can't explain the reason but i will try when i get home.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It seems from what they said that the bios is envolved for any reason. I don't know way and has not any sense for me, but i'll try.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any way i'll post the result of this experiment and share with you guys. So our brains could keep growing up ;)&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't know why it should, but i hope it works</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks a lot</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>They all ‚Äòdo‚Äô different things, so don‚Äôt uninstall them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here are a few ways of freeing up disk space:</span></p>
<p><span>1. If your PC is behaving properly, you can remove the hidden Windows hotfix backup files that begin with $NTUninstallKB from the WINDOWS folder. Be aware that once they are removed you will not be able to uninstall the updates that they represent.</span></p>
<p><span>There are two ways to do it:</span></p>
<p><span>A. My preference is to run a script which additionally removes the corresponding entries in Add or Remove Programs. Once they are removed by the script, they cannot be restored. Create a system restore point first in case something goes wrong during
 the registry update, then download, extract and run this script </span><a href="http://www.dougknox.com/xp/utils/xp_hotfix_backup.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.dougknox.com/xp/utils/xp_hotfix_backup.htm</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>B</span><span>. Manually, but copy the folders to a CD/DVD first to allow their restoration should a fix need to be uninstalled at a later date. Now delete them from the \WINDOWS folder but leave the orphaned Add or Remove Programs entries intact.
 Only delete the $NTUninstallKB folders that relate to fixes not those for applications like Word, WMP, etc. Also, DO NOT DELETE THE $hf_mig$ folder.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Run Disk Cleanup to remove unwanted files by going to Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup. Then open</span><span> a Run window (Windows Logo key+R), type temp and press Enter. Delete everything that appears (there may
 be a few files that cannot be deleted, just ignore them). Repeat the command using %temp% in place of temp.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Reduce the space allocated to system restore, click Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; System Restore &gt; Settings (in the left pane) &gt; System Restore Tab &gt; Settings and in the left pane move the slider to the left to reduce the space
 allocated.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Reduce the space allocated to the Recycle Bin, right-click it, click Properties and change the amount of space allocated.</span></p>
<p><span>5. If you don't use Hibernation you can save almost the equivalent in hard drive space as RAM you have installed by turning it off, i.e. right-click Desktop, click Properties &gt; Screen Saver Tab &gt; Power at the bottom &gt; Hibernate Tab and remove the tick
 from ‚ÄòEnable Hibernation‚Äô.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Uninstall any programs that are no longer used. Also remove unwanted Windows components (in the left pane of Add or Remove Programs).</span></p>
<p><span>7. </span><span>Although not huge, you can delete all the files in C:\WINDOWS\PCHealth\HelpCtr\DataColl that have an extension of XML.
</span></p>
<p><span>8. If there are no outstanding errors, the Event Viewer log files can be deleted via Start &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Event Viewer &gt; highlight Application &gt; Action &gt; Clear All Events then click No to the
</span><span>‚Äú</span><span>Do you want to save..... </span><span>‚Äú</span><span> question. Repeat the above by highlighting and deleting the other categories: Security, System, Internet Explorer and Windows Power Shell.</span></p>
<p><span>9. </span><span>It may sound strange to install a program when you‚Äôre trying to save disk space, but download WinDirStat, which shows where disk space is being used, including a nice graphical display. Just let the mouse pointer hover over the coloured
 areas to identify different file types and large ‚Äòchunks‚Äô of used space. Download it here
</span><a href="http://windirstat.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windirstat.info/</span></a><span> Uninstall the program after you‚Äôve finished with it.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>These error code (</span>80071A30<span>) signifies that there are some damaged/corrupt System Files which is preventing the installation of the Update. Since you have already tried to run the Windows Update troubleshooter, let‚Äôs try the following steps
 and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check if you are able to access Windows Update services and also make sure that the following services are started. If it is not started follow the below mentioned steps:&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong>, type "<strong>services.msc</strong>" (without quotes) in start run box and&nbsp;press
<strong>Enter</strong>.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>b. Locate <strong>Windows Update</strong> service.</span></p>
<p><span>c. <strong>Right click </strong>on the Windows Update service and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. In <strong>Start-up type</strong>, select <strong>Enable</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Click <strong>Start</strong> under <strong>Service status</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>f. Click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>g. <strong>Repeat the steps c</strong> to f for the following <strong>services</strong> also:
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Background Intelligent Transfer Service &amp; Cryptographic Service.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If these steps do not help to resolve the issue, then you may proceed with the step mentioned below and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Step by step instructions to get the issue fixed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a) Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
b) On the open <strong>Command Prompt </strong>window <strong>copy and paste </strong>
the commands (all at once) <br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>net stop wuauserv<br />
<br />
net stop cryptSvc<br />
&nbsp;<br />
net stop bits<br />
<br />
net stop msiserver<br />
<br />
ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old<br />
<br />
ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old<br />
<br />
net start wuauserv<br />
<br />
net start cryptSvc<br />
<br />
net start bits<br />
<br />
net start msiserver</strong></span></p>
<p><span>c) Wait for the process to complete.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
d) Close the Command Prompt.<br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, try to install Windows Updates again and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>

            <p>Thanks. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1 doesn't work because there is no 'enabled' option to select,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried method 2 and it is now telling me that i have to download 770mb of updates. Do i presume that this method erases all existing updates? You should have told me that if that's the case; the updater is now stuck at 4%. So that hasn't helped at all and
 has possibly made things worse.</p>

            <p>I did already remove &amp; re-install sound card driver.</p>
<p>No error message most of play button are disable.</p>
<p>The problem was not after upgrading to windows 10. I was using windows 10 for many month now with no sound problem. My guess is that it start after an automated update...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The problem seems to be with the Windows audio service (or sub-service).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I just re-install windows 10 and the problem is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I need to re-install all my application,</p>

    <title>WSUS Offline Updates - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            WSUS Offline Updates</h2>
                    <p>I posted this question before, but did not fully understand the updates. I downloaded them from Dec 2013 but there were still approx. 170 updates still out there from MS. Correct me if I am in error, the only updates in the WSUS files are from the current
 month and if true, where do you download the entire MS updates for XP. When they no longer support it, I would like to have all the updates for XP and the installation software (update software). I know they would have to be installed in a certain order which
 I would hope the installation package would cover. I am sure I am not the only one looking for this.</p>

<p>I guess I did not explain myself very well and I apologize. All that works on my equipment, and BITS is functioning fine, I was more looking @ down the road when support is no longer available for XP. If I had to do a reinstall from the CD, where would I
 go to get all the (then current) updates.</p>

<br />
Bob, <br />
<br />
April 8 will be the final Patch Tuesday after which support ceases. <br />
<br />
What I suggest you do then is to slipstream your Windows XP installation CD with SP3 and all the patches and hotfixes which have been released. These will all be on your machine.
<br />
<br />
You'll forgive me I hope if I point you to this thread where I've explained how to perform that task. Saves me writing it out all over again:

            <p>If you don't have a wireless router you can use a wireless equiped (WiFi) Win 7 computer as a wireless router. Look at using either
<strong>Connectify</strong> or <strong>Virtual Router</strong> that will turn your wireless Win 7 computer (Home Premium or above) into a wireless router.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Update Error 0xC1900101 - 0x3000D &#124; Failed in FIRST BOOT during MIGRATE_DATA</h2>
                    <p>How do you fix the error "0xC1900101 - 0x3000D. The installation failed in FIRST BOOT during MIGRATE_DATA" in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update ISO? (please see image)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c8d31ab9-96e0-4290-b2f8-25e4e337ec5b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c8d31ab9-96e0-4290-b2f8-25e4e337ec5b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried installing the Anniversary update since it came out and all of them are unsuccessful. I have also posted a question to the community previously and that didn't get me anywhere. Now, I have tried upgrading again and, like my previous attempts,
 the upgrade failed. However, the Media Creation Tool (MDC) showed me an error message. Unlike my previous attempts, this is the first time that the MDC showed me an error message. Before posting this, I have searched the net for answers in solving the error
 and found quite a few in this community and from other sources. I'm planning to do the first reply to this post: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-10-update-error-0xc1900101-0x3000d/7381a7fc-48c6-4d5b-a17f-7bca28c8016c?tab=question&amp;status=AllReplies#tabs,
 and hope that it works.</p>

            <p>I have resolved my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did run chkdsk on my main C: drive but did not on my SDXC 128 gb card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is where I store my OneDrive personal and business files so I disabled&nbsp;OneDrive in "task manager / startup" and rebooted to stop OneDrive from accessing the drive during the repair.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I ran the Check Disk repair from the "properties / tools" menu of the SDXC drive.&nbsp;When the repair was finished, I then&nbsp;began the download of the Store Apps successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then re-enabled the OneDrive in "task manager / startup" and rebooted and tried to download another app and it worked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This article is where I got my idea that It might be the SDXC card. http://www.errorlive.com/error-code-0x80071ac3

            Hi,<br />
I had the same issue and here is what I did to solve my problem and hope it helps someone else in the future.&nbsp; If you disabled the Disk Defrag Schedule, then go back and enable it.&nbsp; It solved my problem and i've reported this bug to the Windows 7 team.

            I spent a few minutes and tracked down the problem and a solution. The issue is a result of task files which exist in the Tasks folders which have no entry in (presumably) in the registry. Here's how I worked through the issue - will take some time, but
 it has cleared up the issue completely for me:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Open Task Scheduler and click OK when prompted with the error. It may seem like you are receiving the same error over and over, but this is really due to the number of tasks which are broken. Make a note of the number of times you are prompted with the
<strong>the selected task</strong> "{0}" error. This is the number of task files that are out of sync with the registry.
</li><li>Start with the first folder under Windows tasks (Task Scheduler(Local)\Task Scheduler Library\Microsoft\Windows) and select each folder in turn until you receive the
<strong>the selected task</strong> "{0}" error. This folder contains files that are not in sync with the task scheduler.
</li><li>Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the tasks file folder (%SystemFolder%\Tasks\Microsoft\Windows) and find the folder which corresponds to the folder in which you received the error.
</li><li>For some tasks you will be able to determine which files need to be deleted by comparing the list in the Task Scheduler with the list of files in Explorer. Some tasks will only have a single file in explorer, or, in one case I had 2 and the first was missing.
 Once Task Scheduler encounters this error it will no longer display tasks so it makes the job of getting the two in sync a little more difficult. Once you have determined which files exist in the File Folder but do not exist in the Task Scheduler folder, delete
 those files. </li><li><strong>IMPORTANT</strong> - Close and Re-open Task Scheduler. Once the error is encountered, Task Scheduler no longer displays the tasks so you need to close it and restart in order to continue your synchronization effort.
</li><li>Continue to select folders in Task Scheduler under Windows tasks until you encounter the error again and repeat the process of determining which file exists on the file system, but not in Task Scheduler.
</li></ol>
I had 6 files that were out of sync with what was displayed in Task Scheduler. Once I deleted all of the offending files, Task Scheduler fired up without issue.<br />
<br />
Good luck.

<p>
</p><p>The "driver" for the Microsoft Sculpt keyboard is the "Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center," which is currently at version 3.2.&nbsp; You don't need this software for basic keyboard operation, so I suggest uninstalling it and see if that has any effect.</p>

<p>I doubt your doing anything wrong, if your able to play other games online to their fullest, however, I would insist that you open the correct Xbox live ports on your router. This will ensure you get the best possible connections as well as make sure you
 can connect to other people hosting games as well as see them in a populated servers list.</p>
<p><br />
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-CA/xbox-live/connecting/network-ports-used-xbox-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../network-ports-used-xbox-live</a></p>
<p><br />
The above link, will show you the correct ports that need to be open as well as some information on how to forward ports on most routers. Do keep in mind the game is one of the older titles on Live, so as you stated, there may not be that many if any people
 playing games online. A lot of people just like to mess around in worms games blowing up the levels rather than battling with people (even if teams) and or creating the own levels just for fun. I would just keep trying to play online during peak online hours
 and usually Friday - Sunday, would be your best chance of finding other players.</p>
<p><br />
Hope this helps. :)</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />Regarding your question:
<br />
<br />I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below:

<br />
<br />2. Try to add the Bluetooth device again.

    <title>Canon LBP2900&#58; Cannot Recognize the USB Connection &#40;After - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jiana de guzman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Canon LBP2900&#58; Cannot Recognize the USB Connection &#40;After multiple tries&#41;</h2>
                    <p>When I first installed the driver (which I got from the Canon Website) for the Canon LBP 2900, it worked properly. I uninstalled it for a time because it could not print my files. It said something like, "Could not print. No pages selected." Then when I
 am trying to install it again, it can not recognize the USB Connection after multiple tries (plugging the cable in and out; turning off and on the laptop). But when in another laptop (Windows 7) it installed smoothly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why? How may I fix this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>What happens when you try to install the driver? Do you receive any error&nbsp;message/code?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Printing problems can be caused by cables that aren't connected properly, problems with wireless adapters or settings, damaged or incompatible printer drivers, or
 missing updates. I would suggest you to visit printer manufacturer website and install the latest driver in compatibility mode and check if it helps.</span></span></p>

<p>And to be quit truthful, unless you have an actual issue, I'd avoid them. Most just end up causing more problems than they solve.</p>
<p>Windows 10 already has a hard drive defragmenter tool so you don't need that.</p>

<h2>            File explorer slow &#40;working on it...&#41;, icons not loading and Indexing Option not responding</h2>
                    <p>Good Day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop ASUS ROG - GL552VW was recently attacked with a virus that installed different apps on the computer and adwares on the browsers. I have cleaned up the system but now, I have this error on my file explorer. I couldn't find a workaround to help me
 with this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0cfabb74-2b64-499b-9b0c-a5c5715143f9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0cfabb74-2b64-499b-9b0c-a5c5715143f9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked other forums but i have not found anything that could help me with the problem. I also noticed this other problem with my Indexing Option.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I've tried using the steps from this forum as well:&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/file-explorer-slow-working-on-it-icons-not-loading/b6c3891f-89fe-42d5-866a-0579876013cd and a few other sites. I have tried a clean boot
 but the problem was still occuring. It seems like the problem is still there when I use the safe mode option. The file explorer and indexing option still has these errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the Event Viewer and these are the errors I've gotten:</p>
