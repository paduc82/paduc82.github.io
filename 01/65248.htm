            <p>Found the answer on Brookstone's site under IConvert 600 dpi USB Scanner...manuals</p>
<p>If you are a Windows 7 user..</p>
<p>go to Computer, Properties cick on Device Manager....In Device Manager, right click on 600 dpi Bus scanner under other devices, select Update Driver Software.&nbsp; click on Browse my computer for driver software, then click browse.</p>
<p>In "Browse for Folder" select folder that contains this scanner driver and click ok to return to previous screen</p>
<p>Cleck on the next button in the window that appears and skip to finishing the install</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this is in manual I got downloaded and helped me, hope it helps you</p>

<h2>            can I re-install Windows XP without losing everything else on the drive&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    My system restore quit working and I've tried just about everything with no luck, now I'm thinking about re-installing my Windows XP from the original disk I got when I bought this computer, I know I will lose all of the Windows 'updates' if I do this
 but will I also lose any/all of my other files/programs on that drive?

<h2>            Help&#33; My windows update doesn&#39;t seem to be doing anything&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I heard about the windows ten update, and that there was a thing on your taskbar to click, but I don't have it. I then found out you need to update windows to have it. I checked my windows update and I have a ton of stuff:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update for Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems (KB2976978)<br />
<br />
Update for Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems (KB3035583)<br />
</p>
<p>Update for Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems (KB3060383)<br />
</p>
<p>I've gotten the error 80073712 a few times, and I have no clue what it means.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are all "important" and "reccomended", so I tried downloading them. First I tried at around 9:00 last night, and it said 5%. I stopped downloading and tried again this morning at 9:15 till around 11:00. It stayed at 0%. I have no clue what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have 10 "optional" updates that won't download either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Try picking one and installing only that.&nbsp; When this happened to me that's what I did.&nbsp; I don't know if the first one reflects that it is a pre-req for the others or not but installing it and rebooting for it then somehow magically made all the others work
 normally.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, another thing I found on a separate occasion is that some updates do not get properly applied unless we allow updates to happen automatically.&nbsp; E.g. trying to take manual control might cause a problem because the reboot that is supposed to apply them
 does not recognize that that is why the system is being rebooted.</p>

<p>Did you try switching to full automatic updates?&nbsp; Any specific clues in ReportingEvents.log?&nbsp; You may have a corrupted SoftwareDistribution folder.&nbsp; So downloading and running the Windows Update troubleshooter may help change that cause.</p>

            I ran the troubleshooter and it found a few things and fixed them, and then I turned the update settings to automatic. I'm a little uncertain about the automatic though, will it just install the updates then tell me to restart whenever it's done?

<p>
</p><p>Seems to.&nbsp; You will also notice the labels in the Shut down menu may change from time to time.&nbsp;&nbsp;It definitely doesn't just reboot without warning if that is your concern.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What bothers me about it is that I feel I don't have as good an understanding of what it has been doing, in particular whether it is reapplying stuff that has already supposedly been applied.&nbsp; That is something that I was much more readily aware of when
 I was using the download automatically and prompt option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I had to switch is that some Surface firmware updates were not getting properly applied.&nbsp; Turns out that there were a lot more things that weren't properly applied too.&nbsp; So, I guess the most significant thing about the change is that you are giving
 AU more awareness of restart.&nbsp; That seems like a defect to me but I guess I can't complain too much if it works better when run as designed.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Did you try comparing what it has done lately with what it was doing before you made your change?&nbsp; Also, use the ReportingEvents.log as the base for a similar comparison.&nbsp; Sounds like something's happening but you're not sure whether anything
<p>
</p><p>BTW have you tried downloading and using the Windows Update troubleshooter?&nbsp; I think it essentially does an enforced script of various suggestions that have been made about resetting WU/AU over the years--including some really ridiculous regsvr32 commands
 but if it would at least clean out your SoftwareDistribution directory that might provide a better starting point for any

            The error is usually 80073712, which it has done since the beginning, although some optional ones have 80240054. I have run the troubleshooter, and every time it has found and "fixed" a few things.

<p>
</p><p>0x80240054 is one of those codes which don't have&nbsp;public documentation.&nbsp; All we know about it is that it fits in this category:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/938205?SmcNavTabIndex=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/938205?SmcNavTabIndex=0</a>
</p>
<p>0x80240FFF WU_E_UNEXPECTED An operation failed due to reasons not covered by another error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, CBS.log or even WindowsUpdate.log might clarify what the code represents, though I would not expect it to really show a problem cause.&nbsp; In order to get that I would try running ProcMon to capture any file and registry events which preceded its generation.</p>

Hi</p>

<p>This should give you a clue that disk optimizers simply do not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They not only do not work, but they can cause irreparable damage to your computer.</p>

<br />You can remove an account from a family group. The account will still exist, but it won't have the benefits or restrictions it had within the family group. To remove a member from your family group, you must have an adult account, and be the one who gave consent.

            I'm not surprised you are having trouble with Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1709, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network 
<br />If that does not work, I recommend you try two things 
<br />First: Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />When complete, restart then check if you can sleep and wake. 
<br />
<br />Second option 
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work, well, we need to try something else. Try resetting the BIOS:

</p><p>I have a Toshiba satellite L445D-S5976 that came with windows 7 home premium. I upgraded it to windows 8 and&nbsp;then 8.1 pro 32 bit. When I had windows 7 I was able to play Minecraft, but when I upgraded to Windows 8 it said I have a outdated graphics driver.
 I know that I have an&nbsp;ATI Radeon 3100 integrated graphics but I don't have the drivers for it and the AMD catalyst control center does not help.

<h2>            Deleting ESO Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>Good Evening Xbox ESO forum,</p>
<p>I have been receiving multiple game play errors from ESO on XBOX ONE and have found the only solution to possibly be deleting the game off the console and reinstalling the game. Does this remove the characters I have created and
 played because I have two veteran ranked toons already.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please ADVISE&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure, however those characters are saved to your eso account that you created. If you sign back in to that account those characters should be there. I think they will be fine, but again I'm not entirely sure.</p>

<p>Navigate to where the game is stored. You can do this several ways, the easiest is to choose the 'My Games &amp; Apps' tile, then navigate to the games section.</p>
<p>Once there, highlight the ESO tile, then press the menu button.</p>
<p>Select "Manage Game". This will bring up the option to uninstall.</p>
<p>When you select uninstall, it will bring up a screen that should have both your game and your game save data listed as separate files. Simply choose the game file. This will uninstall only the game. Your save data will remain unless you choose to uninstall
 it. </p>

            Have you tried the freeware IrfanView for viewing your animated .gif files?<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
IrfanView and IrfanView Plug-ins<br />
<a href="http://www.download.hr/download-irfanview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.download.hr/download-irfanview.html</a><br />
(scroll down slightly for the download links)<br />
(get the plug-ins too)<br />
<br />
To view .gif thumbs open IrfanView and go to...File / Thumbnails...and<br />
navigate to the folder the .gif files are archived in. Double left click a<br />
.gif to see it animate in the main view window.<br />
<br />
Also there's a free download at the following link that may be worth a try:<br />
<br />
(See the post from Corgano)<br />

<br />
Just download the 'gifview.exe' file to your desktop and drag/drop<br />
a .gif on the executable to launch it.<br />

</p><p>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the exact issue you are facing with Cortana as it is not clearly explained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you not able to sign in or is&nbsp;Cortana not singing a song or something else?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Then try to install&nbsp;Windows updates.</p>

            <p>At least 3 windows services are awol</p>
<p>Please only follow my guidance and do the following, as a start:<br />
Download and <strong>SAVE</strong> the following registry files to either your DESKTOP or to a unique folder</p>
<p><a href="http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/win-services/vista/BITS.reg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/win-services/vista/BITS.reg</a><br />
<a href="http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/win-services/vista/SharedAccess.reg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/win-services/vista/SharedAccess.reg</a><br />
<a href="http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/win-services/vista/wuauserv.reg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/win-services/vista/wuauserv.reg</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One by one, for each reg file, do a Right-click on it and then select <strong>
MERGE</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>When that's done, Logoff and restart the system fresh.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Vista is reloaded and ready, do a <strong><em>new run of FSS.exe</em></strong>&nbsp; and copy and paste back here the new FSS.txt</p>
<p>Tell me what your antivirus program is.<br />
Tell me when you did the last full system scan with it.</p>
<p>Be very aware that when you have missing Windows services, like this, it could well be the telltale sign of a malware infection.<br />
Also, tell me if you have used any sort of registry "cleaner", "tweaker", "optimizer", etc.....<br />
Often, a registry cleaner will do more harm than good.</p>

    <title>CD&#47;DVD Tray Button Not Working &#40;Tray Will Not Open&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bbildman  say:</h3>
<h2>            CD&#47;DVD Tray Button Not Working &#40;Tray Will Not Open&#41;</h2>
                    The button that opens my CD tray stopped working, and the tray does not open. The CD/DVD is missing from y Device Manager, I have removed the Upperfilters and lowerfilters from the registry.<br />
<br />
The only place where the button works to open the tray is in the BIOS screen and BEFORE the Microsoft Logo appears in the boot sequence. Any time after that the tray is non functional.<br />
<br />
I think it's a hardware problem, maybe related to the FSB on the motherboard, but want to make sure before I address this as a hardware issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any replies.

<p><span><span>Hi Bbildman,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try to remove CD/DVD burning softwares from your computer and<span>
</span>see if the issue persists. Also check from the manufacturer’s website if there are any firmware updates available. Then, download the latest drivers and install it on your computer.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This should hopefully fix the issue.</span></span></p>

    <title>Xbox One Not Updating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xxxneedles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Not Updating</h2>
                    <p>Our original Xbox One (2013) has had an issue over the past few months that has now caused it to not be able to update anymore</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem was that when we would turn the console off, it wouldn't turn back on unless we unplugged it from the wall for a few minutes or so.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This wasn't a big problem until an update came along that required a reboot of the console to finish installing. Once the console would automatically begin the process of rebooting it wouldn't actually be able to turn itself back on. This means that the
 only way to turn the console back on would be for us to unplug it and manually turn it on. Since we have to unplug the Xbox from the wall to successfully turn it back on, the update will cancel and it will ask for us to update it again when we turn it back
 on thus repeating the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since we can't install this update, the console won't connect to WiFi and most games will not launch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If there would be anyway to fix this problem we would greatly appreciate the assistance. Thanks!</p>

    <title>Xbox One wifi adapter driver does not show up anywhere in device - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> misc-13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One wifi adapter driver does not show up anywhere in device manager after windows update</h2>
                    <p>I have two windows computers: my desktop which has a year old install of windows and recently updated, and my laptop which have multiple windows updating problems so it usually gets updated much later if at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My xbox one wifi adapter worked on both computers flawlessly. I bought this adapter just two months ago. My desktop then had a required windows update and now the wifi adapter WILL NOT AT ALL show in device manager nor work whatsoever on that computer. I've
 tried finding a solution online; all require that it is listed. I've tried manually installing the driver to no luck either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried updating the device through my laptop, but it claims to be up to date. I need help. If anyone had this problem or knows how to fix it please. Or if Microsoft caused this issue, to please fix this immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need this fixed now before my work computer, which I need my xbox controller for testing, also updates and completely loses the VERY NEW device that I bought for the sole intention of using my controller on a pc.</p>

<p>I have been to that page, but I can't use it because it does not show at all in device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i can't uninstall because I can't select it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>device manager doesn't give me anything to fix it because it isn't even aware it's plugged even though the USB ports are in complete working order. There is nothing wrong with my computer.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Paul from Xbox Forums Team here to assist, based on the information provided the final suggestion would be to check and see if there is a local Microsoft store near you to see if they can troubleshoot the device.&nbsp; Please let us know what they say, I would

<p>Edit: Randomly it started working showing up again. The wireless adapter showed up on device manager, I was able to unintsall and then plugged it back in to set itself back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless the Microsoft store is able to fix the windows update (because only computers on the newest windows updated have this problem). They can't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my laptop can recognize the device immediately. My desktop used to until the windows update. Now the desktop can't see the device, but my laptop still can.</p>

<p>Hiya, Misc!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul from Xbox Forums Team here again, I see the information you provided and I'm glad to hear it's showing up again. That means that we can try this troubleshooting step to see if it'll fix the issue. Here are the steps to take to try and troubleshoot the
 device. I hope you find this information useful.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
The adapter was working but isn't responding now </p>
<div>
<p>If your adapter was installed and working, but it did not respond after waking your computer, this may be because your USB controller doesn't have Wake on Wireless turned on by default. This can typically be managed by the USB controller driver.
</p>
<p>There are two solutions to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>While your Windows 10 device is running, unplug the device, and then plug it back in.
</li><li>If that didn't work, you can adjust the properties to enable <strong>Wake on Wireless</strong>. In the Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows Properties window, make sure to select
<strong>Allow the device to wake the computer</strong>. To do so, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Go to your <strong>Device Manager</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>Wireless Adapter for Windows</strong> in the <strong>Network adapters</strong> section.
</li><li>Click <strong>Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows</strong> to bring up the Properties window.
</li><li>Click the <strong>Power Management</strong> tab. </li><li>Select <strong>Allow this device to wake the computer</strong>, and then select
<strong>OK</strong>. </li></ol>

<div>Today I had a "bad pool caller" blue screen of death. I wanted to find the dump file and post a link here so that someone could analyze it, but when I looked for it the last existing dump file was from January 31st. I thought a dump file was supposed to
 be generated after every BSOD. If I'm right about that, what could have prevented my laptop from doing it? I've had a couple of Microsoft support engineers access my laptop remotely to troubleshoot (and fix) other errors since January 31st, but I can't imagine
 that the Microsoft guys would have disabled memory dumps, and I certainly haven't.</div>

<h2>            Skype Audio Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I updated skype to the new (8.29) but I still have the same problem I had since skype 8.x appeared:<br />
I have multiple audio cards, yhecomputer built in one and a bluetooth headset. While in the previous version of Skype I could choose to have skype ring on the computer speakers and have the conversation routed through the blurtooth headset, that possibility
 in now non-existent.<br />
I need a way to have the samesettings as I did before, as I can't just wear my headphones all day long to answer calls and Isimply can't use the computer built in speakers and microphone to have a conversation for privacy issues.</p>
<p>Please, make skype great again and fix this issue (and plase... I'd like to see less emoji and more usability... it's a way to phone and videocall people, not a chat...).</p>

    <title>erratic window movement - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bee111133  say:</h3>
<h2>            erratic window movement</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new hp laptop that was checked out by an hp tech just yesterday, so I don't think this is a hardware, malware or virus issue. I am working in Windows 10 / Firefox / Yahoo. When I have more than one window open, the windows "jump around" in
 erratic ways. Sometimes one window jumps in front of another with no input from me. Sometimes one or more of the windows minimizes itself and goes back to the taskbar. Sometimes if I have 3 windows open (overlapped) they will suddenly reduce in size and line
 up in the middle of the screen.&nbsp; I have tried all the settings I can think of, from mouse speed to keyboard to cursor, and nothing seems to help. I also read several items in this forum and understand there was a "Snap" setting in Windows 8. If this is happening
 in W10, how can I turn it off?&nbsp; Let me say, I have moved from an old laptop with touchpad and the open windows worked fine, so I don't think I am doing anything differently as I type, like&nbsp; accidentally touching the pad.
</p>
<p>I also find that as I am looking at a web page and so much as run my cursor NEAR a different link, that window pops open in another tab and I am constantly jumping back and forth to close the unwanted ones. As I said, I have adjusted pointer to be fairly
 slow but it still seems too sensitive. Any suggestions?</p>
