<h2>            Trouble with System Restore</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I had been having trouble with malware, which I think I have removed with helpful advice from your website. However usually when this happens I am able to use System Restore. But this time System Restore would not work. Instead I get Windows Updates on a
 regular basis, which one cannot go back to, instead of System Restore points. </p>
<p>Has Microsoft dropped this facility? Or has my system changed because I started using Windows Firewall instead of Windows Defender, which now won‚Äôt open?

<p>How have you determined that the computer is no longer infected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender is an anti-spyware application. Windows Firewall is, er..., a
<em>firewall</em>. The former cannot replace the latter &amp; <em>vice versa</em>.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your reply and prompt response. </p>
<p>I have just tried putting Windows Defender on again but it states ‚Äòa problem caused this program to stop.‚Äô The advice to Start now and Restart‚Äô does not cure the problem.</p>
<p>‚ÄòUpdate Status: The program can‚Äôt download definition updates. </p>
<p>Error found:0x80004004. Operation aborted.</p>
<p>Windows 10 couldn‚Äôt be installed: C1900101: Windows update encounter an unknown error.‚Äô</p>
<p>Failed one update. Previous updates OK:</p>
<p>I tried System Restore on different dates back to August but this failed because ‚Äòfailed to extract original copy of the directory from the restore point. Source %System Root%\registration. Destination ComPlusStaging.‚Äô</p>
<p>The problem seems to have occurred since I was offered Windows 10 on July 30<sup><span>th</span></sup> and told my computer was suitable. However Windows 10 could not be downloaded so Microsoft reloaded my Windows 7 with changes to
 appearance.</p>
<p>The only problem is the loss of Windows Defender but I suppose I could reboot with my original Windows 7 disc and start again.</p>
<p>I would be grateful however if you had an easier answer to this.</p>

<p>Did you contact Microsoft's Answer Desk (<a href="http://www.answerdesk.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.answerdesk.com</a>) for assistance and did one of the Answer Desk techs "reload" Win7 for you?</p>

<p>Thanks for the follow up. No, I didn‚Äôt think of any of these things. But I inadvertently found and downloaded Microsoft Security Essentials which I am in the process of trying instead. I would be happy to know if you think this is adequate security. Windows
 Defender is stubbornly still off. I shall try a Win7 reload if issues are not resolved.

<p>If Windows Defender wasn't working properly, chances are Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) won't install and/or work properly either, Rosemary.</p>

<p>When I open it MSE writes ‚ÄòYour PC is being monitored and protected‚Äô so I suppose that means Windows Defender is now superfluous. I found MSE when I looked for a system restore point because Microsoft had recently put it in as an update there. MSE also made
 a full scan and found a virus and reported to Microsoft on errors. Perhaps I will wait and see how things pan out and return to your good advice above if things go pear shaped again. Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>Is KB2990214 listed as a failed update in your Update History and if so, on what date did it (first) failed to install?</p>

<p>I have found KB2990214 which was put in April.</p>

<p>How many people (e.g., kids; grandkids; friends) use your computer?</p>
</strong>
<p>My grandchildren only stayed a week and put my computer online on Wi-Fi some years ago. I transferred it to broadband. I had no problems then.</p>
<strong>
<p>Do you have a password-protected User Account or can anyone just turn on your computer and use it (kinda like a toaster)?</p>
</strong>
<p>I have divided my computer into user accounts, Adminstrator (passworded) and my own account. I closed my husband‚Äôs account because he had AppIntegrator problems and is away at present. I did not have a problem on my account but the AppIntegrator problem
 was on the Admin account.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt appear to be having any problems with the computer at the moment other than I cannot use system restore and windows defender is turned off for some reason.&nbsp; The AppIntergrator problem has not reappeared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MSE seems to be doing a good job of removing malware etc. and looks more sophisticated than Windows&nbsp;Defender.&nbsp; System Restore needs to have a restore point before it can work.</p>

<h2>            Windows XP&#58; What&#39;s the difference between NTFS and NTFS Quick Format&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I'm and going to reinstall XP on my computer, and I got to the format part, and O was wondering if I should do an NTFS quick or normal format. There is no FAT quick or normal format. Just NTFS. I'm kind of wondering which one I should do.

</blockquote>
<p>Andrew, please see JW Stuart's link in this thread to learn about the difference between "full" and "quick" formatting. It's significantly more than just the time element.&nbsp; A hard drive
<em>can</em> be quick-formatted.&nbsp; The options of "full" and "quick" are available for any medium that must be formatted.&nbsp;&nbsp;

</p><p>Thanks for your post! If there are any issues with the Forza Hub, it would be best to check out the

<p>Yes GTA 5 will run on Win10, but it does have high system requirements.</p>
<p>It will run on the HD 620 @ 1024x768 resolution, but is described as not playable in the review below.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It does not matter which version of Windows you use. Your system specs would still be too low for smooth game play.</p>

<h3> godhack  say:</h3>
<h2>            Epson Scan to PC function dont work on Windows 64-bit.</h2>
                    How can I get the function "Scan to PC" multifunction Epson Styius SX550W??!? placed in a scanner Epson Styius SX550W document, press the button "Scan", choose the function "Scan to PC", below, in the list that appears - the name of the laptop on which
 you want to scan and save the document. The screen on Epson Styius SX550W message appears: "Scanning ..." After ~ 30 seconds. And then on the screen Epson Styius SX550W receive the following message: "Communication error. Make sure your computer is connected."
 If I bypass the function "Scan to PC" (put the document into the scanner Epson Styius SX550W, go to my laptop, run the "Epson Scan") - a document is scanned and stored. PS: the function "Scan to PC" does not work via WiFi b \ g, or a USB connection on all
 devices. Installing software and drivers from CD that came with the Epson Styius SX550W performed with Administrtor and turn on Firewall, KIS2010, and when turned off (as well as subsequent testing efficiency function "Scan to PC")

<p>Xbox One Play &amp; Charge Kit&nbsp;</p>
<p>yes the good old charge kit.</p>
<p>The cable is bad... so poorly made.</p>
<p>I have have had to replace mine 3 times now</p>
<p>Microsoft needs to make a better quality cable all it takes is a tiny nudge while plugged in to break the connectors inside making the cable useless.</p>
<p>All it takes it a tiny pet to put there paw on the connector while plugged into the controller to break the thing, That's how mine broke the first time.</p>
<p>I have had 3 friends also with this issue and I am very surprised to not find an Issue about this year, yet i can find Youtube videos on it.</p>



<p>Microsoft needs to Recall these crap cables and replace them with a better manufactured cable.</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>personally I've had my cable for over 2 years and it still works, if you believe that the cables are of low quality then feel free to purchase any other brand of "USB to micro usb" cable which works just the same.</p>

<p>Well DUH, I have 4...</p>
<p>The point is they are selling these low quality cables knowing how bad they are.</p>
<p>the metal connector only does into the plastic base a few milometers, The slightest bend from picking up the controller snaps the connectors in the base off making it useless.
</p>
<p>I have had 3 now all broken and swapped out at the Microsoft Store. </p>
<p>First time a 5 punt cat got curious and stepped on it</p>
<p>Second time the cable bent while sitting in my bean bag chair, No physical contact needed to break it the angle of the bed being abou 50 degrees did it.
</p>
<p>Third I picked up my elite controller the wrong way the cable connector hit my wrist and bent BROKEN again.</p>
<p>I did not write this post to get Feedback from other users, This is for Microsoft Official to see that they need to do something about it.</p>
<p>I have still never used the cable that came with my elite controller but it is of similar design minus the LED indicator for charging. it is that indicator and the hidden gear to make it function that makes this version of the charging cable so faulty.</p>

            <p>I totally agree with you. I have a box filled with broken and useless cables that all fell victim to the slightest nudge. I even stopped buying Xbox&nbsp;own brand of Plug and Play for a more durable design of USB to Micro USB cable and even that fell victim to a slight nudge.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>The problem lies with the design chosen for the new style charger that came with the conception of Xbox One which was the adoption of a micro USB port. On the Xbox 360 controller the charger was of its own unique design where by it fastened to the controller snug and securely and even became part of the controllers ergonomics.</p><p><br /></p><p>Now however we have a protruding micro USB connector in the most vulnerable of places without any thought of reinforcement being applied in the design. This wreaks of known negligence on Microsoft's behalf where by profit is increased by customers being forced into buying yet another Plug and Play kit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I have now taken it upon myself to

            <p><span>Hi Jose,</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the post. I understand that when you the Desktop Internet Explorer, you are able to connect to the Internet however when you
 use the active tiles the message ‚ÄúNot connected to Internet‚Äù is displayed. Correct me if my understanding is wrong.</span></p>
<p><span>Try the methods and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you boot the computer with Safe mode with Networking and check if the same issue occurs.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Follow these steps, check if the issue persists in safe mode.</span></p>
<p>
<span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Insert the Windows 8 Release Preview Installation Disc, click on Repair your System.</span></p>
<p>
<span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click on Advanced Startup Options.</span></p>
<p>
<span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click on Windows Startup Settings.</span></p>
<p>
<span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select Safe Mode with Networking and then press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>Run the app troubleshooter and check in Normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Download and run the Modern UI App troubleshooter and check.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</span></a></p>

<p>the methods you mentioned above didn't help solve the problem. it still persists. my active tiles (including news, people, etc. etc. are showing the updates on the live tile but if I open the program, it says trouble in syncing... also my internet explorer
 app says not connected to internet (and its set as&nbsp;the default browser) but opens the same in desktop mode properly... my store app has also stopped working... it says not connected to internet. no use pressing on try again...</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 connecting to wifi network but drops Internet connection after a short while</h2>
                    <p>I recently tried upgrading to Windows 10 but decided to downgrade back down to Windows 7. Since then, I've been having issues with maintaining an internet connection through wifi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually when I start my computer, my wifi connection is fine and things look normal. But, within several minutes (anywhere from 5 to 15) my internet connection drops while I'm still connected to wifi network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The troubleshooter tool advises that this could be caused by the router losing its internet connection, but I that's not the case because I have other computers and devices on the same network that have no problem with internet access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 and my drivers are updated.</p>

            <p>Here's how:</p>
<p>
<em><strong>Win10 back to Win7</strong></em>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>Copy&nbsp;your data off first.&nbsp; If you can not boot your system, remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer‚Äôs drive testing software.</p>
<p>Read Woody Leonhard‚Äôs advice first, to see if you can complete the restoration without a re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3033806/microsoft-windows/how-to-roll-back-your-windows-10-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>However, if you are unable to make the reversion back to Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should do a complete re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; In the install process, it is called a ‚ÄúCustom‚Äù install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need a Win7 install disk.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.&nbsp; If that disk has SP1
 (Service Pack 1) on it, it will save you many hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NEVER install anything but Windows Updates until your system is up to date.&nbsp; Once you have the update list, install all of them together.&nbsp; Installing updates in batches will not speed the process or make it better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot your system to the Windows 7 install disk.&nbsp; When it asks where to store the system, click Advanced.&nbsp; Delete all partitions. Proceed with the install until you get your new desktop.</p>
<p>Change Windows Update setting to Never check for updates.&nbsp; This is the setting you will keep.</p>
<p>Download and install the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>KB3020369</strong> Win-7 32 https://download.microsoft.com/download/C/0/8/C0823F43-BFE9-4147-9B0A-35769CBBE6B0/Windows6.1-KB3020369-x86.msu<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46827" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">id=46827;</span></a></li><li>Win-7 64 bit <a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/5/D/0/5D0821EB-A92D-4CA2-9020-EC41D56B074F/Windows6.1-KB3020369-x64.msu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>Now proceed to Windows Update and begin the update process.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">before</span></strong> </em>any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">+</span></strong></em>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive,
 you will have a precise duplicate of your system as it was at time you made this image.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for <strong>PLUS</strong> R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Prevent Windows 10</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>If you&nbsp;do <em><strong>not</strong> </em>want Windows 10 and wish to prevent it from being installed on your computer, follow this exactly as laid out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have followed the procedure below, and set Windows update to <em><strong>NEVER</strong></em>, once a month, start Windows Update manually, check for updates.&nbsp; When you get the list of ‚Äúimportant‚Äù updates, right-click and choose
<strong>hide</strong> on EVERY update in the Windows grouping that does not describe itself as Security.&nbsp; Allow the Malicious software removal tool or any C++ updates.&nbsp; Do not use ANY optional updates or place a checkmark in any unchecked updates.&nbsp; Proceed
 to update.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><em><strong>You must adopt a protective stance to prevent your Windows 7 system from becoming something you do not want.</strong></em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3043656/microsoft-windows/first-aid-for-forced-windows-10-upgrades.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.infoworld.com/article/3043656/microsoft-windows/first-aid-for-forced-windows-10-upgrades.html</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Change the Windows Update Setting to <em><strong>Never check for updates</strong></em>.&nbsp; Once a month,&nbsp;about 2 days after the 2nd Tuesday, they receive an email from me advising to manually start WU and then hide every update except for ones specifically
 labeled Security.&nbsp; In other words, only security updates will be applied.&nbsp; In all of 2015 and since, there was not a single update that&nbsp; improved Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some may feel uncomfortable with the setting ‚Äî NEVER.&nbsp; Well you needn‚Äôt be.&nbsp; Never means you are never giving Microsoft a chance to decide what you download and install.&nbsp; It should NOT mean you will never update.&nbsp; The difference is that now you take control
 and the responsibility of updating of Windows and Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read Woody Leonhard (one of the most respected writers in the trade)&nbsp; <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2983777/microsoft-windows/how-to-clean-the-windows-10-crapware-off-your-windows-7-or-81-pc.html?nsdr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 have Windows 7, keep it, you are better off by far.</p>

<p>
</p><p><em><strong>The following process will remove those features which you do not need.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>This process works, but it only works if you do all the steps and do them in order.</em></strong></p>
<p>

<li>Take Windows Update off automatic ‚Äî <strong><em>Never</em></strong> <em><strong>check for updates</strong></em></li><li>Windows Update, Installed updates, WAIT a long time till you see the green bar complete its long trip to the right</li><li>Now, search for each of the listed updates, uninstall them.&nbsp; You must wait until the list is re-created each time. You need to wait till you see the number at the bottom of the search window exceed a few hundred.</li><li>If there are others you want to uninstall, click Later</li><li>Then, clear the search box and after the list is again displayed (the number at the bottom again exceeds several hundred), enter another KB number.</li><li>Restart the PC.&nbsp; It may take a long time to process this.</li></ol>
<p><em>If you choose ‚Äúcheck for updates, but let me choose whether to download and install them‚Äù, Microsoft will download ‚Äúimportant‚Äù updates like KB3035583 to your computer.&nbsp; It will be pre-checked ‚Äî selected.&nbsp; Unless you check Windows Update (WU)&nbsp;and discover

            <p>Hello Neil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you getting the same error when you access the External Hard drive on another computers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you see the message "Device is Write Protected", then it indicates that you have limited set of privileges for performing operation on the Hard disk. In simple, you're not allowed to write the drive, apart from reading it. This because the drive is
 write-protected. Suggest you to try with the below steps and check it they help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Right-click on <strong>Start</strong> button and select <strong>Command Prompt(Admin).</strong></p>
<p>2. Type <strong>diskpart</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Now type <strong>list volume</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>. Now see the volume number the external drive.</p>
<p>4. Then type <strong>select volume #</strong>, where # is the number of the drive which is showing "write-protected" error. Example,
<strong>select volume 3</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Type <strong>attributes disk clear readonly</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Executing the above command line will reset the Hard drive USB's properties&nbsp;by&nbsp;clearing the Read-Only behavior,&nbsp;so that it is no longer read-only.</li></ul>
<p>6. Type <strong>exit</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>. Now check if it allows you do access the drive for writing the content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if you require further assistance.</p>

    <title>how to clean junk files from D Drive on windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lee mclaughlin  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to clean junk files from D Drive on windows 10</h2>
                    Hello, I was wondering what to do about my D drive on windows 10? It appears to be full. It is completely blue so how do I clean it? Do I put in a CD ? I am new to 10 from using vista. Frankly I prefer vista over 10 any day of the week. Do to the fact
 Microsoft basically makes you buy new stuff whether you need it or not, or they won't support you.&nbsp; Anyway can someone tell me how or what to do with this mess? I quite pissed of with MS. Not supporting a program that you pay money for just because they want
 more money. My Vista was 64 bit and just as fast or maybe faster than windows 10. Yet I had to get this mess.

<h3> ahmed hawwari  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing the Display Language of Windows Pro Problem</h2>
                    After updating my <strong>windows 10 pro</strong>, the system has changed the display language to the original language of the system (which is the language that I used&nbsp;when&nbsp;I installed the system for the first time). After the update, I downloaded the&nbsp;<strong>English(US)</strong>&nbsp;language&nbsp;<strong>again</strong>,
 and I tried to make it the display language of the system, but I&nbsp;<strong>couldn't&nbsp;</strong>find the '<strong>Set as primary</strong>' button. and when I go to the control panel I&nbsp;<strong>couldn't&nbsp;</strong>find the&nbsp;<strong>language icon</strong>&nbsp;either. so
 how can I fix this and set the English(US) as the primary language of the system?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bca2d1f1-eb22-4ad7-b536-59d2e42962f0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bca2d1f1-eb22-4ad7-b536-59d2e42962f0?upload=true" /></a>

            Hi Ahmed.
<br />
<br />Try to do this through PowerShell.
<br />
<br />- Start the PowerShell Console with administrator. 
<br />
<br />- Type C:\Script\ChangeSystemDisplayLanguage.ps1 -AvailableLanguage in the Windows PowerShell Console.
<br />This command line shows how to list all the installed system languages in Windows.
<br />
<br />- Type C:\Script\ChangeSystemDisplayLanguage.ps1 ‚ÄìSetLanguage "en-us" in the Windows PowerShell Console.
<br />This command line shows what if we change default language to English (en-us).
<br />

<h2>            Unable to connect to Wi-Fi</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I read about the limited access for wifi, am I correct in understanding that I now cannot go connect to a wifi like a hotel, library or such without upgrading their wifi?&nbsp; I am very sorry I tried windows 10 and did not know that I only had 30 days to
 go back to previous version without major hassle!&nbsp; When you go on vacation or out of town on business, you do not know all windows 10 is needing to know to connect to a wifi available in a hotel.&nbsp; No easy fix, now I am stuck or I have to pay someone to help
 get me back to previous version.&nbsp; No bonus points from me on this one!</p>

            <p>Hi Jean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li><li>Do you remember making any specific change&nbsp;in the computer prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>I suggest you to first place the computer in clean boot state and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup
 is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow
 the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>If the issue still remains, install the graphics driver in compatibility mode and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a.&nbsp;Right click the driver installation file and select

<h2>            Windows 8&#47;Media Player and Blu Ray&#47;DVD Burning&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi.<br />
<br />
I have a laptop with a Blu Ray DVD writer which I use fairly regularly.&nbsp; I'm currently on Windows 7 and thinking about upgrading to Windows 8.&nbsp; However, I've read lots of stuff on Windows 8 not being able to play DVDs/Blu Rays etc.&nbsp; So I have a couple of concerns
 that are not really clear.&nbsp; Lots of conflicting unclear views out there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I would like to know: <br />
<br />
1) Windows Media Player is free with Windows 8 Pro, yes or no?<br />
<br />
2) How do I burn Blu rays or DVDs in Windows 8, and if it is only through Windows Media Player can I burn any kind of data to disc including photographs and back-ups as well as films/movies?<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>3) Is upgrading going to cost me more than the cost of Windows 8 both in either time or money because of this DVD/Blu Ray issue?</p>
<p><br />
If anyone can help, thanks!</p>
<p><br />

            <div>Hi Spear,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We are glad to answer your queries:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Windows Media Player is free with Windows 8 Pro:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Yes, Windows Media Player is available but doesn't include DVD playback. You can navigate to the DVD playback for Windows page to find out how to add DVD playback to Windows 8.</div>
<div>For reference, you may refer to the link:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>How do I burn Blu rays or DVDs in Windows 8, and if it is only through Windows Media Player can I burn any kind of data to disc including photographs and back-ups as well as films/movies?</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>With Windows Media Player you can play digital media files, organize your digital media collection, burn CDs of your favorite music, rip music from CDs, sync digital media files to a portable device, and shop for digital media content from online stores.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Windows Media Player on Windows 8 does not support Blue ray DVD. So, you may have to use other resources to burn them.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can refer to the link to check for the type for files that can be burnt using Windows Media Player on Windows 8:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/burn-cd-or-dvd-media-player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/burn-cd-or-dvd-media-player</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Is upgrading going to cost me more than the cost of Windows 8 both in either time or money because of this DVD/Blu Ray issue?</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can use Windows Store to download DVD movie player app to enable DVD playback options.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can also upgrade Windows 8 Pro to Windows Media Center using Add features as it is available at no charge.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can refer to the link to upgrade to Windows Media Center from Windows 8 Pro using Add features:</div>

            Windows Media Center is bad software - more bloatware. It insists on full screen and the menus are like something on a Smart TV - ugly. Get a decent commercial application like PowerDVD 12.

Sorry, but Power DVD cost money. VLC Media Player is free, and supports Blu Ray as well.</p>

It doesn't insist on running at full screen on my rig...I think you need to research the settings a bit more.<br />

<p>Hi Pijus, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Windows Hello is a more personal, secure and easier way to login to your account. You can log in to your laptop with your face or fingerprint. If you are having this kind of error, we recommend that you run through the settings of the sign-in options. To
 do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: Update Your PC</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First of all, make sure that you‚Äôve installed any possible update that is available for Windows 10. See if you have needed patches installed:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>On your keyboard, press the&nbsp;<strong><span>Windows logo key</span></strong>&nbsp;and<strong><span>&nbsp;I</span></strong>&nbsp;at the same time. Click<strong><span>&nbsp;Update &amp; security</span></strong>.
</span></li><li><span>Click the&nbsp;<strong><span>Check for updates</span></strong>&nbsp;button. Install available updates found.&nbsp;<br />
When you finish, move on to the second step. </span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Enable Biometric from Administration</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you don‚Äôt have the administrator permission, you‚Äôre not likely to use Windows Hello on your PC. To fix it:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>On your keyboard, press<strong><span>&nbsp;the Windows logo key</span></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><span>R</span></strong>&nbsp;at the same time, then type&nbsp;<strong><span>gpedit.msc</span></strong>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<strong><span>Enter</span></strong>.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Follow the path:&nbsp;<strong><span>Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components</span></strong>. On the right side of the pane, double-click&nbsp;<strong><span>Allow the use of biometrics</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;Click<strong><span>&nbsp;Enabled</span></strong>. Then click&nbsp;<strong><span>Apply</span></strong>&nbsp;and<strong><span>&nbsp;OK</span></strong>&nbsp;to save the change.
</span></li><li><span>Reboot your computer and then move on to the next step.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 3: Update Your Fingerprint Device Driver</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If your fingerprint device driver is outdated or faulty, you‚Äôll find the hardware impossible to use. You can update the device driver to fix it.
</span></p>

    <title>URGENT HELP NEEDED&#33; I accidentally deleted the ProfileList folder - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            URGENT HELP NEEDED&#33; I accidentally deleted the ProfileList folder in system32, lost many crucial files and applications.</h2>
                    Hello all,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I was trying to move one computer to another using an external flash drive, and when I tried to use Windows Easy Transfer to do it on the new computer, a message that said something along the lines of "You are currently logged onto a temporary profile,
 restart your system and try again." I restarted my system, and the same thing appeared once more. I searched for ways to get the best of this issue online, and found another Windows thread explaining how I needed to go into Regedit and into the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">HKLM\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList</span><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">&nbsp;</span></div>
&nbsp;folder, find the .bak files, and delete them. They didn't explain how to find the .bak files, and I couldn't find any relevant answers while searching Google. I looked further down the thread and found that someone had deleted their whole Profile List folder,
 and it had worked for them and caused Windows Easy Transfer to work fine again. So, I tried it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When I went to run WET, I got a different error message this time, where it said it couldn't locate the file, and to make sure no errors were made in typing the name of it. I tried to save the WET from the old computer onto the new computer, but it wouldn't
 let me. This same thing happened for Command Prompt, System Restore, and Regedit, as well as whenever I tried to download any Migwiz.exe repair programs. I went to find the MigWiz.exe file, it's visually there as an icon, but it still provoked the same "could
 not find file" message.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
How can I get my system back to normal? I can't afford to take the computer to anyone, nor any programs online I have to pay for.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I run Windows 7 Home Premium Edition on a Sony Vaio laptop, if that helps.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks all.</div>

It appears that you're stuck. You probably have to use this unfortunate incident as a sharp reminder that you must keep backups of all important files and of all software you install. Keeping printed copies of all receipts (with product codes) is also essential,
 same as you keep old-fashioned receipts for warranty and maybe taxation claims.

    <title>Unable to Activate Windows 7 - Access Denied - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to Activate Windows 7 - Access Denied</h2>
                    <p>My computer crashed a few months ago (I have been putting off dealing with this) and I had to do a complete and fresh rebuild. Since rebuilding, I have been unable to activate Windows 7 Pro properly. I had another product key and tried entering it, both
 through the GUI and through slui 4, with no luck.</p>
<p>As it had alreaqdy been activated once or twice, I need to use the phone activation. however, whenever I click on next after selecting my country (I even tried other countries to be sure), I get "An error has occurred" Code - 0x80070005 - Description: Access
 is Denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tired to find a fix through various forums with no luck. Hoping someone smarter than I am can make some sense out of the below diagnostic report. Even tried all the stupid things like making sure files weren't set to read only, and running everything as
 an admin (Account is definitely an Admin, and there are no other accounts anyway).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for the help!!!</p>
<p>
