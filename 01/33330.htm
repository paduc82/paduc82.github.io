<h2>            Wireless Connection on Windows 8</h2>
                    Hi, i have a Toshiba Satellite C855-128 and i wanted to change windows 7 to windows 8. Somes friends of mine put them on their computers and they are ok, so i have dicided to put them too. But i face a problem and i can not solve it. I have tried lots
 of things but still nothing. The problem actually is this: When i have installed&nbsp; Windows 8, everything was ok exept from the wireless connection. Actually it doesn't detect any wireless connection and the only thing it says is "there are no wireless connections".
 Now, i have the internet with the cable but its too annoying, so please if you can tell me anything to help me, tell me what to do (install or not).<br />
<br />
I will appreciate any help as soon as possible. <br />

            Thank you for my help my friend. I did tried to do the steps menioned in the link you sent me but was inpossible to make something work because of the below reasons:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>When i go to the step 2 of the link you have sent me (go to "change pc settings in the right corner of the screen") i can't do anything in the label wireless. The only thing it shows when i go to this label is: "No wireless divices are available" and there
 is nowhere anything that says airplane mode to switch it on/off.</li><li>When i take off the cable of the modem from my computer, when i click on the wireless picture ( a small picture of computer in the right down corner near the time/date), it says: "Not connected - no connections available" and also when i click on trableshoot
 problems it says: "Plug an Ethernet cable into this computer". <br />
</li></ol>
<p>I have tried lots of times and hours to fix the problem but it is still there.</p>
<p>I also went to the side of TOSHIBA to download the drivers (if are missing) of the model of my computer (Toshiba satellite C855-128, part no: PSKC8E) but still nothing happens. I don't know if there is a speciall folder that i have to put the drivers in,
 but the only thing i did was to download them and run them and leave them there on the desctop in a folder.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please i don't know what else to do to fix the problem and i am a little bit ubset so if you can help me with anything (small or big) i will appreciate it so much. I can not use my laptop every day with the cable is too annoying.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you again for everything!! <br />

    <title>Xbox One - Power Supply Fault - My experience with Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xxx1ndyxxx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One - Power Supply Fault - My experience with Microsoft Support&#47;Service</h2>
                    
<p>I would just like to highlight my to-date experience with a faulty Power supply and Requesting a replacement through Microsoft support.</p>
<p>To date the replacement hasn't arrived and I have been unable to use the Xbox for c. 2.5 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Last week of Feb 2014</strong></p>
<p>My partner notices smoke coming from the Xbox One power supply and in a panic removes it from the power socket and xbox and goes to throw it in the trash. Upon returning home from work abroad I am told it was thrown away as smoke was coming from the unit
 and tv channels weren't showing on the tv (HDMI passthrough utilised).</p>
<p>I proceed to the service website and to understand the steps to order a replacement. Realizing that the malfunctioning unit needs to be returned to get a replacement. At this stage I am happy to purchase a replacement.</p>
<p>I contact UK support who notify me that there is a way to pay for a replacement (£24.99) on the website. I am guided through this process however at the payment stage the website has numerous issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First Week March 2014</strong></p>
<p>I call support a second time to notify them of my issue with payment and am told that I should not be able to pay for a replacement. Further details of the issue is taken down and I am told it will be escalated to the highest priority given the nature of
 the malfunction and will be contacted to arrange a replacement.</p>
<p>I am also told in the meantime to contact the Microsoft store to see if I can purchase a replacement power supply</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Rest of&nbsp;March 2014</strong></p>
<p>No contact from Microsoft</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;First week of April 2014</strong></p>
<p>(4th April) Receive an email notifying me that my accessory service request has been processed and that a replacement product will be sent in 20 days. I proceed to login to my account and notice that the address used is my old address.</p>
<p>I contact Microsoft support to notify them of the mistake, the call operator updates my address details and assures me that it hasn't been processed for despatch yet and the new correct address will be reflected on the replacement shipment.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Second week of April 2014</strong></p>
<p>Receive an email a few days later informing me that the replacement PSU has been shipped. I login to MyService page and lo and behold it states it has been shipped to my old address.</p>
<p>I contact Microsoft Support again to notify them of this mistake. Call operator checks with his colleagues and I am told I will be contacted with an outcome to the issue as he is unsure of how to handle it. My contact details are taken.</p>

<p><strong>Third and fourth week of April 2014</strong></p>
<p>No contact from Microsoft (via email or phone). Ironically I receive a customer satisfaction email from Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>First week of May 2014</strong></p>
<p>I contact Microsoft support again to notify them that I haven't received anything. Call operator tells me that I need to wait 28days from date of shipment email for the accessory to arrive before I can complain (totally missing the clear point I made about
 it being sent to the wrong address).</p>
<p>After clarifying the situation the call operator takes my details and tells me it has been escalated and that I will be contacted soon.</p>
<p><strong>Current situation</strong></p>
<p>Waiting to be contacted on outcome of case escalation.</p>
<p><strong>Personal view</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have never experienced such a disjointed customer service operation ever before, with own operators providing conflicting information (e.g around buying a replacement PSU or not).
</li><li>Infuriating dealing with support as they seem to spend more time on the phone filling forms, querying with colleagues or being constantly told I will be called back. However the worst of all is being cut off on numerous occasions, this could be accidental
 or deliberate but given the number of times it has happened I would lean towards deliberate as I never have these issues on my landline with other calls.&nbsp;
</li><li>The whole experience has left an extremely sour taste in my mouth and I am seriously considering selling both my units and moving over to a competitor.
</li><li>No avenue to direct my complaints directly which is extremely annoying. </li></ul>
<p>I hope this issue gets resolved ASAP and that these comments can be picked up by someone at Microsoft.</p>

<p>Just to update this thread.</p>
<p>I have received numerous generic emails from Global Microsoft escalation support (An individual named Carter).
</p>
<p>The emails are generic and simply state I must purchase any accessories and provides a USA based number (1-800-4MYXBOX) even though I am in the UK and a replacement has already been sent (to the wrong address). The emails are then followed up with follow
 up emails saying the case will be closed in 48 hours if I do not respond.</p>
<p>Key points to note:</p>
<p>1. All emails are addressed to "Martin" which most definitely bears no resemblance to my name.</p>
<p>2. I have replied to the initial emails highlighting that my issue is not resolved but still get a 'follow up' email saying that my case will be closed.</p>
<p>3. I have tried contacting the number provided and get no response.</p>
<p>The whole situation is beyond a joke, this xbox has been unuseable since Feb/March and I have no official avenues to get this issue resolved.</p>
<p>I am hoping a moderator/employee from xbox can see this</p>

<h2>            Automatic Repair</h2>
                    <p>i was trying to install windows 10 via USB but after the "finishing up" step where the laptop restarts it goes to automatic repair everytime. Ive already tried to redownload windows 10 via media creation tool a couple of times which proves that its not corrupted
 and ive also tried diskpart but nothing seems to work, in the bios ive enabled legacy support, launched csm and (oprom??) and disabled secure boot. its my third day of trying to get past the automatic repair loop and im starting to think its a hardware issue,
 any thoughts?? &nbsp;but if its a hardware issue, which part specifically?? the hdd or the motherboard?? or should i just go check the warranty and ask for a replacement??</p>

<p>Hi Gene,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 comes with its own repair tool but sometimes Windows 10 Automatic Repair can’t fix your problems — this is that dreaded moment when the “Windows 10 Automatic Repair couldn’t repair your PC” or just keeps on running the automatic repair. This is
 a strange problem but fortunately for you, there’s a way to fix it. To do this, kindly follow the steps provided by
<strong>Abdul_Malik</strong> on this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/restart-goes-to-automatic-repair/4c5e3b7b-0e51-4834-80a8-6d619e469cab">

<h2>            Homegroup stopped working, can&#39;t fix</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 computers (Windows 7 on wired connection, Windows 7 on wireless connection) set up on a Homegroup that was working fine until recently.&nbsp; I installed a new router, and I think it was still working, and then suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Homegroup troubleshooters on both computers.&nbsp; I left and rejoined the Homegroup, and even shut it down altogether and re-created it several times.&nbsp; I tried deleting the files in the PeerNetworking folder to clear everything out, and then it only
 worked for a short time and was back to being broken the next day.&nbsp; The settings on each computer match, and I've shared the folders as I had done before.&nbsp; I've also shut down firewalls temporarily and still no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 7 computer shows nothing in the Homegroup area, but in Network I see both computers listed.&nbsp; I am able to access the files on the Windows 10 computer, without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 computer shows both computers in both the Homegroup and Network areas, but I can't get to any of the files from there.&nbsp; I can see the folders within Homegroup, but if I click on those or on the computer in Network, I get this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>\\COMPUTERNAME\\FolderName\ is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this network resource. Contact the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This account is not authorized to log in from this station.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I am able to access some of the folders by using the Windows 7 computer's IP address, so something is working there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what else to try at this point, and am about ready to give up.&nbsp; I've even looked through all the router settings, in case it's due to that, but I'm turning up empty-handed.&nbsp; Is there anything else I could be missing, or that I should try?</p>

<p>Yes, it will matter. It is best to create the <strong>HomeGroup</strong> from <strong>
Windows 10</strong> then connect your <strong>Windows 7</strong> PCs there. You need to do this because
<strong>Windows 10 </strong>is a more optimized host for other<strong> PCs with lower versions of operating system.</strong><br />
<br />
Regarding your question regarding with HomeGroup, Microsoft is preparing a new feature which would replace the HomeGroup feature.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, kindly try the other troubleshooting methods on the link that I gave and kindly update us regarding your issue.</p>

<h2>            Does metered internet stay on while using a standard user account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently installed Windows 10 and need to turn on the metered internet option. I turned it on through my admin account but as a&nbsp;standard user it still appears to be off and grayed out. I only get 10GB per month so I can't afford to constantly update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Thanks for the fast reply. The troubleshooter doesn't detect any problems and my network adapter drivers appear to be up to date. I have a Qualcomm Atheros AR9485WB-EG wireless network adapter. Like I said, it works fine through the admin account.

<p>Hi there! Sorry to hear on what happened to your issue. You can directly try offline update by following the steps here:

support.xbox.com/.../system-updates-solution</a></p>
<p>"Reset this console" option via keep games and apps usually works and you don't need USB flash drive for this step! Please tell us what happened.</p>

<p>Well, on Thursday morning, I got the prompt to install the System Update. I've attempted it over a dozen times now (including once during the middle of the night just in case the problem was due to too many people trying to update at once), power cycled
 about 4 times, rebooted my modem twice, all to no avail. I tried to do it Offline, but couldn't get all the necessary files to copy to my USB drive, even after following the instructions, so I can't update that way either.</p>
<p>I did the reset idea, but after doing that, apparently the update *still* failed, as the Xbox shut off while I was out, and when I turned it back on, it attempted the update once again.</p>
        </p>

<p>It ultimately didn't work, however, another console I have also had an update, which failed. So it suddenly appears that the issue is more likely with my ISP (AT&amp;T) than my Xbox.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing on what happened. Resetting console to defaults mostly work for this issue, you can try the two option: "Reset and keep games &amp; apps" and "Reset and remove everything". Please note that it may remove all files from your console. Everything
 that are synced to cloud can be sync back when you are connected to xbox live.</p>
<p>You may also opt to contact your ISP and make sure that you are properly connected to Internet and xbox live.</p>

<p><span>Hi <strong>Talha</strong>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you’re unable to activate the Windows Sonic, it’s possible that a conflict has occurred or it’s due to incompatible device driver. To learn more about your concern, I’d like to know the
<strong>build </strong>and <strong>version</strong> of Windows 10 that’s installed on your PC. You may type
<strong>winver </strong>in the search box to get this information. Also, was there an error message/code that has appeared at the time that you've tried activating it? If yes, kindly provide a screenshot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, I suggest that you perform a <strong>clean boot</strong> so we can isolate if there’s a conflict with the other app that’s installed on your PC. Click
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/help/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">here</a></strong> for the complete steps. Once you’re in the clean boot environment, you may try to enable or activate the Windows Sonic from
 there and check the result.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>Note: After the troubleshooting, refer to this section: “</em></span><em><span>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</span></em><span><em>” on the same</em><span>&nbsp;</span></span><em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>support

<h2>            restore a start menu to windows vista settings</h2>
                    
<p>I&nbsp;have several users on my computer.&nbsp; Somehow one of the user's start menu got changed to the classic menu view.</p>
<p>I have tried to change their start menu back to the window vista (home basic)view while logged into theiir account. I tried to change it according to the instructions in "Taskbar and Start Menu Properties". However this did not work, and their account is
 still has the classic menu settings.</p>
<p>I need help in restoring their Start Menu view to the Vista Home basic settings</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Right click on the Start Button and click on properties.&nbsp; There should be two options: Start Menu and Classic Start Menu.&nbsp; Click on Start menu and then click OK.&nbsp; The Vista start menu should be restored.&nbsp; If that button is already pushed, then click on Customize
 and click on reset defaults and then try it again.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work,&nbsp; d<span>o you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong><span>BEFORE</span></strong>
 the problem began (give it a bit of leeway if you can).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></p>
<p>I hope this helps.&nbsp; Please keep me informed.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; I just used System Restore myself to fix a problem with Office Outlook - worked like a charm.</p>

    <title>Outlook showing up twice in default mail app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> siehawk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook showing up twice in default mail app</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read many similar responses to this question but none have been the fix for me. I configured a new computer for a user and installed both the latest version of O365 and Adobe Reader on the machine. We ran into a problem where pdf to mail feature in
 Reader doesn't open Outlook to send the PDF. I made sure Outlook was set as the default mail app in Reader. In Windows settings default mail app is also set to default but I noticed it has two entries for Outlook (as if it is installed twice), I tried both,
 still not working. I have repaired and completely reinstalled both O365 and Reader, rebooting in between, still no luck. I believe the problem is stemming from 2 copies of Outlook showing where you set default apps in Windows. I checked and there is no pre-loaded
 version installed in Apps &amp; Features (some people find Microsoft Desktop Apps installed, I did not), only Office 365 installed. How can I remove the second installation, or whatever it is, of Outlook showing up where you set default mail app in Windows?&nbsp;</p>

            Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />You probably need to perform a repair upgrade to fix it:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Before you attempt that though...
<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Check if you can set the default email app in that account.

            I assume by default administrator account you mean local admin. If that is the case, local admin does not have an Outlook mailbox and therefore I can not test with this account.

            The Outlook application should be available to all user accounts. I assume you have the Outlook 2016 or 2019 application installed, right?

    <title>Invalid Login Credentials Remote Desktop Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joepalmer0216  say:</h3>
<h2>            Invalid Login Credentials Remote Desktop Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Prior to upgrading to Windows 10, I was able to remotely connect to my work computer via Remote Desktop from home.&nbsp; We use a different port (already specified in the Registry and a corresponding entry was made in the&nbsp; Firewall) never had a problem connecting.</p>
<p>Following the upgrade to 10, when I try to sign in via Remote Desktop it clearly makes the connection and brings up the sign in screen.&nbsp; I enter my Username/Password as I always have and instead of being taken to the desktop, I am given "Invalid Credentials"
 ...&nbsp; I have tried using the original password, I've tried using my Microsoft Account, even tried my PIN.&nbsp; No good.&nbsp; Tried using a different account, same results.&nbsp; HOWEVER, on another machine in the office that does NOT have Windows 10 on it, I am able to
 connect without issue.&nbsp; Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Hey Ondabox...</p>
<p>Here's something to try.&nbsp; It worked for me...&nbsp; </p>
<p>When you are presented with the sign-in screen, try putting the remote computer before your username.&nbsp;

            Had the same issue. I was connecting from Windows 10 Home laptop to another laptop with Windows 10 Pro. &nbsp;I recently upgraded the Windows 10 Pro from Windows 7 Professional. &nbsp;I was able to remote desktop prior to the upgrade using my credentials without
 any issues. Once I upgraded, to Win 10 Pro, it said my credentials were invalid. It worked fine after this suggestion! Thanks. &nbsp;

<h2>            Move xbox live account from UK to Australia&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I originally setup my xbox live account while living in the UK, I have moved back to australia and would like to change the billing region. Is this possible? If not, how do I migrate my gamerpoints etc to a new account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks<br />

<p>Only the 9 or so new regions that were added to the live service have the migrate option, sorry but there isn't one for your situation. &nbsp;And nothing can be transfered between accounts. &nbsp;You can make a new account in that region and enjoy live though.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. Shame.</p>
<p>I wonder if you can help on the following please? If I try and register a new account using a email address under a domain which I own, I receive the following error:</p>
<p>This email address is part of a reserved domain such as live.com, hotmail.com, or msn.com. Please enter a different email address.</p>
<p>I know that the domain is not a type of reserved domain, so not sure why this is happening. Do you know if live account services have a support email address?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Matthew</p>

The version of Windows 7 Pro that costs $200 is an Upgrade. The full version of Pro is $300.<br />

If it's an Upgrade license you can not use it on a custom built computer without a qualifying version of Windows to upgrade from.&nbsp; If your copy of XP Pro is a full version (not OEM or an Upgrade) you can use it as a qualifying OS to upgrade from, try phone

<h2>            Unable to install Windows 10 system image on new SSD</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm upgrading from a 1TB HDD to a 480GB SSD. Laptop is a DELL Inspiron 17 5758. I made a recovery disc and created a system image in an external drive. All goes well until I select to re-image computer. Once started immediately get the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The system image failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>an error occurred while performing the recovery operation."</p>
<p>
</p><p>In details it states "No disc that can be used for recovering the system disk can be found"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the different suggestions to no avail. Any help?</p>

            <p>You cannot restore a System Image to a drive that is physically smaller than the source drive, this is irrespective of the actual space used on the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two possible solutions. Use a third party tool to make your image file such as Acronis True Image or similar. Check the documentation provided with the drive as some manufacturers provide a utility to transfer the source direct from one drive to
 the other.</p>

    <title>Upgrading Windows 8.1 Enterprise to Windows 10 on Bootcamp Alongside - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brendanjb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrading Windows 8.1 Enterprise to Windows 10 on Bootcamp Alongside Mac</h2>
                    At work I have a dual boot Mac Pro Late 2013 with bootcamp. One side has Sierra and the other has Windows 8.1 Enterprise. I need to upgrade to Windows 10. The media creation tool for some reason does not support upgrades from Windows 8.1 Enterprise edition,
 so I downloaded an ISO instead, mounted it, and ran the "setup" program. It launched and seemed to be working, but about halfway through (while it was "Installing features and drivers") I get an error that says "Windows could not configure one or more system
 components" and then the install fails. I also get error code "0xC1900101 - 0x30018" and "The installation failed in the FIRST_BOOT phase with an error during SYSPREP operation". Any thoughts? I already tried disabling firewalls and antivirus and disconnecting
 external hardware. I'm also not sure if Mac bootcamp supports 10 enterprise. If that's the case, then I may have to go from 8.1 Enterprise to 8.1 Pro to 10 Pro, but I can't find the ISOs. I only see a generic 10 ISO.

<p>Thanks for the quick reply! We don't have a system admin for these computers. Our IT department doesn't help us with these because we don't use the standard system that they support. I'm currently in the process of logging in to the Volume Licensing Software
 Service Center with my work email. Once I do this, what will I be able to do? I can't do a clean install because we need all the data, programs, etc. that are currently on the computer. Will I be able to do an upgrade?</p>

<h2>            Freeze at password screen </h2>
                    When I took a nap my desktop running Vista went into sleep mode and I couldn't revive it. So I turned it off. Every time I try to restart, it gets to the password screen but freezes. I can't type in the password or move the cursor. But the bar in the password
 box continues to blink. <br />
<br />
The Dell came preloaded with software and I don't have a CD copy of the software.
<br />
<br />
What do I do?<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista,
 and just serves as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft
 to make this available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it</span><span><span>.</span><br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested<br />

<br />
</span><span>This way is&nbsp;if you have&nbsp;Dell Recovery partition on your Hard drive.<br />
You should have that, as a DVD did not come with your Purchase.<br />

            <p>Hi, <br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for choosing Windows RT. I will surely help you to find a resolution regarding the issue.
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To open website links directly using Internet Explorer, you can try the steps below using the run line window.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a. On the desktop, hit Windows key + R.</p>
<p>b. Type the command iexplore &lt;Website address&gt;</p>
<p>For example: iexplore support.microsoft.com<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
The steps above open the links directly from Desktop using Internet Explorer. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&nbsp;can also set the Desktop Internet Explorer as the default as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hope this information helps. Please reply back with the status so that we could help you further.</p>
