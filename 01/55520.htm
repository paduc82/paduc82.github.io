<p>Hi Captin! Since the PX 3 doesn't have an optical input or an HDMI passthrough, it looks like the only way that it would work would be if you ran the HDMI from the Xbox One into something called an HDMI Audio Separator, which extracts the audio from the
 HDMI signal, and sends it to the Red/White "Composite" audio outputs that the PX3 requires. This type of device can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/ViewHD-Premium-Extractor-Converter-VHD-H2HSAs/dp/B00KBHX072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.amazon.com/.../B00KBHX072</a></p>
<p>I can't promise how well this type of setup would work, but in theory it should work. So, you would run HDMI from the back of the console into the Separator, then run another HDMI from the Separator to the TV (strictly for video.) THEN, you would run the
 PX3 Audio Cables from the Red/White outputs on the Separator into the GAME input jack on your PX3 Transmitter.</p>
<p>Again, I can't swear to how well (or even IF) this configuration would work in terms of compatibility, but if it were going to work, this would be the only way! (If you had one of the rare TVs that have a composite red/white OUTPUT on the back, that would
 be another option without using a separator, but most TV's don't have this type of output.)</p>
<p>:-) Hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Suspected Virus in disk.sys</h2>
                    
<p>My security software is reporting a virus corrupting disk.sys.&nbsp; Their solution:&nbsp; remove the file.&nbsp; I restored an older copy of the file (though it appears to be the same size, etc.) to another location from a backup I had, and when I check it, it doesn't
 report any virus.&nbsp; But the existing copy, C:\Windows\System32\drivers\disk.sys, does.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; Is this file required for proper operation of Windows 7?</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; If so, how can I repair the apparent problem?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>(BTW, I took ownership of the file but I can't open it to run a compare on it; it says I need permission fromt he owner, even though I *am* now the owner.&nbsp; Nor can I copy the file to another location.&nbsp; I don't get that.)</p>

            Hi Larry.&nbsp; Your operating system is infected with the TDL3 rootkit and it is very likely that other malware files are present too.&nbsp; There are specialised utilities that should be run under expert supervision that will safely remove it but the procedure
 is not appropriate to post here.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many forums where you can do this however and I have posted a selection below that are known to me and I can recommend (In alphabetical order).<br />

                    <p>Right now the default, for me at least, is for the Quick Access to show items in 'Tile Mode' separated into "Frequent folders" and "Recent files". However, at random times the view will change to a no separation (sorted alphabetically) 'List Mode'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to get it back to the correct way is to reset that 'folder'.</p>

            <p>I can't comment on if that fixed anything or not. As I had already done a 'Reset Folder' on Quick Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My post was more a question of:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) How it happens</p>
<p>b) Why it happens</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I've had this happen on my home system and on several systems at work that were upgraded to Windows 10. So I wanted to see if it was because of the systems being upgraded or if people with clean installs also had this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will say Windows 10 sure does get a lot of corrupted files (as in core files that SFC would repair). :\</p>

<h2>            Icon display spacing in Windows 10 Update 1709</h2>
                    <p>From what I've read online, this actually started with the Creator's Update, but I didn't update my Windows until Update 1709 because of other issues with the Creator's Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a noticeably larger gap between the Task Bar and the icons at the very bottom of my desktop.&nbsp; Why this obvious waste of space?&nbsp; And what is causing it?&nbsp; Absolutely nothing changed in my settings, so it has to be something with how the update changed
 how Windows handles something about the icons or the arrangement on the desktop of them.</p>

            Hi Joseph,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the issue description, it appears that installation of Feitian Tech ePass 2003 stops at 80%. I will be glad to help you.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to install the Feitian Tech ePass 2003 in <strong>Compatibilty mode
</strong>and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>A compatibility mode is a software mechanism in which a software either emulates an older version of software in order to allow incompatible software or files to remain compatible with the computer's newer hardware or software. Follow below steps:</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Locate the setup files. If you are installing from a thumb drive or CD/DVD, launch File Explorer (Windows key + E) and open the location where the setup files are stored.<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Right click the setup file for the program, this can be designated as
<strong>setup.exe </strong>or something similar. <br />
<strong>3.</strong> Click <strong>Troubleshoot Compatibility</strong>. <br />
(This will launch the <strong>Program Compatibility Troubleshooter </strong>wizard which will check for issues).<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Select the option <strong>“Troubleshoot program</strong><strong>”</strong>.<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Depending on the problems you are experiencing when attempting to install or use the software, check off the problems.
<br />
<strong>6.</strong> Select a version of <strong>Windows</strong> the program is known to work from the drop down list.<br />
<strong>7.</strong> Proceed to run the through the programs setup routine by clicking
<strong>Test the program</strong>….<br />
<strong>8.</strong> Follow the on screen instructions to install the program as you normally would.
<br />
<strong>9.</strong> If all is successful, click the option at the end of the wizard
<strong>‘Yes, save these settings for </strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this program’</strong>.<br />
<strong>10.</strong> Wait while your settings for the program are saved.<br />
<strong>11.</strong> Click <strong>Close</strong>. </p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still I m not able to install. It gets stuck after completion of about 80%. I have tried your above steps but the problem still persists. Currently I am using Windows 10. I have inserted snapshot for your ref.</p>

    <title>Cortana and Search bar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacsk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana and Search bar</h2>
                    <p>Hello!<br />
</p>
<p>I am having problems with the Search bar and Cortana. &nbsp;I have found other links, I have tried correct the issue by using powershell. &nbsp;Powershell came to the conclusion that I was missing quite a bit of things needed for windows 10. &nbsp;It was working fine at
 first, the windows key was working, and I was able to use the store, and then my computer completely shut off. &nbsp;When I rebooted my computer, it seemed iobit uninstaller automatically uninstalled a ton of things on its own, and now my windows 10 is incomplete.
 &nbsp;I have no idea what to do. &nbsp;I have to access everything the long way, the windows store is no longer available to me, and so many other features. &nbsp;I know this probably sounds confusing, but I have no other way of describing what is wrong with my computer.
 &nbsp;Help would be very much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
                </div>

            <p>I have the all same issues. In regard to the actual problem, its the same as what people using avast have reported. Unresponsive start menu, search bar, several apps are gone such as groove music and movies &amp; tv etc., and anything microsoft related in the
 task bar (volume, notifications, onedrive, internet). It appears they no longer function, and may actually have been uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything, sfc scan (failed to fix corrupted files), dism attempts, all the things JacsK has tried, uninstalling various programs, updating various programs/drivers. I got rid of all my anti virus software including iobit's. Nothing has worked.
 Windows cant seem to figure out how to reinstall these functions or whatever without uninstalling all your programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to see if windows will allow me to "upgrade" again, allowing me to keep programs/files and reset the OS.</p>

            <p>Upgrading again seems to have mostly work. All functionality is back. One issue though, all my start menu items dissapeared and live tiles do not function properly for most apps. I can also no longer sign in with my Microsoft account, only local. Every time
 I try to log in through store, accounts, etc. I get "Something went wrong try again later."&nbsp; At least 90% of the OS works again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would make a backup disk with windows 10 on it just to be safe.</p>

</p><p>I have a Critical Error with no Cortana or Search Bar and lost the&nbsp;Internet connection and all sorts of other things.&nbsp; PC unusable so booted into old Win7 on different HD so I could look for solutions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How did you do an <strong>additional </strong>upgrade? Off the Microsoft Web site or from media. I've made a USB and am now downloading DVD for ISO. Can I try re-doing an upgrade from these?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I obviously want to try to <strong>keep </strong>all programs and data not just install Win10</p>

            <p>A) download windows media creation tool and save the windows 10.iso to ur computer. Its a few gigs so be prepared to wait.</p>
<p>B) optional but might save you time and space, burn the image to a dvd.</p>
<p>C) run the image the same way as you did to initally upgrade your os. Should automatically choose to keep all programs and files. If not you can manually choose these options.</p>
<p>D)****super important if you dont want to be doing this again in a few days**** remove all your anti-virus programs. Speficically avast and iobit if you ise them. Iobit has been found to auto uninstall functions of the os, which is what happened to me. Windows
 defender works for now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps you. My os has been nearly perfect after the reinstall/reupgrade. The only thing that doesnt work anymore is my microsoft account.I changed to a local account before thw reupgrade process and thats the only account that works. When i attempted
 to login to my official MS account via anywhere except a browser, i get "Something happened, try again later." Thanks microsoft... Also edge automatically closes upon opening but i use firefox anyways.</p>

<p>I have Kaspersky Internet security 2013 installed on my computer, but since the latest automatic update It will not run.</p>
<p>Windows tells me I have no security on the computer,&nbsp; when I click on it a box pops up to say loading and then in a couple of seconds disappears and I can get no further. I've tried troubleshooting compatability to no effect and not being very technically

</p><p>
</p><p>Faulting application name: explorer.exe, version: 10.0.10586.0, time stamp: 0x5632d4c0<br />
Faulting module name: ntdll.dll, version: 10.0.10586.20, time stamp: 0x56540c3b<br />
Exception code: 0xc000041d<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, I found the solution to this problem myself.</p>
<p>1 boot into safe mode</p>
<p>2 roll back video drivers to basic</p>
<p>3 restart normally </p>
<p>4 download and install latest Nvidia drivers from their website.</p>
<p>All works well now.</p>
<p>Whew!</p>

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Disconnect your computer from the internet.</li><li>Reboot the computer.</li><li>After it boots up, to to delete the account while it is offline.</li><li>Check if the issue still persists.</li></ol>
<p>

<p>Thank you for the feedback, Peter. Since our initial troubleshooting didn't work, let us try a different route on deleting your email account. Please perform these steps to further isolate the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open the <strong>Mail app</strong>.</li><li>Display the Charm Bar by either swiping from the right bezel or pressing the <strong>
Windows</strong> and <strong>C</strong> key on your keyboard.</li><li>Choose the <strong>Settings</strong> option. This will display the <strong>Mail</strong>
<strong>App</strong> <strong>Settings.</strong></li><li>On the Settings bar at the top, choose <strong>Accounts</strong>.</li><li>Select the account to open it and click the <strong>Remove account button</strong> all the way at the bottom of the panel.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated.</p>

</p><p>Hi Jay&nbsp; Jap</p>
<p>Thanks for getting back .. After getting to the&nbsp;charms, and and then clicking on settings, I wish I could open the videotron.ca account to get to the bottom section where the remove account button is .. but the moment I click on the videotron.ca account
 window&nbsp;or highlight and push the&nbsp;keyboard delete button the whole menu section disappears. (slides right back off the screen)</p>

<h2>            Windows Explorer crashes on Right Click after uninstalling a program&#33;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>so there's a program called PKzip, I thought It would help me uncompress .LH files, but it didn't. So I had to uninstall it.</div>
<div>It kept on telling me please reboot to uninstall. So I did reboot. Then I uninstalled it. Windows didn't say if the uninstall was successfull or not , it just removed PKzip from the uninstall menu. Now Whenever I Rightclick an item (except the desktop)
 Windows Explorer crashes.</div>
<div>There's no sign of PKzip in&nbsp;HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers , the only files there are BUcontextmenu and Symantec (which refuse to be deleted).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The second problem is that When I use any program's Control+O (open) , and click on My Computer , it stops working and crashes the program (and I get white menu instead of Computer).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help? (I'm trying safe boot now)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>thanks</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Xbox 360 Slim actualiza sus circuitos con un nuevo chip &#40;baja de precio&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>(El chip "SoC" fusiona CPU y GPU permitiendo reducir el consumo energético, el calor y también el tamaño de la placa base.)</p>
<p>Microsoft ha anunciado que las próximas <b>Xbox 360 Slim</b> que se vendan en las tiendas contarán con una
<b>actualización</b> en su circuitería interna que, entre otras cosas, permite una mayor eficiencia energética, reduce los niveles de calor y abarata los costes de fabricación de la consola.
<br />
<br />
Los cambios concretos se refieren a la introducción de un <b>nuevo chip</b> que integra la CPU, GPU, memoria y el sistema de lógica. Su menor tamaño tiene como consecuencia añadida la

            Hi Mike,<br />
<br />
Corrupted files or software conflicts could be the reason why you cannot print using colored ink on your printer. We'd like to know if you have made any recent changes to your printer settings prior to this issue. If so, can you tell us what are those changes
 made?<br />
<br />
Reinstalling the printer driver usually resolve printer problem issues. Since the issue still persists, we suggest running the printing troubleshooter. Check this

<p>Hi Ronalene,</p>
<p>Thanks for the response . I ran Troubleshooter and it reported that "Troubleshooting could not identify the problem". I then tried the driver update and it reported that "The best drivers for the device are already installed" .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont think that i had previously made any changes to the printer settings. I had allowed the PC to accept all the Windows and Dell updates - but could not be sure that the problem occurred after these updates .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you offer any additional suggestions .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thnaks</p>

            We would like to ask if you were able to access the printer preferences before. When printing, whatever the input is, that will be the output. If your font is colored, then the output is colored. But if your font is black, the printed output is also black.<br />
<br />
We suggest contacting your printer manufacturer for better assistance regarding your concern.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need anything else. We're here to help.

<p>Hi Ronalene. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont Know if I could access the preferences before as it was never an issue - It always printed colour. I can confirm that I have tried printing Word and Excel docs with colour fonts without success, They only print in Black/grey . I can also confirm that
 I can print in color on the printer from my Iphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have no other suggestions I will try HP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            canon printer not being detected wirelessly on Laptop and iPad</h2>
                    I have been using my MG3170 Canon Pixma printer for scanning and printing wirelessly over my iPad and Laptop (Wiao, Win 7(64 bit)) for months.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Suddenly, a week ago these devices stopped detecting my printer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I printed the "Network Configuration Page". The following things had changed for my printer-&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) link status-"Inactive"&nbsp;</div>
<div>b) SSID - BJNPSETUP&nbsp;</div>
<div>c) signal strength - 0%&nbsp;</div>
<div>d) IP address - none</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have -&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) reintalled the drivers</div>
<div>2) removed all wires (for printer and modem) and re-attached them</div>
<div>3) switched the 'wifi' of my printer 'off' and then 'on'-manually from the printer</div>
<div>4) tried running Canon IJ Network Tool - it showed the status-Not Detected-and a pop-up saying that there are ports that cannot be used with there &nbsp; &nbsp;current settings and to refer to a manual!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can still print when connecting to the printer with wires.</div>
<div>My internet connection is also good and working (Modem -Binatone DT 845W)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help!</div>

            I referred the articles, followed the steps and still couldn't resolve the issue.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I checked the network connection, which is fine and working. I removed and "added" the printer (multiple times). It installed but wouldn't even print a test page, showing message that the "printer is not responding".&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I even tried the Microsoft FixIt (Windows Help and Support suggested it). Even it showed no problem in the printer and thus couldn't resolve the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>from the control panel on the printer, I printed the network configuration page and it shows no change either!</div>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd this too. Nothing worked to detect the printer&nbsp;until changing the network SSID&nbsp;as BJNPSETUP. And then it could be paired with router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are cases too that the Canon would pick up any&nbsp;random SSID sequence when you'd try&nbsp;by PSK. Again the workout is to at the&nbsp;router point change your network SSID to the same SSID sequence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By&nbsp;printer reset it would revert the SSID to BJNPSETUP again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A&nbsp;funny prob on MG3500 series. Hope you&nbsp; have figured it out yourself.</p>

            <p>When you have a window open and selected (focus), if you press &lt;alt&gt; and &lt;space&gt; together, does the small menu appear with 'minimize' 'maximize' 'close' etc on it? If so click 'Maximize' does that work?</p>

<p>If you use a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-the-theme-to-improve-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
basic theme instead of an Aero theme</a> do the buttons re-appear?</p>

            <p>So the &lt;alt&gt; &lt;space&gt; together menu doesn't appear/work, and using a basic theme doesn't help either?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Have you ever installed or used 3rd party themes? </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You could try a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean boot</a> to see if that brings them back. If it does have a look at the 'What is next when I have a clean boot environment?' to investigate further. Remember, don't leave it as 'clean boot' and restore to normal booting once investigations are completed.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You could also try a&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> sfc /scannow</a> to see if it finds and fixes any problems.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If still no joy, hopefully someone else will 'chip in' soon with some other ideas.</p>

<p>The Safe Mode result tells you that a startup program is causing the problem. </p>

<p>Try clean boot troubleshooting to identify the guilty program.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly do NOT post in all Capitals.</p>
<p>It is considered shouting and is exremely hard to read.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>First thing to try is a System Restore to before the problem:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do System Restore in Safe Mode, if unable to do it in Normal Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try tapping F8 at startup, and from the&nbsp;list of startup selections, select Safe Mode by using UP Arrow Key to go there &gt; then&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Try a System Restore once there, to pick a Restore Point&nbsp;before your problem..<br />
<br />
Click Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; System Restore &gt; pick a different time &gt; Next &gt; etc</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>If the above does not fix the problem, follow these steps to improve performance and resolve the issue:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Go to your&nbsp;Laptop/Computer Manufacturer's website &gt; Drivers and Downloads Section &gt; Key in your Model number &gt; Look for latest Vista Drivers
 for it &gt; Download/install them.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>

<p><span>“<strong><span>Delete files using Disk Cleanup”</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>The More Options tab is available when you choose to clean files from all users on the computer. This tab includes two additional ways to free even more disk space:</span></p>

<p><span>System restore and Shadow Copies: Delete all but the most recent Restore Point</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;Above is what
 you should do as part of normal Computer maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span></p>

<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;full scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the<strong><span>Scan</span></strong>
 button to start scanning your computer<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malwareremoval process.</span><span><br />
<br />
6</span><span>.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span><span><br />

<br />
<br />
</span><span>1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Since its a new computer you need to work with&nbsp;the Seller and the System Maker for replacement
</p>
<p>or warranty repairs. As OEM the System Maker is responsible for the proper operation of both the
</p>
<p>hardware and Windows. So regardless of the cause it is theirs to resolve. You can't fix hardware&nbsp;</p>
<p>with software. Remember the more you do the more they claim it is something you have done.
</p>
<p>
Hope this helps.

            <p>Hi Dennis,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span><font color="#000000">To provide the appropriate resolution, I would need more information from your end.</font></span></strong></p>
<p>1. Do you get any error message while burning FLAC files? If yes, what is the exact error message?</p>
<p>2. Did you try using a different CD?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Same issue here - I tried loading Fallout 3 on my new Windows 10 PC, and I get the same error and it never lets me log in.&nbsp; When I click the "Click here to resolve" link, it brings me to the Microsoft page, I can log in successfully, but it takes me to the
 main page rather than somewhere to actually resolve the problem.</p>
