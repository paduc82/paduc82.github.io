            Hi  Sewale, click the link below to download that driver form the Toshiba support page for your device - you may have to choose the Windows 8 driver and install that!

    <title>WIndows media player for new laptop with windows 10 already installed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ljlaw  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIndows media player for new laptop with windows 10 already installed stopped playing dvd&#39;s</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new laptop in December 2015 with Windows 10 already installed. I was able to play DVD's with it. Now all of a sudden it will not play DVD's.&nbsp; I tried the troubleshooter and it could not detect a problem. Is Windows media player only a trial application
 for windows&nbsp;10, whether you purchased a new laptop with it already installed or an upgrade from a previous windows version? Or is there a way to fix this?</p>

            <p>Hi Suvarna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, thank you for your help and suggestions. I tried steps 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Results from step 1 showed drivers were up to date.</p>
<p>Results from step 2, showed no problems found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was no error message. When I first put the DVD in it brought up a camera upload window asking if I want to import&nbsp;videos and photos into my drop box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP DVDRW GUB0N version 10, but I do not know the file format. Not sure where to look.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did download my iTunes music and videos onto my laptop and can play them on iTunes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open my windows media player, I can only play the music I downloaded, but not my movies. I did download a video from my android phone that will play on the windows media player though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not try to uninstall/reinstall my windows media player as I am not sure if it a trial thing that I will have to pay for later or lose it. Doesn't the windows media player come from free of charge when you buy a new laptop with windows 10 already installed?
 Or is it a trial period?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son says I should just download VLC media player, but I would like to see if my windows media player can be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you :) </p>

            <p>Hi Thofikh</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help and suggestions. However, those links talk about upgrading to a windows 10. I already bought a new laptop with windows 10 already installed. I did not have to upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This new laptop already had an edition of Windows&nbsp;that came with windows media players and drivers that already played DVD's. I was able to play DVD's when I first bought this laptop. So I guess I am going to have to conclude that no matter how you get windows
 10; be it as an upgrade or a new purchase with a new laptop, it does not come with a free DVD player with the windows media player only a limited time DVD player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are my conclusions correct:</p>
<p>That no matter how you get windows 10 (as a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
new purchase </span>or an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">upgrade</span>), that it does&nbsp;(<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOT</span>) come with a free DVD player included in your windows media player? That when you first purchase a new laptop
 with a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">version</span> of windows 10 already installed&nbsp;(that included a&nbsp;windows media player and drivers that played your DVD's included in this&nbsp;version of&nbsp;windows 10), that it is also a limited time capability to watch
 DVD's? As I was able to watch DVD's when I first bought this laptop, using <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
my windows media player</span>. I did <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> use a DVD App when I first bought this laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I don't understand is why? Why do you have to buy a separate DVD player App when your windows media player should work and did when you first buy your new laptop. Is there a fix to it other than having to purchase something different. Can you fix windows
 media player to play DVD's like it did when you first buy your new laptop.&nbsp;Or is that something that Windows took away and will no longer provide as an option with the windows media player?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello Lj! &nbsp;This is Catherine - it's a bit sad to see your distress and nobody coming to your aid! &nbsp;Of course you have a dvd player - it's just not working! &nbsp;There seem to be loads of people with windows10 having problems with their dvd players, myself included.
 &nbsp;I'm not having any trouble with old dvd's, but I've just bought a new set and they just won't play &nbsp;- this will tie in with what people are saying on the web - that there is a copyright thing tied in with the media player and it won't function with some dvd's...
 &nbsp;??? &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; However, it's time you got off this help page, as nobody's helping you, and contact microsoft direct - you are their customer, and they will be more than pleased to help you! &nbsp;This page is OK for the short term, but you've been patient enough!! &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Good luck - Catherine!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where did you purchase your license?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lately there have been several reports of instances of blocked MSDN keys packaged with legitimate looking media. I can't stress enough to save your packaging, media and reciepts, if you purchase software such as this seek recourse with the store you purchased
 it from and report it to </p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/wrong-display/www.microsoft.com/piracy"><u>www.microsoft.com/piracy</u></a>
</p>
<p>If you have purchased a key, with or without DVD's or packaging from EBAY or any other person or vendor and believe it may be an MSDN key because your key has been blocked you can check a few things yourself, if you received your key with the physical product
 go to </p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/wrong-display/www.microsoft.com/howtotell"><u>www.microsoft.com/howtotell</u></a>
 and verify your product however some counterfeit software is so convincing you may not be able to spot it as such.</p>
<p>To check your PID press the win key and pause at the same time, or open system properties through the control panel, scroll down to activation section and look at the PID It will look something like this 12345-067-1234567-54321, the portion you are interested
 in is the three digit section, if it matches or is within one or two digits of the examples below you probably have an MSDN key.</p>

<p>They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose
 is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside
 of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses
 it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.</p>
<p>In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere
 along the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use.</p>

<p>You can confirm that your software is genuine now. It’s quick and easy.</p>

            not temporary. the server winbeta.update.microsoft.com has a nameserver, but is not pingable - it is down, and I can't even curl the cab file. microsoft stated that the beta program would be taken down during the january timeframe or so.&nbsp; maybe this is
 an early cutoff or is the normal cutoff date.<br />
<br />
I connect via wireless card on a channel that is not being used by anyone else.<br />
just out of curiosity, why is win8cp connecting to my wireless networks using my wired connection? I have both connected. I wasn't having a problem before. I just turned off file and printer sharing on those network connections. horrible practice by microsoft
 after the conficker worm, re-enabling it after just about every operation you do. file and printer sharing is a conficker worm magnet. please make it disabled by default. thanks.<br />
hmm. I also have classic shell installed. and I can't install any printer either. my printer possibly disappeared too.&nbsp; weird stuff.<br />
<br />
in \windows\windowsupdate.log I see at the end:<br />

    <title>Boot Loop after updates tried &#40;and failed&#41; to install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael gecko  say:</h3>
<h2>            Boot Loop after updates tried &#40;and failed&#41; to install</h2>
                    <p>My computer has been stuck in a boot loop since automatic updates forced themselves upon it. The updates didn't seem to have worked, as the computer is trying to undo the changes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's an HP something or another, running Windows 10 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it starts up:</p>
<p>-it gives me the HP splash screen</p>
<p>-followed by the blue Microsoft logo and circling dots</p>
<p>-after a few seconds, the screen quickly flashes what looks like a Command Prompt window</p>
<p>-next, a black screen with circling dots and the words "Attempting to recover installation..." below them, then it changes to "Restoring your previous version of Windows..."</p>
<p>-lastly, it restarts and does this all again</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I attempted F8 for Safe Mode, but that didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I hit F11 during boot for the System Recovery, and it opens an HP Recovery Manager:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5806d606-f78a-4a9a-b872-0283c31b863a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5806d606-f78a-4a9a-b872-0283c31b863a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't seem to have any System Restore points set, and I don't want to use System Recovery because it's for restoring to factory state. When I select Microsoft Startup Repair Tool it closes the above Recovery Manager and tries the repair, but fails.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cecbefa7-77fa-4c37-9a5f-431062972f30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cecbefa7-77fa-4c37-9a5f-431062972f30" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So much for the recovery tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, I tried to use the Windows Media Creation Tool to make a bootable USB drive, and hit ESC during boot for Boot Menu. I select my USB drive and get:
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/77b772e9-2241-42dc-b8e5-29ca2a6c0654" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/77b772e9-2241-42dc-b8e5-29ca2a6c0654" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I don't want to do a clean install if I can help it, because that will get rid of everything. So, I click "Yes" and it reboots, and I'm back in the boot loop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What do I do now?</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based from your explanation, it seems that your operating system is corrupted. This is the reason why the updates are failing to install which causes a boot loop. As you may already know, there are two options in order for you to proceed. The first one is
 to use the System Recovery from HP's Recovery Manager. There may be a way in order for you to save or keep your files when used this option, but we recommend contacting HP support to verify this information.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second one is to perform a clean install which will be <span>will remove<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>all</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>apps that do not come standard with Windows, including other Microsoft apps such as Office. It will
 also remove most apps installed by your PC’s manufacturer such as your manufacturer’s apps, support apps, and drivers. You will not be able to recover removed apps and will need to manually reinstall them later if you want to keep them. May we verify if this
 is the <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10#d2784474-fdb0-4e9d-9e47-5e88c0e053ec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> you used to create Windows installation media? If so, we recommend following the instructions
 provided in this <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10startfresh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know if you have other questions.</span></p>
        </p>

<p>That is the link that I used to create the Windows installation media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now tried to perform a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It goes:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c4172961-a7a7-45c0-89a6-e3e835966513" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c4172961-a7a7-45c0-89a6-e3e835966513" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then input product key, etc., then:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4688e095-a0fa-489c-83a9-b25f9458ab1b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4688e095-a0fa-489c-83a9-b25f9458ab1b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/316620ae-311c-4f0c-8a28-269f8ec4df45" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/316620ae-311c-4f0c-8a28-269f8ec4df45" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And if I choose "Upgrade" it doesn't work and shows:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a4b626a3-4b4c-491f-aba1-abee172fa458" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a4b626a3-4b4c-491f-aba1-abee172fa458" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I go back and choose "Custom" for install, and get:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e71201f-e59e-4a9a-b822-2271cb992468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e71201f-e59e-4a9a-b822-2271cb992468" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking good, looking good....and....just kidding:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5fc29165-d60c-43a2-97c6-67725701cc42" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5fc29165-d60c-43a2-97c6-67725701cc42" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, there goes that... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I try to use the HP Recovery to do a factory reset or the like. Restart the computer, F11 for System Recovery, and get:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6513365d-07e3-4578-bbd9-15d172a3a0fb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6513365d-07e3-4578-bbd9-15d172a3a0fb" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't make it to the HP recovery or anything I'd seen before. Just here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enter fails.</p>
<p>F8 fails.</p>
<p>F9 fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now what?</p>

            At this point, we recommend performing a custom install of Windows as your operating system may already be corrupted. This process will re-install Windows on your computer and at the same time will give you an option to recover your files. This

<p>That does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried to do a custom install (as pictured in my post), and it failed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get to "Where do you want to install Windows?" in the Windows Setup, </p>
<p>then I select my Drive Partition, </p>
<p>click "Next" and select "OK" on the warning that says:</p>
<p>"<em>If t</em><em>he partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will
 be able to use your previous version of Windows." </em></p>
<p>and it goes to the next screen...and "The installation was canceled" is shown with an error message that says:
</p>
<p>"<em>Windows Setup could not reinitialize the deployment engine. To install Windows, restart the installation.</em>"</p>

<p>The internet connection is reliant on many pieces of technology in your home.&nbsp; There is a lot you're covering in very few words, but there is a lot to unpack.&nbsp; To start from the console, the Xbox One X can do wireless and ethernet, we'd want to verify that
 you are connected via ethernet and not wireless, as that can affect speeds and performance.&nbsp; Additionally you might want to check with your ISP and verify the speeds you get with your internet package.&nbsp; I'd also ask what router you have, check the speeds that
 capable of. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you dig into the router, you want to check if <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/network-ports-used-xbox-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the ports used by Xbox Live are open.&nbsp;</a> That can easily affect network performance and speeds with Xbox Live.&nbsp; Might also want to check priorities and see if other devices are rated higher for network traffic.&nbsp; Or if QoS is turned on the router which might
 give other services a higher priority than Xbox Live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is not enough information here to dig in, but if you want to provide the information that it is on ethernet, how long the ethernet cable is, what router you have, what detailed network statistics say in Network Settings on your console, what speed
 package you have form your ISP and what method of connection (cable, fiber, copper, dial-up, etc).&nbsp; Blaming the console for poor network performance is... questionable at best.&nbsp; A poor carpenter blames his tools.</p>

            PB did a nice job but I'll add the issue is not the Xbox One X as it has a gigabit ethernet connection, so I'd take a long look at my router and the LAN switch ports.&nbsp;

<p>Another thing you have to keep in mind is this when you do a test on your computer unless you change where its testing to it is going to find the closest server to your local area to test to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the Xboxes they run the test to MS servers in Seattle WA so its going to take more time to get there and back (depending on where you live)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this on your computer go to speedtest.net and change the test server to seattle wa and see what type of speeds you get and see if it is much different then what your getting on your Xboxes</p>

            Yeah I agree with others that this does not seem like an issue with the xbox. I have similar experiences with different connected devices in my home as well. There are a lot of variables.&nbsp;

<h2>            Microsoft Jigsaw is driving me crazy</h2>
                    <p>For the 4th month running (since early January) i have been unable to play more than 1 challenge game in Microsoft Jigsaw.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What happens:&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>

<p>i launch MS Jigsaw, go to the daily challenges and what i see is this:<br />
<br />
</p><figure><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fimg-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net%3a443%2ftenant%2fxvi%2fentityid%2fRW4p9u.img" /></figure><br />
When i go to the calendar, i see this (the dots are spinning):<p><br /></p><figure><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fimg-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net%3a443%2ftenant%2fxvi%2fentityid%2fRW4rKM.img" /></figure><p><br /></p>
when i press the squares to choose a challenge, the button depresses, but does nothing on release.<br /><ul><li>At a speed sufficient to stream full HD video (17.33mpbs) i try to download the Fable collection, (which has been part of my collections as late as Dec 2016--why was it as well as about 10 others removed from "my collections"?), the download runs 5 (five) seconds before ms jigsaw crashes. Tried this with 3 different free collections 3 times each: i couldn't try others because when i click "buy for xx gold bars", the bars are snapped up, my total # bars changes, then the app crashes.</li><li>i have already played all the jigsaw jams: now only one of them is loaded, and when i click to download one of the others, the app crashes.</li></ul>
<p>What i've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Letting the "download" run all day (15 hours). I did this near the end of March. was still downloading at the end of the day</li><li>uninstalled, reinstalled by rightclicking/selecting uninstall, then going to the store and installing (says i already own this, so i'm not sure i get a fresh copy?) i JUST did this, still getting great internet connection, and it is still not working: app crashing in classic games on download, downloading continues in challenges.</li></ul>
<p />
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please help. i've seen other solutions that say my internet speed is slow and i should try wired. i am using wireless systems, no wired available without purchase of an adapter, but that should not matter. For 3 years this application worked, EVEN when my connection was for ****. It's not the internet speed. Please help. i really like this game, but it is just so inconsistent, and solutions offered by xbox/microsoft turn the problem back to the user, without even trying to give a solution. Frustrating.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>i just checked the May Jigsaw and everything seems to be working fine. My apologies for not responding to earlier questions: i had done everything except try another microsoft account--don't play games on any other account. I am very happy tht this has been fixed. One Windows update has happened in the meantime (after May 1, by the way), but i did not do anything else. i did not reinstall or make any other changes, so either it was something on the latest update, or something on the MSJ side. It would be good to know which. &nbsp;Thanks for fixing. and this discussion can be closed, from my perspective (will open new if it happens again....)</p><p><br /></p>

My xbox 360 has flashed the 3 light red ring the last 3 times I started it, then I turn off and restart and it works fine. Not the real problem though, but it lead to this:<br />
<br />
I decided to back up my profile/saves/arcade games on to a usb drive. I didn't realize it wasn't just copying them, it just moved them, and now they are no longer on my xbox360.<br />
<br />
I had inserted the usb drive into my PC, it recognized the drive and sees a hidden folder, labelled "XB3C90~1" with five "Data0000*" files in it, adding up to the correct size of the drive (it's only 3.8GB of stuff). I copied the folder onto my pc. I turned
 on my xbox, realised I had moved my profile, and tried to plug the USB drive back in to move them back. But, the xbox can't see the files on the drive. It wants me to format again, that's the only option. I haven't formatted it yet. I then tried to format
 a different USB drive with the xbox, and transferred the files from pc to that one, and same thing, xbox wants to format it only.<br />
<br />
Please tell me I haven't lost all my profiles and save games. I can redownload the arcade games I assume. But some of those saves are priceless. Help?</p>

<p>I'm so sorry to tell you but as soon as you plug the USB Flash Drive into your PC and moved/copied the files onto your PC the files instantly become useless and all that saved progress/profile is lost. This is a security measure taken so people cannot modify
 their profiles and saves. <br />
<br />
If this was an offline profile then you'd need to start from scratch but if this was an online profile you can just download the profile again by following the directions located
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.
<br />
<br />
If you need to re-download your purchased content again you can follow the instructions located
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/download-content-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.&nbsp;(click "View Download History and Download Again")<br />
<br />
Again, I apologize for the lost saves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>you can't just do that since the file that you moved are compressed.</p>
<p>i guess you have to download your profile again</p>

<p>So even if I use the same drive? I didn't format it when plugging in to pc or anything. I just plugged it in, transferred, and unplugged. I then use that same drive, where no change has been made, and it won't work? They were all offline profiles, and I
 was in the middle of too many games for this to be true :(</p>

<p>Thank you for the info everyone. Icestorm, I am trying your method, I haven't got it to work, but that was last night and I am going to try some things today with a fresh head.</p>
<p>It's so disappointing to me that no where on the official xbox page about transferring to a USB drive does it say that you will lose EVERYTHING if you try to back up the files anywhere else. Obviously I wouldn't edit the files. I just wanted to make a copy
 for safety, due to how sensitive the data is.</p>
<p>So my suggestion Microsoft, please write a warning on the instructions page, or a popup when the xbox is done moving the files. I was mid-way through so many games I don't even want to play my xbox anymore.</p>

            <p>thanks I found this bug too and I concluded it started after KB3140768 </p>
<p>I&nbsp;see you got a report to save too, with enough fidgeting with the open event trace sessions&nbsp;and so&nbsp;on&nbsp;I can get a report to save too, this windows feature isn't predictable though I haven't isolated a particular event trace session or why it eventually
 starts working again. I type the perfmon /report command in dozens of times is the other troubleshooting step I've used</p>

            Go ahead and change the C:\PerfLogs folder owner to Administrators instead of SYSTEM and that will fix it. Sometimes a Windows update will mess with the security settings of folders maybe by design;&nbsp;none the less.

<h2>            Unable to start chat&#47;request call back with xbox support</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys. As the title says I can't start a chat with xbox support, or submit the form to request a call back (uses the same layout.)&nbsp;The first and last name as well as email are auto filled because I'm signed in. I press "start chat" and the button turns grey and nothing happens. Popup blocker is off. I've tried 3 different PCs on both chrome and edge, even internet explorer.&nbsp;&nbsp;I also even tried a family member's account. I tried on my iphone using data for a different IP address.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Randomly, twice in the last ~100 tries it's worked immediately.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Tried talking on the phone with support, no real help.&nbsp;</p>

I did not ask to get 123 Photo Viewer.&nbsp; It automatically changed.&nbsp; How can I change back to Photo Viewer?

I don't recall upgrading to 123.&nbsp; I think it was automatically done.&nbsp; I still cannot open the additional pages of the downloaded document from County Public records.&nbsp; It displays the cover page only and does not give me an option to page through the several
 pages.

<h2>            How to properly restrict access of Another User or a Guest Account on all the active drives on my Windows 10 pro</h2>
                    <p>Couple of times I had to face this issue where on trying to restrict another User or a Guest account from having full read and write access to all the drives and data on the system by adding my local admin account in the locations below or inheriting complete
 permissions from the Advanced menu I ended up restricting myself from accessing any of the drives and all the Windows apps and features stopped opening up.</p>
<p>For e.g. - Microsoft Edge failed to open up and simply disappears after showing a splash screen for itself, Action center and Start menu stops opening up which is same for most of the other apps and services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><em><strong>This screenshot is after I had to reset the OS and start all over again</strong></em></span>)</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The moment I add my offline local admin account on any of the disk(s) and inherit or replace permissions control to my account from a previous profile it corrupts the functioning of Windows apps and services which are dependent on these drives to run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An "Account Unknown" SID comes up which I assume to be the culprit. idk.</p>
<p>(<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><em><strong>The last SID tag is my account and no longer is see the Account Unknown SID as I haven't made any changes yet to test the response</strong></em></span><span style="color: rgba(133, 98, 0, 1)">)&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 23, 1)">Is there any other effective way of doing this without restricting my access in my offline admin account (or online account) to all the drives and data except for the Guest or Another User account and to avoid resetting the OS
 again and again to recover my control on the system.</span></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

</p><p>Thank you Seahawk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But Here I'm trying to restrict access of any other User (Guest or Admin) to the drive partitions available on the system.</p>
<p>I can put restrictions on an app or apps but it'd just take a lot of time to as it's not a batch operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, this is what I'm talking about if I add my local admin account by removing all the other User profiles from C: drive for example to take and restrict access to it, It'd make the Windows apps, features and services stop opening up as well like the
 Start menu, Action Center, etc for me as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last time removing Trusted Installer profile wrecked the system. </p>
<p>These are the Current profiles on the drives and I'm just not sure which ones to remove to test it out again.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The SID account on the drives also doesn't match with Mine's in the Registry :</p>

<p>Trusted user account is not a user that is a physical person on your PC. </p>
<p>Forget the registry, you are not doing anything in there that is going to change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Think you are a bit confused and making this more difficult than it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting with C:\OS drive. Nobody has access to your user account. Only public is shared. So the only thing left is
</p>
<p>C:\Program Files</p>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)</p>
<p>C:\Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>For these 3 above, remove users, guest and administrators and add your user name in the list full control. But you need to take ownership first so you are able to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea why you would&nbsp;have SID S-1-5-21 ………… as the owner of any drive. You&nbsp;need to&nbsp;take ownership of them or change to system for owner. This will not cause Windows apps, features and services to stop opening up as well like the Start menu, Action
 Center, etc. Impossible.</p>
<p>When taking ownership, the key is the users in the list and the permissions they are granted. But by you taking ownership, gives you&nbsp;the ability to assign users and their permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for any other partitions or drives, removing trusted installer does not cause any negative effect. Removing all users on drives also has no effect. You Take ownership of them and add your user name in the user list with full permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You simply take ownership of each drive or partition, disable inheritance and add yourself .</p>
<p>
</p><p>For additional drives, nobody can access them over the network from other PC's or devices unless you select advanced sharing and share them.</p>

<p>You can also have <span>Windows</span> automatically arrange your icons. Right-click an empty area of the desktop, click

<h2>            How to delete the proxy setting</h2>
                    <p>original title: Proxy Address 127.0.0.1</p>
<p>In my dial up connections, the check box for proxy server is checked and the address is 127.0.0.1 with Port 8080.</p>
<p>If I delete it, it comes back on when I connect to the internet again.&nbsp; Is this something to be concerned about?</p>
<p>I have used various virus/malware removal tools and they haven't found anything.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>My Earthlink accelerator does not work very well when I delete the 127.0.0.1</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span>The line "127.0.0.1 local host" can be safely ignored, because it is a standard entry.</span></p>
<p>
<span>These are addresses your computer uses to identify itself, so don't remove them.
<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

            The old paint can't do this at all, but the new Paint 3D can.&nbsp; Go to the "Canvass" icon at the top (looks like a grid symbol, almost tick-tack-toe).&nbsp; From there you can tell the canvass to be transparent, and then when you export out your PNG picture file,
 it will be too.

    <title>Windows 10 Laptop Won&#39;t Run exe Files While Connected To Wifi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Laptop Won&#39;t Run exe Files While Connected To Wifi</h2>
                    <p>I am currently taking a computer science course at my university and need to be able to compile and run my own programs on my computer. I have downloaded CodeBlocks for its gcc compiler (coding in C) and went through some issues with getting that to work
 and then I realized that my programs weren't running when I tried to open them in the command prompt, even the simple "Hello World!" test. I took my laptop to Geek Squad and conveniently&nbsp;it&nbsp;ran all of the exe files that I&nbsp;had on&nbsp;there, but&nbsp;when I went home
 it didn't work again. I realized the common denominator was the internet connection since at home I am always connected to my private secure wifi, but at Best Buy I was connected to nothing. I have done multiple trials with this and it&nbsp;is definitely true.
 Even if I have the wifi on and then turn it off,&nbsp;the programs will not run, I must power up my laptop without being connect to wifi&nbsp;in order for the files&nbsp;to run at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, why is this happening?&nbsp;And, is there anything I can do so that I can&nbsp;code on my&nbsp;laptop and stay connected to wifi?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the clean up and optimization (defragmented) options as well as downloaded something that went through my files and cleaned/repaired them (not sure if that would matter in this case).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all in advance!&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Reily,<br />
<br />
<br />
Corrupt registry settings are one of the reasons why you are unable to run exe files even if you are connected to your Wi-Fi. To come up with the correct resolution, please answer the questions below:<br />
<br />
1. Have you tried updating your computer's drivers?<br />
2. Have they tried to check if you can connect to the internet via ethernet cable?<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.
