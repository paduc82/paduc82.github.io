<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Click Add
<br />
<br />Enter a user name
<br />Password, confirm it, create a hint
<br />Click Next
<br />Click Finish
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Sign into the new account.
<br />Open File Explorer on the Taskbar &gt; This PC 
<br />Open the drive where Windows is installed 
<br />Open Users 
<br />Look if your old account old is there with your files 
<br />
<br />If they are, you can copy them over to the new account. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work....
<br />
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen

<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<p>Thank you for your quick reply.</p>
<p>Not sure if it's caused by a pre-set user account to do auto-oobe after push button reset, by modify unattend.xml in C:\recovery\oem\C\windows\panther before push button reset.I have tested 1803/1709/1703 build with the same action. This issue just appears
 to me in 1803 build.&nbsp; Is this known issue to MS? How to address it or any forcast to fix it?<br />

            Hi Oliver.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Sounds like it's signed you into a Temporary Account. Sometimes when a Windows or Version Update fails due to a corrupted account it will create a temp one to sign into.
<br />
<br />You should be able to leave the password box blank to sign in to the temp account.  
<br />
<br />Check at C:\Users if you can see your old account with its files intact.  If not check at C:\Windows.old to see if files were archived there during a version install that fails.  
<br />
<br />If so copy the files out externally so they are safe.  Files should always be backed up if you value them at all.  You can copy or drag them to an external USB flash or hard drive, or into Onedrive (up to 5gb free) or Google Drive (up to 15gb free).  
<br />
<br />Try restarting the PC a few times to see if it will start into your account.  If so go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then from the temp account can try to repair the old account using one of these methods:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/48012-fix-youve-been-signed-temporary-profile-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/48012-fix-y...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.sysprobs.com/fix-temporary-profile-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sysprobs.com/fix-temporary-profile-w...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then you can try to create a new Admininstrator Local Account to see how it works:  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10/how-to-create-a-local-account-in-windows-10/95097c32-40c4-48c0-8f3b-3bcb67afaf7c">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>.   
<br />
<br />If necessary to try to repair the old account or create a new Account you may need to enable and Sign into the Hidden Administrator account used only for emergencies, using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>.
<br />
<br />Once the new account is created: sign into the new account, move your files over, test that all programs run.  If you decide to keep it then you can delete the old accounts when ready. in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and other Users.  
<br />
<br />If the install is too corrupted for even a new account to run well, then see if you can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If not you can run a Repair Install which reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files, programs and most settings in place,  by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This will solve most problems and also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If those fail then you can do a Reset:  <a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/reset-windows-10-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/reset-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can do the vastly superior Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p><span>Greg, it seems that both you and Andre not get my point.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My issue happens after Push Button Reset. I run quick reset, look at below to see what I have done.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Modify unattend.xml in&nbsp;</span><span>C:\recovery\oem\C\windows\panther to add auto boot sections like below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/866b01fa-0f6f-4759-94f4-2082672c7c2e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/866b01fa-0f6f-4759-94f4-2082672c7c2e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;2. Press "LWIN+I" to launch setting and click "Update &amp; Security";</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;3. Click "Recovery" in the left panel;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;4. Click "Get Started" button in "Reset this PC" section;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;5. On the pop-up &nbsp;"Reset this PC" dailog window, select " Remove everything" -&gt; "Just remove my files";</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;6. Click "Reset" button</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My PC will restart this time and the Reset process will be last for a long while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; 7. When Reset is finished, my PC will auto boot to desktop</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -----&gt;This is when the error message pops up.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp; The preset admin account is created while it's desktop profile is not right prepared.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Network Wifi keeps dropping, Have to run troubleshooter to reset</h2>
                    <div><span>I am running a Dell Inspiron 15 3000 on Windows 10. &nbsp;Upon startup my laptop connects to WiFi just fine, but throughout the day it will lose it's connection. &nbsp;I run the Troubleshooter on the Network Adapter (WiFi), it resets the adapter and then things
 work fine again.</span><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;Specifically, I have the Dell Wireless 1704 802.11b/g/n (2.4 GHz) adapter.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>The Wi-Fi works fine on my other computer, even after going to sleep, waking etc.0</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I've already gone into Device Manager and unchecked the option to let Windows turn off Wifi. &nbsp;And yet, the December release of windows continues to disable the wifi adapter to the point that only the Network Troubleshooter can fix the problem. &nbsp;A cold reboot
 doesn't fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it just too hard for Microsoft to write code that has a reset button built into the interface? &nbsp;I mean its so frustrating to go into Settings to try to change something only to snake my way through 2-3 screens in order to get to the Old Control panel,
 where everything is laid out nice and clean. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it too hard to write software that doesn't randomly turn off devices that it can't turn back on again. &nbsp;This is ridiculous. &nbsp;Microsoft changed something in the Dec release that cause the Wifi on this unit to stop working. &nbsp;Every other unit in the house
 works fine. &nbsp;So why is this Dell failing us on Windows 10?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Surface Book Models</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what the difference is between the 256GB / Intel Core i5 - 8GB / dGPU Surface Book model and the&nbsp;256GB / Intel Core i7 - 8GB model other than the i7 core.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both Models are listed at the same price, and I have read that all Surface Books with an i7 core also contain the 940 NVIDIA GPU so if this is true, then what feature puts the i5 computer at the same price as the i7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            The reason why one of the Surface Book i5 Core has the same price with the i7 is the video card. The i5 has an NVDIA FeForce GPU with 1GB. The i7 only have the built in video card from its core. It means that the i5 with video card has a better graphics.

<p>I believe all surface books that have the i7 core also come with the NVIDIA chip which would mean that both models have the same GPU.</p>

    <title>Not showing as &#34;Available&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim_mck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not showing as &#34;Available&#34;</h2>
                    <p>My Skype for business has always had difficulties showing my correct Availability status. For example, it would show my status as "Offline" even though I was online. I'd manually set it to "Available" and sometimes that would work; sometimes it would work
 after 10-15 minutes. Sometimes I had to reboot and it would start working. Today, in an effort to fix it, I installed the latest update (the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">November 22, 2016 release; version 16.1.456). It's been well
 over an hour. I've rebooted and manually set my status to "Available" but other users still see me as "Offline". I can message them and they can reply but I don't show as "Available".&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            Hi Jim,<br />
<br />
From the description, it's indicate that issue may lie with the client side. May I know whether you have tried
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3202833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
performing a clean uninstall</a> then reinstall latest <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Skype-for-Business-8a0d4da8-9d58-44f9-9759-5c8f340cb3fb?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#OS_Type=Mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype for Business for Mac application</a> program to check this issue.<br />
<br />
Please make sure that the computer should have the latest operating system updates. For your reference:
<a href="https://products.office.com/en-US/office-system-requirements/#Office-standalone-applications-section" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
View the system requirements</a><br />
<br />
You may also try to troubleshoot this issue via creating a new Mac user profile and then performing a clean reinstall the latest Skype for Business for Mac application program to see whether the problem still occurs.<br />
<br />
If the troubleshooting steps above don’t help, then try to check this issue via using different Mac PC
<em>(e.g. any non-problematic colleague’s Mac PC)</em> to determine whether it is a client side issue.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Shyamal

<h2>            USUARIO CON GAMERTAG &#38;quot&#59;CrazySick Gunz&#38;quot&#59; NO DEJA DE ACOSAR MIS PARTIDAS DE RESIDENT EVIL ORC </h2>
                    
<p>Buenas noches expertos de Microsoft, quiero quejarme del usuario con gamertag "CrazySick Gunz", pues únicamente entra a mis partidas en cooperativo para matarme a mí y a todos los usuarios, ya metí una queja e incluso lo bloqueé para no recibir sus mensajes
 pues sólo se dedica a decir una sarta de groserías y también me amenaza con que me va a robar mi cuenta del xbox live, no se cómo lo pretenda hacer, pero la verdad si es algo que me preocupa, esta persona no la conozco, y de hecho nunca he tenido problema
 alguno con algún usuario de dicho servicio.</p>
<p>Espero pronta respuesta a mi situación, y ojalá si lleguen a bloquear definitivamente a este individuo de mis partidas, ya que no puedo disfrutar de mis juegos como yo quisiera.</p>

<p>Hola Daniel "#@%&amp;$" :)</p>
<p>Aquí, o mucho han cambiado las cosas desde que era Mod o Scarfy solo puede hacer frente a las "amenazas" de los foreros, troles y demás personas que no cumplan con la normativa vigente en el Foro.</p>
<p>Has hecho lo correcto en cuanto a la queja y el bloqueo de este sujeto, realmente si juegas con un grupo de amigos o, al menos juegas con gente que él puede "seguir" para unirse a tu partida, de poco te sirve dicho bloqueo. El bloqueo de Xbox Live solo funciona
 personalmente, es decir, nunca te lo vas a encontrar en 1 vs 1 estando solos tu y el pero si tu y 3 amigos mas jugáis en una partida, tú le bloqueas pero tus amigos (y digo todos los de la sala) no lo bloquean, el a través de ellos &nbsp;podría unirse a vuestras
 partidas siguiéndoles. </p>
<p>Si, parece injusto, pero es que si fuese total, imagínate la de gente que no podría jugar a nada por no mencionar de incurrir en un posible delito o falta de coacción :) ... yo mismo, he recibido quejas de demasiado agresivo jugando al Gears of War 0_0 y
 dirás, ¿en serio, al GoW? la moto-sierra va incluida!!!</p>
<p>No desesperes y alerta de esto a tus amigos si eres frecuente en los juegos con ellos, a cada cerdo le llega su ...</p>
<p>un saludo socio</p>

<p>pon las quejas que consideres oportuna a este "individuo" y un consejo:manda a toda tu lista de amigos un mensaje exponiendo el tema y que le bloqueen para no coincidir con el mas que lo justo en las partidas y que le pongan las quejas tambien.Por lo que
 se,con 15 quejas de 15 personas de ciudades diferentes microsoft inicia una investigacion sobre el gamertag en cuestion y si es cierto lo que dices,tranquilo que de entrada le bloquearan las comunicaciones si se dedica a ofender y en el mejor de los casos
 le banean el perfil.Estoy contigo,esta gentuza no deberia jugar online,Suerte y salu2</p>

<p>La mejor defensa, es un buen ataque, puteale tu a él puesto que realmente lo de "evitar" solo vale para engañarle a tu cabeza, pensando que no vas a coincidir mas con ese perro, por que por mucho que toda la lista o amigos habituales con los que juegas,
 lo eviten, el tipejo volvera a entrar, lo que tienes que hacer es jugar mejor y derrotalo en el juego y te ries con tus colegas de él.</p>

            <em>Oddly, I do not have any problem launching pdf files that are on websites.</em>
<p>-&gt; Not odd at all. When you open .pdf files on web sites then you use a cut-down version of Acrobat Reader that is built into your browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"The version of this file is not compatible with the version of Windows you’re running.&nbsp; Check your computer’s system information to see whether you need an x86(32-bit) or x64(64-bit) version of the program and then contact the software publisher."</em></p>
<p>-&gt; Uninstall Acrobat Reader, then download the current version and re-install it.</p>

            <p>My sentence starting with "Oddly, I do not have ..." was just a lead-in (perhaps odd) way&nbsp;to say&nbsp;that in actuality the problem is not with the browser's Reader but with the Reader on my desktop.&nbsp; I've tried&nbsp;all the obvious fixes to my problem, including
 uninstall followed by reinstall Reader DC (as you suggested) even before I posted my question.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the current status to my posted problem:&nbsp; I still cannot use Reader DC, but have reverted back to Reader 11 with which I have no problems opening and using pdf files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reached this status after 3 hrs of online assistance&nbsp;from MicroSoft Help Desk, which could not find the problem.&nbsp; Then I signed on for the MS Assure Plan and received another 10 hrs of online assistance.&nbsp; MS help desk&nbsp;focused on the idea that my laptop had
 an infected file, so spent all their time cleaning up my drive -- scanning for all kinds of malwares, threats, rootkits, etc.&nbsp; Result: no significant finding, nothing wrong with Windows 7&nbsp;and still Reader DC would not launch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Subsequently, I had a local professional look at my computer: he spent another 3 hrs on the issue, with same results - nothing wrong with Windows or disk.&nbsp; So cause of the problem is&nbsp;most likely with Adobe, perhaps one of the&nbsp;files it created on installation
 was corrupted&nbsp;when I updated to Reader DC from the cloud&nbsp;and that miscreant file&nbsp;ever since has prevented both its launch and all reinstallation attempts (Adobe message on initiating DC reinstallations has been: already installed, no need to go further).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My next step: connect with&nbsp;Adobe Help Desk, unless someone else here comes up with a good tip.</p>

            Gulp. I find it hard to believe that MS gave you 13 hours of free assistance for a problem with someone else's software. At their usual rate this amounts to around $2,600.<br />

<p>If you've forgotten your Windows password, there are several ways to retrieve or reset it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your PC is on a domain, your system administrator must reset your password.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you're using a Microsoft account, you can reset your password online. For more info, go to the

<p>If you're using a local account, use your password hint as a reminder.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If you've tried these suggestions and still can't sign in:</p>

<li>
<p>If you have <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span>, you'll need to reinstall Windows. </p>

<p>If you have <span>Windows&nbsp;RT&nbsp;8.1</span>, you'll need to contact your PC manufacturer.

    <title>File Explorer and Edge open up in a different position on the desktop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            File Explorer and Edge open up in a different position on the desktop in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original Title[Window placement]</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all previous versions of Windows both Windows Explorer and Internet Explorer would always open up in the exact same position on the desktop they were in at the time they were closed.&nbsp; Now in Windows 10 both File Explorer and Edge open up in a different
 position on the desktop, which happens to be slightly skewed to the left or right of the previous position.&nbsp; This is extremely annoying when I position these windows to a location that works best for me but causes me to grab the window and reposition it to
 where I want it instead of where Windows (i.e. Microsoft) wants it placed.&nbsp; Also, I really miss the ability to do a 'Save As' for downloading files as was the right-click option in Internet Explorer.&nbsp; This option allowed me to overwrite an existing file instead
 of having additional copies of the file on my hard drive with&nbsp;a (1), (2), (3), etc. suffix appended to the end of the file name.&nbsp; The lack of being able to avoid this action from happening causes a lot of confusion for non-technical users who don't grasp the
 concept of these files being duplicates of the same file that have been repeatedly downloaded.&nbsp; It wastes disk space and increases confusion for the average run-of-the-mill user.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hello David,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
I suggest you to follow the steps below and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
1.&nbsp;Open your window.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The window opens to its usual unwanted size.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
2.&nbsp;Drag the window’s corners until the window is the exact size and in the exact location you want. Let go of the mouse to drop the corner into its new position.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
Be sure to resize the window manually by dragging its corners or edges with the mouse. Simply clicking the Maximize button won’t work.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
3.&nbsp;Immediately close the window.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
Windows memorizes the size and placement of a window at the time it was last closed. When you open that window again, it should open to the same size you last left it. But the changes you make apply only to the program you made them in. For example, changes
 made to the Internet Explorer window will be remembered only for Internet Explorer, not for other programs you open.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If issue still persists I suggest you to check whether the same issue persists with different account as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</span><span>

                    <p>*Original Title: Office 365 and Windows 10 Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are planning on upgrading our office machines to Windows 10.&nbsp; I have started with 1 machine and given it to one of our developers for testing.&nbsp; The problem is Office 365.&nbsp; When he tries to use the mail app provided on 10 it errors out with unable to synchronize
 and/or unable to connect and has a generic error code of 0x85010004.&nbsp; He is connected, can access his email via the web portal and Thunderbird.&nbsp; Is this functionality not available via the mail app that is provided?&nbsp; All my web searches come back with information
 about the mobile app.&nbsp; It just blows my mind that an app provided by Microsoft wouldn't be compatible with Microsoft Office 365.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any and all suggestions will be greatly appreciated!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            Mail App in Windows 10 would work fine with Office365, you just have to check Store and make sure it is update and also check setting and make sure you configure it correctly.

<h2>            Unable to set restore point either in System Restore or during attempts to install auto updates.</h2>
                    I recently (November)&nbsp;had a problem with Windows update being unable to install a .net security update, contacted support and ended up removing the .net frameworks using .net removal tool, then re-installing them via downloads.&nbsp; Since then, windows update
 is unable to install updates and gets frozen while trying to set a restore point.&nbsp; When I open system restore myself, I am unable to even select a drive to manually set a restore point as the system seems to be stuck "searching".&nbsp; The rest of the system works
 fine, it's a new HP pavillion laptop running Vista Home Premium 64-bit.&nbsp; Using Norton 360&nbsp;for security. &nbsp;I am also going to upgrade to Windows 7 and have the upgrade disk, but wondered if I needed to fix my current problem first.&nbsp;

<p><span><span>Hi bluedeucerider,<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
Welcome to Windows Vista Answers Forums!<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
This issue may occur due to Norton Antivirus, If you have installed Norton on the system then you may try to disable or uninstall norton to resolve the issue.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
You may also get in touch with Norton for further assistance.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
You may also try to run a System File checker tool. This tool will fix the system files that are corrupted.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Steps to perform SFC scan:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click the Start button</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. From the Start Menu, Click All programs followed by Accessories</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. In the Accessories menu, Right Click on the Command Prompt option</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. From the drop down menu that appears, Click on the 'Run as administrator' option</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled, you will be asked for authorization prior to the command prompt opening. You may

<p><span><span>6. In the Command Prompt window, type: sfc /scannow and then press Enter</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7. A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>8. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>9. If any files require replacing SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Vista DVD for this process to continue</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>10. If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity
 violations"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>11. After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.

<h2>            I&#96;ve tried everything but I&#96;m ready to smash my laptop up, please help me with PC freezing.</h2>
                    HI all, I`m at my wits end. My laptop will work for a few minutes then freezes so i have to press and hold the power button. Even typing this takes ages cos my pc won`t keep up. I`ll be lucky if it lets me complete this question without freezing.<br />
It appears to be doing something in the background but I can`t work out what. My pc gets extremely hot even when I`m not doing anything and then it either freezes or switches off by itself. It always appears to be either writing or reading to disk.<br />
I`ve tried various virus detections. I`ve tried checking for disk errors and memory errors. I`ve tried system restore but it froze up and I had to hold the power button which caused it to delete all the restores.<br />
I`ve tried stopping all third party services and start up programs. I`ve tried safe mode but it won`t load in safe mode? I`ve tried thr scannow program which scans for faulty system files. I get thousands of error messages but most of them don`t appear on the
 Microsoft website.<br />
I`m really at the point where I want to throw my pc out the window but I have lots of files I need to keep but it won`t let me back them up because it freezes.<br />
Has anybody got any idea as to what my problem is or how I can find out what it is and rectify it??<br />
&nbsp;PLEASE HELP ME.....

            This definitely sounds like bad hardware. Perhaps the fan is failing and the laptop is overheating. You really can't fix this yourself since it's a laptop. Either take the computer to a competent local tech (not a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place)
 or contact the laptop mftr.'s tech support.

    <title>Can&#39;t print from any printer and application - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edward_b  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t print from any printer and application</h2>
                    
<p>Windows 7 Pro 64-bit - fully patched</p>
<p>HP CP1518NI laser (Windows Vista drivers as HP hasn't supplied Windows 7 drivers), Acrobat Pro 9, OneNote 2010, XPS Document Writer</p>
<p>I've had 2 intermittent cases [that I know of] where I can not print to any printer from any application. Restarting the print spooler does nothing. Nothing in the Queues. Printers shows as "Ready". Not grayed out in Devices &amp; Printers. Nothing in the event
 logs.</p>
<p>Only solution I have had is to reboot. System is shut down nightly.</p>
<p>[System scanned for viruses every 2 weeks plus MSRT &amp; Spybot scans and is clean.]</p>
<p>Ideas?</p>

<div>Hi Edward,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Do the printers work on another computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As per HP, Vista drivers should perfectly work for Windows 7 computer. However, since you're facing problem with every printer and application, the below suggestions may help you in fixing the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>
<p><span>Stop the print spooler and delete all spooled files. By doing this, you should be able to print.</span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<span><span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Windows Vista/Windows 7 Start orb and type Command in start menu search field.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>From
 the list select and right-click Command Prompt and select Run as administrator. (This will give you an elevated command prompt).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type
 “<strong>net stop spooler”&nbsp; </strong>into command prompt window without the quotes and then press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>You should get a confirmation that the print spooler is stopping.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Then
 type “<strong>del %systemroot%\System32\spool\prtiners\* /Q”</strong><span> without the quotes</span> then press Enter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Then
 type<strong> “net start spooler”&nbsp; </strong><span>without the quotes and</span> then press Enter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type
 exit and press Enter to exit the elevated command window.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The print queue of your printer should now be cleared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try printing. Verify if this resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</span></span></span>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>
<p><span><strong>Method 2: Check the print server properties.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Most of the time there will be more than one driver listed. If so, remove everything and reinstall the printer driver.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 start and Click on device and printers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 the printer and click on print server properties.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on the driver’s tab</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Remove
 everything listed there.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Ok</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Then
 reinstall the printer driver and check.</span></p>
<strong><span><strong>Method 3: </strong></span>&nbsp;Remove and reinstall the HP software</strong></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>
<p><span>To do so, you can run the HP uninstaller by following steps from the article below.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Uninstalling the Printer Software<br />
</strong><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c02259020&amp;cc=us&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;product=3422472&amp;tmp_track_link=ot_search#N1438" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c02259020&amp;cc=us&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;product=3422472&amp;tmp_track_link=ot_search#N1438</a></span></p>

<p><span>Hi Thirteenthdancer,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on the forums.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Question, where did the file came from? Did you convert it when you downloaded it to your computer? What’s going on is that you either need to convert the file or,
 you don’t have the proper codec to play this file using media center. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try importing it to Movie Maker and save it as a .WMV file. You can also follow the instructions on this article about
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Codecs: frequently asked questions</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/3d0c5a49-8f61-45cc-8a7d-38c4695ba9291033.mspx#EEB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/3d0c5a49-8f61-45cc-8a7d-38c4695ba9291033.mspx#EEB</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are hundreds of audio and video codecs in use today. Some have been created by Microsoft, but the vast majority of codecs have been created by other
 companies, organizations, or individuals. By default, the Windows operating system and the Player include a number of the most popular codecs, such as Windows Media Audio, Windows Media Video, and MP3.</span></p>
<p><span>There might be times, however, when you want to play content that was compressed with a codec that Windows or the Player doesn't include by default (for
 example, a file compressed with the DivX video codec or the Ogg Vorbis audio codec). Because the Player is extensible, in many cases you can download the necessary codec from the web for free or for a fee. And, in some cases, the Player can automatically use
 the codecs installed by other digital media playback and creation programs on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Some codecs are available for download from the
</span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=40931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>WMPlugins.com Codec</span></span></a><span>
 webpage.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope that helps, please post back and let us know.

            <p>Thanks for trying to help. I did follow your instructions but the microsoft media player in Win 10 Professional does not play mp4 videos any more since I installed the Windows10-KB3010081-x64.msu media pack on the Win10 Prof. Version. Thus, how can I de-install
 the media pack to make it work again? <br />
I also cannot see the Windows10-KB3010081-x64.msu in the installed software list.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The problem is unfortunately not solved :(&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I can only play mp4 films in the Apple Quick Times Player (which I just installed) but not in the Windows Media Player any more - since I did install the media package as described earlier. Thus I somehow need to de-intall the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows10-KB3010081-x64

<h2>            Pen Tips</h2>
                    <p>Hello MS Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have what seems to be the typical failure of the Surface Book Pen tip. What in God's name can I do about this. There is no store anywhere near me than can supply me with the replacement tips, Microsoft online is OUT OF STOCK WHAT?! and the warranty order
 "conveniently" has no option for pen or pen tip replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've tried to purchase from Amazon.ca but was deterred by the 170 DOLLARS FOR SHIPPING AND FOUR WEEK DELIVERY! What is going on here? I spent 4,200 shmeckles for this 'omni-potent' machine, and have had success, although more importantly, it has been heavily
 perforated with malfunctions, including this epic failure.</p>
<p><br />
Sometimes I wish Microsoft was one person, so I could punch this person in the face, though this is my unreasonable side- clearly emerging under here under these stressors.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please direct me, someone, haha, I haven't cried in years but holy zebra am I close now. If I can't solve this I'm forced to retrograde from digital notes to analog notes. What a nightmare, mid-semester Mechanical Engineering...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Somebody with the greater sense of stability and righteousness, please help me!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Jake,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Sad,&nbsp;<em>Sad</em> Customer.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem with my HP Pavilion dv7-3162nr. I ran chkdsk c: /f and get no errors. I have cleaned up my registry with both SpeedyPC and Regwork, but the machine still crashes every few days and sometimes multiple times a day. It seems to be related
 to the encryption routines I am using. I was using TrueCrypt, but switched to Folder Lock hoping that would fix the problem. It does not crash as often with Folder Lock, but still does occasionally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a dropbox link (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6vu84oqy2fwnr6a/ntKL47vGK9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6vu84oqy2fwnr6a/ntKL47vGK9</a>) to the files you indicated were needed to diagnose the problem. Any help you can give would be very appreciated.</p>

    <title>Stuttering display while playing games in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Stuttering display while playing games in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Freshly build PC was working fine till May updates.</p>
<p>Since then all games were unplayable on 1803. Tried to uninstall updates, reinstall drivers, borrowed few pc parts from a friend - nothing seemed to work.</p>
<p>Then at 07.06.2019 I instaled 1903 from Windows Insider program. Not a clean install, just upgrade - worked like a charm. But it was not a happy ending, I could delay updates only for 7 days, left home for few days (PC was still in use by my GF for her work)
 I came back at 17th, !@#$ - it happens all over again, check everything - seems fine, look at update history - 16th Windows got updated. FML.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Noticed that here:&nbsp;<a href="https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/1004600/geforce-drivers/all-games-stuttering-with-fps-drops-since-windows-10-creators-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/1004600/geforce-drivers/all-games-stuttering-with-fps-drops-since-windows-10-creators-update/</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing that seems to somehow ease the pain of it (not make it completly gone) is app that cleans cached memory, which is not in use:&nbsp;<a href="https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/fix-game-stutter-on-win-10-1703-1809.420251/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forums.guru3d.com/threads/fix-game-stutter-on-win-10-1703-1809.420251/</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there are few questions left:</p>
<p>Do Microsoft knows about this problem?</p>
<p>Why the F thier updates get !@#$ broken?</p>
<p>Do I really have to get back to use Win7 in order to terminate any updates? IDGS about all new functions when basic functionality of PC gets F'ed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I use: 1903, 18362.145 - any idea how to get and install some other version to get my PC back up and running?</p>
<p>If I try to do this with same install file it wants to do full clean installation, and I've got so much stuff that I don't want to download again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For support answers: YES, I CHECKED EVERYTHING BEFORE POSTING, U RESPONDED TO A TON OF SIMILIAR POSTS - SAME RESULTS - PROBLEM STILL EXIST, NOT A HARDWARE OR DRIVERS FAULT.</p>

            After fighting the same issue as well as others.that are verified by Toshiba/Dynabook I clean installed 1803 and every issue is solved. Whatever 1903 broke its just not worth the time anymore.

<h2>            Error al instalar controlador de adaptador inalambrico xbox  &#91;Edit - Translation&#93; - Error installing xbox wireless adapter driver</h2>
                    <p>Buenas</p>
<p>
</p><p>Expongo el problema que he tenido y a continuacion como lo he solucionado, para que si le pasa alguien más no se vuelva loco como yo, y para que el soporte técnico de Microsoft este enterado del fallo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Compre el adaptador inalambrico de windows 10, al conectarlo no se instalaban los controladores, una ventana emergente indicaba que estaba listo para usarse pero al ir al administrador de dispositivos en lugar de aparecer en adaptadores de red aparecia en
 otros dispositivos y bajo el nombre Xbox ACC, probe lo que decia en el web de soporte, desinstalar divers reiniciar y reinstalar pero seguia con el fallo, probe en todos los puertos del pc y siempre pasaba lo mismo. Me puse en contacto con el soporte por chat
 y por teléfono y en ambos canales se me indicó fallo del dispositivo, les hice caso y fui a descambiarlo a tienda. Con el nuevo me pasaba lo mismo asi que me dio por indagar. No tenia otros pc con windows 10, asi que probe en los de varios amigos, en varios
 me indicaba lo mismo pero en el último que probé se instalo sin problemas y funcionó, la unica diferencia que pude sacar entre todos los equipos probados es que en el que funcionó tenia el sistema operativo casi recién instalado. En fin, localice los driver
 en el equipo que funcionó, los instale manualmente en mi equipo y solucionado, ya puedo usar el mando.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desde que hable con soporte les pregunté que si habia algun enlace en la web para bajar directamente los controladores para la instalacion manual y se me dijo que no. Pongo este post principalmente para que esto se haga, evidentemente no voy a subir dichos
 archivos aqui dado que no se si seria lo apropiado, tambien lo pongo para que si a alguien le pasa lo mismo sepa como solucionarlo, aunque sino dispone de otro pc en el que le funcione si o si tendra que hacer la instalacion de forma manual o plantearse un
 formateo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Un saludo</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[Edit - Translation] - </strong><span><span><strong>Error installing xbox wireless adapter driver</strong><br />
<br />
</span><span><strong>Good</strong><br />
<br />
</span><span><strong>I expose the problem
 I have had and then how I have solved it, so that if someone else happens to you, do not go crazy like me, and for Microsoft technical support to be aware of the failure.</strong><br />
<br />
</span><strong><span>Buy
 the wireless adapter of windows 10, when connecting it the drivers were not installed, a popup indicated that it was ready to be used but when going to the device manager instead of appearing in network adapters it appeared in other devices and under the name
 Xbox ACC, </span><span>probe what it said on the support website, uninstall divers
 restart and reinstall but still with the failure, probe in all ports of the pc and always the same thing happened.
</span><span>I contacted the support by chat and by phone and in both channels I was informed
 of the failure of the device, I listened to them and went to exchange it to the store.
</span><span>With the new one, the same thing happened to me, so I started to investigate.
</span><span>I
 did not have other PCs with windows 10, so I tried several friends, in several they indicated the same thing but in the last one I tested it was installed without problems and it worked, the only difference that I could get between all the tested equipment
 is that in the </span><span>that it worked had the operating system almost newly installed.
</span></strong><span><strong>In short, locate the driveren the equipment that worked, install them manually on
 my computer and solved, I can use the command.</strong><br />
<br />
</span><strong><span>Since I spoke with support, I asked them if there was a link
 on the web to directly download the drivers for the manual installation and I was told not to.
</span><span>I
 post this post mainly for this to be done, obviously I will not upload these files here since I do not know if it would be appropriate, I also put it so that if someone does the same thing, they know how to solve it, although they have another PC in the
</span></strong><span><strong>what works if or if you have to do the installation manually or consider a format.</strong><br />
<br />
</span><span><strong>a greeting</strong></span></span></p>

<p>Hello Victor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your finding here on the forums. I agree with you here, having a link on the web to directly download the drivers for the manual installation sounds like a great idea. If you haven't already, I recommend submitting this as an idea on
 our<a href="https://xboxideas.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Xbox ideas website</a>. From there, users can submit ideas for other customers to upvote or expand upon for Microsoft's viewing.</p>
