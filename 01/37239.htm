<h2>            Surface 3 won&#39;t charge over 40&#37;</h2>
                    <p>My battery stopped charging the other day. I looked it up on the Microsoft website and followed all the instruction provided in the battery issues article. This helped my Surface to start charging. I shut it down and had it charge over night but it won't
 get over 40%. Is there anything else I can do that is not outlined in the article to help it?<br />
<br />

<p>The article I followed to help in the first place:</p>

<h2>            IRQL_LESS_OR_NOT_EQUAL atikmdag.sy_ driver error, BSOD and more</h2>
                    <p>So I bought this new MSI RX 480 graphics card, that at first had problems with games, crashing and stuff, but I fixed that successfully and gamed for several happy days.
</p>
<p>Ever until a Windows update hit me this Tuesday and since then I cannot do anything without the computer crashing every hour or even every 15 minutes, games, youtube, chrome browser, DESKTOP anywhere it can happen and I have no clue why it happens. Sometimes
 I get a BSOD saying IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL what failed: atikmdg.sys, sometimes the screen just goes black and after 10-15 seconds the computer restarts itself.</p>
<p>This is really getting on my nerves as of the fourth day I can't do anything without living in the fear of the thought that the computer could crash any second.</p>

            <p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To isolate your concern with getting errors on your <strong>Windows 10</strong>, we suggest you to perform the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Perform a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clean Boot</a></strong>.</li><li>On each restart, enable the services one by one to know what program causes the problem.</li><li>Uninstall the the program that causes your driver to crash.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If in case that it still re-occurs, you can boot to <strong>Safe Mode</strong> by following the steps indicated on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

            <p>Just did the Clean boot thing(I hope I didn't screw up anything http://i.imgur.com/s4MIXl5.jpg), watched a youtube video, and decided to go and "stress" this issue and opened up around 10 different webpages. Needless to say, when I changed the currently
 displayed webpage it instantly froze the screen and the auto-restart thing happened without BSOD (this time).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: In Safe Mode it didn't happen even after 20-25 minutes with several pages open, some are youtube, even tried to play a game meanwhile but it didn't quite load within 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I guess that was to be expected, as it is an ati/amd driver file, and that is not loaded in Safe Mode</p>

</p><p>To further troubleshoot your concern, we suggest that you uninstall and reinstall your drivers. On
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>, your <strong>Windows</strong> only loads just the basic functionality from display to functions. You can refer to this

</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Does your machine also have an Integrated graphics processor, such as Intel HD graphics ?</p>
<p>If so, try running the machine using that graphics processor, and run a game using that graphics processor.</p>
<p>If you still experience the crashes the problem is probably not to do with your AMD card. There may be something else in the chain of events that causes the card to crash, resulting in an

<p>17.3.3 , 17.3.2 , 17.3.1 , 17.2.1 , 17.1.2 , 17.1.1 , 16.12.2</p>
<p>All of them failed. I guess at this point we can be sure, that there is a hardware issue here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For hardwares:</p>
<p>-I have Memory checked with memtest for 8/9 passes without error, and even took them out and replaced them into the other memory slot pair.</p>
<p>-The HDD had communication issues with the system, and it grew by 400 over the last few days (from 15112 to 15523) although the games I had crashes with were not on the HDD, so not sure if that's a problem there. (System and few games are on SSD)</p>
<p>-I have an old HD 6870 with partially damaged memory interface, but it is functional to a certain degree. I might try that tomorrow as a substitute.<br />

            <p>I didn't intend that you try a whole stack of drivers. That is just pushing guano up hill.</p>
<p>The idea is to make sure whichever driver you install is installed properly and not corrupted, so you</p>
<p>can move on to troubleshooting other potential issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"memtest for 8/9 passes without error"</em> </p>
<p>
</p><p>- If using <em>memtest86+</em>&nbsp; it is generally recommended to run overnight for a proper test.</p>
<p>- If you used Windows <em>Memory Diagnostics Tool</em> ,&nbsp; running it for 2-3 hours should do in most cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"The HDD had communication issues with the system,"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp;It could still be involved.&nbsp; Try disconnecting the HDD, and run one of the games on the SSD.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"and it grew by 400 over the last few days""</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- No new files you are able to identify in the 400MB ? </p>
<p>Is there much cpu or RAM use while at idle ?</p>
<p>If you can't identify what the source of the extra 400MB is, or there is a lot of cpu or RAM use</p>
<p>at idle it maybe due to a Virus/Trojan/Malware&nbsp; ?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I have an old HD 6870 with partially damaged memory interface"</em> </p>
<p>
</p><p>- Sure, if you don't have the R9 380, give it a whirl, but if the game needs to use the suspect part of the VRAM
</p>
<p>you will still have issues.&nbsp; If you don't have any problems it would at least rule out the PCIe slot, and</p>
<p>point more toward a problem with the 480.</p>
- No integrated graphics on your machine to test with ?<br />
<p>
</p><p>- Note that any software you launch after booting into Windows may not come into the equation when</p>
running in Clean Boot, so there is still a potential for a software conflict.
<p>
</p><p>- It still may be worth posting the mini-dump, so you have more information before contacting MSI
</p>
<p>regarding a warranty exchange/RMA.</p>

            <p>What is the exact message (no paraphrasing) you are getting? Do you mean to say that there is a shield on the shutdown button indicating that there are updates downloaded and ready to install? If that is the case, you should "shutdown" instead of rebooting
 to get the updates to install. You can also visit the WU Website to see if there are updates available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tip: Resetting he WU componets may resolve the issue.</p>

<p>The click-chain would be:&nbsp;
<strong>Settings / Accounts / Family &amp; other users / Add someone else to this pc / I don't have this person's sign-in information / Add a user without a Microsoft account</strong>.<span>&nbsp;

<h2>            &#34;Choose another operating system&#34; menu for dual-boot appears after Windows 10 runs it&#39;s diagnostics and repair</h2>
                    <p>I have been running Windows 10 for 3 weeks. I upgraded from Windows 7, which was dual-booting with Windows XP. I've had a problem with my graphics card driver in Windows 10 (the Windows 10 WHQL signed version from the AMD website), causing it to give me
 many different types of blue screen errors the moment the computer starts booting up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the&nbsp;"Choose another operating system" menu appears&nbsp;<em>after</em> Windows 10 starts booting, and running it's diagnostics and repair. My computer gets in an endless cycle of booting up, giving me a (different) blue screen error, then
 rebooting, until it does the Diagnostic, then some more reboots, the Preparing Automatic Repair, and it's only when it's fully fixed Windows 10 startup that it will present the menu to allow me to boot into Windows XP so I can run chkdsk and other offline
 repair tools. When it's at the point of the dual-boot menu, I can either continue to boot up perfectly into Windows 10, or into XP. But it takes 40 minutes of endless reboots and repair, trying to fix and load an operating system that I'm not trying to access.
 (For my particular error, running chkdsk in WinXP <em>did </em>find &amp; repair file issues with the graphics card drivers)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dual-boot menu should be before the Windows 10 startup/diagnostic/repair cycle, because I don't need to diagnose/repair/load Windows 10 if I've turned my computer on to use the other operating system.</p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for the info but this doesn't address the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(If I let the automatic repair run to completion, it is successful, and I'm able to get to the Windows 10 desktop and use the computer as if there was nothing wrong. It takes 40 minutes of endless errors, reboots and repairs - all automatic - for me to get
 to the Windows 10 desktop.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that, if somebody has a corrupt Windows 10 installation or driver files and they have dual-boot already set up, they should be able to boot immediately into their other operating system so that they can at least use their computer when they
 need to, until they're able to fix their installation of Windows 10 properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My driver issue happens every time I boot up Windows 10 - it immediately gives me some fatal blue screen error and restarts the computer. I know that my issue is with my graphics card drivers - so please don't give me help on "how to install graphics drivers"
 - I'm talking about something more fundamental: I have a dual-boot Windows 10 PC, which I can't use because Windows 10 takes 40 minutes to repair itself before it displays the "Choose your operating system" menu. By the time it gets to this menu, I don't need
 to boot into Windows XP any more because Windows 10 has finally repaired itself enough to let me load Windows 10 to the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I shouldn't have to turn on my computer and then wait 40 minutes for it to repair itself, if I want to start working right away. I should be able to turn it on, and boot immediately into Windows XP if I want to.</p>

<h2>            Watch Dogs &#38;quot&#59;hangs on quit&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>I bought a retail disc version of Watch Dogs on day of release along with the Season Pass (digital download). The game installed perfectly and when I finished playing I "quit to main menu" upon doing this the game seems to just hang there, using the guide
 button on the xb1 controller will take me back to the console dashboard no problem so it seems like a game fault rather than console. When I restart the console I can start the game again and it looks as though I haven't lost any progress, Is anyone else experiencing
 this?</p>

<p>I don't have the game yet, but just in reply to the OP on having to restart the console. Rather than restarting the whole machine, why not shut the game down?</p>
<p>To do this, hit the guide button so that you see the dashboard with the game still in the large "Window". Press the start button (Well, what was the start button on the old controller, forget what it's called now) and a menu will come up. There's a "quit"
 option in that menu that should stop the game. The next time you launch it, it should start up from scratch, rather than resuming the hung session.</p>

<p>Sorry fyrbreak, I meant to say restarting the game rather than the console. As I previously said, I can get back to the dash easily enough it was just the game hanging that was of concern. Since I first posted there seems to be more people reporting this
 issue.</p>

<p>Sorry Epic, I misread that. I've had to manually "quit" titanfall once or twice when the servers were doing funky things. I purchased watchdogs this morning before I left for work and started the download. Should be good to go for when I get home. :)</p>

<p>This happens as the game is trying to connect to Ubisoft servers which are overloaded with players. As players change games/Ubisoft adds more capacity you should notice this hanging behaviour disappear.</p>

<h2>            Video calls and audio calls are freezing after a couple seconds.</h2>
                    Same issue as described by others here. Video calls or audio calls will connect for a couple seconds and then freeze. Sometimes they wouldn't connect at all. It keeps saying there is an internet connectivity problem. I did a speed test and my download
 speed is 81 meg/sec, upload was 80 meg/sec. I literally have changed nothing. I then updated to 7.40.0.103 and that made no difference. I just tried again this morning and I still have the same issue. I uninstalled and re-installed the software as well and
 that did not change anything. I went in and delete the config.xml and that made no difference. I reset internet explorer as recommended in other posts and that has not helped. I've tried on 3 different desktop computers and get the same outcome. However, I
 skyped from Iphone to Iphone on the same network as the computers and that worked. Any help would be appreciated. I work at a TV station and we use skype often for interviews. The account I'm using is WHEC.TV1 if that makes any differe

    <title>How do I Reset Gatherer Component of Windows Search - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> curious joe  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I Reset Gatherer Component of Windows Search</h2>
                    <p>Over a year ago, I set the index location of Windows Search (on a computer hosting Windows 7 Home Premium) to "D:\Windows\Search" on a non-system drive in order to improve overall system performance.&nbsp; Recently, I reset the index location to its original
 path ("C:\ProgramData\Microsoft").&nbsp; However, the Gatherer component still uses "D:\Windows\Search".&nbsp; This means Windows Search uses both the system and non-system drives to maintain its indexes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apparently, setting the Index Location option on the Advanced Options dialog (from the Indexing Options dialog) updates the configuration of the Gatherer component only once.&nbsp; Subsequently changes do not update its configuration as shown by the following
 registry keys:</p>
<p><br />
Registry Path: Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Search\Gathering Manager</p>
<p>Registry Key: DefaultApplicationsPath<br />
Current Value: D:\Windows\Search\Search\Data\Applications\<br />
Original Value: %ProgramData%\Microsoft\Search\Data\Applications</p>
<p>Registry Key: TempPath<br />
Current Value: D:\Windows\Search\Search\Data\Temp\usgthrsvc<br />
Original Value: %ProgramData%\Microsoft\Search\Data\Temp\usgthrsvc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I cannot update these registry keys manually because their access control lists grant Administrators read/query access only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I configure Windows Search (including the Gatherer component) to use its original index location?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I found a solution: Turn off Windows Search and then turn it back on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After turning off Windows Search, I noticed that the aforementioned registry keys were deleted.&nbsp; Of course, they were recreated after turning it on.&nbsp; Also, note that Windows requires a computer reboot after enabling or disabling the feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the steps to enable/disable Windows Search:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Click Start, Control Panel, Programs, Turn Windows features on or off</p>
<p>2. On the Windows Features dialog, navigate to the Windows Search node, deselect the check mark next to it to disable (or select it to enable if it is already disabled), and then click OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps anyone with a similar issue.</p>

<p>My best advice is to try the dashboard deals and buy GOLD from the dashboard and then you can cancel the auto renewal.

 it boots just fine. I have run driver verifier.</p>

<br />
<br />Recommendations
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />2. Breakaway Audio Enhancer driver is very old. Its date is of 2009. It is recommended that you should update this driver from manufacturer's site. I have a feeling that you won't get updated driver for this. If update is not possible, disable this (not uninstall) and see whether BSOD stops.

            Hi  Lukáš
<br />
<br />If you do use Breakaway Audio Enhancer,,you should re-install Breakaway Audio Enhancer, to see if that resolves your system crashes, the current version on their website is fully compatible with Windows 10
<br />
<br />If that is something you no longer use,then you should uninstall that software . . .

            <strong>1601 Fix</strong><br />
<br />
1. Click START, and then click RUN.<br />
2. In the OPEN box, Type msiexec /unreg, and then click OK<br />
3. When this process is complete, click START, and then click RUN.<br />
4. In the OPEN box, type msiexec /regserver, and then click OK.<br />
5. Now install&nbsp; Turbo Tax.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Another Possible Fix for 1601 <br />
</strong><br />
1. Open a command prompt. (Start -&amp;gt;Run-&amp;gt; type "CMD.EXE" or "command")<br />
2. Type msiexec /unregister and press Enter.<br />
3. Type msiexec /regserver and press Enter.<br />

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>=================================<br />
Maybe the freeware DVD Flick would be worth a try:</p>
<p>(FWIW) It's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore Point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
DVD Flick<br />
<a href="http://www.dvdflick.net/download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dvdflick.net/download.php</a><br />
(the file you need to download is : 'dvdflick_setup_1.3.0.7.exe')<br />
<br />
Save the file to a folder on your hard drive and<br />
install from there.<br />
<br />
Be sure to read the Guide:<br />

<br />
To create a basic Video DVD that should play in a free<br />
standing DVD player...try the following...<br />
<br />
First...read the DVD Flick Guide to familiarize yourself<br />
with the program.<br />
<br />
Open DVD Flick and insert a blank DVD in your burner.<br />
<br />
If your computer's Autoplay window opens....just close it.<br />
<br />
Click the Project Settings button and go to...Video /<br />
Target format...residents of USA...choose...NTSC /<br />
Accept.<br />
<br />
Left click the Add title button and browse to your<br />
Movie Clips and select the ones you want on the DVD.<br />
<br />
You can arrange them by selecting one and then use<br />
the Move Up and Move Down buttons.<br />
<br />
Left click the Create DVD button / OK / Yes / Yes.<br />
<br />
Wait while the DVD is created.<br />
<br />
When the text "Finished Successfully" appears you<br />
may close DVD Flick. Now you can eject your DVD<br />
and play it in your DVD player.<br />
<br />
At some point you may wish to purchase more<br />
advanced software like Cyberlink, Nero, Roxio,<br />
Ulead, etc...but at least this is a start.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

                    Can't find any info on what this means or what to do so I can update again in Windows Defender. this error message only started showing up recently, or at least I think so. I thought it was updating automatically but when I tried to do so manually because
 it said it was out of date. Tried several times but get same message each time.

            <p>You're welcome. Your computer should NOT be connected to the internet or any networks without a fully-functional, fully-updated&nbsp;anti-virus application installed. But first, let's take care of any Norton "leftovers"...<br />
<br />
1. Download the Norton Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop: 
ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/removal_tools/Norton_Removal_Tool.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Right-click on the file you saved in #1 above and select Run as Administrator to run the utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.<br />
<br />
Now you'll need to download/install an anti-virus application. While I don't professionally recommend AVG, you might find that AVG Free v9.0 more compatible if you select a CUSTOM install this time around and do NOT install Linkscanner, Search-Shield, Active
 Surf-Shield, Security toolbar or any of the email scanning components.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Why you don't need your anti-virus to scan your email&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://thundercloud.net/infoave/tutorials/email-scanning/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://thundercloud.net/infoave/tutorials/email-scanning/index.htm</a><br />
<br />
Otherwise, I can recommend <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Security Essentials</a>* and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.free-av.com/en/trialpay_download/1/avira_antivir_personal__free_antivirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Avira AntiVir</a> (all free) as well as NOD32 and Kaspersky (not the "internet security"
 suites). After installing your chosen AV app, manually &amp; repeatedly update it until you get a "no more updates" prompt.<br />
<br />
[Avoid Norton, McAfee, AVG &amp; Avast&nbsp;applications IMHO.]<br />
<br />
=============================<br />
* Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) includes an anti-virus and anti-spyware components. The latter will replace (and should automatically disable) Windows Defender in Vista.</p>

    <title>PC unusable after Windows 8 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rashad_oz  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC unusable after Windows 8 update</h2>
                    Hello.<br />
I look after my father's PC. IT is a Samsung F3SR notebook. It has Windows 8 Pro (64 bit)&nbsp; installed.<br />
It has been running fine, but today (morning of 15th Dec)&nbsp; it had pretty much frozen. The HDD light was flashing periodically, but:<br />
the Metro screen (and computer) was unusable.:<br />
- Could not scroll to right, <br />
- Apps would not open<br />
- Shortcut keys were not responding<br />
- Live tiles had stopped changing<br />
<br />
He told me he had seen a message about Windows updates this morning.<br />
After trying to get to the control panel or other troubleshooting panel (search did not come up too), thought it needed a Refresh.<br />
Tried Refresh twice, both ended with the machine in the same state ... almost at a standstill, nothing working.<br />
About the only thing that worked was Ctrl-Alt-Del (to bring up the menu)<br />
<br />
I then decided to restore an image.<br />
Have to say, Win8 image restore is the fastest windows restore I have ever experienced. It absolutely flew.<br />
<br />
OK, had to prove the updates theory, so tested it out for a while. All fine, installed app updates. No problem.<br />
Then did a Windows update and bingo!&nbsp; (or should I say Bing!) - froze up again.<br />
<br />
He has another PC, newer Samsung i7 which has all updates installed - not a problem<br />
Also my own Windows 8 running in VMware 9 is just fine (also updated) <br />
<br />
So it is just this Asus PC - slightly old C2D Intel CPU, but 8GB of Mem and fast disk<br />
Have turned off Win Update while I figure this out.<br />
As best as I can deduce, it was one of:<br />
KB2779768<br />
KB2779444<br />
KB2779030<br />
KB2779562<br />
<br />
And that is not with any firm idea - just based on the fact that the other PC had these downloaded as well (over past 24 hours)<br />
<br />
I know its not malware (after the update test)<br />
I cannot run the Windows Update troubleshooter - because once the problem happens I cannot run anything at all.<br />
Will have to do a step-by-step update install test to try and locate it - but haven't the time now.<br />
I am not expecting MS to give me any useful help with this, but just writing it up for others to match up with their own experience.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
rashad<br />
<br />
PS:&nbsp; Word of advice: Backup to images as much as possible. The speed of an image restore leaves Reset for dead - and you then have to reload all your data anyway...<br />

I wanted to ask a question yesterday and forgot that I had this profile from 2009.
<br />
The problem is that the process let me create a new profile with a different user name but my same hotmail address as this one. Now, I would like to access/delete the newer one, but every time I sign in to MS Communities, it finds this one.<br />
<br />
Of course, my question from yesterday exists, so if someone answers, I cannot reply any more because I can never sign on as that user.<br />
Thsi is it...<br />

</a><br />
It's perplexing!<br />
<br />
Any suggestions as to how I can access my other profile?<br />

            <p>I <u>think</u> it is impossible to create another profile on MC&nbsp;with exactly the same Microsoft account, so you may have used a slightly different account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My advice: just forget about your new profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm going to merge this question now in your original question at <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_update/pc-unusable-after-windows-8-update/a8dbf79e-e86e-4018-80e5-3661e45e4532">

You can just reply there. Everyone understands now that you are the person who originally asked the question.</p>

Apparently it could be arranged to have you banned.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ;&nbsp; }</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but I would have thought that meant the Live ID associated with the user's Answers Profile would be what was "banned".&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe that would happen but then you would have to arrange also to be unbanned so you could use your Live ID again?&nbsp;&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp;&nbsp; Try
 it and come back to tell us how it works.</p>

<p>Hi Stacy Bruce,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype to phone is essentially using your Skype account to contact someone on their mobile device or landline.&nbsp; Skype is free if you are talking from Skype to Skype but there are very low rates if you wish to call a phone.&nbsp; For more information on rates,
 please check out this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1214/how-much-does-it-cost-to-call-mobiles-and-landlines-from-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1214/how-much-does-it-cost-to-call-mobiles-and-landlines-from-skype</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps .</p>
