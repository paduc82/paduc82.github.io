<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have </p>
<p>MacOS Mojave</p>
<p>Version 10.14</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was not given a Service Request Number. I talked to a Microsoft representative named Nihal from 7:10 am- 8:30 am on Oct 16. I have a screenshot of my conversation, the representative had control over my computer but he was not able to solve the issue.
 He told me to post my question here.</p>

            Yes, I cannot launch it. Every time I download the app, I see a broken image, it says&nbsp;New Look. I cannot click on it. It's just a still image in blue with words in white. The Microsoft representative erased the previous skype apps and re-downloaded it.
 But we saw the same problem, same image.&nbsp;

<h2>            Can&#39;t Send emails with mail.mchsi.com</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 10 and Live Mail (from before I upgraded from 7 to 10).&nbsp; My email worked fine for about a month after the upgrade - then out of the clear,&nbsp;cannot send emails.&nbsp;&nbsp;My Internet provider (Mediacom) said&nbsp;my public&nbsp;IP was blacklisted&nbsp;due to spam
 and there was nothing they could do.&nbsp; I ran Malwarebytes and full scan - only 28 tracking cookies found.&nbsp; I changed&nbsp;outgoing and incoming to 465 and 995 (per their suggestion).&nbsp; It did not work.&nbsp; Later it did work.&nbsp; Next day, it didn't work again.&nbsp; Sometimes
 it's only blocking send.&nbsp; Another time both send and receive.&nbsp;I've unplugged modem overnight to try and get new IP address.&nbsp; Nope, same IP.&nbsp; What the heck can I&nbsp;do.&nbsp; I'm ready to just trash Live and use&nbsp;webmail from Mediacom (which I don't like).&nbsp;

            <p>Thank you!</p>
<p>On the Server tab, I changed my incoming and outgoing from mail.mchsi.com to mail.mediacombb.net.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My email server name had been only the first part&nbsp;of my email address so I added @mchsi.com to it per your instructions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My server requires authentication on the server tab is unchecked.&nbsp; </p>
<p>On the Advanced tab, I used 465 for outgoing and 995 for incoming.</p>
<p>This server requires a secure connection is checked&nbsp;for both outgoing and incoming mail.</p>
<p>It seems to now be working for both sending and receiving mail, although a sent 'test' email goes into the Outbox first for just a second and then disappears.&nbsp; I do receive it shortly thereafter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not holding my breath, but sure hope these changes do the trick!&nbsp; Sure do appreciate your help!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 System Tray gaps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> craig g hamilton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 System Tray gaps</h2>
                    I'm on Windows 10 Home, upgraded to build 1607. Perhaps unrelated, but now there appears to be a gap in the system tray area of the task bar which either randomly duplicates the left-most icon (usually Defender), though both icons wont be active, or leaves
 it as a gap which shows the desktop. Changing to show only some icons or all icons makes no difference, I've tried system scans, again no resolution. I've unlocked the task bar and tried moving the bars, it looks as though the system thinks there is one more
 icon in system tray than there actually is. can anyone help?

<p>
</p><p>That would assume there is a bug with the taskbar. Prior to this build of Windows 10 I never had this issue, the taskbar and system tray icons were functioning correctly. Now there is a gap and duplicate icons appearing.</p>

<p>Considering its a 18+ game, you cant parental control on it. Its for a mature audience. Im pretty sure if you use Parental control on it you wont be able to play the game at all.

<p>&nbsp;Unless there's a setting on the game itself you can't disable it, and putting P.C on the 360 itself will just lock the game out.

<p>Will agree with the OP though, there is just way to much of it. &nbsp;</p>

<p>At this time there is no way to put a parental control for this game on the 360 via the game. The only way that you could do this is to create another gamertag with parental controls on it, but then you wouldn't be able to play it. There are many games out
 that will allow you to hide the gore and blood, but this is not one of them!</p>
<p>If this truly bothers you though, you can always go into the audio settings and turn them down, but this alone will not stop you from hearing the cussing and so forth.</p>

    <title>Update 1703&#58; no more free icon placement&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kartoffelkuchen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update 1703&#58; no more free icon placement&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Whats wrong with the new update? It messes up my icon placement. Since for ever I put my icons at the bottom of the screen, so far the descriptions aren't even visible. My taskbar is at the top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But since the update there is huge usable zone for icons at the bottom and left side, at least 2 cm where I cant place anything, on the other edges I don't get as close to the screen border as I'm used to too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right after the update all looks fine but if I touch an icon and move it they all jump away from the screens edge towards the middle and wont move back. Updated on another PC, same thing, just not as bad, the "no icon zone" is much more smaller there, just
 a few pixels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will this get fixed? How can I get back the control over my icons?</p>

            <p>I got the Creators Update four days ago, and I can place my icons wherever the he** I want. Nobody tells the Bulldog where not to place icons. There isn't a 'no icon zone' anywhere on my desktop.</p>

</p><p>My guess is that there's something wrong with your display settings. Either your graphics card/chip or your monitor (controlled via buttons on the bezel) is not aware of the full dimensions of your desktop.</p>

            <p>Version is in the title, as I said that is Creatures Update behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- no error messages</p>
<p>- its not working in save mode</p>
<p>- it is not working for a newly created user</p>
<p>- it can be adjusted by changing the vertical and horizontal spacing options (https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16941-change-desktop-icon-spacing-windows-10-a.html) but not good enough on my main PC</p>
<p>- rolling back the Creators Update fixes it</p>
<p>- what do expect so see on a screenshot? you cant see them snaping back from the edge, you can only see a desktop where the icons are kept away from the left and bottom edges of the screen, you should be able to imagine that, if not you can easily arrange
 your icons manually on your own desktop this way and pretend windows wont let you place them near your screens edge ;)</p>
<p>- on my 40" 3840 x 2160 screen I have 2cm wide zones where I cant place icons, but mostly annoying is that it completely destroys the way I used desktops for years, by moving my icons to far down on the bottom edge that just the icons but not the description
 text is visible</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a screenshot from another person, this is a close as he gets to the bottom with his icons:&nbsp;http://www.bilder-upload.eu/show.php?file=080525-1491554286.png<br />
<br />
Mine would look the same, just that I have my taskbar on the top, bigger desktop and more icons on my workspace, and a larger unusable gap to the left side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a different machine he can do this:&nbsp;http://www.bilder-upload.eu/show.php?file=e62060-1491554681.png<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>And what I want, is to be able to do this, like it was before the update:&nbsp;http://www.bilder-upload.eu/show.php?file=a04edf-1492151156.jpg With the FireFox Icon just showing it was possible before, I don't really use it in that position. But I have some hidden
 transparent icons at the bottom only showing a few pixels above the edge to run some stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen Resolution doesn't seem to matter. since other guy is just running HD on both of his machines that behave differently.</p>

            <p>Can you move your icons half way off-screen? That worked before, If you cant you see that desktop icon behavior has changed, you are just lucky that that restrictions fit your working area of the screen, some aren't that lucky. As I said, on another PC the
 "dead zone" wasn't that big and was fixable by adjusting horizontal and vertical spacing in the registry. Still can't icons of screen, but at least it got it to hide the texts off the bottom area there.

</p><p>And this wrong display settings change magically back by undoing the Creators Update and appear back on a new try for it?</p>

            No, I actually can't move icons half way off the screen, but then I never had a reason to do that on earlier versions of Windows so I don't know if Windows 10 is any different in that respect. I suspect that most people would have no reason to place their
 icons half way off the edge of the screen.

<h2>            Windows 10 Stuck at Safe Mode Login Screen - PC Unusable</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My issue started as an intermittent Wi-Fi connectivity problem, but has turned into something much worse.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I called into the MS Help Desk to fix the Wi-Fi issue and after several attempts at troubleshooting, with no success, the MS tech told me to Boot into Safe mode. &nbsp;I did this following his instructions only to find that once I was
 at the Login screen in Boot Mode my password was no longer valid (the error message was that the PW is not correct).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I changed my PW under the direction of another tech, but neither my old or new PW gets me by this screen. &nbsp;I tried connecting via Ethernet to see if that made a difference but I am still locked out. &nbsp;My new PW works when signing into
 my MS account online and Xbox One.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My PC has been unusable for several days now.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any help would be appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

</p><p><span>Hi King,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Check for the language layout on the lock screen. Select the proper language and try to log-in.</span></p>
<p><span>You can also use on-screen keyboard and try log-in and make sure you click on the (<strong>EYE</strong>) button to check whether its entered correctly or not.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists then, I suggest you to enable the built-in Administrator account by following the steps below:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press Windows key + X and select Command Prompt (Admin).</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">net user administrator /active: yes</span></strong></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>After the command line is complete, restart the system and login to the built-in Administrator account and do the necessary changes to your account. Again, restart your computer and login to your account and disable the built-in Administrator account

    <title>Movie maker pixelates my images - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stefaniegg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Movie maker pixelates my images</h2>
                    <p>I made a wmm project using my drawings+audio tracks and am trying to save it but all the images become pixelated (especially any parts of the pictures that have gradients, it put lines of colours instead of a nice smooth gradient) no matter which video form
 I tried (high res, cd, computer...). They're all in very high resolution and look good when I watch the result on my project, so I don't understand why it would pixelate when I save it.</p>
<p>To give you an idea the images are all about 5118x4094 pixel, 72 pixel per inch. I've tried making them smaller (about 1120x900 pixel) but they still appeared pixelated when I saved the file as mp4 or other format. I've tried uploading it directly to youtube
 but the same thing happened.<br />

            <p>That's pretty much the result of taking 20 megapixel images (5118 x 4094) in a still format and then trying to shoehorn them into a much lower resolution (2 megapixel) in a video format. You don't have as many pixels to work with and as much dynamic color
 range in a video format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things that can help are cropping and scaling your images first as much as possible. But this step alone will introduce a loss in resolution, obviously. If you can get that looking as clear as possible, then try saving your video with the highest bitrate
 possible. Again, there are limitations going from still to video that you may still not be able to overcome. In particular fine line, high-detail portions will get blurry. And also gradients with lots of shades will show symptoms of banding as the color ranges
 are reduced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Higher end video programs might do a better job of maintaining the fidelity of images compared to Movie Maker, but even there they can struggle.</p>

            As I said, I've tried downgrading my images to about 800x600 and converting them to jpeg instead of using png, then trying to save that with basically every option movie maker gave me (cd, 1080, hd, for computer...). My gradients are simple, linear black
 to blue gradients (as suggested by a friend who made a very similar move maker video to the one I'm trying to make, with the same programs, format...)<br />

            Can you confirm you are using Movie Maker 2012? Your mention of saving to CD has me confused. As for going all the way down to 800x600, that would be too far. Are you creating a 16:9 or 4:3 project? Do you have any sample of the issues you are seeing (a
 screenshot or a link to a video?)

            If you are talking about pixelation in the *preview*, that's a known issue. For some reason, Movie Maker will sometimes scale up the thumbnail representation of a picture to speed up the preview window. It's just an artifact of the preview and won't affect
 the final movie. The main way around the issue is to close and reopen the project. But as you have noted, if you add additional photos, you may see the pixelation in the preview again.

    <title>vista no network drives available authority database contains internal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave_883  say:</h3>
<h2>            vista no network drives available authority database contains internal inconsistency</h2>
                    I got a windows update overnight for Vista 64.&nbsp; This morning no network drives are connected.&nbsp; I get an error message for all drives:<br />
An error occurred while reconnecting to V: to<br />
\\&lt;server&gt;\photos<br />
Microsoft Windows Network: The local security authority database contains an internal inconsistency<br />
<br />
The connection has not been restored.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only google searches told me to try rebooting and changing my workgroup.&nbsp; I tried both, and had no success.&nbsp; I also tried disconnecting a mapped drive and re-mapping it (same error).&nbsp; Any other options besides trying to roll back all the windows updates
 from last night (24 or so)?<br />
<br />
-- Update, The server is a Fedora Linux machine.&nbsp; I am able to SSH, and see that smbd (Samba) is running.&nbsp; I just went to another Windows XP box.&nbsp; It said Windows was just updated, and gives the same error when trying to connect to the drives.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Dave<br />

                    <p>I have windows movie maker version 6.1 i think but all i know is that its not the latest version and when ever i put in an AVI file it says "cannot be imported because the codec required to play the file is not installed on your computer. If you have already
 tried to download and install the codec, close and restart Windows Movie Maker, and then try to import the file again." but i have got the codec installed im really sure but i don't know how to check this. Also i have tried restarting the thing and it still
 doesn't work. also i don't know where to get the codec from and what other file types would work. I am in desperate need of help so thank you if you answer back! :D</p>

=================================<br />
There is no Movie Maker 6.1, that would be your <br />
Windows Version. Windows 7 is version 6.1.<br />
<br />
See the following link for info on finding the MM<br />
Version Number:<br />
<br />
windows movie maker Version ???<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/moviemaker-av/windows-movie-maker-version/ed0427da-55dd-4d27-b19c-abe2b32c7ec1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/moviemaker-av/windows-movie-maker-version/ed0427da-55dd-4d27-b19c-abe2b32c7ec1</a>
<br />
<br />
To install the latest version of Movie Maker for<br />
your system...see the following article:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Get Movie Maker<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-movie-maker-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-movie-maker-download</a><br />
<br />
Anyway...there are many types of .AVI files and <br />
many if not most are problematic in all versions <br />
of Movie Maker. Even if you manage to import <br />
and edit them...issues may develop when trying <br />
to encode as a movie file.<br />
<br />
Best bet IMHO would be to convert the .AVI file <br />
to the ,WMV format before importing into Movie <br />
Maker.<br />
<br />
There are many converters available on the net...<br />
some free, some retail, some better than others...<br />
the following freeware&nbsp; is just one example that <br />
works well for me.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Freemake Free Video Converter (freeware)<br />
<a href="http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/</a><br />
(Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8)<br />
(***Choose the Custom installation and carefully<br />
read *all* the install screens...there may be some<br />
items you want to uncheck***)<br />
<br />
If a green Install button appears when you launch<br />
Freemake...you can ignore it and it should disappear<br />
when you import files.<br />
<br />
To download the full version instead of using the <br />
web installer...see the following:<br />
<br />
Freemake Apps - Offline version<br />
<a href="http://www.freemake.com/offline/offline_all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freemake.com/offline/offline_all/</a><br />
(If you want to install Freemake freeware <br />
to your PC without the Internet connection, <br />
download these files)<br />
<br />
When you have Freemake installed...open Freemake <br />
and drag/drop your video files on the main screen. <br />
<br />
Or...Left click the Video button and Browse to the <br />
folder your video files are saved in. <br />
<br />
Select (highlight) the files you wish to import into <br />
Freemake and left click the "Open" button.<br />
<br />
When your video files are imported into Freemake,<br />
Left click the WMV icon at the bottom of the screen.<br />
<br />
The "WMV Output Parameters" screen will open.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Choose a "Save To" folder so you can find the <br />
converted files.<br />
<br />
Left click the "Convert" button and wait for the files <br />
to be converted.<br />
<br />
Good luck.....<br />

====================================<br />
What app did you use to convert the .avi file to .wmv?<br />
<br />
Movie Maker 2.1.2046.0 is the Windows XP version...<br />
which version of windows are you running? XP? Is it<br />
possible that it says 5.1 instead of 6.1?<br />
<br />
Is the following screenshot like yours?<br />

            <p>Since Windows Movie Maker 2.1 is a really old Windows XP version (albeit running on Windows 7 somehow, in your case), it doesn't have support for many codecs.&nbsp; In particular, it appears it doesn't like your .avi files.&nbsp; I would suggest a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use Windows Essentials (Movie Maker 2012) instead, which is designed for Windows 7.&nbsp; You mentioned you installed it and encountered crashing, so try step #2.</li><li>Update your video graphics driver.&nbsp; Run <strong>dxdiag</strong> and go to the
<strong>Display</strong> tab.&nbsp; Once you know the manufacturer of your graphics chip/card, go to their website (e.g. Intel, AMD or NVIDIA) and find a driver update utility.&nbsp; After running, see if Movie Maker 2012 will launch correctly.&nbsp; If it does, but you still
 have problems with the .avi files, see #3.</li><li>Consider converting any problem files (i.e. the .avi files) to .wmv format.&nbsp; I've used Freemake Video Converter for tasks like this.&nbsp; If you do install Freemake, be sure to choose Custom Install so you can uncheck any add-ons you don't want.</li></ol>
<p>If you still find you are having problems with Movie Maker 2012 after that, post back with more details on the exact error message and error codes.&nbsp; Also, if you want to use a "classic" version of Movie Maker for some reason, I'd recommend uninstalling Windows
 Movie Maker 2.1 and instead&nbsp;<a href="http://goo.gl/B1eRC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">installing Windows Movie Maker 6.0.</a></p>

<h2>            Tech support phone scams</h2>
                    Okay so I've read the responses to : "Windows Tech Support Phone Scam", but it's too late. Having already fallen for this clever scam, what am I to do now? Do I uninstall the "support" software &amp; malware/virus protection programs that they 'installed'
 remotely on my laptop? Is it safe to take the black tape off of the web cam? Lastly what behaviour should I be on the look out for (from the computer itself)? Help, at a loss on how to proceed!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what to do as you gave them Remote Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These so-called "Microsoft" Tech Companies either want to sell you worthless software, or gain Remote Access to your Computer to try and&nbsp;steal your Banking and Credit Card details and to also carry out an Indentity Theft on you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>As&nbsp;you have given them Remote Access and if&nbsp;you do Internet Banking, contact your Bank, explain it to them and change Passwords.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you use your Credit Card online, cancel it and get a new one issued to you.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>And the only way that you willl know that you are free of them is to save your Data and do a clean install of your Operating System.</strong></p>
<p>

<span>Hi MooJup,</span></p>
<p>
<span>The error means "Access is denied". This may happen if the "MpsSvc" account doesn't have the necessary permissions for the related registry keys.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Please follow the steps present in the below link:</span></p>

<span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943996</a>
</span></p>
<p>
<span>For the "Diagnostic Policy Service" service, the issue may occur when the account Trustedinstaller is missing the permissions for the key below:</span></p>
<p>
<span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DPS\Parameters</span></p>
<p>
<span>The permission needed is: Full Control, Read. Do follow the resolution given in the above link.</span></p>
<p>
<span>You can also try performing a system restore. Refer the below link as in how to perform a system restore:</span></p>

<p class="contentStandard">Hi,<br />
I'm having trouble using my Epson WF-2530 all in one printer. There's information below that might show what the problem is.&nbsp; I would be grateful for any help fixing this.<br />
</p>
<p class="contentStandard"><br />
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I removed the device and reinstalled it many times via a USB connection.&nbsp; I don't want a wireless connection.&nbsp; I tried installing it both from 1) the manufacturer's disc and 2) drivers and software from the Epson website.&nbsp; When
 I connect the USB cable the printer isn't recognized.<br />
</p>
<p class="contentStandard"><br />
</p>

The printer is listed in Device Manager under Imaging Devices and under Printers, but it's grayed out with a Code 45 message. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
In Control Panel &gt; Devices and Printers &gt; the Epson WF-2530 printer icon sometimes reverts to being grayed out after I've unchecked Use Printer Offline.
<br />
<br />
The Windows Troubleshooter didn't detect the cause of the problem.<br />
<br />
I can give more details about the drivers and information from the Event Viewer if it might be helpful.&nbsp; The associated Services all seem to be running.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Again, any help with this problem would be very much appreciated because I need to use my printer!

            <p>You have to install the drivers and software from Epson here--</p>
<p><a href="http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&amp;oid=209709&amp;prodoid=63095160&amp;infoType=Downloads&amp;detected=yes&amp;platform=OSF_W_8_1-64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/support/supDetail.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&amp;oid=209709&amp;prodoid=63095160&amp;infoType=Downloads&amp;detected=yes&amp;platform=OSF_W_8_1-64</a>&nbsp;
 &nbsp;(for win 8 64bits)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be sure to connect properly and <strong>turn on the printer</strong> to set up. Follow the directions at Epson support*. You are adding unnecessary steps and settings-- Printers are not hidden devices do not need additional drivers, should not be used offline.
 &nbsp;code 45 means the printer is not connected correctly. Do not use a usb hub. Make sure to use a<strong> special usb printer cable</strong> that has a square connector on one end that goes into the printer and a usb at the other end. It's not a regular usb
 cable. It does not come with the printer--you must buy one. From the setup instructions--</p>
<strong><em>You must install the software on every computer from which</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>you want to print. For the first installation, we recommend</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>using a USB cable (not included)</em></strong>

            <p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I made a mistake by refering to the connecting cable as a USB cable.&nbsp; It's the cable that came with the printer I think, and it does have a square connector on the printer end and a USB connector on the end plugged into the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link you gave opened to the Epson web page I've downloaded from several times trying to fix the problem, and I also used the CD.&nbsp; My computer is on a LAN and as far as I know my print jobs aren't rendered on any other printers on the network, but you
 quoted Epson, "You must install the software on every computer from which you want to print," and I wonder if this is an issue.&nbsp; The printer worked before without problems but stopped working awhile back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try again to connect the printer using the Epson website.&nbsp; It will be a bit later but I'll see what happens.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello Giridhar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please excuse my delay in returning to update progress (lack of progress!) trying to fix the problem with my printer.&nbsp; I have Windows 8.1 on my system and I did a refresh so I could keep all my files, but the problem persists.&nbsp; I'm getting ready to do a
 complete system recovery if after chkdsk /f/r and sfc /scannow things don't improve because of general problems with this notebook. I've scanned with Avira and can't find anything there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I neglected to give my system specs when I posted so I am not all that helpful.&nbsp; I have a ASUS X551MA x-65 based Notebook with Windows 8.1 OS which was a gift given to me.&nbsp; I'm very grateful for the gift, but I would never recommend this product
 to anyone if only because of&nbsp; the poorly designed and badly functioning touchpad and keyboard.&nbsp; There are other issues, too.&nbsp; I had a beautiful Dell Inspiron for years, a HP Compaq Presario whose hard drive finally died after 8 years of heavy use, and those
 machines were a dream compared to the ASUS X55MA I'm now using.&nbsp; I write this to warn people, and I hope this is OK to do.&nbsp; If not I'll delete this but people should know.&nbsp; It's been a problem from the first day I got it, and the man who gave it to me works
 hard for his money and I don't want him to know it was wasted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll update ASAP.</p>

            Did you ever find a solution? I have the same problem. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the software many times; it works fine for a few days then goes offline again, and only works when we reboot the computer. I've also changed my modem/router.&nbsp;

<h2>            Backup doesn&#39;t work.</h2>
                    <p>I can't obtain any backups, whether System Image, full or incremental backups. I've had this problem for some time in Windows Vista, but recently updated to Windows 7, and hoped it would disappear.<br />

            Hi RichardSteel,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting in Microsoft answers!<br />
<br />
The error 0x80042308 is related to Volume Shadow Copy. <br />
<br />
Check if the Volume Shadow Copy service is running on your computer or not. <br />
<br />
To check for the same,<br />
<br />
1. Click ‘Start’, type ‘services.msc’ and hit Enter.<br />
2. Locate “Volume Shadow Copy” and check if the service is started.<br />
3. If not ‘Start’ the service.<br />
<br />
If the service was already started, I’d suggest you to stop the service and restart the same. Repeat the above steps for ‘Windows Backup service”, too.
<br />
<br />
Shadow copy errors are often caused by disk problems (usually minor) which check disk will find and correct.<br />
<br />
You can solve some computer problems by checking a drive or drives for errors. For example, you can check your computer's primary hard disk to fix some performance issues, or you can check an external hard drive if it's not working properly.<br />
<br />
Follow the below steps:<br />
<br />
1. Open Computer by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Computer. <br />
<br />
2. Right-click the drive that you want to check, and then click Properties.<br />
<br />
3. Click the Tools tab, and then, under Error-checking, click Check now. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
To automatically repair problems with files and folders that the scan detects, select Automatically fix file system errors. Otherwise, the disk check will report problems but not fix them.<br />
<br />
To perform a thorough check, select Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors. This scan attempts to find and repair physical errors on the drive itself, and it can take much longer to complete.
<br />
<br />
To check for both file errors and physical errors, select both Automatically fix file system errors and Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start.<br />
<br />
Refer the below link for more details:<br />

            OK. Thanks, Gokul.<br />
<br />
The Volume Shadow Copy was already started; (however - see below).<br />
<br />
Stopped both VSC &amp; Windows Backup Service, and restarted. Backup still didn't work.<br />
<br />
I ran CHKDSK with both options set on all drives involved in the backup. (Including both hard disc partitions, another drive to be backed-up and the external drive to be backed-up to.) Stopped and restarted services again. Backup still did not work.<br />
<br />
I've been working through the steps ultimately referred to in your last link, above. (i.e.
<a href="http://kb.backupassist.com/articles.php?aid=2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://kb.backupassist.com/articles.php?aid=2965</a>&nbsp;)<br />
<br />
In step 1, there was only the Microsoft VSS Provider.<br />
<br />
In step 4, there was no UpgradeInProgress key in the Register location referred to, but SystemSetupInProgress was set to zero.<br />
<br />
In step 5 (with CMD run as administrator) a number of the register commands returned errors, such as swprv.dll was loaded but the call to DllRegisterServer failed with error code 0x80070715.<br />
<br />
The destination drive is definitely NTFS formatted (and was backed-up to successfully from my notebook PC) and has ample capacity.<br />
<br />
At present, backup still isn't working, but now the error code is 0x81000019, and I find that the VSC service has stopped after backup fails, although it was started before the backup attempt.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Richard<br />
<br />
I haven't yet reinstalled COM+, but will do that later today, as soon as I have time!

            Please can I have more help with reinstalling COM+ in Windows 7?<br />
<br />
I deleted the <span>HKLM\Software\Microsoft\COM3 key, and booted to the Recovery Console. This, however, requires an administrator password. Although I am the administrator of my PC, my password is not accepted?<br />
</span><br />
Once I get into the Recovery Console and rename <span>
clbcatq.dll&nbsp;with the ~ in front, how do I reinstall COM+? Clearly the instructions you referred me to are for an earlier version of Windows. I would guess this is now achieved via the Administrative Tools in Control Panel?<br />

            Anyone??<br />
<br />
I guess reinstallation is now via Component Services under Administrative Tools in Control Panel? If I click on Action-Help, I can find...<br />
<br />
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>To install a COM+ application proxy using the Component Services snap-in</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open Component Services.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the console tree, locate the <strong>COM+ Applications</strong> folder that is associated with the computer on which you want to install the application.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Right-click the <strong>COM+ Applications</strong> folder, point to <strong>New</strong>, and then click
<strong>Application</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the COM+ Application Install Wizard, click <strong>Next</strong>.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is this what I need?<br />
<br />
Currently, if I try this, I get Error Code 80040154. Presumably because I've deleted the COM3 registry key, and not set-up ~clbcatq.dll ?<br />

            DeadManWalking86. The only reason I "messed with COM+" was working my way through Gokul T's advice. He refers to
<a href="http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/whssoftware/thread/9967a751-aa13-4f96-842c-13c44953ed48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this link</a>&nbsp;wherein brubber refers to <a href="http://kb.backupassist.com/articles.php?aid=2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this link</a>&nbsp;in which it's suggested to try reinstalling the COM+ library. I don't think either of the articles you've pointed me to addresses that issue. They concern the installation of new COM+ server applications or COM+ application proxies; not the DLL
 itself.<br />
<br />
When I got stuck as explained in my entries,above, I restored the backup I took of the
<span><span>HKLM\Software\Microsoft\COM3 key.
<br />
<br />
Everything is still working fine, including all the Office family products that rely on COM+ as explained in the overview you pointed me to, so I don't think any harm has been done although, of course, backup still isn't working.<br />
<br />
I've downloaded and installed the Windows 7 Systems Update Readiness Tool (KB947821) after checking it wasn't already installed. (My PC is set to automatically install all updates.)<br />
<br />
Have just tried backup again. Still doesn't work - error code 0x81000019. Under further information "Please check 'VSS' and 'SPP' aplication event logs for more information". Here is the information from the reported VSS error-<br />
<br />

            Many thanks.<br />
<br />
I'll work my way through the suggestions and report the results.<br />
<br />
My backup drive is definitely NTFS formatted. In fact, I've backed-up successfully to it from my other PC (a notebook; also Windows 7).<br />
<br />
Some of the suggestions refer to the 64 bit version; mine is 32 bit; are these equally relevant?<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Richard<br />

<h2>            Disk Defragment screen keeps popping up  </h2>
                    Using windows 7 home premium, microsoft security essentials. Issue is the disk defrag screen keeps popping up while I am using my pc. Never happened until I ran my first defrag. I have the settings set to schedule defrag once a month on the 15th, not every
 ten minutes I use the pc.<br />
I was running XP on my pc and did a clean install of windows 7<br />

    <title>Port Forwarding Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cipriandrugu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Port Forwarding Problems</h2>
                    Hello everyone!!! So i have tried to port forward some ports from my router's settings. Im 100% sure i have done everything correctly because i checked tons of tutorials and guides. However the port forwarding did NOT worked , checked with canyouseeme.org.
 I tried to port forward different ports so im sure its not about the ports.&nbsp;
<div>Because i couldn't find any solutions i mailed my ISP to help me with this problem and they send me the following mail:
</div>

<div>"By creating Port Forwarding you wish to permanently translate a port on the network gateway to an IP address and port of the private network. A virtual private network extend a private network over a public network such as the Internet. Allows a computer
 or a device that can be connected to the network to send and receive data over public networks as would be connected to the private network. You created a VPN connection? To connect the client to the server station in a VPN network you need VPN server ,IP
 address in the VPN network and the local path on the company server or program that you want to connect to.
</div>

<div>PPTP - is the protocol most used by VPN. This protocol allows you to connect and authenticate to the VPN using existing Internet connection.
</div>

<div>From a technical standpoint, in order to achieve such connections you need: </div>

<div>1. Router that supports PPTP connection type in the location where the server will be.
</div>
<div>2. Internet connection, in the server location with static IP. </div>
<div>3. Router's setup is done in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions
</div>

<div>Regarding the router's settings you need to know </div>
<div>that the settings wich need to be done are different from router to router so it's recomended to use your router's instructions!!!
</div>
<div>" </div>

<div>Next day i sent them a message regarding a step by step tutorial or anything like that. They mailed me again and told me that they dont give technical support,which is a bit weird because they should give technical support.
</div>
<div>Because i have no clue about how to do any of the stuff my ISP told me about,i need some help from you :)&nbsp;
</div>
<div>If you have any other solution for my problem just say it, you might solve my problem :D
</div>
<div>Thank you! </div>
<div>&nbsp;By the way my router is a TP-Link 150M Wireless Lite N Router , Model No. TL-WR741N / TL-WR741ND</div>
                </div>

            <p>Can you give some detail of what you are trying to do? For example are you trying to connect via VPN to your workplace network?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not all routers support VPN tunnelling and would require client based software to run, this particularly applies to ISP supplied routers which often have limited functions. Most remote access systems now no longer require port forwarding because the external
 service does not connect inbound, the client establishes the connection outbound. I know I require no settings on my router to join the work network.</p>

            <p>Then that has nothing to do with VPN but is entirely about port forwarding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you create your Web server you will define a listener port, default for WWW is port 80, secure is 443 but whilst in development it is better to define a non standard port so you know but no one else does (8080 is fairly common for admin connections.
 Also the web server needs a static IP address so you need to assign that and make sure the routers DHCP excludes that address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then on the router you need to forward any inbound connections on that specific port to the address of the server. Some routers config utilities will define both the forwarder and firewall rules as the same task others require it as two separate settings.
 Allow the inbound connection is firewall, send it to the server is forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing to bear in mind is most domestic ISP use DHCP for your internet facing connection so the address your server is available on the internet will change (it is not the address you assign the server itself). Dynamic DNS gets around this but if you
 are serious you need to speak to your ISP about getting a fixed IP which might be chargeable</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process for game servers is much the same except they will have their own listener ports and a general guide can be found here</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t hear anything from my earphones when i plug it into the headphone jack.</h2>
                    I have a Dell Laptop Inspiron,&nbsp; Windows Vista Home Premium.&nbsp; And I just bought it 2 months ago.&nbsp; I was listening to music from my laptop through my earphone.&nbsp; And suddenly I can't hear the music through my earphone.&nbsp; I thought my earphone was broken.&nbsp;
 So I changed to several other sets of earphones.&nbsp; And none of them work.&nbsp; But all of them worked when I plug them into my Mp3 player.&nbsp; So this is definitely not my earphone's problem, but the problem from my laptop.&nbsp; I checked the Sound.&nbsp; It showed an independent
 headphone on the playback list.&nbsp; But when I test it, i can't hear anything.&nbsp; Please help me.

<p><span><span>Thank you for using
<strong>Microsoft Answers </strong>Forums!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Did you make any changes to your system? Did you install any new Updates and/or Software?
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We can try a few steps and check if it helps:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span>Step 1:
</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Verify that the default sound device is set correctly</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>After you install a Windows Vista service pack, you may find that the default sound device, also known as the playback
 device, was changed. You may also find that the sound quality has changed. Make sure that the default sound device is set correctly for the sound device that you are using. To set the default device, follow these steps:
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong> <span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span>, type
<strong>Sound</strong> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box. </span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Sound</strong> in the search results at the top of the <strong>Start</strong> menu.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Playback</strong> tab. Notice the check mark next to the default device. For most users, the default device is
<strong>Speakers</strong>. Make sure that your audio settings are configured as expected. Follow these steps:
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>On the
<strong>Playback</strong> tab, select the playback device, click <strong>Properties</strong>, click the
<strong>Advanced</strong> tab, and make sure that the <strong>Default Format</strong> is set to the value that you expect. When you finish, close this window to return to the previous window.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>On the
<strong>Playback</strong> tab, select the playback device, click <strong>Configure</strong>, and then make sure the configurations are set correctly.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Select the sound device that you want as the default sound device, and then click
<strong>Set Default</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>OK</strong> to save your settings and to close the <strong>Sound</strong> dialog box.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>NOTE:
</span></strong><span>M</span><span>ake sure that "Headphones", "System Sounds" and "Windows Media Player” sounds are unmuted. Also
<strong>u</strong></span><strong><span>ncheck</span></strong><span> allow applications to take exclusive control of this device.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Go to Services.msc and check for the status of Windows Audio Service (Windows Audio and Windows Audio Endpoint Builder) as
 well. It should be started. </span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 2:
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>To fix these problems automatically, click the
<strong><span>Fix it</span></strong> button or link. Click
<strong><span>Run</span></strong> in the
<strong><span>File Download</span></strong> dialog box, and then follow the steps in the Fix it wizard.<br />

<p><span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Note</strong> this wizard may be in English only; however, the automatic fix also works for other language versions of Windows.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Step 3:
</span></strong></span><strong><span>Reload the current sound driver
</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try to reload the sound driver. To do this, follow these steps:
</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span><span>Click <strong><span>Start</span></strong>
<span>Collapse this image</span><span>Expand this image</span>, type
<strong>Device Manager</strong> in the <strong><span>Start Search</span></strong> box, and then press ENTER.
</span></span></li><li>
<span><span>In the <strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong> dialog box, expand
<strong><span>Sound, video, and game controllers</span></strong>.
</span></span></li><li>
<span><span>Locate the audio device that was included with the computer.
</span></span></li><li>
<span><span>Right-click the device, and then click
<strong><span>Properties</span></strong>.
</span></span></li><li>
<span><span>Click the <strong>
<span>Driver</span></strong> tab, and then click
<strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong>.

<strong><span>Delete the Driver Software for this device</span></strong> check box is cleared, and then click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>. </span>
</span></li><li>
<span><span>In the <strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong> dialog box, click the
<strong><span>Action</span></strong> menu, and then click<strong><span> Scan for hardware changes</span></strong>.
<br />
You receive a message that states that a hardware device is being installed, and then the uninstalled audio device appears in Device Manager.
</span></span></li><li>
<span><span>Close the <strong>
<span>Device Manager</span></strong> dialog box.</span></span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>Determine whether you can now hear sound. If you can hear sound, the issue is resolved. If the current sound driver
 did not reload or if it did reload, but you cannot hear sound, try the next step.
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 4: Update the current sound driver
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If the current sound driver does not seem to be working, see whether there is an updated sound driver that you
 can install.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</span></span><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Open Device Manager by clicking the
</span></span></span><span><span><strong><span>Start</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span>
 button, clicking </span></span></span><span><span><strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span>,
 clicking </span></span></span><span><span><strong><span>System and Maintenance</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span>,
 and then clicking </span></span></span><span><span><strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span><span><span>‌</span></span><span><span>
<span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In Device Manager, locate the device you want to update, and then double-click the device name.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<span><strong>Driver</strong></span> tab, and then click <span>
<strong>Update Driver</strong></span> and follow the instructions.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Reputa&#38;&#35;231&#59;&#38;&#35;227&#59;o evitar-me</h2>
                    
<p>Depois de mais de 5 anos com reputação "bom jogador" tive minha reputação alterada para "evite-me" do dia para a noite. Sem passar por qualquer outro nível de reputação e sem que houvesse acontecido qualquer tipo de problema. Entrei em contato com o suporte
 via 0800 e a resposta que obtive foi "leia o código de conduta" e afirmam que você não pode e não terá como saber os reports que eles consideraram validos. Diversos amigos estão tendo problemas com isso. Apesar de a microsoft afirmar que as denuncias são analisadas
 por uma equipe de enforcement, diversos usurário seguem tendo sua reputação rebaixada por receberem reports sem nenhum motivo. Qual a solução? Abrir uma reclamação no PROCON ou na ANATEL? Se houve qualquer tipo de violação do código de conduta por minha parte,
 quero que isso seja provado, pois estou perdendo dias da minha live (que não esta de graça) sem poder jogar online e sem nem saber o motivo.</p>

<p>Sonysta (aka Allucard), sua reputação não mudou de um dia pro outro. Vc sempre foi escroto com a galera. Levando as partidas muito a serio e xingando por mensagens, independente se ganhava ou perdia. Já foi tarde.
</p>
<p>Parabéns Microsoft.</p>
