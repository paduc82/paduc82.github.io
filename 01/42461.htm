<h2>            Skype account</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have used a skype account for many years to communicate with grandchildren and family around the world. I had a large address book and £9-10 worth of credit. When I opened Skype this evening first I was given a sign-in screen which is not normal - usually
 it loads automatically; when I entered my email address it refused to recognise the address, saying there was no account tied to that email and I should open a new one. Since I was in a hurry to speak to the grandsons and I didn't know how else to proceed
 I created a new account - with the same email address. Now I have an account but I've lost all my contacts and I've lost the credit.
</p>
<p>How am I supposed to regain access to my data, my old chat history and my money? What right do Microsoft have to deny access to my account, my data and my money in this way? What redress do I have?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Debra&nbsp;</p>

            It sounds like you are using the default locations to save your files to. Just select a different location. Use Windows Explorer to create your new folders on your D drive and then just cut and paste from your C drive (just your files!) to your newly created
 folders.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<p>Thank you.&nbsp; I finally found it but it is certainly buried.&nbsp; The only time it begins to show up is when you have a current or recently completed phone call with someone. Possibly it would show after a completed or current chat?&nbsp; If you have contacts in which
 you have never had a conversation, (or possibly a chat) I could not find translate anywhere.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I had a completed call, then per the FAQ, you can right-click on a contact and go to yet another menu item and eventually you find "translate".&nbsp; Then it sets up a group (I guess that is what it is called) with me and that contact and the translate "bot".&nbsp;
 I am a bit new to using Skype for international calls or chats.&nbsp; I knew that I would like to use the translation for chat but it does not seem to be available until you have at least one phone call or maybe an active chat.&nbsp; Maybe the system knows that it is
 an international call/chat and then decides to offer the translation feature?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also know the "translate" feature is only for chatting which makes sense.&nbsp; Now I just have to try and figure out how to help my contact in Italy, find the translate feature when we can't communicate directly.&nbsp; I only speak English and the contact only
 speaks Italian.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Google translate or MS translate so I guess I can figure out some way to show my contact how to enable the translate.&nbsp; It sure would be great if in the process of me creating the translate Group, my contact would automatically have it enabled on their
 end?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx DD</p>

<p>Thank you for the idea.&nbsp; Yes, screen shots would likely do the job.&nbsp; I am concerned however that my contact in Italy is using Skype on a phone, so i imagine the app is quite a bit different versus my desktop on Win 10.&nbsp; I guess I could put the app on my
 phone and see if I can find the translate feature and then take some screen shots.&nbsp; THX!</p>

<p>Juan, Can you please help clarify something?&nbsp; I see the You Tube video of two people using Skype, utilizing translator.&nbsp; It is a MS you tube video.</p>
<p>
</p><p><cite>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnEbQtp_r3A</cite></p>
<p>This is what I would like to do.&nbsp; It demonstrated voice translation.&nbsp; My question is:&nbsp; I have Windows 10 with newest version of Skype.&nbsp; I have just discovered my friend in Italy has Skype on an Android phone.&nbsp; Latest version.&nbsp;
 We have already talked once on Skype (then I discovered my friend only speaks Italian) but that was before I knew about the translator bot.&nbsp; Does the mobile app on Android have have the features which will allow voice translation?&nbsp; Or just Chat translation?&nbsp;
 Or both?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, best case, can I do all of the necessary things to enable translate on my end (on Win 10) so that it will work for both of us?&nbsp; Like the video sort of implies?&nbsp; Maybe my friend does not have to do any settings on their end?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or does my friend still have to enable translation on the phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx DD</p>

<p>Update: On Win 10 with the latest Skype, I have been successful in getting the translator to work, but only in one direction.&nbsp; My friend writes in Italian and I write in English.&nbsp; When I get the translate bot going on my system and add my friend, it only
 translates their Italian to English for me.&nbsp; It does not translate my English to Italian for them.&nbsp; They have a Android phone with the latest Skype app, download a week or two ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does my friend need to start the translate bot on their end as well as me starting it my end end?&nbsp; This seems to be trouble some but my friends are not very strong computer folks in Italy.&nbsp; At one point, they were receiving an error from the Translate Bot
 that it could only handle translation for two people max.&nbsp; I think we had other chat sessions going both of us tried to get the Translate Bot to work.&nbsp; We closed all of the other sessions and I recall it started working, but only in the one direction I mentioned
 above.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Do both users need to actuate the bot on their systems and does it some how need to be in the same chat because it doesn't seem to the system will do that, it wants to start another chat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Are we dealing with a croos-platform issue with Win 10 Skype apparently working with the Translate Bot but maybe the Android platform with the Skype app is unable to run the bot in that platform?</p>
<p>

<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, we cannot view this YouTube video link that you've posted, let me answer your questions one by one below:</p>
<p>
<strong>Does the mobile app on Android have have the features which will allow voice translation?&nbsp; Or just Chat translation?&nbsp; Or both?</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Unfortunately, there is no option to use the call translator for new Skype Android, but base from our FAQ help article there is an option to use chat translation only. For more information about it, please go through this link
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34542/how-do-i-set-up-and-use-skype-translator?q=translate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Click here</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Do both users need to actuate the bot on their systems and does it some how need to be in the same chat because it doesn't seem to the system will do that, it wants to start another chat.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>- As long you two are using the Skype translator bot, no matter who is the host of that chatroom, everything will do fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Are we dealing with a cross-platform issue with Win 10 Skype apparently working with the Translate Bot but maybe the Android platform with the Skype app is unable to run the bot in that platform?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>- What do you mean by this post? Were you pertaining that the translator bot is not pushing on your friends end?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will look forward to your update about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Juan,</p>
<p>I really need to have a phone discussion with technical support.&nbsp; Can I do this somehow?&nbsp; Or even a online chat?&nbsp; I try to use chat and I only get an option to Ask the Community, which is very frustrating!&nbsp; Appreciate your help but it takes a long time this
 way, back and forth, days in between, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now, I am on Windows 10 Skype, my friend is on Android phone with a Skype app recently download, maybe 2 weeks ago.&nbsp; Not sure what version they have.&nbsp; But the best I have been able to accomplish is the chat translation only works coming to me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Win 10 pc, I see the Italian words in the chat session and the bot translates almost immediately to me in English. This is working great for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My friend is not seeing this nor the Bot is apparently not working on her end.&nbsp; Does my friend have to do anything on their phone to start the bot, in the same manner that I started the bot on my Win 10 Skype app?&nbsp; I have a group of me, my friend and the
 bot when I look in my contacts.&nbsp; Is this correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>No worries about that You Tube because it is apparent that both people demonstrating the app, must have Win 10 PC's going, as it works on voice or chat and it seems very simple to add the person to use the bot.&nbsp; Not the same on Android app or apparently
 when I am communicating with someone who is using a phone app.&nbsp; Of course, I cannot not see what my friend is seeing.&nbsp; They try to send me screen shots but that is not showing me anything I can use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attached a few screen shots of my Win10 screen.&nbsp; One is the contact which I guess is now a group with the bot included?&nbsp; To set that Up, I initially had her as a contact and then right click on her, go to properties and start the translator.&nbsp; Is that
 all I have to do and it should be working in both directions? Or did I set it up incorrectly?&nbsp; The large pic is the profile of the group you see in the small picture, which is the contact list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other thoughts?&nbsp; Thank you Dave</p>

<p><span>Hello v siva kumar,</span></p>
<p><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Since
 when are you facing this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Any
 recent chnages made to the computer?</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>A flickering monitor can contribute to eyestrain and headaches. You can reduce or eliminate flickering by increasing the screen refresh rate. A refresh rate of at least 75 hertz
 generally produces less flicker.</span></p>
<p>
<span>You might need to change your screen resolution before changing the refresh rate because not every screen resolution is compatible with every refresh rate. The higher the resolution,
 the higher your refresh rate should be.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information, refer the below link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Correct-monitor-flicker-refresh-rate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Correct-monitor-flicker-refresh-rate</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Also, try updating the display card drivers.</span></p>

<br />
============================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong></p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView - set VIEW to
<br />
Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names. (Also update&nbsp;the BIOS
<br />
and chipset drivers.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and
<br />
then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to<br />
show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

    <title>SYNC CENTER NOT RECOGNISING VPN CONNECTION AS CONNECTED TO DOMAIN - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> w0ody  say:</h3>
<h2>            SYNC CENTER NOT RECOGNISING VPN CONNECTION AS CONNECTED TO DOMAIN</h2>
                    I am running Vista business service pack 2 (6.0.6002). My problem is this:<br />
I have network folders set to be available offline.<br />
When I connect to my Work VPN from home the sync centre still says that I am disconnected. All other apps are available to connect to my work domain (eg. Outlook) and I can ping the address of the server that I want to browse. I just can't see any folders other
 than those that I have made offline. My vpn connection in &gt;Control Panel&gt;Network Connections has a network category of Domain Network.<br />
<br />
When I view the properties/offline files tab the option to sync now is greyed.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
thx

            Here's a comprehensive article on Ofline Diles and&nbsp; Active Sync which may be of some help:
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749449(WS.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749449(WS.10).aspx</a>.<br />

It sounds like your active sync connection no nolnger exists and needs to be re-created.&nbsp; Here's how to check your network connections:
<a href="http://www.vista4beginners.com/Check-Network-Connection-Status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.vista4beginners.com/Check-Network-Connection-Status</a>&nbsp;(but this is probably OK if you can connect to the other sites - but it's worth a look}.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's how to run a Network
 Diagnostic: <a href="http://www.vista4beginners.com/Windows-Network-Diagnostic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

The following article includes many FAQs including how to set up a sync partnership (which you may need to do again).
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Sync-Center-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Sync-Center-frequently-asked-questions</a>.&nbsp; Here are some troubleshooting guidelines for sync problems that may answer your problem:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-sync-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-sync-problems</a>&nbsp;(though I saw nothing addressing your exact situation).<br />
<br />
Here are procedures for setting up a new sync partnership: <a href="http://www.windowsvistauserguide.com/sync_center.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.windowsvistauserguide.com/sync_center.htm</a>&nbsp;which you may need to do if your system doesn't recognize any existing partnerships.&nbsp; Remember you need to first deal with sharing and perissions before the sync can work - so do that first (if it isn't
 already done - and if it is, check it to be sure it is still correct {it may have changed for some reason)).&nbsp; The reason the sync now option is greyed is because it is incapable of syncing with the network for some reason (the connection is not there) and
 so it doesn't present it as an option - that more than anything suggests there's something wrong with the network despite the fact that everything else is working fine (most likely some simple configuration error).&nbsp; I'm not sure how the vpn connection should
 be configured (whether domain network is correct) - perhaps you can get some hep from the techies who manage the servers at your company (they've probably faced this problem before).&nbsp; I'd start over from scratch with the instructions that worked the first
 time and give it another try (you&nbsp;may need to use a new name because it may think the old one is taken even though it doesn't show a partnership).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Why by the way are we here?&nbsp; I mean, was it working and then all of a sudden it stopped (recently - maybe with the installation of SP2 or some other update)?&nbsp; Did you make any changes to your system like device drivers (hopefully you don't download them from
 Microsoft Update - you shouldn't.&nbsp; <span>
In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:
</span><span><span><span><span><span><span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista</a></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Did
 you change a&nbsp;network card or add new security or AV software?&nbsp; We may be able to fix this simply if you want to give this a try (it's a shot in the dark but it often solves problems like this and is relatively quick and simple).&nbsp;
<span>
Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time <strong>
</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work.&nbsp; Y<span>ou can make a bootable Recovery Disk using
</span><span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps on a different PC if you can't get it to work on this one but that doesn't seem to be a problem).&nbsp; Then try to sync and see if that resolves the problem. - maybe that will do the trick (if you went far enough back to when it
 was working correctly).<br />
</span></span></span></span><span>/</span><br />
Another option is to try using Microsoft SyncToy (which is a stand-alone product which is sort of an upgrade to Microsoft Sync) at:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=C26EFA36-98E0-4EE9-A7C5-98D0592D8C52&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=C26EFA36-98E0-4EE9-A7C5-98D0592D8C52&amp;displaylang=en</a>.&nbsp; Be careful if you decide to do this because the instructions are very specific and you could cause harm if they aren't followed precisely - but
 if you can do so, this may resolve your peoblem with a new program that may establish the connection and the sync with no problems (or at least less problems than you're currently having) - and you'll probably have a better product at the same time (it seems
 to have quite a few more options and features).<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

            <p>From the <strong>PortForward.com</strong> site...</p>
<p><a href="http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/Huawei/HG510/Remote_Desktop.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/Huawei/HG510/Remote_Desktop.htm</a></p>
<p>Ignore references to UDP Port 3389. You don't need to open a port for that.</p>
<p>Also...</p>
<p>Look at using a <strong>free</strong> dynamic naming service like No-IP.com or DynDNS that map a fully qualified domain name (FQDN) to your ISP assigned DHCP address. The way it works is you run a small updater program on one of your home PCs that contacts
 the No-IP.com (or DynDNS) servers on a time scheduled basis. The server then knows your current IP address and maps that to your unique FQDN. You call home using the FQDN, ie. yourFQDN.noip.com for example.</p>
<p>Note that many consumer grade routers support No-IP.com or DynDNS or similar services. That means you setup everything in the router instead of a PC on the LAN. Check the users manual for help or the manufacturers support site.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.no-ip.com/services/managed_dns/free_dynamic_dns.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.no-ip.com/services/managed_dns/free_dynamic_dns.html</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.dyndns.com/services/dns/dyndns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dyndns.com/services/dns/dyndns/</a></p>
<p>As far as the RDC host computer on your home LAN you really should use a <strong>
static LAN IP address</strong>. Not doing so can negate any port forwarding scheme you have through your router if the PC reboots and gets a different IP assigned.</p>

            There are alternatives to Windows Remote Desktop that are much simpler and more reliable.&nbsp; Keep in mind that even if you resolve the configuration issues at home and use a dynamic addressing service, you will find that the remote access will fail from
 some locations due to security restrictions or configuration issues there.<br />
<br />
Take a look at team viewer (teamviewer.com).&nbsp;&nbsp; Their latest software version supports free remote access of the type you want free for personal use, is relatively easy to set up, and will work from anywhere.&nbsp;

            XML and XHTML are related at the code level - many articles on one refer as well to the other - programs that work for one often work for the other (but I could find no readers and only that one editor).&nbsp; But I'm having a VERY hard time finding a single
 program that can read XHTML-formatted documents in any computer OS (XP, Vista, Windows7,...).&nbsp; (I haven't found a single one for certain - they seem to require special coding {and there are 3 types of code} when they are created to make them readable in various
 browsers and programs - or the browsers need special coding to be able to read them {and I couldn't find a place to download that coding - just the coding itself - for any available browser or program}).&nbsp; It seems like such files are just supposed to be read
 so easily it isn't even worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
Since I don't have an XHTML document to test, I can't try some of the possible options I've found - so it's your decision if you want to try them.<br />
<br />
Here's an article on XHTML/XML applications/text and what can read them.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.w3.org/People/mimasa/test/xhtml/media-types/results" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.w3.org/People/mimasa/test/xhtml/media-types/results</a> It seems IE has a problem with them which may
 explain the problem you're having.&nbsp; It looks like Mozilla Firefox might work (they are green across the columns) but I honestly don't know if this means those programs will open the files (since none of the columns were XHTML/text) - but I guess it's worth
 a try.&nbsp; This article is a bit old so use the most recent version of Firefox that's compatible with Vista as I doubt it lost the capability if it ever had it.<br />
<br />
Here's another XML Editor that says in the writeup that it can read and work with XHTML documents (which are a type of XML document) - but you'll probably encounter the same problem as before - I think it is reading the code instead of the resulting text.
<a href="http://www.syntext.com/products/serna-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.syntext.com/products/serna-free/</a>.<br />
<br />
Another option you might try is to contact your phone vendor and see if they offer software for reading the text files which are in XHTML - they may have a special program available.&nbsp; Check their web site and/or give them a call.<br />
<br />
I found the following in another article <a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/05/WCAG-REC-fact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.w3.org/1999/05/WCAG-REC-fact</a>&nbsp;- which may explain why we're having so much trouble:<br />
<br />
"Does document.write work in XHTML?
<p>No. Because of the way XML is defined, it is not possible to do tricks like this, where markup is generated by scripting while the parser is still parsing the markup.</p>
<p>You can still achieve the same effects, but you have to do it by using the DOM to add and delete elements.</p>
Why is it disallowed to send XHTML 1.1 documents as text/html?
<p>XHTML 1.1 is pure XML, and only intended to be XML. It cannot reliably be sent to legacy browsers. Therefore XHTML 1.1 documents must be sent with an XML-related media type, such as application/xhtml+xml."<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I found MANY programs that could convert RTF or TXT file to XHTML but NONE that could convert XHTML to anything (except perhaps the XML editors and what I listed above if they actually do work).<br />
<br />
I've spent several hours looking for something that will either read XHTML or convert XHTML into something a program that's available can read and I can find nothing (Bing, Google, Tucows, Download).<br />
<br />
If the above doesn't work, sorry I can't help you.&nbsp; Perhaps someone else will read this thread and post a solution.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>An aspect we can look at is your Windows Firewall and your third party antivirus software. It is possible that they are blocking the installation of the said update. To troubleshoot this issue, we recommend that you turn your Windows firewall and your third
 party software off to confirm whether they are blocking the installation or not. To turn off your Windows Firewall, kindly click this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028544/windows-turn-windows-firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. You can visit the support site of the third party antivirus to see how to disable it. Once the Windows Firewall and the third party antivirus software have been turned off, Windows Defender will activate when it detects that no antivirus software
 is activated. It will help protect your computer so you don't have to worry about your security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how that turned out for you.</p>

<h2>            Lock Child Account Remotely - Family Safety</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was searching for it but couldn't find it anywhere and i thought that if its not there than I should make a suggestion for the feature myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i would like to know that is it possible to lock my child's account remotely from the web panel of Family Safety in windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Like similar option which is in Android and iOS to remotely locate and lock the phone. I was wondering if Family Safety has that option.</p>
<p>I was not able to find it. If Family Safety does not have that option than i would like to make a suggestion adding that to Family Safety.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setup a Child Account and restrict all required needs.</li><li>Calling child for dinner,lunch, going out, or etc and child does not listen while too busy playing video games</li><li>Or any other example anybody could think of. I just want to lock my child's computer nothing more... will set more setting to which app or game he use later.</li><li>I would like to lock and change the password or only lock and restrict access for X mins remotely from my mobile phone or my personal computer.</li><li>So my child could learn a lesson or do his homework first. etc</li></ol>
<p>The above is just example to explain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly tell me if its possible to lock my child's account from anywhere in the world. if not then its a good idea to have it in Family Safety.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Maaz Aftab</p>

<h2>             MEDIA PLAYER 11- RIPPED CD NOT IN LIBRARY.</h2>
                    When i rip a cd in vista media player 11, it does not show up in the library,
<br />
but it does appear in my music file but with no details of the album any <br />
ideas how to put this right. <br />
I have tried re- downloading media player 11, but it says i have a newer <br />
version, &amp; will not work.&nbsp;<br />
i have checked unknown list,&nbsp;&amp; it cant find info even doing a manual <br />
check, &amp; i have tried popular cds. <br />
Also it will not sync with my walkman, or add new music to the library from <br />
files, although it will add video. <br />
There seems no way to uninstall media player, &amp; re install. <br />
Do you think i should re install windows, as a last resort. <br />
There seems to be no way of contacting microsoft, unless you pay for help.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Tried sfc/scannow, scans it, then disapears, so i assume it has not picked <br />
up faults. <br />
Tried manual search&nbsp;album art, the info comes up but is not added to the album i am
<br />
ripping when i select &amp; finish. <br />
&nbsp;Tried in mp3 format, to rip.<br />
<br />
Also i have just noticed this on itunes, but i am still using it to rip&nbsp;but it will not burn.&nbsp;<br />
The registry settings used by itunes drivers for importing &amp; burning cds <br />
dvds are missing. <br />
This can happen as a result of installing other cd burning software. <br />
Please re install itunes. <br />
Which i have &amp; i still get the warning up. <br />
I have not installed any other software.<br />
Please help.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I uncheck &#34;connect automatically&#34; on foreign networks&#63;</h2>
                    I have about 12 wireless networks in my area. I'm having problems with my wireless connection dropping occasionally and I'd like to tell my computer to ignore my neighborhood networks. From the system tray, I can see all the networks and it gives me the
 option to uncheck "connect automatically", but it doesn't stick (I return to the network and it is magically checked again). I've never connected to any of these networks, so they do not appear in the Manage wireless networks window.

            If you are running 64 bit Windows 7, then I suspect that this calendar that you ran on Windows 3.1 is a<strong>16 bit</strong> program. 16 bit programs aren't supported on 64 bit Windows 7 AFAIK...

<h2>            My PC is bugging out</h2>
                    <p>I had a few problems lately with Windows 10. My start menu would not show up when I clicked it or if I hit the windows button. Then, there came the huge problem. I was playing Skyrim, when my computer suddenly shut down. I though it might have overheated,
 so I turned it back on. When it loaded, it didn't show me my home screen, and after I entered the password, the screen was zoomed in, and the background wasn't loading. The internet was also disconnected, which is weird considering I have Ethernet.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f2e4d014-84a8-43f6-9ba4-846cf0ce8198" /></p>

            Thank you for the help even though it didn't work. I was hoping that I didn't need to reboot, but it seems as if I don't have a choice. Thanks anyway!

<h2>            Skype 8 desktop for teenagers - is there a serious version&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I use Skype for desktop version 7.40 on Windows 7 and found 8.11 version to download.
<strong>OMG what's that?</strong> It looks like Skype for kiddies or teenagers. It is not possible to use it at all on a desktop machine. No settings at all, big chat fonts, icons etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not recommend me the UWP Windows 10 version. It is buggy and unstable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will there be further updates of the 7.x version or does it mean the Skype is over for serious use?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

    <title>Moving the Magnifier icon on a Surface 2 &#40;Windows RT 8.1&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Moving the Magnifier icon on a Surface 2 &#40;Windows RT 8.1&#41;</h2>
                    My wife is legally blind and was hoping that the Surface would be useful to her for email, online, etc.&nbsp; There are a lot of items (start tiles, etc) that we can't seem to change the text size of, so she has taken to using the magnifier almost all the time.&nbsp;
 But the magnifying glass icon seems to finds it's way into the middle of the screen and very often in the way.&nbsp; I have yet to find a way to get it to move.&nbsp; Anyone have any tried and true methods?<br />

<p>I thought the opposite problem was the case--hunting for that&nbsp;hidden toolbar&nbsp;is often a problem.&nbsp; Does she know about the keyboard shortcuts associated with it?&nbsp; Also, I assume this about Fullscreen Magnifier?&nbsp;(Ctrl+Alt+F) &nbsp; OIC.&nbsp; Each mode is has independent
 positioning.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we need to find a keyboard method of getting keyboard focus and moving it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or maybe Speech Recognition?&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What about Minimizing it?&nbsp; That works using the Mouse.&nbsp; If you had it pinned to the Taskbar you could access it then by Win-&lt;n&gt;&nbsp; where n is the position on the Taskbar.&nbsp; E.g. I just dragged it into range and left it in position 5, so I would press Win-5.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 That works but I had to use Narrator (Win-Enter)&nbsp;to figure it out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the elements that I needed to use were obscured.&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise Alt-Space N&nbsp; works as usual once the Magnifier window has keyboard focus.&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hey!&nbsp; That pinned Magnifier item is useful!&nbsp;&nbsp;Win-5 is now an alternative for other methods for invoking Magnifier.&nbsp;&nbsp; So now I can Restore it with Win-5 and Minimize it with Win-DownArrow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neat.&nbsp; Thanks for making me find this!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck</p>

<p>Windows explorer is constantly not responding and restating. It is getting progressively worse.&nbsp; Also IE 8 is running very slowly.</p>

Here are some steps to make your computer run a bit faster:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Click Start&gt;search for cleanup&gt;Click "Disk Cleanup" and follow the prompts. </li><li>Click Start&gt;search for defrag&gt;Click "Disk Defragmenter&gt;Click "Defragment Now" and you're good to go.

</li></ul>
<br />
