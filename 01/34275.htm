<h2>            &#42;NEED HELP&#42; Official&#47;Legitimate way to do a Proper License Transfer</h2>
                    
<p>HELLO EVERYONE,</p>

<p>I recently purchased my 3rd Xbox 360. It is a 500GB E model. My current Xbox 360, that has the Licenses I would like to transfer, is the 320GB Star Wars S model from April of 2012. I am requesting help from you the community to give me a step by step approach/reminder
 on how to do a proper license transfer again because the way to do it has changed since April 2012 since I last did it.</p>

<p>However When I go to settings &gt; Account Management &gt; License Transfer the following is displayed on screen:</p>
<p>"This will transfer the console licenses for previously purchased content to this console."&nbsp; "You can transfer licenses between consoles a limited number of times per year."</p>

<p>I DO NOT WANT THE LICENSES TRANSFERRED TO THIS(current 320GB S) CONSOLE. This console should already have them since April 2012. I want to transfer the licenses to the new console(500GB E). Right now with the current console any Xbox Live or regular profile
 is able to play all my Games and DLC without having to sign in to Xbox Live. That is how I know the current Xbox 360 properly has the license. I want to do a proper transfer but there is too much idiotic information out there regarding the License Transfers
 process. Almost all internet videos are about getting free games and all other sorts of illegitimate methods to getting your account banned/flagged.</p>

<p>As far as I know I am supposed to:</p>
<p>1. Go into the current console &gt; sign into my Xbox Live profile &gt; go to Settings, Account Management and License Transfer.</p>
<p>2. Then remove the Hard Drive &gt; connect it to the&nbsp;Xbox 360 Hard Drive Transfer Cable &gt; connect it to the new console and transfer all the content.</p>
<p>3. Sign into my Xbox Live profile on the new console &gt; go to Settings, Account Management and License Transfer again.</p>
<p>4. Re-Download all the content so the licenses transfer over properly.</p>

<p>Please let me know if this is correct. If not someone please help me do it properly. As stated before The first and last time I did this was April of 2012 and the process has changed.</p>

<p>You need to sign into the console you want the licenses on, then go to Settings, Account Management and License Transfer. Confirm the transfer and then redownload the content onto that console. No need to move the hard drive or sign into a previous console.</p>
<p>Although, if you do the data transfer first, when you redownload the content you will only need to redownload the licenses, so the redownloads will actually go faster.

            <p>You don't need to step 3 at all. &nbsp;Just do 1,2 and 4. &nbsp;Also, make sure the transfer cable you are using is an official transfer cable (best to purchase from a reputable retailer or the Microsoft Store). &nbsp;An attempt to use a 3rd party transfer cable could make your hard drives into expensive usb devices which Xbox will not fix as they do not cover 3rd party devices.</p>

<p>Also if you followed your method, the licenses would still be tied to your current console since you did the license transfer there. You would have to wait another 4 months before you could do the transfer on the new console.</p>

<p>Hey onyx62is, I believe that you may be misreading his steps. &nbsp;If step 1 is taken, it will do the license transfer to his current console not his new one. &nbsp;This would cause him to be unable to license transfer to his new console for 4 months. &nbsp;It is step
 1 that should be skipped and follow steps 2-4. &nbsp;</p>
<p>AMERICAN RIFLE, just to add about the transfer cable, if it asks you to configure your drive once connected DON'T DO IT! &nbsp;This is what 3rd party transfer cables do and is how they will turn your hard drive into a 32gb usb device. &nbsp;You will not be able to
 recover the drive if you do this. &nbsp;If this message pops up, find a new transfer cable.</p>

            <p>You're absolutely right. &nbsp;I did misread the post. &nbsp;Skip step one. &nbsp;It doesn't matter when you do the license transfer to the new console. &nbsp;Just remember to redownload the items after doing the transfer. &nbsp;There is no need to delete anything before redownloading.</p>

<p><span><strong>OK..Fine! I understand now. DO NOT START THE LICENSE TRANSFER ON THE CURRENT CONSOLE, START IT ON THE NEW CONSOLE. Got it.</strong></span></p>
<p>However, I have a follow up!!!</p>
<p>After I am done completing the transfer of all the data from the current Hard Drive using an official Hard Drive Transfer Cable to the new Xbox 360 Hard Drive, Then log in to my account that will transfer the license and/or content, Then go to Settings &gt;
 Account Management &gt; License Transfer Then finally re-download all the content again</p>
<p>Here is the question:</p>
<p><span><strong>Do I have to download the licenses by downloading the content from inside the console?? Because doing it from xbox.com would be so much quicker than the one by one method that would be required if I did it from the
 console. Would it be okay to download all the content from my account's purchase/download history using the webpage
<a href="https://live.xbox.com/en-US/Download/History" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://live.xbox.com/en-US/Download/History</a> Would the Licenses download if I did it this way??</strong></span></p>

            <p>You can certainly start the downloads from Xbox.com. &nbsp;It works just as well. &nbsp;However, have your console on to initiate the first download as the content won't download to the new console immediately.</p>

<p><span>The reason I asked this question is because official chat support told me if I do it from the website it might not work because the license download was not "local".</span></p>
<p><span>As of right now I have completed the license transfer. There has got to be a better way to do this. Never in my life have I endured the amount of time that it took to complete the process from data transfer to license transfer
 to downloading all the content again. It is just palin and simple tragic how convoluted this process is.</span></p>

            <p>When I did my last license transfer I did it through the website and there didn't seem to be any issues. &nbsp;What I would recommend if you're not sure is to download one game from the website (to do the license) and then check to see if it can be played with other gamertags. &nbsp;Make sure that your tag is logged out of before launching the game with another one.</p>

<h2>            Age of Empires 2 and Age of Empires 2 Expansion not running.</h2>
                    I have attempted to run these discs trying any fixes that supposedly would overcome this problem&nbsp;but to no avail. I even downloaded a digital edition which would only result in an error code when trying to unzip. I have attempted to use suggested downloads
 that some claim to have success with but still cannot make it run. I have overcome the problems with AoE 1-3, EE 1-2 as well as other old programs. I have gone to several web sites that offer help but still no success. I would appreciate any advice that could
 be rendered on this subject. It seems that there may be a missing driver for those programs but tried 1 but it didn't work.

<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>There is no error message. The administrator permission screen appears and once answered yes the screen goes back to the desktop. There is no indication that a program even attempted to load, much less run.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>The game has been tried in all available compatibility modes offered, from Win 95 through to Win 8. Also is running as administrator.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>As of now I have tried several runarounds to compensate for the difficulty. It is my understanding that the programmers used “safe disk” to protect the program. Win
 10 does not recognize this so the supposed runaround for this is to change “secdrv.sys” to either manual or automatic. The start function for this program is blocked but the “auto, manual and stop” all respond in cmd screen. The other option is to download
 a digital copy which also will not unzip. This gives the error code 0x80004005 when attempting to unzip it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As of now all of the claimed fixes on this thread have been tried including some from other sources but only to the point of frustration.</span></span></p>

    <title>Missing Remote Desktop Services User Profile Tab in Windows 10 Build - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasm516  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Remote Desktop Services User Profile Tab in Windows 10 Build 1903</h2>
                    <p>Sorry if this is a little lengthy.&nbsp; I wanted to provide as much detail as possible.&nbsp; I am running Windows 10 build 1903.&nbsp; Prior to the update, I was use a custom ADUC console that had loads of LDAP queries and a couple of different domains.&nbsp; After the upgrade
 to 1903, I noticed that the <strong>Remote Desktop Services Profile</strong> tab was missing.&nbsp; The first thing that I verified is that Advanced Features is enabled on the View menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I did an online&nbsp;search and found a number of articles recommending that the following two files be copied from a Windows Server 2012 R2 server:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>tsuserex.dll to C:\Windows\SysWOW64</li><li>tsuserex.dll.mui to C:\Windows\SysWOW64\en-US</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>And then to run <strong>regsvr32 c:\Windows\System32\tsuserex.dll</strong>.&nbsp; I copied the files and successfully registered the DLL.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that made the problem worse.&nbsp; Now, I can't load the ADUC console at all.&nbsp; I get the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">MMC could not create the snap-in. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">MMC could not create the snap-in. The snap-in might not have been installed correctly.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Name: Active Directory Users and Computers </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">CLSID: {E355E538-1C2E-11D0-8C37-00C04FD8FE93}</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it was back to the Internet.&nbsp; Found an article indicating that I should look for the CSLID in the registry.&nbsp; I found that key, and it has a subkey called InprocServer32, which contains a value referencing
<strong>%systemroot%\system32\dsadmin.dll</strong>.&nbsp; The article recommended registering dsadmin.dll, which I did successfully, but that made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can create a new ADUC console, but I would need to re-create all my LDAP queries.&nbsp; I would really prefer a way to get my current ADUC console working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to fix this problem so that I can regain access to my custom ADUC console?&nbsp; Barring that, and assuming that I can access the ADUC console from another machine, is there a way to export the saved queries so that I can just import them into
 a new console?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help that you can offer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>--Tom</p>

                    My Gateway SX 2855 came with Windows 7 Home Prmium. It had NARRATOR and it worked. Eventurally it became annoying, so I "turned it off." Recently, I tried to "turn it back on" and&nbsp; I get nothing, except the variation of various graph fluxes as in Realtek

            <p>There is no Snapchat for Windows Mobile because the company that owns Snapchat refuses to create a version for Windows Mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has tried to get Snapchat to write for Windows Mobile but the Snapchat company refuses to do so.</p>

            <p>Well, you could buy the SnapChat company and then get them to make an app for Windows Phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you could simply not use SnapChat (I don't).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you simply must have SnapChat then you need another phone.</p>

            Hi immalilpeatot 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Whatever I can gather from internet, casting Roku TV through Windows 10 is something where I don't see any affirmative answer. (I have Chromecast and Google has stopped this casting from Windows 10. Now only phones can do it for Chromecast)

    <title>Transferring Subscription to a New Credit Card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cnd aaa beef  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transferring Subscription to a New Credit Card</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to transfer my Xbox Live subscription over from my mother's credit card to my own. I've added my card to the Payment Options page, but I can't remove my mother's card from the list. Both cards are on the Options list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm getting a message stating that there is still an outstanding balance on the last Gold - 12 Month renewal charged on 11/10/2012. However, my mom lost her card a few weeks later and cancelled it. We didn't update the payment options with the new card information,
 so my Gold subscription was cancelled on 26/11/2012 and this account was downgraded to Silver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I resolve the outstanding balance and transfer the Gold subscription to my credit card? Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, my subscription is set to auto-renewal.</p>

                    I just purchased the HP Pavillion All-in-One and was able to add my wireless printer. However I can't get my wireless mouse or keyboard to work. Both came with batteries included and the mouse has the transreceiver but I can't use it. It's not on my list
 of devices either. The red light under the mouse is lit. Is there supposed to be one on the wireless keyboard as well? Please help!

                    <span><span>
<div>
I've been I big supporter of Microsoft for 20+ years now but having something this simple as indexing a network drive (which XP and Vista were fully capable of ) that now is not available in W7 is a disgrace...&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I can understand removing indexing from network files if you could add them to a library but you can't even do that. &nbsp;You have to make them available offline which is not what I want, need, and highly impracticable of replicating 500GB on my 300GB laptop. &nbsp;In
 addition, don't want those files on my laptop for security concerns. &nbsp;Let us index it or add it to a library so Windows can help us find our data instead of trying to force us down a data management path that isn't practical.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
Windows 7 is very quickly becoming a bigger looser due Microsoft's "We wan to control the way you do things" attitude. &nbsp;Functionally, it seems stable but&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;is now touting "compute and store data your way" in commercials which I'm clearly find out to
 be FALSE.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
In addition to all the W7 installation and delivery issues people are experiencing, you have managed to turn IE into bloat-ware. On my freshly installed Windows 7 laptop with 3.0Ghz and 4GB of memory, it takes 4 seconds for IE to open. &nbsp;Firefox, Opera, Chrome
 all start and ready to browse sub-second. &nbsp;Windows 7 installation that can't perform an "upgrade" on clean hard-drive, product key issue or without using crappy vendors like Digital River. &nbsp; I don't understand why Microsoft is going down this extremely non-user
 friendly path of making things very&nbsp;inconvenient&nbsp;and difficult for its customers.</div>
</span></span>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Microsoft has managed to&nbsp;alienate&nbsp;their power-user/technical groups by dumbing things down and removing some key functionality. Not too sure of the Business Reason for this as the OS market is about to get heavily saturated and competitive... so lets alienate
 our power users, the ones who innovate for us and/or push Microsoft into the business/residential community and make IE slow and bulky.&nbsp;</div>

            Hi KipperMN,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for using Microsoft Answers!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Have a look at this thread below, it may provide some ideas on how to get around indexing the network drive:</div>
<div><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7network/thread/163a64f2-073f-4a01-b7af-30f26b86b7ce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7network/thread/163a64f2-073f-4a01-b7af-30f26b86b7ce</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>If Internet Explorer is taking a long time to open due to "bloat-ware", have you tried Internet Explorer with No Add-ons?&nbsp;</div>
<div>To do this, Click <strong>Start </strong>and type<strong> Internet Explorer</strong>. In the results, you should see<strong> Internet Explorer (No Add-ons)</strong>.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Commonly what I've seen is the first time IE is opened, it can take a second or 2 longer than usual. But every time after that (since it's been loaded into memory), it's very quick to open. Also, have a look at the following thread:&nbsp;<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/InternetExplorer/thread/72dd379e-bb28-4342-91ec-472d9af83ab7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/InternetExplorer/thread/72dd379e-bb28-4342-91ec-472d9af83ab7</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>You mention Windows 7 "removing some key functionality." Is there anything specific you're not seeing?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Overall, I'm sorry you've had a bad&nbsp;experience&nbsp;with Windows 7. As Steve said, giving feedback is the best way to improve Windows.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let me know if I can do anything else to assist you!</div>

<p>So to be clear, the controller still drifts up in F1, but you can play it without issue, correct? Does a friend have a controller you can test on your console? Can you test your controller on a friend's console?

<p>Sounds like faulty/broken right stick. It will still work on the dashboard, as the right stick is unused on the dash</p>
<p>As Mister Fitzer has suggested, try another controller as that will at least tell you if its the controller or not

<h3> chrishxx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950XL - Project My Screen not working after Win10 1803 Update - Black Screen</h2>
                    <p>I use my 950XL extensively for demos of my company's software because it's much better display than my iPhone and doesn't need additional apps to do it.</p>
<p>I updated my Win10 desktop today to 1803 and also my phone updated to .104 and the app no longer works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open the app I get the message on the phone to ask if I want to share and I agree. The display on the desktop is black, but I can actually start applications on the phone by clicking inside the black window, so there obviously is a connection, just
 no display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was working perfectly, but not now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, is it possible to use continuum? I'm sure there used to be an option to display the phone's screen rather than a full desktop to the connected display but that appears to be no longer available</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Chris</p>

</p><p>The Lumia 950 XL supports Continuum. Therefore, you can use it as a workaround. Please note, however, that in order for you to use the Continuum feature of your phone, you will need to have the
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/accessory/hd-500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Microsoft Display Dock">Microsoft Display Dock</a></strong> accessory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your concern about the black screen when you're using the Project My Screen feature of your phone, please try to resolve it by restarting your Windows 10 computer and soft resetting your Lumia 950 XL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Soft resetting your phone will not remove anything from your phone. It is like removing the battery on your phone and is completely safe to do. To soft reset your phone, press and hold the
<strong>Volume down</strong> + <strong>Power</strong> buttons until you fill a vibration. After your phone vibrates, it should automatically restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After your phone and computer restarts, try using the Project My Screen feature again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please let us know how it turns out.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, but I'm not sure you fully understood the question or were correct about Continuum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, the 'try a reset' option - no, that didn't make any difference and I had already tried that. The functionality worked perfectly before my desktop Win10 update from 1709 to 1803. I updated my phone to build 15254.401 at the same time, so I'm not
 sure which update broke it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question I asked about Continuum was whether I can mirror the phone's screen rather than show the continuum desktop on the connected display. The answer didn't address that question. I felt sure that in a previous release of Windows 10 Mobile that I
 had seen the option but can't find it now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your education, you don't need a display dock&nbsp;<span>(I do have one)</span> for Continuum, you can also use a wireless connection for it. If I'm trying to replicate the functionality of the now-not-working Project My Screen app then I'm trying to show
 my phone screen on a Win 10 computer, not just connect my phone to a monitor. The dock can't do this, but wireless projection can using the Win 10 'Connect' app on the desktop which acts as a Miracast receiver. The only way this will suffice as a workaround
 is if I can mirror the phone screen to Connect on the computer's desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this is clearer.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. - Update to this. I found the way to mirror using the Connect app. When the connection is made and your phone is being displayed on the laptop screen, on the phone you can go into display settings, make sure the dropdown shows "connected display". Down
 at the bottom there is "advanced settings". This allows you to select if the connected display shows a Windows desktop or mirrors your screen.</p>
<p>So now I have a workaround but it would be nicer if the Project My Screen app worked.
</p>
<p>I also just tested it on a laptop with Windows 10 version 1709 and the Project My Screen works fine. This indicates that something in the 1803 version of Windows 10 breaks the Project My Screen app. I anyone has any updates on this it would be useful - I'd
 like to see it working again.</p>

</p><p>I was reminded by a new post in our other thread that I had found this earlier thread of yours, so am adding this to become an "interested party" in here. &nbsp; Did you find a resolution for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I won't be much help with testing since I don't have a phone and since my 1803 preview is a VM but I am willing and available to chip in more thoughts about it.&nbsp; As I mentioned the app has never helped me get a connection with it but it sure
 does cause eerie coincidences when I start playing with the Connect app too.</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem in projectng the screen of my 640xl win 10 phone to my Win 10 PC , since the 1803 update.</p>
<p>It was working ok before the 1803.</p>
<p>Once the phone is connected to the PC on the black screen I can click with the mouse and the phone reacts correctly.
</p>
<p>Moreover, when disconnecting the phone usb cable, the phone goes to a soft reset, by itself.</p>
<p>Waiting for a solution.......</p>

<p>It’s good to learn it’s not just me, those are exactly the symptoms I see!</p>
<p>I get the occasional accompanying reboot on disconnection but not every time.</p>
<p>The Connect app works ok but there is a slight delay due to wireless and when on full screen get a slight strobing with green lines. Fine in a windowed screen though.</p>

</p><p>So the Project my Screen window is just acting as a remote Touchpad?&nbsp; Do you see a pointer (or at least visual feedback for a virtual pen) moving on your phone when you move your mouse?&nbsp; Maybe you should be looking at using&nbsp; MouseWithoutBorders&nbsp; instead.&nbsp;
 Oops.&nbsp; I just remembered.&nbsp; MWB dropped phone support.&nbsp; And previously the functionality was to let you use your phone as a remote Touchpad for your host Windows device, the reverse of this symptom description. &nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>

<div>I have the same problem!<br />
<div>After updating Windows to the build 1803 the app 'Project my screen' stopped working with my Nokia Lumia 900. Upon starting the app the window with the question "Do you want to project the screen?" pops up on the phone but after clicking 'Yes' the screen
 does not appear in the app. What is funny, the control part of the app works, when clicking in the app my phone reacts, as if it was touched - so the app basically becomes a virtual touchpad. I confirmed this on two separate Windows PCs - the app works on
 older builds. Reinstalling phone drivers or the app doesn't help.<br />
<br />
I'm a disabled person and this app is CRITICAL for my ability to communicate with the world, as it allows me to control my phone using my foot via a trackball.<br />

<p><em>Otherwise could you please clarify how you know where you would be clicking on your phone with the Project My Screen app acting only as a remote Touch pad?</em><em>
</em></p>
<p>I can answer this : pure guessing !!!! There is no image at all on the PC screen..... You have to remember/know&nbsp; where the clickable tiles are placed&nbsp; in the start screen of your phone.... Certainly this is not a situation you can work with....&nbsp;<em>
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can add another detail : I noticed that if I close the "project my screen" app on the PC BEFORE to disconnect the usb cable, then my phone goes to a soft reset boot by itself. Solid.</p>

            Here's a thought - if the beats wireless headphones are seen as a wireless PHONE "Bluetooth headset" (like a Bluetooth earpiece) then it will sound terrible. If it's seen as Bluetooth speakers it might sound better.<br />
My Blackberry speaker is actually a hands-free unit that you can clip on a sun visor so you can talk hands-free in the car. Most of time it's recognized as stereo speakers and it sounds okay, and then there's a headset jack on it that allows me to plug in my
 headphones. But on occasion (not on my Surface Pro 3 so far) it is picked up as telephone earpiece.

            More random thoughts.<br />
If you go into <br />
Control Panel\Hardware and Sound\Devices and Printers<br />
Look for the device that sounds bad. If the icon looks like a Bluetooth microphone/earpiece then it's using the telephone device profile, Now that I think of it I had a similar problem with a Motorola headphones with a built-in microphone. Sometimes it was
 recognized as stereo speakers and sometimes it was recognized as a Bluetooth headset. The latter sounded terrible. That was some time ago and I haven't tried them with the Surface Pro 3.

            <p>Here's what I found after digging some more. For whatever reason, when I have paired headphones and turn them on and connect them, the SP3 does not automatically switch to use the headphones. Instead it still shows the built it speakers as the default device
 and sends SOME sound through the headphones and mutes the speakers. </p>

<p>
</p><p>If I go in and set the Stereo headphones as default, I get what I expect. But I have to manually set as default.

<h2>            How can I download windows 10 iso with the option to resume</h2>
                    I do not know if it is bad programming of the creation tool. Why can't we resume a failed connection. I do not want to start over again from 0%. I have a slow internet connection and this is really frustrating. Is there a mirror or a torrent that can be
 downloaded somewhere so I can just get this upgrade over with. Why do I need to waste my time waiting on a download that fails because there is no build in programming to resume a download after a connection failure.&nbsp; Btw I have run the creation tool 3 times
 starting from 0% again. Wasted 2 days of my life. Please I just want to get the ISO without this amount of hassle.

    <title>Upgrade of Windows7 Evaluation Copy Build 7100 to Windows7 Release - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Upgrade of Windows7 Evaluation Copy Build 7100 to Windows7 Release with product key</h2>
                    I have been testing Windows7 last year and have now bought the final release home premium. But i do not have Vista anymore - I only have Windows7 RC evaluation 7100 running on my laptop. Can I just enter the product key of the bought version someplace
 and activate or do I have to do a complete reinstall? And since its an upgrade on vista can I install Windows7 over my Windows7 RC.<br />
Microsoft should have given better instructions to those who have been testing Windows7 for it..

            Hello AloeM,<br />
<br />
Yes you will have to uninstall Win7 RC Build 7100 before installing Vista.&nbsp; You can't downgrade from a newer Os to a older OS unles syou have the Windows.old file located on your drive.<br />
<br />
The Easy Transfer Utility should back them up for use.&nbsp; Check <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Transferring-files-and-settings-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a> for more information.<br />
<br />
Windows Vista is not available for download for free.&nbsp; Contact the PC Manufacturer and see if you can order the media from them.&nbsp; Can also purchase the media from
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/2057/ordermedia/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.<br />
<br />
Yes there is a Movie Maker available.&nbsp; Can also get the one bundled with Live Essentials as well.<br />
<br />

            No, you cannot convert the RC into the final version. Its recommended you do a clean install.<br />
<br />
Can computers running Windows 7 Release Candidate upgrade directly to Windows 7 Release to Manufacturer build?<br />
A: Yes, but this is not a recommended or supported scenario. Microsoft recommends persons running the Release Candidate released in April 2009, reinstall Windows Vista and do upgrades from that release to Windows 7 RTM.<br />
<br />
Q: Didn’t previous development versions of Windows support build to build upgrades?<br />
A: True, but Microsoft has changed this policy for the Windows 7 release. They want users to test against real world scenarios. A build to build upgrade introduces unexpected complications that make it difficult to diagnose problems considering such scenarios
 do not exist in real world deployments.<br />
<br />
You can learn more about the Windows Teams decision:<br />
http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2009/04/07/delivering-a-quality-upgrade-experience.aspx<br />
<br />
Pre-release in-place upgrades across milestones (for example, Windows 7 RC to Windows 7 RTM) are not supported.<br />
For more details check out the link http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd772579(WS.10).aspx<br />
<br />
I assume you have accumulated personal data on the Windows 7 RC that you don't want to lose. What I would do is, when you receive the Windows 7 Home Premium RTM, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to
 x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you
 have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 Home Premium RTM.<br />
<br />
In Windows 7 Home Premium, launch Windows Easy Transfer in Windows 7 Home Premium, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.

                    <p>I recently purchased Wolfenstein ll: The New Colossus, and while starting the game and playing a total of maybe 5-10 minutes, I instantly lost all interest in the game for it didn't suite my play style.

    <title>All games minimize on startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slavedriver  say:</h3>
<h2>            All games minimize on startup</h2>
                    I have a problem with Vista minimizing all the games on startup. Sometimes it's not possible to maximize them because they keep minimizing. I&nbsp;thought I tracked the issue&nbsp;down to the Vista&nbsp;Sidebar stealing focus&nbsp;but that isn't the case it seems.<br />
Anyway before someone asks:<br />
1) I'm&nbsp;not pressing Alt+tab<br />
2) I am not pressing Win key<br />
3) I do not have any programs running in the background<br />
4) This is reproducible on more than one machine (on&nbsp;all 3 I have in fact) and is quite widespread according to Google search<br />
5) This did not happen with WinXP<br />
6) Vista is up to date,&nbsp;DirectX is up to date, drivers are up to date<br />
7) Hardware is not faulty (as I said I tried it on 3 machines,&nbsp;one brand new)&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi Slavedriver,<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Thanks for your response. The reason I asked about the Nvidia cards was that I read quite a few posts on other newsgroups regarding this issue. If you are using the latest drivers, maybe Nvidia has a setting that needs to be enabled or disabled to work properly
 with the Aero theme. Maybe it's the drivers period. The transparency feature can be resource intensive. Unless someone else has a better&nbsp;answer, I'd say your best bet is Nvidia's support. Maybe they have a newer driver or can offer assistance in the settings
 on those cards. Sorry I couldn't be more help. Let us know of any new developments.&nbsp;<br />
