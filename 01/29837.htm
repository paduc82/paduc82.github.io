<h2>            Windows 10 sign in when PC wakes from sleep</h2>
                    When I "tell" my PC to sleep, then wake it, I get the lock screen and must sign in. &nbsp;But when the PC goes to sleep automatically (when I've been away) and then I wake it, it goes directly to the desktop without requiring me to sign in. &nbsp;But I have set
 it to require sign in when waking from sleep. &nbsp;This is apparently not working.&nbsp;

            This did not work. &nbsp;Neither has any other strategy I've found, including "chatting" with a Microsoft tech. &nbsp;So I am giving up on it. &nbsp;Maybe it's something the latest Windows 10 update changed. &nbsp;In any case, I'm not going to waste any more time trying to
 make it work. &nbsp;I'll just be sure to tell the PC to sleep whenever I'm going to be away.

                    When i bought the computer software was installed.&nbsp; The computer in question needs a new HD. How can i get a clean copy of winXP Profrssional without the software.&nbsp; No I do not want to buy another software system update. All I want is to install a fresh
 copy like i was able to do 5 to 10 years ago. Then the software came seperate from the Hardware. No instruction came with the computer on a new install of the operating system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please help before my system crashes and i lose the data seperate from the the
 operating system.&nbsp; Back up never worked for me because it will not give ne a clean copy. When i bought the computer software was installed.&nbsp; And no software to reinstall. I tried using a Boot disk and the recovery disk neither works.

            If the PC was supplied with a recovery disk then that is the means of reinstalling, if you have tried booting with the recovery disk and it fails to boot, either your recovery disk is damaged or your PC has a fault.<br />
To backup data all that is neccessary to do is copy any data from My Documents to an external scource, eg memory stick or recordable cd, assuming you have burning software

                    <p>Original Title: Optical drive+error code 0x80010108.</p>
<p>My 2 optical drives, DVD/CD RW made by LG, upon putting a CD in to read it to display photos, I get the statement, "An error is preventing the photo or video from being displayed.<br />
<br />
Error code: 0x80010108"<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
My 2 drives are not SATA but EIDE flat ribbons in a home built PC from parts purchased from NewEgg.com<br />
<br />
The optical drives were working to display photos until recently.&nbsp; The optical drives read DVDs ok concerning loading programs.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I built my i7-920 based PC, May of 2010.&nbsp; My C: drive is Windows 7 Ultimate, 64-bit.&nbsp; Video card is a PNY GeForce GTX260 single card.<br />
<br />
I have run deep scans via Norton 360 Premium utility tools and I come up system clean.<br />
<br />
This CD works fine on my old Dell Dimension 3000, Pentium 4, running Windows XP Pro, even still.<br />
<br />

</span></p>
<p><span>Which application are you using to view the photos?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If you are getting this error in Windows Live Photo Gallery, you may follow these steps &amp; check if the issue persists:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Close Windows Live Photo Gallery.
</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click on
<b>Start, Computer</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>c. Paste this address in the Address field %userprofile%\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Windows Live Photo Gallery</span></p>
<p><span>d. Right click on
<b>Pictures.pd5</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>e. Click
<b>Rename</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>f. Change the file name to ‘OLD_Pictures.pd5’.
</span></p>
<p><span>g. Open
<b>Windows Live Photo Gallery</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>h. Now
<b>Windows Live Photo Gallery</b> will rebuild its database, which should stop the error you are receiving from occurring.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Hope the information helps.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Freezes When Optical Drive is Used - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomaspringle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Freezes When Optical Drive is Used</h2>
                    <p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10, awesome OS.&nbsp; I've been running it for 2-3 months with no issue or incident.&nbsp; Smooth and error free up until a few days ago when I tried to use my Blu-Ray drive to burn a CD.&nbsp; Opening iTunes, I inserted a disc (I know, old
 school), and attempted to start the process.&nbsp; About 30 seconds in, without the drive spinning, or even giving the command for iTunes to create a new CD, the program froze.&nbsp; I attempted to close the program by using Task Manager and although it clearly identified
 iTunes as "Not Responding," I couldn't force a shut down.&nbsp; After a few attempts, the freezing started to overtake my entire system.&nbsp; Where once only iTunes was unresponsive, other apps, Chrome, Firefox, the Start Menu, etc. were no longer accessible, then
 my mouse &amp; keyboard became unresponsive as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing a little testing I unplugged all extraneous USB devices and went bare bones to see if anything else might be causing the issue (I haven't added/installed anything new).&nbsp; iTunes didn't have any issues after the freeze, all the other devices I plugged
 back in (systematically), caused no problem so I know it's the blu-ray drive.&nbsp; I can easily repeat the issue by putting a disc into the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some reading, I found that many people have experienced similar issues with an improperly connected device and/or one that is failing.&nbsp; I checked the connections, put a few more discs in just to make sure I didn't have some sort of damaged/corrupt
 media but found no improvement.&nbsp; I eventually caved and bought a new drive.&nbsp; The new drive is having the same problem.&nbsp; A disc is inserted, and after a minute or so, things begin to seize.&nbsp; Both devices (blu-ray/dvd) are "working properly," and up to date
 drivers are present.&nbsp; Additionally, there are no new bios updates for my MoBo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help, let me know, I'm missing out on burning my antiquated media :D</p>

<p><span>Let me help you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To understand the issue better, I would like to know what is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try simple steps and check if you are able to burn CD’s using Windows Media player, this is to make sure which is&nbsp;conflicting with the issue. Follow the below link on Burn CD or DVD in Windows Media Player. (Steps applicable for Windows 10).</span></p>

            <p>It's a custom build. </p>
<p>
</p><p>System Specs:</p>
<p>MoBo: Asus Sabertooth 990FX v1.0 (Bios is up to date)</p>
<p>Processor:&nbsp; AMD FX-8120 Bulldozer 3.11 GHz</p>
<p>RAM: 16 GB DDR3 Corsair</p>
<p>HDD:&nbsp; 240 Corsair SSD (OS), 1 TB WD Black (Storage)</p>
<p>Optical Drive:&nbsp; ASUS BC-12B1ST (original),&nbsp; Lite-On IHAS124-14 (recently installed, new).</p>
<p>Card Readers:&nbsp; Rosewill 64 in 1 Card Reader.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All devices/hardware are working normally (as stated by Device Manager).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually can't put a CD/DVD into the drive without the system slowly coming to a grinding halt.&nbsp; I'll try a few more just to make sure and respond (provided my computer doesn't free).&nbsp; On all instances, I didn't even get as far as "Burn Disc."&nbsp; I don't
 think it's the software as I was unable to even execute a command before the system froze.&nbsp; Stand By.</p>

            <p>Ok, new information regarding the freeze.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Media Player and iTunes are not the culprits.&nbsp; While I was testing various CDs &amp; DVDs with media already burned on, they run without issue.&nbsp; The system scans the media and presents the contents without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have discovered is Windows Explorer, while "scanning" blank media, will reach ~98% then freeze the entire system.&nbsp; Explorer takes ~1 minute to scan up to 98%, while looking for data, and when it is unable to find anything, the entire system freezes
 requiring a restart (CDs with data already on them take ~2 secs for scanning to complete).&nbsp; I will also note that if the blank media is left in the drive, the system will fail to boot which is odd as my boot device priority does not have the optical drive
 as primary (I switch it to primary if I'm going to reformat with a DVD).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Point me towards an Explorer based problem.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Ok, new information regarding the freeze.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Media Player and iTunes are not the culprits.&nbsp; While I was testing various CDs &amp; DVDs with media already burned on, they run without issue.&nbsp; The system scans the media and presents the contents without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have discovered is Windows Explorer, while "scanning" blank media, will reach ~98% then freeze the entire system.&nbsp; Explorer takes ~1 minute to scan up to 98%, while looking for data, and when it is unable to find anything, the entire system freezes
 requiring a restart (CDs with data already on them take ~2 secs for scanning to complete).&nbsp; I will also note that if the blank media is left in the drive, the system will fail to boot which is odd as my boot device priority does not have the optical drive
 as primary (I switch it to primary if I'm going to reformat with a DVD).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Point me towards an Explorer based problem.&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I find it disgraceful that no Microsoft support had bothered to answer any further! Is this because windows 10 is severely flawed!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having exactly the same problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know my dvd drive works fine until installing win</p>
<p>10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My pc freezes after 2-5 minutes with no explanation, i can't move the mouse either. There always to be no event log because I'm guessing the system doesn't even get chance to log the errors!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed in device manager that although there are no issues apparent when i go to the smbus it says there are no drivers installed for it! I thought this was the problem as system mechanic said this driver needed updating, which i did update, and then
 this freezing started around the same time. I don't know if it was coincidence or was actually caused by s windows update that also got applied working without me knowing (which i world guess is the case).</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what driver i install for the smbus it doesn't seem to actually install one as it keeps saying none installed!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

            <p>Ha!&nbsp; Sadly Steve, this was my second attempt at having Microsoft solve the issue.&nbsp; Each time I post my specs and describe the issue, Microsoft Support goes radio silence :(&nbsp; I haven't found a work around/solution as, much like you, the system crashes hard
 and does not create an error log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, perhaps with the two of us now "reactivating" the issue, we'll get some sort of response.&nbsp; I found it highly unprofessional to have two separate MS Support Reps begin the process of resolving my inquiry only to have both of them drop me without
 any notice/apology like "We're sorry for the inconvenience, please understand that we are working hard to resolve this matter in a timely manner."&nbsp;

            <p>Hmmm. I'm not sure we will actually get a reply to be honest. Have you checked your smbus driver and does it say you have one actually installed? Not sure if this is related. I did see a YouTube vid saying to install the Intel driver but i haven't tried
 this yet and I'm scared too lol.</p>

<p>I have had two separate Microsoft "Support" people begin to diagnose this problem and each individual has dropped me faster than a terrorist out of a Nakatomi Plaza window.&nbsp; I give them my specs, tell them that Explorer freezes, while scanning the blank
 media, and then that's it, no response, no explanation, no "We're currently working on resolving this matter, please be patient."</p>

            Hi dipdas,
<br />It is required you allow the remote connection establishing. And in general there is no sense to read pagefile.sys - it is highly fragmented internally.

    <title>Windows 10 Update got stuck at reboot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexander lai  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update got stuck at reboot</h2>
                    <p>Currently I have an old laptop Lenovo ThinkPad X61 running Windows 10 Pro 64-bit version 1607 build 14393.1593.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that there was an update available, called <strong>Feature update to Windows 10, version 1703</strong>. &nbsp;Every time I was trying to install this update, download completed, update started, and at the first reboot, it would show Windows 10 logo and
 little circling dots, that's it. &nbsp;It won't boot into Windows, just keep circling dots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dot circling was moving, but it had no response to CAPS LOCK key (CAPS LOCK indicator not flashing). &nbsp;I tried to wait for 3 days for this but it won't boot into Windows. &nbsp;I could only force power down the laptop and turn it on again, Windows would be
 left not upgraded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestion?</p>

<h2>            Reiniciar juego Forza Horizon desde cero</h2>
                    <p>Muy buen día.</p><p><br /></p><p>Para comenzar, informo que dispongo de una consola Xbox One y desde ahí estoy jugando al Forza Horizon de Xbox 360.</p><p><br /></p><p>Tengo una duda que no he podido resolver. Necesito comenzar nuevamente a jugar este juego partiendo desde cero en mi misma cuenta, el problema es que&nbsp;siempre me carga la partida sincronizada en la nube y no puedo recomenzar. ¿Cómo podría hacerlo?

                    <p>I have a new Dell laptop with Windows 10 on it.&nbsp; I cannot use Win 10 due to software compatibilities.&nbsp; I have a new copy of Windows 7 that I want to install over it.&nbsp; When I install Window 7 I get error " Digital signature enforcer will not allow to install."&nbsp;
 Error file: \$windows.-BT\windows\system32\winload.efi</p>

            <p>You need to change the UEFI setting in the BIOS to Legacy.</p>
<p>You cannot install Windows 7 "over it".&nbsp; You must use the "Custom" install choice in the Windows 7 install process.&nbsp; The drive will be erased completely, so make certain you have backed up your data.&nbsp; Also be prepared to re-install all your programs.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Fully backup your&nbsp;DATA.</li><li>Use your hard drive manufacturer’s drive tester software to ensure you are working with a good hard drive.&nbsp; If yours is a laptop with a hard drive 5 years or more, just replace the hard drive.</li><li>This is likely to take an elapsed time of around 12 hours.</li><li>First go to your computer’s OEM support site and find and download the Windows 7 drivers for your computer and store them on a USB stick.</li><li>Do not do any formatting or partitioning.</li><li>If you made a set of disks for recovery or an image copy&nbsp;at the time your computer was new.&nbsp; This is the time you need them.</li><li>Start your computer on the first of the disks as instructed and in an hour or so, your computer will look exactly as it did then.</li><li>If you do not have that set of disks.

 drivers only from the maker of your computer or Intel.&nbsp; Its best to get all the drivers at this point.&nbsp; Win7 install may have installed all of them or nearly. Do NOT use any of those driver download sites.&nbsp; They are all bogus, have bad drivers, and install

<p>
</p><p><strong><em>New install tip:</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<strong><em>before</em></strong> any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<strong><em>+</em></strong>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive, you will have a precise duplicate of your system as
 it was at this point.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time, and you will have saved yourself all the time you put in this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for PLUS R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>

<p>Hi John,<br />
<br />
<br />
The issue you are experiencing might be due to an outdated/incompatible device driver.<br />
<br />
I would like to know more about the concern. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue?<br />
</li><li>Have you tried using another keyboard? If so, are you experiencing the same issue?<br />
</li><li>Have you tried the polaroid keyboard on another device?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you may run the <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong> and <strong>Keyboard</strong> troubleshooter. To do this, refer to the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Start menu, type Control Panel, and then hit Enter.<br />
</li><li>On the Control Panel search field, type Troubleshooting, and then click the result.<br />
</li><li>On the left pane, select View all.<br />
</li><li>Select and run the Hardware and Devices and Keyboard troubleshooter.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Updating your keyboard driver will help resolve your concern. Driver updates in Windows 10 are set to install automatically via Windows Update. If it fails to do so, then you can consider updating it manually in
<strong>Device Manager</strong>. To open <strong>Device Manager</strong>, press <strong>
Windows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong> on your keyboard, type <strong><em>devmgmt.msc</em></strong>, and then hit Enter. You can use this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> as a reference on how to update drivers in Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Should you need further assistance, feel free to get back to us.</p>

            Hi Gabriel.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Are you using the OneDrive download from here:  <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/</a>.  Make sure first it's fully uninstalled in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features, then restart the PC before installing a fresh download.
<br />
<br />But to solve this and also get current since you're falling too far behind with Version Updates,  I would manually upgrade to the latest version by opening the Media Creation Tool from this link:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>, choose Download Tool Now, then open the tool and choose Upgrade This PC Now. This is the most stable method to change versions and avoids buggy Windows Updates and Update Assistant.  
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

            Hi Gabriel, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />If your OneDrive installation file isn't installing OneDrive correctly, you could try installing it from the Microsoft Store. Here's a link to the store page for OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/p/onedrive/9wzdncrfj1p3?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/p/onedrive/9wzd...</a>
<br />
<br />On that page, click on Get, and the Microsoft Store should open and begin installing OneDrive automatically.
<br />
<br />Hopefully this helps! Please let me know if you need further support. Thanks!
        </p>

<h2>            Microsoft account does not sync &#40;issue on phone and pc&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>I am having trouble syncing my&nbsp;Microsoft account on my laptop and my lumia 950 xl, this has been going on for&nbsp;more than two weeks.</p>
<p>I tried to do a soft rest of my phone to see if it would help, and it made things worst. Now that I reset my lumia I lost my contact list and cannot recover it yet. this is a urgent problem as I have all my data stored on that outlook.com Microsoft account.
 Now, the apps Outlook mail and calendar, the Microsoft people app, and others do not sync on neither my pc on windows 10 nor my lumia 950 xl. This weird knowing that they are both on the latest updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I tried troubleshooting and it didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me, this is very urgent. </p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you, </p>

<p>Hi boodles83,</p>
<p><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forums.</p>
<p>If your backups are saved to CDs or DVDs, you can discard discs containing earlier backups, but make sure that you keep the most recent backup of your files. If your backups are saved to an internal or external hard disk, you can delete a backup by following
 these steps:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Open the location where the backup is saved.<br />
For example, if you backed up your files to an external hard disk labeled "E," connect the external hard disk to your computer, and then open drive E.<br />
2.&nbsp;Right-click the folder containing the backup you want to delete, and then click Delete.</p>
<p>Notes:&nbsp; Backups are saved in this format: &lt;backup location&gt;\&lt;computer name&gt;\Backup Set &lt;year-month-day&gt; &lt;time&gt;. For example, if your computer name is Computer, your backup location is E, and you backed up on April 2, 2006 at 16:32:00, that backup would be
 located in E:\Computer\Backup Set 2006-02-04 163200. You would right-click the folder named Backup Set 2006-02-04 163200 to delete that backup.</p>

    <title>Xbox One won&#39;t turn on via the Xbox App on Windows 10 Professional - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rickwenrich64  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One won&#39;t turn on via the Xbox App on Windows 10 Professional</h2>
                    <p>I'm able to stream and play games using my Xbox 360 controller for the PC and by using my Xbox One controller, but I have to go and physically turn the Xbox One on first.&nbsp; When I try to turn it on via the app I get the following message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"We can't turn on your console.&nbsp; Make sure this device is on the same network as your console and your console is set to instant-on."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this problem?&nbsp; My Xbox One connects wirelessly and my PC is connected via a direct Ethernet cable to the router.&nbsp; I'm using AT&amp;T's U-verse router and wireless access point.&nbsp; I really don't think that's the problem because it works fine
 if I go and turn the Xbox One on before I connect via the Xbox app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you've had the problem and somehow resolved it...&nbsp; I would appreciate it so much if you would share the solution with me and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>Xbox ONE controllers turning off after a few seconds - STEAM ISSUE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steveskp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox ONE controllers turning off after a few seconds - STEAM ISSUE</h2>
                    <p>I have seen a few threads on here on how on how to fix this but one contained links to a driver for the old XBOX Controller and not the ONE, depsite iot saying XBOX&nbsp; ONE Controller in the title.<br />
<br />
I have isolated the issue to STEAM, if I quit Steam and turn on the controllers they all work fine (I have 4), buit Steam is set to run at startup, which I like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix for this bug? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled the Nvidea Networldriver but that made no difference :/&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Who else is suffering from this? </p>

            HI Steve,
<br />
<br />Let's see if the problem is related with a driver issue.
<br />
<br />Please go to setting on the search bar, click on Bluet tooth &amp; other devices, select controller, click on remove device. 
<br />Then unplug and plug back the Joy Stick. 
<br />
<br />You can also use this fix for Windows USB problems

<p>Hi Angel,</p>
<p>it's not the driver issue - after hours of messing around, it is STEAM - if I quit Steam the controllers all work with no issues - If Steam is running the controllers turn them selves off after asecond, no errors on screen or anything. It just looks like
 dead batteries but I knwothat is not the case.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have had to stop Steam running on Boot Up.<br />
<br />
Whilest on the subject of Steam, if I run a Steam Game I cannot use the Windows Game DVR,&nbsp; it fails to run in ANY Steam games but works great on uPlay or Origin!&nbsp; I know this is for another thread but felt I should mention it.</p>

<h2>            migrating dns  to Windows</h2>
                    <p><br />
</p>
<p>All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a win2008R2 forest/domain running without AD integrated DNS. &nbsp;The forest uses a linux IPAM server for DNS. &nbsp;The IPAM is absolete and there is no vendor support therefore it needs to be decommissioned. I am working on testing a migration plan from
 this BIND based linux box to Windows DNS. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I have no permissions to configure a zone transfer from the linux box I am creating a new primary non-AD integrated DNS zone in a member server(it is much simpler to test without affecting the prod servers).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have installed the DNS role on a member server, created a new primary zone in this new &nbsp;non-AD integrated DNS server, I have successfully imported the records from the linux DNS box. As I started testing I realized the &nbsp;SRV records did not import to the
 new win dns zone. &nbsp;It looks like they were not part of the file I downloaded from the linux box. &nbsp;Also, &nbsp;since the new test primary windows Zone I created is not AD integrated it did not automatically &nbsp;create the the usual SRV records folders: &nbsp;_sites, _tcp,
 _UDP, domainDNSzones, ForestDNSzones. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, my questions are:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- is there a way I can recreate all the SRV records and folders in the non-AD integrated zone?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp;can you actually run 2 primary zones in parallel while testing is validated: 1 &nbsp;linux and 1 non-AD integrated</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DNS</p>
<p>&nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; or is it best to just decomm the linux primary zone and switch to the windows dns zone at the same time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thnx</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Screen warped, i.e. coming unglued and convex</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had this experience?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can put my baby finger between the screen and the back of the tablet on the left side.&nbsp; The color is washed out on the edges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened a month after the warranty expired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer still works.&nbsp; I'm sure it was due to over heating as the fan seems to be always on if I'm doing anything graphical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Mine has the same thing. Happened suddenly.</p>
<p>Warranty has been over for 9 months.</p>
<p>I'm thinking this might be the time to upgrade the hard drive.</p>
<p>$400 bucks for a 1Tb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has become a desktop computer until i can seal it up.</p>
<p>Back to the iPad.</p>

I was extremely happy with Microsoft.&nbsp; I took it to the store and they replace the whole tablet.&nbsp; Remember it was months past the warranty period.&nbsp; They said it was a safety issue and it didn't matter if it was out of warranty.&nbsp; I went shopping in the mall
 and they had the new one imaged and identical to my hold one in 2 hours.&nbsp; They offered me coffee or a drink four times while I waited.&nbsp; Very happy customer.&nbsp; Typing this message on it now.
