<h2>            Seeing AI software</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft has developed a fantastic piece of software for Apples smartphones which is great.&nbsp; It is called Seeing AI and can be used by the blind or visually impaired to dramatically improve their independence.</p>
<p>I am the Personal Assistant to a totally blind gentleman.&nbsp; He is not in a position to pay for Apple's iPhones.&nbsp; My question is for Microsoft.&nbsp; Is there any chance that Seeing AI will be ported to the Android or Windows platforms in the future?</p>
<p>This kind of software is amazing and deserves to be available on all platforms.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hello Martin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're not alone in wanting <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/seeing-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Seeing AI">Seeing AI</a></strong> to be available on all platforms. I understand how incredible it would
 be if users can access the app across different platforms. The app is only available on
<em>iOS</em> devices at the moment. However, I recommend checking the latest updates of
<strong>Seeing AI</strong> through the <strong><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/accessibility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Microsoft Accessibility Blog">Microsoft Accessibility Blog</a></strong>. You can check the blog from time to time.
 Should there be a future announcement regarding the app, you will see it right away in that blog. You're also more than welcome to post your feedback in the
<strong><a href="https://microsoftaccessibility.uservoice.com/forums/307429-microsoft-accessibility-feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Microsoft Accessibility Feedback">Microsoft Accessibility Feedback</a></strong>. Please make sure to sign in
 with a valid email address so you can revisit and see the status of your feedback items.</p>

    <title>Help&#58; VISTA is only in BLACK and WHITE for admin user - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> krisbell1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help&#58; VISTA is only in BLACK and WHITE for admin user</h2>
                    I switched to a different user to play a game which worked fine but when I logged off that user and back in to my usual, everyday admin user account the screen turned black and white whilst loading up. Everything still functions fine except there is no
 colour - all settings in control panel and NVIDIA control panel suggest it is displaying full colour. If I log into a different user account the colour returns. Unfortunately system restore was dissabled for some reason so I cant restore to an earlier time.
 I have downloaded and re-installed the latest driver for my graphics card (NVIDIA 260M GTX) but this didnt solve the problem.<br />
<br />
Searching Google suggests a few people have had this exact same problem but as yet there are not solutions. Any help much appreciated.

I have Nero 8 on this system and have a modified hosts file running here:&nbsp; http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm<br />
<br />
Not sure but I may have changed a network setting to enable the new hosts file to work properly.<br />

Have seen these errors for quite some time; system runs well and smoothly.&nbsp; No symptoms of malware or infection seen or found.&nbsp; I would call these

            Oh yeah :)<br />
<br />
I have never used the VEW program and don't think I will be checking it out - I just look at the Event Viewer logs the old fashioned way (manually) if I think there is a problem, but that could just be the old fashioned me.<br />
<br />
It is true that XP Home does not have Group Policy Editor, but all of the policy settings are still available via the registry.<br />
<br />
Some malicious software will alter your GP settings and cause some problems.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I have a little registry import that will fix all of the ones I know about, so if somebody has these certain symptoms, no matter what flavor of XP they are running, I will just send the script because sometimes you will not be able to fix the problem even if
 you do have the GP Editor.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The registry import always works - and will work fine for XP Home or XP Pro.&nbsp; If you have the symptoms and have XP Home, what would you do?!&nbsp;&nbsp; Run the registry import.<br />
<br />
If you are curious, <a href="http://cid-6a7e789cab1d6f39.skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?resid=6A7E789CAB1D6F39%21311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
out on my SkyDrive</a> there is an Excel spreadsheet (Group Policy Settings) that has all the GP settings and where they are in the registry.&nbsp; I am not recommending you start poking around, but it is handy to know where things are if there is a problem.<br />
<br />
I would not enable the security logging stuff in XP unless you think you are under attack.&nbsp; More and&nbsp; verbose logging slows things down.&nbsp; My Event Viewer Security log is
<br />
Finding the Microsoft Support Engineer links mostly useless for actually solving a problem (did it help you with your issue), if somebody has an Event Viewer issue/question, I usually just send them this:<br />
<br />
To see the Event Viewer logs, click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
A shortcut to Event Viewer is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\system32\eventvwr.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
The most interesting logs are usually the Application and System logs.<br />
<br />
Some logs such as Security and Internet Explorer may be completely empty or have only a few items.&nbsp; The default settings for XP is not to log all that activity unless you need to troubleshoot some issue in those areas.&nbsp; If you enable the logging for them the
 logs fill up quickly and could negatively effect your system performance with all the extra (usually unnecessary) activity.<br />
<br />
If you have Microsoft Office installed, it has its own logs and they may be empty or occasional boring activity or very little activity if there is no problem with your Office applications.&nbsp; This is normal.<br />
<br />
Not every event is a problem, some are informational messages that things are working okay and some are warnings.<br />
<br />
However, no event should defy reasonable explanation.<br />
<br />
Each event is sorted by Date and Time.&nbsp; Errors will have red Xs, Warnings will have yellow !s.<br />
Information messages have white is.&nbsp; Not every Error or Warning event means there is a serious issue.<br />
<br />
Some are excusable at startup time when Windows is booting.&nbsp; Try to find just the events at the date and time around your problem.<br />
<br />
If you double click an event, it will open a Properties window with more information.&nbsp; On the right are black up and down arrow buttons to scroll through the open events. The third button that looks like two pages on top of each other is used to copy the event

<h2>            Multiple blue screen errors</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>from time to time I'm getting multiple blue screen errors in a row. I've checked some solutions but the problem still persists. It's a new PC and I'm running Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example today I got these errors:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kernel security check failure<br />
Page fault in nonpaged area<br />
memory management<br />
system service exception<br />
0xc000021a<br />
system thread exception not handled<br />
unexpected kernel mode trap<br />
kmode exception not handled </p>
<p>
</p><p>After this PC had trouble restarting I've turned it off and after turning it on it ran disk check and repair.</p>

            Hi, Kakutsa-Jikidze 
<br />
<br />Follow these steps, they are to check the integrity of the Operating System, I hope you can solve the problem.
<br />
<br />Press the Start key and type the word CMD, right click on the command prompt and select Run as administrator, enter the following commands one by one followed by the Enter key:
<br />sfc /SCANNOW
<br />Sfc / Scannow
<br />DISM.exe / Online / Cleanup-image / Scanhealth
<br />DISM.exe / Online / Cleanup-image / Restorehealth
<br />The execution of these processes may be delayed, do not forget to restart the computer to apply changes.
<br />
<br />If it works, follow these others.
<br />
<br />Any corrupt DLL files are best performed using built in utilities or using a repair upgrade method: 
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD 
<br />Right click CMD 
<br />Click Run as administrator 
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each) 
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth 
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth 
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth 
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility: 
<br />Open Start, type: CMD 
<br />Right click CMD 
<br />Click Run as administrator 
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow 
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations 
<br />
<br />Restart your system       
        </p>

            Hi  Kakutsa, 
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<h2>            Windows 8 and windows 7 file sharing access</h2>
                    <div>\\shaun\ is my windows 8 pro 64 machine</div>
<div>\\media_server\ is my windows 7 ultimate 64 machine</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>\\shaun\h is a hard drive I have shared on the windows 8 machine. Entire drive is set for sharing - everyone, full access</div>
<div>\\media_server\e is a hard drive I have shared on the windows 7 machine. Entire drive is set for sharing - everyone, full access</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I have 2 computers on my network. One is going to be a media server and the other is going to be my work station. I have setup a work group named Shaun on both machines. Both machines have network discover on, file and printer sharing on, and password protected
 off. Both machines are setup with same username and password. From \\media_server\ i can see, map, and fully access \\shaun\h. From \\shaun\ I can see \\media_server\e and map the drive. However, when I try to access the drive on \\media_server\e it gives
 me the "you don't have permission to access this drive. So why can the windows 7 PC read and write as intended, but the windows 8 pc can only read and write the shared public drive from windows 7.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All sharing is on and set for everyone. All drives are set to share except operating system drive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am at a total loss at this point. I need this to work using work groups for my xbmc to play nice.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance</div>

            <p>Hi Shaun,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assuming the actual message you get is "<em>You do not have permissions to access
</em><em>\\media_server\e</em><em>. Contact your network administrator to request access.</em>"&nbsp;I suspect your Windows 7 share (\\media_server\e) doesn't have the appropriate file permissions set.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For security reasons you do not only have to set up sharing permissions but also file permissions sometimes - this depends upon what you share and honestly I don't remember all the rules.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To fix your problem I would suggest</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In Windows Explorer right-click on the folder that represents \\media_server\e</li><li>Choose <em>Properties</em> and go to the <em>Security</em> tab<br />
Under&nbsp;<em>Group or User names</em> you probably don't have "Everyone"</li><li>Click the <em>Edit...</em> / Add... / Advanced...&nbsp;then Find now buttons</li><li>In the <em>Search results</em> list double-click on "Everyone" then click OK</li><li>In the <em>Group or User names</em> click on "Everyone" and&nbsp;set the desired permissions in the box below</li><li>Click OK twice</li></ol>
<p>That should do it...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skype number does not show up properly on caller ID..&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I make calls out from my Skype line, sometimes the caller ID on the other end shows my number properly, but in many cases it shows a completely random number.&nbsp; This becomes a real problem when I'm trying to do things like activate a credit card where
 I'm supposed to call from the phone number associated with the bank account.&nbsp; They see some random number, and they won't let me continue with activating the card.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does this happen, and how can I make it stop?&nbsp; Any information on this would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

Can't find neither a related options for that, nor some help over internet (yes, I already googled it).</p>

<h2>            wont let me sign into my account &#40;or any account&#41; on Xbox one console</h2>
                    <p>My console is having an issue signing into any account. I tried a power cycle already. I removed all accounts/profiles from my xbox and tried to add them back still nothing. I tried creating a new account with no avail.&nbsp;I tried doing a factory reset still nothing. I went to my century link account and portforwarded and still can not sign into any account. Extremely frustrating, if anyone has any suggestions I&nbsp;have not already tried I would appreciate the advice. Error code for reference 0x87DD0017. The console itself says my internet connection is fine. I&nbsp;ran a diag already and have efficient speeds showing up. Any help would be seriously appreciated as this is going on 48 hours of no gaming access.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            What is causing my CPU to run at 100&#37;&#63;</h2>
                    My CPU is running at 100%. It was fine earlier today. This has been happening the past few days. How can I find out what's causing this? In task manager, all the programs are responding, and I don't see anything unusual in the active processes.

<h2>            Falha Na Autoriza&#38;&#35;231&#59;&#38;&#35;227&#59;o do Disco &#91;HD 320GB&#93;</h2>
                    
<p>Quando eu instalo jogos no meu HD (qualquer um em) ele pede para inserir o Disco Original, tudo bem, faço isso, mas quando vou jogando o Xbox 360 Slim fica dando sons estranhos e depois de uns 3 minutos aparece Falha na Autorização do Disco. Alguém sabe
 como resolver ? Ouvi rumores que se você coloca música junto com o jogo rodando no HD ele pega, mas não sei baixar músicas pelo Xbox. Valeu;</p>

<p>Hey there Helmax,<br />
<br />
When you search for Doodle jump on your console as Mister Cerb described, it should bring up a couple options:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Full game </li><li>Trailer </li><li>Trial game </li></ul>
<p><br />
They are all just named "Doodle Jump" so it can be a little confusing.<br />
<br />
If you select one and it just gives you an option to download the trailer or download the trial game, you should also see a another option to the right of that called "See Full Game"<br />
Select that and it will take you to the Arcade Game where you can buy and download the Doodle Jump game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us know how that goes.</p>
