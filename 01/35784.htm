<h2>            Refreshing Desktop and Black Screen when attempting to access system screens</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a crazy issue, and I am about 95 percent sure it is not hardware related.&nbsp; Basically the windows 10 login screen is fine, but when entering in my password and clicking login brings me to my desktop.&nbsp; All is normal for about 9 seconds, then my
 desktop starts flashing and refreshing where I don't have enough time to type in the run box or bring up any relevant settings.&nbsp; Another issue that has arisen is that when I hold shift and click restart the settings menu pops up,, but once I click troubleshoot,
 advanced, and startup my monitor is black as with bios and other system style menus.&nbsp; This did not occur until a recent windows update and it is killing me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When logging in I've taken advantage of the 9 second window to try to run some commands in the command prompt, but "systemreset," "sfc scannow," disma does not quite work.&nbsp; I'm at a loss for words, and have tried everything except for installing linux.&nbsp;
 I've seen other people talking about the refreshing desktop issue, but it seems no one is having this issue in conjunction with the system settings not displaying.&nbsp; I've switched monitors and everything.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, in advance,</p>
<p>CHris :)</p>

            Hi, cebeezly
<br />
<br />Try entering Safe Mode to repair later.
<br />
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

            Hi CE.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1803 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you sooo much.&nbsp; I went and bought a USB drive to download the media creation tool as I usually do, but after like 2 hours of setting up it fails on my win 10 laptop.&nbsp; I have even tried different formats, as well as running the install file from the
 flash drive itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another weird issue is that my mobo logo doesn't show up on monitor when booting anymore.&nbsp; Again, it is as if the system menus aren't invoking a signal within my monitor.&nbsp; If I hit shift and restart at login screen I can get to the screen
 where I can click troubleshoot, it is that no matter what there is no signal for anything else.&nbsp; BBIOS doesn't have signal either. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When engaging "systemreset" from command prompt the menu pops up and is unimpacted by refreshing desktop in the background which is super weird.&nbsp; When I click any option "Keep files" or Completely delete files" system says "getting ready."&nbsp; The PC restarts,
 and there is a black screen until either I grab a hand full of &nbsp; buttons, where it then goes to the login shade with the time.&nbsp; I had disabled system restore on install when installing the original OS.&nbsp; BTW I build this PC 3.5 years ago and have no issues
 ever.&nbsp; </p>

            Hi again Chris -
<br />
<br />Can you try installing Media Creation Tool to create bootable flash media on another PC, even borrow one if necessary?  
<br />
<br />If MCT doesn't work use the alternate download site here from MS TechBench:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Then follow the steps I gave to boot the media and attempt repairs, or just skip to the Clean Install  following the illustrated steps in the link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            Curious though, if the bios isn't even displaying a long with other things how will I boot the ISO via USB?&nbsp; I do have my wife's PC which has the exact hardware as mine, except the mobo is micro atx which I don't think makes a difference.&nbsp; Maybe I'll connect
 it and see if there are any changes in behavior.&nbsp; There seems to be now easy fix.&nbsp; Especially given that my dog's butt hit the Blu Ray drive button and broke the tray.&nbsp; I have the windows cd, just can't use it.&nbsp; I'm stressed because this is my work pc too,
 and with the amount of data and games I have on it, it will take a month to download everything agaiin if I even remember what to download with my current internet connection.&nbsp;

            Interesting, connected ssd from pc with issues to wife's pc with same hardware and though I can see all options and bios, PC fails to reset and boot into safe mode.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still continues to refresh desktop though.&nbsp; Just glad it's not a hardware issue, and
 glad to know that I can install ISO because of being able to see menus that I previously couldn't.&nbsp; Just weird, and I shouldn't have to do this just because of a stuppid update.&nbsp; I seen a disk image setting in the windows blue screen settings, can I use that
 tool to avoid using the LUCUS tool?&nbsp; I have an eye problem, and something tells me that the LUCUS tool isn't accessible to a screen reader.&nbsp;

            Lucas tool?  
<br />
<br />Look over these steps for doing a Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You could also first try a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool from this link choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This reinstalls WIndows while saving your files and apps in place; takes about an hour, resolves most problems.

<h2>            &#42;&#42;Problems Using Task View&#42;&#42;  -Feature Update To Windows 10, Version 1803</h2>
                    <p>This latest update has caused some instability in my personal system. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically, anytime I use the task view feature my system locks up. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked into it and you can't uninstall a feature update like you can other updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a restore point available for rolling back my system nor do I wish to go the route of a fresh OS installation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reported the issue to Microsoft's support staff, but there wasn't anything they could do. Especially since I was traveling when I reported the issue and they couldn't attempt any troubleshooting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do aside from waiting on Microsoft to release a patch?

            If you are within 10 days rollback window - I would recommend that you should consider rolling back 1803 to 1709 and defer it from happening as there seem to be issues. Try to install this after a month or two when more cum packs are released stabilizing 1803 further.
<br />
<br />Roll Back - Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; Under Go back to previous version of Windows 10, Get Started &gt; Follow onscreen directions

<h2>            Window 10 has too many problems I have to revert back to 7</h2>
                    <p>I found the download and install of the windows 10 'upgrade' very easy</p>
<p>However after install I couldn't connect to the internet I found out after some time that this was because windows edge was trying to make me use a proxy server that didn't exist so I had to remove the proxy server option</p>
<p>Windows edge and Internet explorer run very slowly (I have also got Firefox installed which runs much faster)</p>
<p>I click on links in emails and it takes up to 10 seconds for the Internet explorer or edge to open and find the URL</p>
<p>I am asked every time which application I want to use when clicking on links despite the fact that I tick the box to use the selected application in future.</p>
<p>I right click the taskbar to show windows side by side and it shows them stacked.</p>
<p>I couldn't connect to my nokia phone via it's Nokia PC Suite Application I found out later that I had to now 'pair' my phone with windows which was not required in windows 7.</p>
<p>Start Menu is too big and impossible to reorganise the way I want it.</p>
<p>Shut down button has disappeared so I now I cannot use keyboard shortcuts to put my computer to sleep</p>
<p>Computer will not stay in sleep mode and wakes up for no reason despite the fact that I have switched off all wake triggers</p>
<p>it takes a long time to open MS Office applications</p>
<p>You would think that the MS Office applications would start up quickly but the opposite is true</p>
<p>In general it is too slow. and full of bugs which annoy me and prevent me from working efficiently</p>

            <p><span>I also find Windows 10 is too intrusive, offering less granular configurations for many things than previous versions. I will be going back to Windows 7 Pro where everything works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows update doesn’t allow you to do anything to stop automatic security updates and has defer for non security updates, which is also pretty useless.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What I have seen so far with graphics on a 4k screen is also pretty dismal, text and dialog boxes flickering etc…<span>&nbsp;
</span>the other 2 non 4k screens on my system also display the flickering when I have a box open and am working in the 4k screen.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Generally it is with mouse movement that I see this, tried different mice and drivers, no joy.</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 7 on the same system does not display any of these issues.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Attempted to contact Windows support, received a call back from someone who either couldn’t understand or didn’t care (possibly both). I was asked questions that were already answered and then several
 that had no relevance to the issue, eventually ended the call when it was clear I was not getting competent help.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately on the help forums you can also see MS Support giving canned responses that clearly show they either do not understand or don’t know the answer and put irrelevant info instead of just saying, I am not sure, will have to check.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Edge is far too basic to be useful; the settings are poor in many areas offering little control over the browser.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Many sites (at least ones I use) either won’t open or are missing some of the web page.</span></p>
<p><span>It is possible I am just not finding the settings, however there are only so many places they would be.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I should have gone further on the preview apparently, as I did not see all of the issues I see with the retail build when running earlier preview builds.</span></p>
<p><span>In all fairness the mini
<span>&nbsp;</span>Zotac Zbox runs win 10 well with a touch screen monitor, but it is just for winamp music in my basement.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This was a clean install off of a Win 10 Pro 64 bit DVD, not an upgrade. I can only imagine how many issues an upgrade will cause.</span></p>
<p><span>Makes me wonder how bad the next Windows server will be if it follows the same UI.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am not sure why Microsoft thinks one OS on all platforms is a smart choice, windows 8 and no one wanting it, should have been the first clue.
</span></p>
<p><span>I wish MS would license Direct X to Linux, would be running a linux desktop instead.</span></p>

<h2>            Backup files in File History didn&#39;t remove the old files and folders in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Old title: Backup files in FileHistory</p>
<p>I am using Windows 10.</p>
<p>I received a notification tha the 15GB space on Onedrive will no longer be available and will be reduced to 5GB. &nbsp;If you need more space on Onedrive, &nbsp;you'll have to pay for it.</p>
<p>As a result of this memo, I started moving folders away from the Documents folder on "This PC" &nbsp;and saved it to another drive.</p>
<p>After this change I did a File Backup to FileHistory on my external drive of the C drive and the also the drive I moved the folder to.</p>
<p>When I viewed the FileHistory folder on my external drive, &nbsp;Backup did not remove the folders and file that no longer exist on the C drive, &nbsp;they still sit there. It did however create the folders in the other drive I selected for backup where the folders
 were moved to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question:- To get the backup FileHistory fixed, Can I delete the complete FileHostory folder with all the folders and do a backup again. Will this work? Is there perhaps procedure to follow to fix this?</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hello Anton,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We understand your concern in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>File History regularly backs up versions of your files in the Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos, and Desktop folders and the OneDrive files
 available offline on your PC. Over time, you'll have a complete history of your files. If the originals are lost, damaged, or deleted, you can restore them. You can also browse and restore different versions of your files. For example, if you want to restore
 an older version of a file (even if it wasn't deleted or lost), you can browse through a timeline, select the version you want, and restore it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In view of same, while backing up the files, it will only override the files and folders with the new one, which are with the same name. I
 guess you might be seeing the old folders, as they no longer exists in the C: drive. Hence the backup process didn't change them.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Yes, you can do it, if you're willing to startup the file history from scratch by removing everything from the external hard drive. But ensure
 that formatting the drive will wipe out everything from your hard drive. Please have a cross check with the files and folders in the external hard drive before you initiate this.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this will address your query.</span></p>

            Hi Mufaddal.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />You said WIndows 10 came with the PC.  To know for sure it's factory activated install ProducKey:  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a> and check for an OEM-BIOS key which confirms it was activated in the factory and should work if you copy and paste it into Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation &gt; Change Product Key.   
<br />
<br />The error normally means that someone has activated Windows with a Volume License Key meant only for business or organizations that activate a large number of PC's, which need to check in with the organization's server regularly to reactivate.
<br />
<br />Sometimes this is done by shops reinstalling Windows, unnecessarily because the PC either came with a Windows Product Key embedded in the BIOS/UEFI firmware, or it was already activated for free Upgrade and would have reactivated after a reinstall had they given it the chance and not interrupted this by installing the illegal key.
<br />
<br />If you know Windows was originally activated legitimately by one of these methods then to fix the problem what I would do is go offline to remove the Volume License key and then restore the Generic Product Key that is used to activate with the Digital License issued by Upgrade or Factory install. Then we'll see if it activates:
<br />
<br />1) Go offline by opening Action center at the right end of Task Bar, then clicking on Airplane mode to turn off internet.
<br />
<br />2) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click to Run as Administrator, then right click to copy and paste this command in and press Enter: slmgr -upk
<br />
<br />3) Restart PC and then insert Generic Product Key for WIndows 10 Pro from here: <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-</a>...
<br />
<br />This sets everything back to default so that if there is a Digital License issued during a proper Upgrade it should reactivate within a few days. If not we will need to try something else:
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps contact Microsoft Support phone or chat options here:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Mufaddal 
<br />
<br />It is likely that the Windows 10 licence you are running is a volume licence version and is meant to run in a Company or organisation where the activation is re-armed on a regular basis, or it is a cracked version of Windows . . . 
<br />
<br />Do you know the history of your PC or version of Windows . .. 
<br />
<br />Is your PC second hand or Windows was reinstalled by a PC Repair Shop?
<br />
<br />Is there a Windows sticker on that laptop, and if so, what exactly is printed on that sticker?

ASUS...&nbsp; Their device, they support it.<br />

&nbsp; <br />
Don't use third part driver finders... they usually come with baggage.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
I see ASUS does have the RealTek audio driver for Windows 8 available on their site... Did you also install all the other drivers?<br />

Again - this is not a Microsoft issue as much as an ASUS issue.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Windows 8 does not "normally" come with "all drivers defined" (which I assume means that Windows 8 just finds its own drivers) if it is installed on a machine that was not shipped with it (and even then - you might be able to get newer/better drivers after
 the fact - even immediately.)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
If the drivers provided by the manufacturer under Windows 7 worked fine and the drivers provided by the manufacturer for Windows 8 are not seemingly working - you need to contact ASUS and figure out what needs to be done next.&nbsp; They are solely responsible for
 their hardware and choose what operating systems they support.&nbsp; Given they have provided Windows 8 drivers - they seemingly have chosen to support that device under Windows 8.

It works pretty well, depending on what you do on a daily basis and who you interact with.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
You might also consider openSUSE.<br />

            Hi #lavish, this does seem to be an issue caused by the 1803 update, a lot of users are reporting this over the last few days . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small utility which will find your Windows 10 Product Key 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://neosmart.net/OemKey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/OemKey/</a> 
<br />
<br />Go to Settings - Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />Try entering that product key there to activate Windows 
<br />
<br />Otherwise, have that product key at hand and contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10 
<br />

            Hi #lavish,
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to System - About 
<br />
<br />Whet version of Windows 10 is reported there, is it Pro or Enterprise? 
<br />
<br />Then in the Settings App, go to Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />Does Activation report that 'Windows is activated using your Organisation's Activation server'? 
<br />
<br />If so: 
<br />
<br />It is likely that the Windows 10 licence you are running is a volume licence version and is meant to run in a Company or organisation where the activation is re-armed on a regular basis . . . 
<br />
<br />Do you know the history of your PC or version of Windows? 
<br />
<br />If your PC is second hand or Windows was reinstalled, it is likely that version of Windows came from a company environment or it is a cracked version of Windows

            Hi #lavish, if you do not know the history of that PC, I would say at some stage, that PC was upgraded with a volume Windows 10 licence . . .
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows
<br />
<br />Search that folder for KMS
<br />
<br />If you do not find it there, search both these folders for KMS
<br />
<br />C:\Program Files
<br />
<br />C:\Program Files (x86)
<br />
<br />Do you find a file with KMS in the name?

<h2>            Windows 10 files unable to be accessed</h2>
                    I keep getting the error message: "Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file.&nbsp; You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item." This keeps happening with my Adobe DC Reader files. It never happened on my old PC that ran
 Windows 8. I'm getting really frustrated. Please anyone, can you help me?

<p>Hi,</p>
The various Adobe documents tend to be in one of my various personal folders but OneDrive has them linked under Pictures for some reason.
<br />
<p>C:\Users\ahki5\OneDrive\Pictures\Documents is their path.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try moving them and I'm only able to access the documents occasionally. For the most part it went right back to the original error message. That was with me trying to access thru my Quick Access menu. If I dig down and start at C: and follow the trail
 down to my docs, then they'll open. As an extra note, once I set up this laptop and installed Adobe, I've gotten occasional messages stating "The application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000022}. Click OK to close." I'll click OK and the dialog window
 will close but Adobe will run fine, until I try to open another doc the same way. I have uninstalled and reinstalled Adobe about 5 times thinking that was the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to be able to save my bill statements from online and have them open right away in Adobe. They won't open at all now and I have to save the files and go down the path from C: to access them at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Norton as my antivirus software. I haven't tried turning it off. I'm not sure which parts I should turn off as most of it shows up as internet protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated. -Pam</p>
<p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After sending the previous message, I went in and moved the files once again. I also did a quick scan, again, of the hard drive. I had already done an in depth one not long ago. After moving all the files I was able to open my documents and download a new
 one. Now, I have already gone thru this once before and had it stop working within a week or so. I'm not sure what causes it. I'm still getting the message that the application didn't start properly and I have no idea why I get that. On the plus side, as of
 right this very second I can access the files. I'll see how long it takes for it to corrupt this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again. -Pam</p>

<h2>            New HP G42 freezing up</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I bought a new laptop back in september of this year, an HP G42, with windows 7, but not long after I got it it started freezing. Whether I listen to music or use Word it will freeze. And also on the ad before I bought it, it said that it could be used
 up to 3 to 4 hours and the battery gets low within 1hr to 1 and a half hours. Is this normal? If it is, it sure doesn't seem like it.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 store not working...</h2>
                    upgraded to win 10 yesterday,and everything working fine except my store,and hidden icon task bar do not work. my store stumbled so much it must be drunk. i tried everything form the forums,and researched all alternatives,and i am pretty good at finding
 fixes. but whatevr i tried it does not work. &nbsp;it keeps giving me this error 0x80072efd, even researched that error. virus check my system,and i got 3 antivirus,and 2 spyware plus clean it all out,and i guess it stumbled so much its dead drunk cause nothing
 works. so i hope microsoft patches it even though i get my apps from the internet cause i just upgraded from win 7 home premium. i really would like to have it cause theres seems to be some interesting apps. maybe some day microsoft will it and it works,and
 sober the store up. forrest gump was right life is like a box of chocolate you ever know what you get. peace!!!

            <p>I had a different problem, but this worked for me and apparently for a lot of other people:</p>
<p>Navigate your File Explorer to the following directory:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C:\Users&lt;Insert Username&gt;\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsStore_8wekyb3d8bbwe\</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once here, delete the&nbsp;<span><em>Local Cache</em></span>&nbsp;folder and try launching the Windows Store again.</p>

            This doesn't work.&nbsp; I upgraded from 8.1 Pro to 10.&nbsp; Every time I try to update an App, it downloads, but when it tries to install, I get the same error message: "Try that again. Something went wrong. The error code is 0x80073D0A, in case you need it."&nbsp;
 The Store App shows an update, and when it attempts to update, the whole App crashes and closes.&nbsp; Any ideas?

<p>I really do not want to do that as I will lose apps that cannot be reinstalled.</p>

            Try uninstalling an app if it won't update; and then download and re-install from&nbsp;the 'Purchases' Window. It worked for me with the Reader app.

            See Andre Da Costa's reply, and let me that it is very common for very old software not to run under newer versions of Windows. And 2006 Quickbooks is very old--11 versions old.<br />

<p>I managed to run chkdsk /f</p>
<p>
</p><p>and now I get the Ctricial_Process_Died error when I boot up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the log C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt and everything completed successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, I finally had it, Windows 10 has boomed obviously and decided to Reset the PC and even that does work (Even if I don't want to save my file, just blow everything away)!&nbsp; Now what?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been in IT a long time, started with Win3.1, and this is my absolute worst experience with Windows.&nbsp; Nothing works!&nbsp; Since this was a Windows 7 upgrade to Windows 10, I have no media.&nbsp; The integrated functionalities, all of them, don't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hopefully, someone here will be able to offer some advice shortly, otherwise I think I'll be dropping Linux into the system and be done with this.</p>

            So I ended up creating a USB installation medium and reinstalled Win10 just to prove it was&nbsp; a Win10 issue (not hardware ...) and it worked.&nbsp; Then I formatted the whole thing and installed Ubuntu so I don't have this issue again down the road as it is
 pretty obvious by this post and countless other reporting the exact same issue that Win10 is unstable!

with a stop error <br />

This belongs to your Nvidia video drivers<br />
<br />
Looks like dxgkrnl.sys ius crashing too. Directx<br />
<br />
I would uninstall that Symantec program then use their removal tool. Then install something better<br />
<br />
Uninstall then update your video drivers<br />

<h2>            Sony WH-CH500 Bluetooth headset not working properly on Skype</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently got a&nbsp;Sony WH-CH500 Bluetooth headset, but for whatever reason, it's not working on Skype.
</p>
<p>I'm using Windows 7, all drivers are up to date, the device and all services are connected and enabled, and it's working with every other program except Skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While troubleshooting, I've found out that the headphone's mic only works when in Mono mode (it is one of the services, besides Stereo), but I can't get the sound to go through the headset. I've tried all the settings I could think off, disabling Stereo,
 setting each as the default device, changing settings in Skype, etc., but nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>Any and all suggestions are welcomed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            Hi there, 
<br />
<br />I'd first try updating your camera drivers, and then by locating your camera settings on Skype:- 
<br />
<br />Updating Drivers 
<br />1. Search "Device Manager" in the search box, near the Windows Start Button, and select it. 
<br />2. Locate your camera, right click and select "Update Drivers". 
<br />3. Restart your PC. 
<br />
<br />Camera Settings 
<br />1. Open Skype 
<br />2. Click on your display picture at the top left hand side of the application 
<br />3. Scroll down and select 'Settings' 
<br />4. Click on Audio &amp; Video 
<br />5. Select 'Webcam Settings'.       
        </p>

<p>All drivers are up-to-date, and I don't&nbsp;have a problem with my Webcam (which is integrated into my laptop). Do you still think I should follow your instruction?</p>

            Hi Boris,
<br />
<br />Yes, I've read the post, but I'd like to make sure that you have definitely updated your drivers - by checking the formal way. It is also worth updating your bluetooth drivers this way aswell.
<br />
<br />I hope it all goes well.

<br />1. Launch Control Panel

<br />3. Sound
<br />4. On the 'Playback' tab, right-click and select your headset as the default device, if it is not already.

            Stereo mode would be an AD2P profile. That mode is playback only as stereo requires more bandwidth. Mono mode would probably be Hands-free or Headset Profile (lowest bandwidth). Skype would use the Headset Profile. If the stack software for the external
 or onboard Bluetooth device allows the device to be configured using the Headset Profile, it may work. However, if the device chooses to mute playback in that mode, that probably points to a limitation/locked configuration in that hardware (firmware). The
 only other settings that may have any effect is toggling exclusive mode settings. Of the instances I have read online, in regards to this hardware, people simply purchase another vendor's hardware that does not exhibit this limitation.

<p>I have had problems for two years on my 3 home machines, I beleive they are hijacked and the link above will give detail on what has been happening.</p>
<p>I pasted parts of my CBS log and this log was run only @ week after complete reinstall from factory supplied disks.</p>
<p>I would like to paste the start of the log in this post and on the following post I would like to post the part of the log where it lists the files (from what I can see) that SFC could not repair.
</p>
<p>And then further&nbsp;posts with&nbsp;some screenprints (though I'm not sure if I can post screenprints?)&nbsp;and anit rootkit&nbsp; reports that I have only recently been able to carry out. I currently use AVG they asked me to provide GMER logs but could not because the 'select
 all' dialogue box is greyed out on both my ACER and Toshiba. However 'ctachme.exe' worked (I think)! When I have completed posting information&nbsp;I will say at the end of the last post and would be gratefull for help from all/any of your experts, I am in despair
 over this!</p>

            One thing that is again peculiar for me, is the amount of XP files on my machine, there are many files especially in system32/drivers opened by 'unknown applications' when I google them they say they are part of the XP o/s, weird? I also paste the notation
 from&nbsp;an AVG file, V Protect, another corrupt file it seems? I would be delighted to have an explanation about these two files either to put me in my place or to help me understand, I don't mind your motivation, I'd just like to know how this is happening!<br />

            <p>By downloading GMER.zip to my TOSHIBA I found I was ble to run. &nbsp;The first run threw up sveral entries , as it was running I thought to take a screenprint in case it should get sabotaged; as I was about to, the extracted file in the explorer window popped
 up when I minimised the window the scan had restarted and the entries had been wiped

But it threw up two entries under rootkit so I saved that scan and restarted in the hope that it might do what it did first time! To me surprise it did
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.avg.com%2fstc%2fimg%2fsmileys%2fsmile.gif" /> at least the bits that were missing reappeared

            <p>My third machine DELL desktop has caused me the most grief. It was my retirement 'gift' a super machine purchased in september 2009 and has never functioned for me. I paid for a technician from Dell to set it up. it was my first home desktop and I wanted
 it spot on, the graphics driver was not on the driver disk and the technician downloaded it; within 2 weeks I had him back to clean the machine and reinstall, I felt it was hijacked from day 1! The problems continued Dell accessed online and lost the image!
 Recently when microsoft pointed out that the product id was wrong on the ACER when I checked it was wrong on the DELL to.
<br />
I reinstalled the Dell o/s vista 32 bit home premium and have not loaded drivers yet.&nbsp; I decided to copy the GMER zip file to the desktop and ran. Once again it ame up with a hit (though I am getting concerned with hits on all the machines that they may be
 positive negatives ).</p>
<p>How can I have an attached device when I have only reinstalled from factory disk, I have deleted the parition, created a new one and formatted it! What I do not undrstand though is after formating the amount of diskspace&nbsp;usable&nbsp;is .9gb less that the total
 available?</p>
<p>result below. This machine is vista 32 bit home premium&nbsp;with a free upgrade&nbsp;to win 7 home premium&nbsp; which when I ran recently asked me for my product key, I did not have one for win 7 available from Dell, when I contacted them they told me I should not need
 one and to contact Microsoft!</p>

            <p>I have had issues with AVG (paid version). AVG sent me a diagnostic tool t run on my computer to upload logs, the tool stated it could not find AVG on my machine! On the AVG site I found a&nbsp; link to upload the tool and it worked however when I started to
 upload the files I had a pop up that concerned me greatly, I cannot attach but will type the contents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pop up is from Security Task Manager and I always answer no and I get the same pop up every time I use the upload &nbsp;both on the Toshiba and Acer the only difference is the deleteavgtool number changes ecah time.</p>
<p>Contents</p>
<p>Program "DeleteAVGTool448" wants to start automatically when windows starts do you want to allow this?</p>

<p>That's it all the information I have I apprceciate I have not posted system info but there is no facility neither have I printed the full cbs log. But if anyone able/willing to help wants any information they are more than welcome and if anyone 'official/trustworthy'
 wants to access my machines they may access anyfile folder part they wish. I just need help please!</p>

            <p>Which I have done many times and it all comes back. I have been convinced either my boot has been corrupted or the flag to erase data changed or there is a hidden partition which does not get erased?? I am not a techie so I have no idea what is and what
 isn't junk. That's all I can tell you is that Dell tell me my machine is ok! Microsoft tellme my Acer machine is&nbsp; now OK , every bit of rootkit and anti virus has told me I'm ok!&nbsp; It was not until I ran the SFC sscan that I had some evidence to prove it. My
 instinct (from day 1) wasn't accepted&nbsp;by all the support centres I contacted, unfortunately if you are not a techie you are treated like a fool and that sadly I have to say has been my experience with Microsoft mind you I have got so frustrated I am sure they
 have cause to say that I have been an akward git at times!</p>
<p>&nbsp;T he root of my prblem is that group policy is hijacked, when I connect to the internet whoever has taken control then dowmloads legitimate microsoft tools to complete the hijack taking control of my 2 laptops and desktop, how do I know? I just do, but
 I know that's no good without evidence and I wish I had the technical know how to provide that. If someone could provide a reference (not too complicated) as to how to get into the machine and control my network settings, e.g. autoconfig IPV4 keeps getting
 set and I can't change it and also for Group policy. Ggroup policy does not exist on this machine (win7 64 bit) according to windows but when I shut down it tells me it is shutting down 'group policy client'(?),&nbsp;please let me know where I can find it/purchase
 it.</p>
<p>This will read perveresley but you cannot believe how pleased I am to read what you say, why has everyone ignored this, if it is so obvious to you??
</p>
<p>The Dell desktop gives me the most worry, I installed the Dell CD after the o/s; it contains the Dell resource module and all the Dell divers. After installing the CD on the hard drive and then installing Security task Manager, security manager in the notation
 of this file was suggesting the drivers were the wrong one for my Inspiron and gave it a high risk rating.</p>
<p>I reinstalled Dell again cleaning the disk based on the dell instructions. I then&nbsp;installed avg tune up , which told me the registry needed fragmenting?? Then Security Task Manager (STM). When I ran STM it told me the DELL upgrade assistant disk (installed)&nbsp;was
 a risk, I didn't think I had put this on but I may have done to see if it would upgrade without asking for a new licence key. I copied the notation and will paste below some of it, I wish there was a way I could attach files. What concerns e is that the token
 keys are different, or am I misreading? (These were installed off memory stick, I have not connected the Dell to the Internet).</p>
<p>I have never formatted disks , worres me in case I wipe the boot or something. I think probably I need a complete format of every tiny corner of every disk and that is no problem because I have absolutley nothing of value on any machines, I have removed
 all my personal /files/photos etc. My son is 12 and needs a good working machine to develop educationally and socially and at the moment I can not provide that and that is my greatest concern.</p>
<p>So Veritas or anybody if you can help me I would be most gratefull</p>

    <title>Kernal Security Check Failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bradlylawrence  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kernal Security Check Failure</h2>
                    <p>Ever since i updated to windows 10 i have been getting this error and it happens at random times sometimes a couple of times a day. I did some research first trying to find a solution some saying that upgrading to windows 10 itself could be the problem and
 that i should reinstall windows. I did this when i got a new hard drive, and ssd drives so that i would not have to do the reinstall more than once. Figured that would fix the problem, it did not. So i looked into it more and found out that maybe some of my
 drivers were out of date and so i updated them, and then most recently i found out that my computer had been trying to install an update but was stuck and wouldn't complete the update. So i looked into that and got it updated. But even after that i am still
 getting these errors i saw on a post that sending you a dmp file would be helpful in diagnosing the problem, makes sense, and that's what this post is. Hopefully this can be fixed so i can finally stop getting these BSOD.</p>

<p>A blue screen error (also called a stop error) can occur if a problem causes your PC to shut down or restart unexpectedly. When you experience this type of error, you won’t be able to see things like the Start menu or the taskbar on the screen when your
 PC is turned on. Instead you might see a blue screen with a message that your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.</p>

            i do have an Astro A40 and its just like what they said i have the xbox one edition of them. but what the forum lacks is how to get the proper driver and which drive is the faulty drive if you could link that to me i would be greatful as this most likely
 will fix my problem. i did attempt to look for it myself but my internal knowledge of drivers isn't that extensive.

            well i think i figured it out but only time will tell i got out all my manuals and stuff i have for my astros and turns out i forgot something pretty crucial which is with the xbox one edition of the mix amp and headset you have to set it to pc mode by
 holding down the power button which make the light turn white instead of red like it was doing which was why it was giving me a controller for sound because it was supposed to have a controller as it was in console mode. so i will have to wait and see if this
 fixes my problem. just a side note when i switched it to pc mode it installed drivers and the xbox peripheral in the device manager went away.
