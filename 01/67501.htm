<h2>            Broadband download buffering, how to increase buffering during congestion periods</h2>
                    <p>I am on a high end cable connection with Telstra, however having actually measured and logged the upload and download data speeds; I have the evidence to prove that Congestion is a fact of life. During peak periods our streaming ability for iview, utube
 or any other streaming provider incurs significant data package losses and pauses in the stream to the point we no longer stream during peak periods it is very frustrating.</p>
<p>If we could adjust the buffering of the downloaded data so that the streamed video is cached significantly, we may be able to watch iview again. My question is , how to increase the buffering capacity levels of down loaded data. Equipment is a surface pro
 1, using windows 10.</p>

<p>Thank you for responding. </p>
<p>In regard to contacting Telstra, my ISP, they are aware of the congestion, their answer is that they are limited by the old cable networks. As you can see I have already covered that basic research.
</p>
<p>In relation to my original enquiry, how to adjust download buffering. If you do not know the answer to my question, I&nbsp;will understand, however I still need a constructive solution.</p>

<h2>            iHome clip-on webcam WON&#39;T INSTALL</h2>
                    <div>Hi. I recently bought an iHome clip-on webcam, and it won't work on my Windows 7 computer. I checked to see why exactly it was defective and got the following error code in device manager:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged. (Code 19)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I open the it's program in my desktop, it immediately stops responding and closes.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, when I check it's installation status, the "USB composite device" installed successfully, whilst "USB2.0 Camera" failed to install.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Lastly, and this may be normal but I thought I'd mention it anyway; The webcam light turns on during the split second I plug it in and then stays off.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried to fix it (reinstalling, using command prompt, scanning for hardware changes), but nothing seems to be working.</div>
<div>Would you guys be able to help me out to get it working again, based on what I've provided?</div>
                </div>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
</span><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it.<br />
<br />
1. What is the make and model of the webcam?<br />
2. <span>&nbsp;</span>Which fixit did you run?<br />
<br />
<br />
Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged. To fix this problem you can first try running a Troubleshooting Wizard. If that does not work, you should uninstall and then reinstall
 the hardware device. (Code 19)<span>&nbsp; </span><br />
<br />
This can occur when more than one service is defined for a device, if there is a failure opening the service subkey, or if the driver name cannot be obtained from the service subkey. Here are some things that you can try to resolve this problem.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1<br />
</b>I would suggest you to run Hardware and devices troubleshooter<br />
<br />
Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a><br />
<b><br />
Method 2<br />
</b>I would suggest you to update the drivers for the webcam from the manufacturers website.<br />
<br />
</span><b><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly<br />
</span></b><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a><br />
<br />
If the issue still persists, then i would suggest you to Post.<br />

    <title>New HP laptop with activated Win 10 Pro lost activation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> juliusbt  say:</h3>
<h2>            New HP laptop with activated Win 10 Pro lost activation</h2>
                    <p>My daughter got a new laptop, with Windows 10 Pro activated on it, it booted with an account named after the model of the laptop (Zbook 15). Assuming to use that as the Admin account I decided to create a user account for her. Not bound with a Microsoft
 account, because she's too young to have one and I will admin this laptop for her most of the time. Now, within her account, it suddenly asks for activation when she wants to change the color theme? WTH?</p>
<p>Since when are activations local user bound? Or let me rephrase that:</p>
<p>How do I activate Win 10 for *all* local users of this OS ?</p>

            This is a known issue impacting Windows 10 pro customers worldwide. Below is the excerpt from Microsoft Chat Support about activation issue being faced by people. I will suggest that you should wait for a day or two.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has just released an Emerging issue announcement about current activation issue related to Pro edition recently. This happens in Japan, Korea, American and many other countries.I am very sorry to inform you that there is a temporary issue with Microsoft's activation server at the moment and some customers might experience this issue where Windows is displayed as not activated.
<br />Our engineers are working tirelessly to resolve this issue and it is expected to be corrected within one to two business days

<p>And, if I don't get this solved within a day or two, I'll be installing and switching this laptop to use Linux for good.</p>
<p>Seriously, if she can't even change a COLOR selection for the OS desktop shell without having to activate or pay, what kind of "Pro" OS does MicroSoft thinks this should be? That's just pathetic. I'm her father, she doesn't need MS to hold her hands, to
 get permission from, to change a COLOR theme, for crying out loud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone at Microsoft ever uses common sense, when designing BS limitations like this? You have no idea how disappointing an experience Windows 10 already is for her (and me for that matter). I think I'll teach her to use Linux.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If that were all, that would be fine, but it's not that it *displays* as not activated, it refuses to allow any and all personalization. Amazing, a business, a company with a budget this huge, can't even get this right. I'm stunned. Truly stunned. Give me
 a couple billion, I'll set up a business that designs an OS that actually works.</p>

<h2>            HP Pavilion won&#39;t connect to internet</h2>
                    I did a factory reset a week ago due to persistent performance problems with my PC. One of the problems was frequently losing internet connection even when other devices had no issues. Usually it was resolved with a reset or I plugged in Ethernet. Now
 it rarely connects to any internet including the Ethernet. I tried to do another reset but it says there is an error and it can't reset. I tried the media creation tool while the internet was working and attempted a reboot from USB but the error says "The
 selected boot device failed. Press enter to continue." &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated! I'm furiously searching cyber Monday deals from my phone to replace it if it can't be fixed!&nbsp;

            I did reinstall windows from a pen back up. &nbsp;For about 5 days it seemed like everything was resolved but then it started over like before; randomly disconnecting from the internet, and sometimes not even recognizing there are any networks to join. Even
 the ethernet cable would not work. &nbsp;I don't know what it will take to make it reliable again. &nbsp;I suppose I will attempt another reboot with the pen back up I made but I am not hopeful.&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks Michael,</p>
<p>I tried this today but it says "Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem" &nbsp;However when I ran it the internet was working. I will try again the next time it won't connect to see if I get a different result. &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>If you have a Skype account that you're signing in with a <em>Skype Name</em>, it's best to link that account to your Microsoft account (the newly created account). In this way, you can sign in to Skype and other Microsoft services using your Skype Name

<h2>            Surface Pen Not Working</h2>
                    The very first time I paired the pen with my surface pro, I had someone do it for me and it worked just fine. But then I disconnected it and tried to pair it again, the led on the pen did not work neither did the pen show up on the list of devices to pair
 with. I also tried changing the batteries but it still did not work. Will I have to buy another one?

            Is your Surface under warranty?  If so, I would go down the path of a warranty claim.  If not, I can do more research looking for solutions.

<p>Hi, my surface pen is about 1.5 years old. I don't use it very often, but I do use it every now and then. Just in the past 2 days, the LED light started to show orange and then red. So I found out from online help that I needed to change the AAAA battery.
 I got brand new GP brand of AAAA batteries. But after the battery change, the LED would not come on. Whenever I put back the old Duracell battery original from Microsoft, the red light would still come on. After some more tries, both batteries could not get
 the LED light to turn on.<br />
<br />
I did all kinds of things:<br />
ran diagnostic tests on Surface.</p>
<p>installed all the Windows updates.<br />
remove the pairing of the pen (but after this, nothing I have done could get it to pair again, which is part of the problem now).</p>
<p>the LED light just won't turn on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The eraser and the pen still works on my Surface. So I could draw, paint, etc in OneNote, Fresh Paint, Windows Ink, etc. The problems are 3:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. No LED light no matter how long I press and hold down the eraser button</p>
<p>2. Surface cannot find my pen - not showing up in list of Bluetooth devices.</p>
<p>3. The shortcuts that I set up (still there), like one click to open OneNote, Double click and Click and Hold Down -- all these do not work.</p>
<p>I have the GP AAAA new battery in it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise what exactly is causing this? </p>
<p>Is there a BLUETOOTH battery separate to the AAAA battery? Because I saw that for SP 3, there is this #319 Watch batteries that need to be replaced as well.
</p>
<p>However, mine is a SP 4, and it does not look up I could open the cap up to insert new batteries (the cap seems to be one complete piece, not cannot be taken apart into different components).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pen costs a lot - equal price to a Kindle, to replace. So it's quite a disappointing if the shortcut buttons don't work. It's best feature of the Surface Pen!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate if someone could hack this for me.</p>
<p>

<div>Perhaps try a different brand like the Duracell that came supplied with the pen?</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 Game Bar Stops Recording</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I have a new Lenovo Y70 PC and I was trying to use it to record some gameplay of Deus Ex: Human
 Revolution Director's Cut. I set the limit to an hour and the entire time, I saw the timer in red in the upper right corner of my screen so I knew it was recording and I knew how much time I had left. But when I stopped recording after about 55 minutes, and
 went to my Captures folder to retrieve the video, it was only 3 minutes long. It's as if the game bar stopped capturing on its own and truncated the video, even though the timer was clearly running for the whole 55 minutes. I tried the same thing again, and
 the second time, I only got&nbsp;</span><em>15 seconds</em><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;of
 video. What is going on here? I have tried searching around and could not find anything that describes the same problems. Does the game bar time out if it thinks it's not recording a game or something?</span>

            If reinstallation doesn't solve the probelm - As a work-around, You can download Classic Skype and use that. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a> 
<br />
<br />Good news is that Classic Skype is not going to be retired. Its last date in service was 1-Sep-18 and it has been decided not stop the services to Classic Skype for some more time. It would nag you for updating to latest version which is v8 which you will have to ignore and tolerate.

<p>I would leave it running for a while yet. If you have chosen to clean up windows update files this will take a while even with a decent CPU.</p>
<p>The reason being is the windows update files are compressed, in order to delete them disk clean-up has to decompress the files one at a time to delete them, this is quite CPU intensive.</p>
<p>If your Windows install is quite old and has been regularly updated there could be a gigabyte or more of update files to remove.</p>
<p>On my system with an i5-8400 CPU and 16 Gb ram disk clean-up takes over 20 minutes to complete if I include windows update clean-up as well. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi AngusMcLean1 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Sometimes it may take a lot of time depending upon file size and whether they are being used / locked. If that still does't finish even after waiting for few hours, you can restart and try again. 
<br />
<br />Let me know the results.

                    When I first got my laptop I didn't use the camera until a month later until I decided to play with it. But when I tried to open the camera it said my camera didn't exist. That didn't bother me. However my face recognition camera was working until I updated
 the Windows 10 and now my face recognition isn't working.<br />

<p>Same here. There are a few threads on the Activition page regarding this but they were shut down for some reason. Hoping MS can help out since Activition's support page sucks.</p>

<p>When I log in on the Call of Duty Forums with my account that I should be logging in with in-game I can't see their forums. &nbsp;It says unauthorized. &nbsp;LoL &nbsp;Something is up with their authentication servers is my guess. &nbsp;But that's the IT Guy in me speaking.
 &nbsp;Hoping they have it fixed soon. &nbsp;Not that I need the clan right away since a lot of my friends are still on the 360. &nbsp;However I would like to maybe run with some other guys for now.

<h2>            After wake, Type Cover &#40;keyboard&#47;touchpad&#41; stops working and USB mouse stops working&#59; Results in blue screen upon restart</h2>
                    <p>This problem has plagued me for a few days now:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. This happens sometimes after waking my PC from Hibernation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Once awaken, the keyboard and touchpad of my Type Cover become unresponsive (even after unplug/replug). Also, my USB wireless mouse does not respond. The touchscreen still works and can be used to log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. My attempt to fix this is to Restart. However, this leads to an error and brings me to blue screen. If I try to restart from blue screen, it still does not fix problem, and leads again to blue screen. The Type Cover (keyboard/touchpad) works within the
 blue screen menus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. The only fix I've found is to perform System Restore from the blue screen menus. The Restore date is to Dec 26th, 2017. After restore, keyboard/touchpad/USB mouse work normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Sometimes when I hibernate, the PC will wake normally. But sometimes, I get the same problem of my Type Cover and mouse not working, and I have to repeat the whole restore process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the recent System Restore, I've checked the Windows Update Status and posted screenshots below:</p>

    <title>Apps Start in Background When Computer is Idle - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Apps Start in Background When Computer is Idle</h2>
                    <p>I have a "problem" in Windows 10, that when the computer is idle it starts several windows store apps in the background (such as calendar, store, news, weather, xbox, etc.). This is strange because they have all been disabled in settings --&gt; privacy --&gt;
 background apps. When this happens the live tiles also stop updating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is annoying because it increases the number of processes running on my PC by up to 20 and also uses memory. These background apps don't stop until I log out and log in again. Unfortunately, as soon as the computer is idle again they start again. Does
 anyone know how to disable this? Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Aero,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.<br />
We appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the following method and check if the issue still persist.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><strong>Boot the computer in Safe Mode</strong>
</p>
<p>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers necessary to run Windows. The words
<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To go to safe mode follow the steps below</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Restart </span></strong><span>your<strong> PC. <br />
</strong></span><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Press&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Shift + F8</span></strong><span>&nbsp;before the Windows logo appears.</span><span>
<br />
</span><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Click&nbsp;</span><strong><span>See Advanced Repair Options</span></strong><span>.</span><span>
<br />
</span><strong><span>Step 4:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Click&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Troubleshoot</span></strong><span>.</span><span><br />
</span><strong><span>Step 5:</span></strong><span> Click&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Advanced Options</span></strong><span>.</span><span><br />
</span><strong><span>Step 6:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Click&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Windows Startup Settings</span></strong><span>.</span><span>
<br />
</span><strong><span>Step 7:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Click&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Restart</span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong><span>
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You then see a list where you can choose&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong><span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Safe Mode with Networking</span></strong><span>&nbsp;(depending on whether you think you’ll need the Internet).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If your computer works fine in safe mode, perform clean boot</p>
<p><strong><span><br />
<strong><span>Method 2: Perform a clean boot</span></strong></span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.
</p>
<p><span><br />
Following is a link to perform a <strong>Clean Boot</strong>:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: </span>Start the computer in normal mode refer the section,
<strong><span>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting
</span></strong>from the link above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get back to us if you have queries regarding Windows, we will be happy to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,<br />
Microsoft Community.</p>

            <p>It doesn't happen when I'm not connected to a network but does when I am. It also doesn't happen when I have my WiFi set to a metered connection. I assume it is Windows Store updating apps when the computer is idle. Can this be disabled?</p>

            <p>I've tried your instructions but unfortunately they haven't helped. After the recent store update I can now disable automatic app updates but it appears that the problem isn't linked to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When my computer is idle for a few minutes, various apps continue to open in the background and their associated live tiles and notifications then no longer update/work correctly until I close the process and restart the app. Any more ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<h2>            Cannot get the Windows 7 &#34;Play To&#34; feature to work.</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to render some video files and pictures from my PC (Windows 7 Ultimate x64 SP1) to my TV set (Samsung UE40D8000) using the Windows 7 "Play To" option but it won't work. The "Play To" window pops up furtively and disappears and most of the time
 the Windows explorer becomes unresponsive and I've got to kill&nbsp;it and restart it when this happens (when I click "Play To" from the Windows explorer).</p>
<ul>
<li>All Stream options are enabled in WMP12.</li><li>I tried to reinstall WMP12 from Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features &gt; Turn Windows features on and off to no avail.</li><li>I uninstalled and reinstalled the TV DMR from both "Network and Sharing Center" &gt; "Network Map" and from "Devices and Printers" to no avail as well.</li><li>The private inbound and outbut rules for "Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service" are all enabled in the Windows Firewall.</li><li>I can successfully play the same files directly from my TV set but it is not as handy as using "Play To" from the PC.</li><li>The "Play To" feature does work from the Administrator account on the same system though the "Play To" button is always grayed out in WMP12 and I've got to click "Play To" from the menu when I right-click a file.</li></ul>
<p>Have you got any ideas how to fix this issue? Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>A new account would probably fix the issue since the PlayTo feature does work from the alternate administrator account but since this is my primary work system I am concerned that creating a new user profile could break my installed applications. If I've
 got to reinstall them I would possibly save time starting from a fresh install. I was just hoping for a possible fix without having to reinstall my system. Thanks for your support.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The article mentions the following: </p>
<p>"If you have e‑mail messages in an e‑mail program, you must import your e‑mail messages and addresses to the new user profile before you delete the old profile"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if creating a new user account affects e-mail messages and addresses,&nbsp;I was wondering if other settings in other applications could be affected as well. I'm concerned about it since I've got tens of installed applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Creating a new user account may reset some application settings back to default, but for the purpose of testing. It is a good idea for&nbsp;you to see if the issue persists when logged in as a different user.</p>
<strong>Create a user account:</strong>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a new user account does not have the same setting preferences that&nbsp;you like,&nbsp;you can check the program to see if&nbsp;you can re-import the correct settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the information is helpful.</p>

                    <p>I was trying to plug in my souround sound into my tower. Well the wires accidentally touched something and then there was a loud noise of course we were startled &amp; so after many attempts trying to have surround sound for the computer we couldnt hear anything
 so&nbsp;I gave up &amp; just plugged the computer speakers back into the tower. Well we could not hear ANYTHING now!!! I tried watching a movie and NO SOUND!! We tried pluggin in headphones &amp; still nothing!! &amp; now even though the speakers are plugged in and its saying
 that the&nbsp;speakers are not detected even though their plugged in!!! But if I check the sound I can see that the lines for volume are moving up and down but we can't hear anything!! so I called a computer tech and he said that sometimes the sound gets changed
 well I changed the sound and it was trying to detect the speakers but it is still saying that nothing is plugged into the speaker plug when they are!!! Not computer savy so need help please!!!! Did I blow out something?!!!!</p>

<br />Support will vary by manufacturer and since Microsoft indicated it will be ending support for Windows 10 Mobile, you might be experiencing signs of its early demise.

            Hi, Jtoots
<br />
<br />My name is Phillip and I am an Independent Advisor. I hope it helps.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode with network function to repair Windows.
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

            Hi JT.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try for sign-in failure so that at least something will work:
<br />
<br />First see the various troubleshooting steps here: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-10-account-password-from-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-w...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Next try enabling the Hidden Administrator account to log into and set up a new Local Administrative Account to sign-into, move files over and set up, using Option Five here:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>
<br />
<br />To do this you'll need to access a Command Prompt in repair mode using whichever method works here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  You can also try the option to System Restore.  If you don't have the password this may be limited to using the booted media.   
<br />
<br />If necessary you can  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options to try System Restore, or if that fails the Command Prompt to enable the Built-in Admin account .  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the Troubleshoot Options try a Reset, saving files.
<br />
<br />If this fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope having the full range of options helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello Jtoots,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try booting into Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />1. Start your Windows 10 machine, and quickly shut it down before it reaches or if it is at boot screen. Do this two times repeatedly.
<br />
<br />2. On the third time, Windows 10 will automatically display 'Your PC couldn't start properly' message. Now press Esc key for recovery options.
<br />
<br />3. Then under Choose an option screen, click Troubleshoot option and now click Advanced options option.
<br />
<br />4. Under Advanced options screen, click Startup Settings.
<br />
<br />5. In Startup Settings screen, you need to click Restart.
<br />
<br />6. After restart, press F4 or 4 to boot into Safe Mode.
<br />
<br />This will allow you to login as built-in administrator, then you can manage your system.
<br />
