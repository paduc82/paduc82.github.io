<h3> mr.xerves  say:</h3>
<h2>            WSOP &#58; Full House Pro</h2>
                    
<p><span>Just wondering why the game is the new arcade releases. I downloaded it, but I can't play &amp; I presume nobody else can since when I "Push A to Start" it says the WSOP : FULL HOUSE PRO service is not available please try again later". It is doing this
 since I downloaded this morning. Sucks, I was happy , been waiting a while for this to come out. Cheers !!!</span></p>
<p>P.S: It's been 24 hours, it's still doing the same thing but yet the game is still in the new releases &amp; I got no help or even an answer since I wrote my first message about this here.</p>

<p>Well, thank you for letting me know, I had a feeling it was something like that, seeing there was BETA written in the upper left corner of the main menu/title screen. Well,they better get around to it, its still on the marketplace in the new releases and
 its been well over 24 hours. Anyway,thanks agai &amp; may I ask where you got this info cuz I was looking all over the web to find out what was going on with this.</p>

<p>Well part of it is I'm also press. I sent out a few emails and the emails I got back is the game has yet to be released. So translating it would simply be that servers will not be turned on until a later date.</p>

 cannot find anything,&nbsp;&nbsp; MacAfee installed, up to date, multiple complete scan no viruses.&nbsp; Ran Malwarebyte multiple full scans - nothing.&nbsp; Kaspersky lab - nothing.&nbsp; Work IT guy ran a boot vrius detector and nothing.&nbsp; No error logs being generated.&nbsp; And both
 techies shut down various files in the task manager and NOTHING has made it stop.&nbsp; I was sent a reinstall XP SP3 disc from Dell and I did a complete XP repair with no fix. IT guy checked a bunch of stuff and thought it was "relate to a driver."&nbsp; Regardless
 of what is causing it,&nbsp;how do I find the problem and fix it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,

            @GarySibley:<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback, and I'm glad that you found it.&nbsp; Although I'm not surprised that an msiInstaller error might have caused a "Critical Stop" but I wouldn't have thought that it would continue issuing the error ever few seconds.<br />
<br />
@JudsonWelcher:<br />
<br />
I suggest that you also check your Event Viewer for msiinstaller errors.&nbsp; I've seen other posts where a "critical stop" sound seemed to be related to such errors (but as I said above, not to continuous repetitions of the error).<br />
<br />
<p>There's no easy way I know of to track down this sort of thing.&nbsp; Before you start the "Clean Boot" method or begin using Process Monitor, open the Sounds control panel applet and scroll through to check that Windows XP Critical Stop.wav
 has not been assigned to some event in addition to (or in place of) an actual Windows Critical Stop.<br />

<h2>            Where do I get the drivers for HP PSC 2105 All-in-One Printer&#63;</h2>
                    Question on Windows 7 64-bits home edition.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Due to an unsuccessful attempt to get be the "good old" 32 bits scanning utilities I lost (uninstalled?) the printer drivers for HP PSC 2105 and other members of the HP PSC family. Does anyone know how to get it back?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I see:</div>
<div>- If connect the printer, it is recognized, but becomes a scanning device only, not a printer</div>
<div>- If I manually install a printer and look at the list of HP devices, a whole lot of PSC drivers are missing (I compared with another Win 7 home machine)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance</div>

<h2>            Help&#33; Merged 3D Objects and user profile while moving items from SDD to HDD</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just got a new machine and this is the first laptop I've owned which has two separate hard drives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system was installed on the SDD (which is small... only ~125gb) and I wanted to move the user profiles over to the HDD to free up as much space as possible for games etc as I think these benefit more from being on the SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stupidly, I didn't properly look up what I was doing and managed to merge my user profile with my 3D objects folder...While I have now moved a lot of my folders successfully over to the HDD, the 3D objects is now called 'Max_T' and is stuck on the C: Drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, can you help me restore this 3D Objects folder to its original state and then help me move it over to the D: Drive?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried following this guidance... And I've moved my desktop over to the D: Drive....But it hasn't fixed the issue with 3D objects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone can help! I've attached a couple of screenshots in the hope that this might help my explanation. If you need any more info please let me know!<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/11df970b-6ffa-45a2-ae7e-19a936a41844?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/11df970b-6ffa-45a2-ae7e-19a936a41844?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ecfe3c47-1d60-4c80-8551-faf15ab487fe?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ecfe3c47-1d60-4c80-8551-faf15ab487fe?upload=true" /></a></p>

            Hi Max
<br />
<br />This is a fairly common error and will require a registry fix . . .
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Click View and make sure 'Address Bar' is turned on
<br />
<br />Paste this into the Address Bar at the top and hit Enter
<br />
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of the resulting Registry Editor window . . .

            Hi MaxT2593
<br />
<br />
<br />Open Regedit again, it should still be on the same page
<br />
<br />Double Click this item at the top:
<br />
<br />{31C0DD25-9439-4F12-BF41-7FF4EDA38722}
<br />
<br />Set its value data to D:\Users\Max_T\3D Objects
<br />
<br />Click OK and close the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Restart your PC
<br />
<br />That will have split those folders and moved the 3D Objects folder to D:\Users\Max_T\3D Objects and should have rectified this for you . . .

 as you said and seems to have somewhat improved the situation...However, the 3D objects folder now appears to exist in my shortcuts but not actually exist... Any ideas?

            Hi MaxT
<br />
<br />That is no problem . . .
<br />
<br />In Windows File Explorer, navigate to  D:\Users\Max_T
<br />
<br />Create a new folder in there called 3D Objects 
<br />
<br />Then restart your PC . .. 
<br />
<br />If you did have any 3D objects in your folder, you may need to manually move them from your user folder into that 3D Objects folder . . .

            This is probably a really dumb question... What kind of files should be in 3D Objects? I may have moved items out elsewhere but unsure.

<h2>            Miracast not working after recent upgrade - 12&#47;30&#47;18</h2>
                    <p>I have a <a href="https://www.netgear.com/home/products/connected-entertainment/wireless-display-adapters/PTV3000.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Netgear PTV3000</a>&nbsp;wireless display adapter that has worked flawlessly since Windows 10.&nbsp; After the recent upgrade (12/30/18), it connects quickly as usual, but now there is no picture or sound.&nbsp; The screen is just black - but I can see the mouse moving across
 the screen.&nbsp; It does this when duplicating and/or extending the monitors.&nbsp; On my other computer which hasn't been restarted yet since it isn't used often, it still works as normal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There clearly has been upgrades made in this new version of Windows because I now have this bar that was never present before:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44e8215c-107a-441f-bd78-7195b9650d13?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44e8215c-107a-441f-bd78-7195b9650d13?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see that it is connected and this shows that it is even recognizing multiple monitors:</p>

<p>Here is the info on the version that I am on:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Anyone else experiencing similar issues?&nbsp; I have looked at lots of forum posts, but those are from 2-3 years ago when it was Windows 8 and WiDi was spotty.&nbsp; Nothing recent, but again, this just started yesterday after the most recent upgrade.&nbsp; I have removed
 the device and added it back - same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help or suggestions.</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>

<p>Hi Naveen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your assistance.&nbsp; I am on the latest firmware.&nbsp; I downloaded the other file from Intel, but wasn't successful in installing and got the following error.&nbsp; Additionally, since Windows 10, the Connect function worked without needing any Intel software.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Same result when doing second screen only - I can see the cursor moving on the screen, but that's it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Toshiba IdeaPad Z580.&nbsp; Model number 20135.&nbsp; I have reviewed those troubleshooting links previously.&nbsp; Doesn't help in this situation unfortunately.</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked the compatibility of the laptop and I see that there are no drivers available for Windows 10 for the product that you are using from the

system manufacturer site</a>. The drivers are available only for Windows XP, 7, 8, and 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also see that the PTV300 firmware supports Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 and not Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd suggest you to refer this article on <a href="https://kb.netgear.com/23982/PTV3000-Firmware-Version-2-4-26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    <p>I've had my laptop repaired after water damage. They've fix various things appeartley but say that the hard drive also needs to be replaced.
</p>
<p>In the quote for the repairs is a fee for installing Windows but can't I just reinstall with the windows key I have from when I originally paid for it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Laptop was dead for over a year so it would have expired some time ago and wasn't renewed but does that matter?</p>
<p>Can't I just reinstall and renew without having to pay for a new windows system?</p>

            Good day! I apologize that you are having this issue and I am hoping we can work through it and fix it.
<br />
<br />You likely do not need to purchase another product key or spend any money! You can look here for more info: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4000735/windows-10-reinstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/400073...</a>
<br />
<br />just click "You likely don't need a product key" and look for all the info there! 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!

            You need not pay for a new Windows license. If you had your Windows 10 license activated previously, you got a digital license. You will never need the product key again once you get digital license. Since, you have a digital license, hence when you do clean install, the license information is automatically picked up from Microsoft activation servers. Windows will activate your Windows license from this information.
<br />
<br />Make sure the version installed is same as it was previous. For example, if it was Windows 10 Home, you need to install Windows 10 Home only not Windows 10 Pro. If at any point during installation it asks for the key, choose you will do it later on / skip.
<br />
<br />A new Windows license may be required if motherboard is also changed and Windows license was OEM. In case of Retail, the new license is not required.

            Hi Vee1, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, you will not need a product key, activation will be automatic and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

    <title>After switching user using Fast Switch, my USB wireless mouse and USB - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iwillrockyou7  say:</h3>
<h2>            After switching user using Fast Switch, my USB wireless mouse and USB wired keyboard stop working or responding.</h2>
                    <p>After using the Username switch feature under "Sign Out" in Windows 8, my Microsoft Sidewinder X4 USB Wired keyboard and Logitech M235 wireless mouse both stop working and responding, making me unable to type a password for the new user account, or use onscreen
 keyboard. I also cannot click the restart button due to this problem, meaning I need to push the main power button on my PC case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using the USB 3.0 port for the mouse, and a USB 2.0 port for the keyboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, when using a Gigabyte Force M9 Laser Wireless mouse, the cursor will lag and sometimes not respond, whether I am browsing on Internet Explorer, playing League of Legends, or using Microsoft Office. I believe this is not a driver problem as I have uninstalled
 and reinstalled the driver for the mouse and keyboard several times while trying to fix this problem.</p>

            Hi Bilyana.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> I'll give you everything possible to try for sign-in failure so that at least something will work:
<br />
<br />First see the various troubleshooting steps here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-10-account-password-from-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-w...</a>
<br />
<br />This could also be due to account corruption so see the fixes here:
<br /><a href="https://www.techbout.com/fix-corrupt-user-profile-windows-10-9139/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techbout.com/fix-corrupt-user-profi...</a>
<br /> 
<br />To access another account to try to fix corruption, or create a new Admin account to replace a corrupted account, see these steps to enable the hidden Built-in Administrator used for emergencies like this.  First try whichever method works here:  
<br />
<br />If it blocks these by requiring a password, then first see this tutorial for enabling Built-in Admin from Log-in Screen.  <a href="https://www.isumsoft.com/it/enable-hidden-administrator-account-in-windows-10-without-login/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isumsoft.com/it/enable-hidden-admin...</a>
<br />
<br />It may also be necessary to create bootable media to access Command Prompt at boot to use Option Five to enable Built-in Administrator,  or to Reset or do the Clean install:<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then Command Prompt to attempt enabling Built-in Administrator.  
<br />
<br />Restart PC, Sign into new Admin account, elevate the desired account by typing netplwiz in Start Search, opening the wizard, highlight desired account (tick box if necessary first), then under Properties &gt; Group Membership, change to Administrator. Save that and then if desired highlight and remove the old Admin account.
<br />
<br />If these fail then create a new Admin Account to sign into and test, move your files over and when ready delete the old account:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki</a>.... It is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>ASP.NET Machine Account Now On Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adriano b b  say:</h3>
<h2>            ASP.NET Machine Account Now On Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My brothers laptop has been recently updated from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 and it got the ASP.NET Machine Account issue after that update. As stated before by other folks:<br />
<br />
- Anything you try to do on your computer will trigger a window asking for the password for that user, and that is for anything, e.g.: trying to create a shortcut on your desktop area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to delete the account wont work either, as it will ask for the password for the&nbsp;ASP.NET Machine Account user, which as stated before now has admin rights, and the real human user does not anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very frustrating to check the web and see that this is not a new issue. It actually had been solved for Windows XP if I recall from some sites, and yet, it is still appearing on the new Windows versions. That really does not make sense!!!<br />
<br />
Appreciate any help at this point, as this might also help others who are facing the same problem.</p>

</p><p><span>Hello Vanessa! First I would like to thank you for your quick reply. Vanessa, before I posted into this forum I searched the web extensively trying to solve the issue on my own. I have knowledge of what the .NET Framework
 is and I had already tried the two steps you provided but again, no luck!</span><br />
<br />
<span>The reason it is so frustrating as I stated before is that:</span><br />
<br />
<span>- The .NET Framework created this&nbsp;<a href="http://asp.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ASP.NET</a>&nbsp;Machine Account and gave it a password which we (users) do not have, since we did not create it.</span><br />
<br />
<span>- Now, when you try to access the&nbsp;</span><strong>Local Users and Groups</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;node
 for your Method 1, it simply isnt there. Theres no list of users so that we could select the ASP.NET Machine Account user.<br />

- For Method 2, when you access the Registry Editor and try to create&nbsp;</span><strong><span><span>SpecialAccounts</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>Userlist</span>&nbsp;keys</span></strong><span>, an error message pops up:<br />
<br />
</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b6553b0e-5203-4cb3-bbbb-0dc84a629b5e" /><span><br />
<br />
&nbsp;My brothers pc is in brazilian portuguese. Translating ---&gt;</span><span>&nbsp;That message says:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Error creating value<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is not possible to create that value: error trying to record on Registry.<br />
<br />
Again, thank you and I hope someone could come up with a solution other then restoring the machine to factory settings.</span></p>

<h3> coleyeliz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blinking hourglass on Windows 10</h2>
                    I upgraded to Windows 10 yesterday on my HP laptop. All seemed well. Shut down the computer last night and turned on this am and I now have a blinking hourglass next to my arrow cursor. I am able to click items, but cannot right click because the box refreshes
 too soon. Not sure what is happening but it's really obnoxious. I can't seem to find what is causing this in the task manager. Thanks for the help!

            CSanders09, I did a system restore on my computer to just before two "critical updates" that were installed last night on mine about 3 hours after I upgraded to Windows 10 and that seemed to fix the problem for now. I have yet to restart my computer though
 and I obviously do not have those 2 critical updates on board anymore. But at least I can right click and choose items in drop down boxes. Wish I would have waited longer to get Win10. Hopefully the problem doesn't keep coming back.

            Tried the clean boot below to no avail. I didn't try the simple pass as I don't use it . BUT&nbsp;I just tried a solution from another Microsoft Community page&nbsp;suggestion.&nbsp; They related it to an HP Officejet Pro 8600 driver.&nbsp; I reinstalled mine (same computer)
 - just selected " install new Bluetooth printer" - went through the 3 step process &amp; it seems to have fixed the issue! (in that it was constantly searching for the connection) AND as suggested, "check ink levels only when printing" (altho I think this was
 already set as such) - Will let you know if the problem resurfaces after I go through shutdown &amp; get home to&nbsp;restart the computer.

<h2>            Cloud not available to everyone&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Just upgraded to Gold in order to take advantage of the storage using the cloud. AFTER upgrading and trying enable cloud services, I get a message that says, "Cloud storage is not available to everyone". So I upgraded for no reason? Can someone help please?
 Thx!</p>

<p>I believe that your console must have at least 514MB of storage free as the cloud service stores a local copy as well. You should check that you have some storage space left, if you don't hopefully removing unused items could fix this.</p>
<p>Also, here is a quote from&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-360/games/cloud-save-troubleshoot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-360/games/cloud-save-troubleshoot</a>&nbsp;-</p>

<p><b>Can't enable cloud storage just yet</b></p>
<p>If you get this message, here's what to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the Xbox Dashboard, go to&nbsp;<b>settings</b>&nbsp;and then select&nbsp;<b>System</b>.
</li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Storage</b>, and then select your primary storage device (for example,&nbsp;<b>Hard Drive</b>).

            Hola Jesus! 
<br />
<br />Soy Saylis, Asesora Independiente y me complacera mucho poder ayudarle con su problema. Vamos a trabajar en conjunto y lo resolveremos. 
<br />
<br />Teniendo en cuenta la experiencia recibida en actualizaciones anteriores, la descarga e instalacin a travs de Actualizaciones automticas de Windows Update suele traer problemas a muchos usuarios, bien sea por cortes en la conexin, por conexiones lentas o medidas o por cualquier otro motivo durante el proceso.
<br />
<br />Para intentar solucionar estos problemas y conseguir que se instale sin errores, vamos a ver cmo se puede hacer la instalacin mediante una imagen ISO proporcionada por Microsoft. Se trata de actualizar el sistema utilizando un medio de instalacin en soporte DVD, o en una unidad flash USB, que contenga la imagen de Windows 10, versin 1809 (compilacin 17763).
<br />
<br />Para llevar a cabo esta opcin siga el paso a paso que expone Enric Corts (Autor de Artculos de la Comunidad |  Moderador de la Comunidad) en el siguiente enlace:

<br />
<br />NOTA (del autor): Antes de proceder a la actualizacin, es recomendable tomar ciertas precauciones que pueden evitarte problemas o errores inesperados
<br />
<br />Le agradecera que lo checara y me comente si resuelve su problema, caso contrario nos mantenemos en contacto para llegar a la solucin.
<br />
<br />Reciba un atento saludo. Tenga un bonito da!

    <title>Is OneDrive messing with File Explorer and how do I get rid of it&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobbychariot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is OneDrive messing with File Explorer and how do I get rid of it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I signed up to OneDrive several weeks ago but quickly found it was not for me: it appeared to create folders with identical names to existing folders (Documents, Desktop, Pictures, etc) within my user folder; and the location of files suddenly became unpredictable:
 some I found in folders within OneDrive, others in folders within my user folder. After much trial and error I uninstalled OneDrive (or so I thought) and reorganised my stuff (or so I thought) back to the way it was before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a relatively new Windows user I'm still finding my way around and today I tried to locate a document using File Explorer and found that the Documents folder was empty. Then I noticed that there were two Documents folders: one in This PC and one within
 my user folder, ie OS (C:) &gt; Users &gt; Me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although This PC contains folders with the same names as some of those within my user folder, they don't always have the same contents: for example, the Desktop folders in each have identical contents but while the Documents folder inside my user folder
 contains hundreds of files and folders, the Documents folder in This PC contains just one. What's more, its location is within a third Documents folder, within a OneDrive folder, within my user folder (see screen grab below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've posted this in search of two solutions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I really, really want to see the back of OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I don't understand the point of This PC in File Explorer when everything I want to find is within my user folder. Is there a way of "disappearing" it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><p>This PC / Documents, Pictures, Videos, Music folders - are actually mirror's of your C;\users\myName\Documents...etc folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive has the options, not sure if set default or not, to include all things in Documents and Pictures and desktop too, in your default users folders.</p>

<h2>            Computer booting to backlit screen, no cursor</h2>
                    <p>I am having an issue with my HP laptop. the computer is booting up and the fans are coming on. But there is just a backlit screen. Kind of like it is projecting to a second monitor that is not there.</p>
<p>I have attached cables to all external display ports and tried to WIN+SHIFT+direction without luck.
</p>
<p>I have not seen something like this before as I can WIN+B on startup and the restoring BIOS screen does actually display on the screen. Also hitting ALT+CTRL+DLT will make the screen go black for a moment like it is also displaying the task manager on another
 monitor. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what to do here. tried booting to a USB device but cannot see anything on the display.&nbsp;<br />
