    <title>Blue Screen of Death Every Startup - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Blue Screen of Death Every Startup</h2>
                    So my HP Tower PC was working fine but since I last turned it on I get a Blue screen of death saying system_thread_exception_not_handled. It turns the computer off and back on, the same thing happens. It asks me if I wanted to restore but I did not so
 I cancelled and did a hard restart. I turned it back on and the same thing happened with the looping BSOD so I decided to restore. Now the computer is just stuck on a black screen with the infuriating HP logo just laughing at me. I haven't upgraded to windows
 10 recently not have I been asked to complete an update for said operating system. The only thing installed was kaspersky total security after having bought a new disc for it and removing kaspersky internet security from the computer in the program management
 area. The computer has shut down and turned back on fine after installing the anti-virus for about a week. This happened out of the blue so I have no idea what to do but wait and see if this screen does anything. Don't ask me to

            It doesn't matter now, the computer was restored since I gave up on trying to follow tutorials to get into safe mode which were failing for some reason. Of the two major problems that I have had on this computer, both occurred while in Windows 10 so I
 can't say that I am happy with this OS.

            So, the same problem happened again, I decided to continue my search for this problem and the only information I got that was relevant was that the problem could be due to old drivers. I had to restore the computer again and I have gone to device management
 and updated the drivers using the search automatically function for every driver listed in that window. The computer seems (and I stress the word "seems") to be functioning fine now. Do you think updating my drivers has fixed the problem based on anyone's
 experience who bothers to reply? This all happened after I installed kaspersky total security since my license for the Internet version ran out so I purchased the seemingly better version from a reputable shop. This never happened with my old anti virus and
 I refuse to believe that it is this anti virus by the same company causing a new problem. P.s if you need information from my comp please give a moderately detailed explanation on how to get it since I'm not that good with computers.

i understand that without the DMP files you are just guessing. It doesn't matter whether you do it or not, I wasn't asking for you specifically to guess my problem I meant for anyone who would like to take their time and give me any possible causes based on
 their experiences or understanding. I am the one with the problem so whether or not it's something you don't do, it doesn't matter, don't reply if it's something you don't do. This might be trivial for you, but for me it isn't, so finding a reply telling me
 that you don't do it and that I should just "live with it" seeing as how I looked at your tutorial and I cannot get my DMP files since the BSOD occurs in safe mode if the computer itself actually wants to go into safe mode despite me following instructions
 for it. I just felt bad reading that reply since you went out of your way to say that you won't help me with what I was asking for since it's something you don't do.

<p><span><span><span>True&nbsp;Widows Media Player will not play .MOV files. However, there are some codecs or third party software/converter that

<h2>            Unable to sign in to my Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>Some time ago I started receiving messages every time I open my email account which tell me someone else may be using my Microsoft Account .</p>
<p>I follow instructions to reset it signing in with my email and password. &nbsp;It then says to enter my email address again and they will send me a code if it matches the address on file. &nbsp;I never get a code. &nbsp;So I am unable to use my Skype, lost my balance of
 money and unable to sort out the Microsoft Account problem. &nbsp;Just to wind me up further I still get the message that someone else may be using my account every time i open my email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't access the "talk to a person" facility on Skype because of the micrs. Acct problem so am unable to get any official help.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f00ec1b0-bc9b-4d4a-81ce-1104737cbf07" title="PeterMarksZF">
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The interrupting message "It looks like someone else is using the account" usually is appearing if the system noticed that the account has been logged in to an unfamiliar device or location. And this is a Microsoft feature to make sure that only the account
 owners can access their accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not receiving any Microsoft verification code, it can be because of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You misspelled your email address. Make sure you are typing your email address correctly.</li><li>The email has been moved to the spam or trash folder.</li><li>Your email provider is blocking the message. Please check your blocked senders' list and remove any Microsoft hosted email from there.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you can fill out the <strong>Recover your Microsoft Account</strong> form which can help you prove that you're the owner of the account.&nbsp;You can start filling the form out using&nbsp;this link:

    <title>restoring the security permissions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> axelsharma  say:</h3>
<h2>            restoring the security permissions</h2>
                    I just upgraded to windows 10 form windows 7. I&nbsp;had to access the folder "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps" which is the default install location of apps downloaded via store. I was denied the access and hence took the ownership to my acc, which is an administrator
 account. <br />
Previous owner of the folder was 'Trustedinstaller'. Once my work was done there, I tried to get the permissions back to it's initial state. changed it to 'read and execute only' applied, which gave a failed message. I ignored the message, took the ownership
 back. Now the apps wouldn't open. Can I get the permissions back to default? As my PC is upgraded, seems like I'll have to re-install all the apps back from windows 7 which is very inconvenient. &nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi Jessen,<br />
Thanks for your response, but I had to perform a windows restore. It's all running smooth except for the part that 'VlC for windows store' app keeps closing or freezing. Could it be due to previous issue?
<br />
Thanks.

            <p>Hello Billion,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've followed your suggestion, but unfortunately the problem persists.</p>
<p>Either in Ascending or Descending, folders are not displayed before the other file types.</p>

            <p>As I understand it, there is a registry modification for this, changing the folder type to [Folder] instead of some shell filetype, but I cannot remember how, which is annoying. I had this fixed before I upgraded to Win10, and now I can't remember how I
 did it, nor can I find the page that details the registry hack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Aha! Found it in the registry on my own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, before editing the registry for even trivial things, it's a good idea to back up the registry to be safe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, make sure you have administrative access, then run regedit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, Go to HKCR\Directory. Find the Friendly Type Name key. Change the value there from @shell32.dll,-10152 to [Folder]. Click ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fourth, Restart Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fifth, Enjoy your folders grouping above the other file types.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT 2: You may need to log out and back in again, actually</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I haven't been able to update my Windows Vista for over a year now. There's 96 updates I need to install.</p>
<p>When I try to install them it doesn't download the updates and gives me the error 80246008. Following the help file, when I go into Administrative Tools, double click on services, there is no Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS)" to click on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible I&nbsp;unintentionally&nbsp;uninstalled&nbsp;this long ago? How do I get it back? I assumed I can't update because it is missing.</p>
<p>Info:</p>
<p>Microsoft Windows Vista Home Basic</p>
<p>6.0.6001 Service Pack 1 Build 6001</p>
<p>Toshiba Satellite A135</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks you in advance</p>

<h2>            Installed Windows Without Internet&#59; What Do I Need to Download Now&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've just installed a fresh copy of windows onto a new PC I'd built; I didn't have any internet access though, and I had to skip a parts the setup process which required internet access. Before I skipped the step the setup told me that by connecting to internet
 then, which I couldn't, would allow them to automatically download/do things and save whereas I didn't I'd have to do that manually in my own time. Could someone please tell me what steps or programs/drivers I have to now do/download manually now that I have
 internet access? Also, do I need to sign into my Microsoft account to complete certain steps.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

            Hi Mr
<br />
<br />If you installed Windows 10 Offline, you will need to go to the Support Page for your Device to download and install a full set of device Drivers to get your network card, Display Adapter . . . .etc. working correctly
<br />
<br />Since you built that PC, you will need to visit the website of the individual components (Motherboard, graphics card, WiFi card . .. etc.) to find those drivers.
<br />
<br />If you want to use a Microsoft Account to log into your PC you will need to connect to that online. Also you will need to activate Windows 10 if that is not already done . . .

<p>normally lan adapter drivers are built in windows and wifi too.&nbsp; if you dont have drivers means, use Your mobile phone, go the manufacturer website, download the drivers for your computer model&nbsp;</p>
<p>copy the drivers to computer, and then install with admin rights</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I install with no internet frequently...</p>
<p>Windows 10 will automatically start downloading pretty much everything that it could not during the installation as soon as you have a internet connection..</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might need to download some drivers from the motherboard manufacturer for your model... It may have come with a CD, but their website would probably have newer versions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look in Device Manager for anything with a yellow triangle...</p>
<p>There are some things for which you may not even know you need a driver until you try to use it and it doesn't work quite right...</p>
<p>
</p><p>An example... My Intel USB 3.0 only runs at USB 2.0 speed until I install the latest Chipset (inf) driver... This is despite the fact that it already has one.</p>
<p>Even upgrading a working version of Windows 10 to a newer build will require installing the driver... Microsoft is not getting this right for some reason...</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>have you bought and used this number? or just selected it and didn't buy? if you haven't bought it, or it expired more than 3 months ago, you won't be able to reactivate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possibility is that you are logging into a wrong account. Please check you log in to the same account that you have used to buy the number. You can also try to go to the Skype application you used to receive calls to that number and in menu select
 "My account", it should open web browser with your account logged in.</p>

                    <p>I want to try this DvD player out, to see if it works on my PC, but on the store there is no option to have a free trial, only for me to buy it.</p>
<p>How come?</p>
<p>My laptop that shares the same Microsoft account says I can have the trial, when I checked, but ultimately, I want it on my computer as I no longer use this laptop.</p>

            Hello, I see that you are having some trouble getting the free trial version of Windows. First of all, you will need to create a Media Creation Tool and burn it into a DVD or make a bootable USB. More on that here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a><br />Boot into your USB or DVD, then keep following the steps until you hit the Enter Product Key section. On the bottom, there should be a Skip this Step option. Continue and it should boot into Windows in Free Trial version. Hope this helps!

            Have you already had a trial of the Windows DVD player on that PC? If so this is why it’s not available.
<br />In any case the DVD player is poor, many recommend VLC media player &amp; it’s free:

            Now that you mention it, I think I may have tried It out, when I first got this computer, but it has since had a new hard drive put in it and when that happened I lost everything I had on it. If that may have something to do with it.&nbsp;

            Yes, your Microsoft account would remember the trial so wouldn’t allow you to retry the DVD app.
<br />Your only option would be to purchase it but as I previously mentioned the app isn’t well recommended by those who’ve tried/bought it.

    <title>Factory reset after shrink volume - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> onthebeach500  say:</h3>
<h2>            Factory reset after shrink volume</h2>
                    I have a new Acer PC with 1 TB HDD<br />
C:\ is currently 930 Gb (only 30 Gb used)<br />
There is a hidden partition with factory reset files.<br />
My questions: If&nbsp; I shrink C:\ to say, 100 Gb will a future factory reset still work ok?<br />
I intend to make a new partition - would this disappear after a future factory reset?<br />

Many Thanks

            <p>Factory reset will make it as when you took it out of the box so yea all will be undone.</p>
<p>You could instead use a system image after you get things setup and use that to restore your newer settings and setup</p>

            This might be due to some malware or unclean Windows installation, try downloading an anti-malware application and see if your problem is gone, if not, try to rest windows to factory&nbsp;settings.

<h2>            battery not recognized by Windows</h2>
                    I have Windows 8 installed as a dual boot system with Windows 7. In windows 8, It does not recognize that I am using a laptop or that there is a battery. I have forced it to recognize it by unplugging the AC adapter and scanning for hardware changes in
 device manager, but doing this every time is getting old. I got a blue screen when I closed my laptop and then opened it, probably cause it didn't know what was happening. Any ideas on how to fix this?

            <p>Hi ShawnMunkvold, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>​</p>
<p>- What is the make and model number of the computer?<br />
<br />
<strong>Perform</strong><strong> a hard reset: </strong></p>
<p>Performing a hard reset erases all of the information that is stored in the temporary memory and forces Windows to do a complete scan of the system, including the battery.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong>To perform a hard reset, follow the steps below.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div>Unplug the AC adapter from the notebook PC and remove the PC from any port replicator or docking station.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Remove the battery from the notebook battery compartment.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Press and hold down the power button for about 15 seconds to drain any residual electrical charge from the capacitors.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Once started, insert the battery and plug the AC adapter back into the notebook PC.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Press the power button to turn on the notebook PC.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Use the arrow keys to highlight <b>Start Windows Normally</b>, if it is not already highlighted, and then press the enter key.</div>
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Reset the BIOS to defualt, after reset try updating the BIOS.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope it helps. If you have any issues in future please let us know. We will be happy to help you.</span></p>
