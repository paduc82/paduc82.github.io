    <title>Skype help with viewing other&#39;s presentations - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype help with viewing other&#39;s presentations</h2>
                    <p>Thinking this may have to do with my monitoring setting, but it may be Skype. When some presenters share in Skype, I see a black screen with a white line outlining where I should be able to view the presenters screen but can't. I can see the participants,
 buttons to share, record, mute, etc.</p>
<p>In the same Skype session, someone else will share their screen and I can view it. Any suggestions for how to resolve?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p />

    <title>File Explorer - Quick Access - Very Slow to Open - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            File Explorer - Quick Access - Very Slow to Open</h2>
                    <p>I've searched through all of these examples, but have yet to find a good answer that actually resolves the issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files-winpc/windows-10-file-explorer-not-responding/60cc0e18-942a-427f-a1b8-31cd33d2cabf</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone through this old locked thread, and followed the steps, but have not seen any fix actually work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open File Explorer - Quick Access opens very slowly, "working on it..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>After waiting some time it does open but it's definitely not "quick access".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can right-click on Quick Access and click on options.&nbsp; Then Clear File Explorer history and uncheck one of two boxes for Privacy to show files and/or folders.&nbsp; This works for a little bit, until the user starts opening more files and folders.&nbsp; It seems
 to be attached to how large the folder or file is as to how long it takes Quick Access to open up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>from Johnober:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click Start and select Command Prompt (admin).</li><li>Type PowerShell and press enter to open it.</li><li>Copy and paste the below script.<br />
<br />
Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}<br />
</li><li>Wait for the Powershell to complete the process. This could take about 10 minutes and at times may look like it stalled. Just continue to let it run. You may see a number of errors reported, especially at the end when the script has completed running.
 Ignore any errors displayed in the window.</li><li>Close the Command Prompt window. The problem should be fixed.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>It did install some stuff, but have yet to test and see if this fixed any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have gone through PaulSey's advice and his link to a fix.&nbsp; Nothing from that has resolved the issue.&nbsp; Clean boot, DISM and sfc /scannow usually do not fix much of anything.&nbsp; I've yet for "self-healing" of Windows to work for any issues.&nbsp; It seems to be
 something inherent with Windows and not something these fixes would see as something to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice to get a good patch that would resolve this issue in a Windows Build fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone found anything that would fix the Quick Access issue?</p>

<p>No this was before the cumulative update from yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got Privacy for QA turned off and File Explorer loads fine.&nbsp; Cleared cache and no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Files pinned to QA will mostly be network-based files, which is probably part of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run DISM and /sfc scannow.&nbsp; They didn't fix anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's currently fixed with QA - Privacy turned completely off, but it should not have to run like this.&nbsp; Have several users that have had this issue and clearing QA cache seems to help for a while until they open a file that might cause QA to have issues.&nbsp;
 Most files are Excel files.</p>

<p>Well I have not heard of and have worked on 100's of PC's With Windows 10 and never seen this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is either corruption in your system or some issue. Opening up QA is only a folder holding shortcuts to others. The only thing that could even be a remote possibility as in a pinned item in QA causing this would be a pinned item that came off of another
 PC's shared items in the network. But then I doubt that because you are not trying to access it. it is only displaying in the QA folder when you open the QA folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this:</p>
<p>unpin all in QA</p>
<p>delete the privacy cache</p>
<p>Unpin File explorer/QA from taskbar</p>
<p>restart PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to C:\Windows</p>
<p>find Explorer towards bottom</p>
<p>right click and Pin to taskbar</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pin your items back in QA</p>
<p>restart pc</p>

<p>
</p><p>For your last question - It seems that once QA loads I can click on other folders and move around fine.&nbsp; Just that initial open-up with QA.&nbsp; But will test, it's a difficult user to get access to her machine, but will let you know what I find out.&nbsp; Thanks
 very much for your time and attention to this one.</p>

<p>Interesting that this issue has suddenly happened to five (5) separate users in just the past 2-3 weeks.&nbsp; Commonality seems to be laptops so far as no desktop users have reported the issue.&nbsp; Quick Access is affected with the "Working on it..." and is non-responsive
 even after several minutes.&nbsp; Changing the open option to "This PC" resolves the File Explorer opening issue but this is really just a workaround as far as I'm concerned.&nbsp; Users are able to open recent files/folders from the right click menu even when the Quick
 Access option is active for File Explorer just not File Explorer itself.&nbsp; If this was just a one off or even two off situation, I could understand, but this is too many, too close together to be a coincidence.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth quality issues, any advice is welcome</h2>
                    <p>I am dissatisfied with the sound quality from my Odyssey HMD. When I attempted to use my PowerBeats3 wireless headphones, the sound was (of course) awesome but kept breaking up. It doesn't matter if my Bluetooth controllers are on or not, it continues to
 happen. I am using a&nbsp;Wavlink Nano Wireless Bluetooth CSR 4.0 Dongle Adapter. Do I need a better USB adapter?</p>
<p>As the title says, I apricate any advice... Thank you&nbsp;</p>

            Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  <br /><br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.<br /><br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  <br /><br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.<br /><br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  <br /><br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hid

<p>I've tried several of your suggestions, but nothing has helped. I got the Bluetooth dongle just to operate the left &amp; right controllers for the Odyssey HMD Windows Mixed Reality. I have been impressed with the visual aspects of the HMD,
 but not the audio. I have contacted Samsung about removing the speakers so I could use my KAVE 5.1 surround headset, however their engineers didn't design it with that much foresight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having a PoweredBeats3 wireless headset for my phone, I thought "why not see if I can make that work with the HMD." and it does. But the sound cuts in and out.</p>
<p>Also, been doing some testing. Tried playing music - sounded awesome with no problems. While playing music, turned on the controllers (leaving the HMD off) and it started breaking up. So I'm thinking it's just to much traffic across that
 USB dongle. Some info I found about the dongle (Bluetooth Version: 4.0 with EDR - data transfer rate up to 3Mbps). I'm thinking that might be the issue. More info found here&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA6PF4837790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA6PF4837790.</span></a></p>

            <p>Greetings!<br />As Onyx mentioned, there's always a good start, to talk with the IT depertment of your school and ask them if the firewall has any rule restrictions regarding port 3074, for Xbox traffic.<br /><br />If you have a third-party firewall installed on your computer, disable this and use Windows firewall instead.<br /><br />[quote user="Tahrigady"]I also wanted to add that in order for me to access the schools wifi, an ID/password is needed.

<li>Confirm which build is currently installed on your device. To check, follow the steps below:</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Press <em><strong>Windows key + R</strong></em>, then type in <em><strong>winver</strong></em>.</li><li>Click <em><strong>OK.</strong></em></li></ol>
<ul>
<li>What is the VPN client that you're using?</li><li>Are you using any third-party antivirus? If yes, try to disable it and then install the TAP driver.</li></ul>

<p>I'm having this exact issue, and I've already tried disabling my antivirus. I'm running 1803 and trying to connect using PIA, if it matters
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Interesting, I guess you can disregard that. amough, try restarting your computer and see if that fixes it, for some reason it kept stopping the install and showed the driver was broken in Device Manager, but after rebooting everything was fine</p>

            <p>PXE (Preboot Execution Environment) is a micro operating system built into the network card. It allows the card to request and accept an IP address issued by the network and then ask for any server that has an operating system available to boot its host
 computer. It allows computers that have no operating system internally to boot from a network server. This is very specialised and seldom seen outside large networks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PXE is one of the possible devices a computer can start from such as Floppy, Optical disk, USB Flash drive or the hard disk. The boot order is the set list of which devices will be tried in sequence. As each one in the list fails it moves onto the next.
 So FDD &gt; CD &gt; USB &gt;HDD &gt; PXE would mean that normally the 1st 3 would try and fail before booting from the hard disk</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two reasons why PXE would appear. The order gets mixed up so PXE is tried before the HDD, it times out because there is no server or as on your case the LAN card has no cable. Then it would go onto the HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively the HDD times out so it moves on to the next device. You are right to be concerned because this is more than just corrupt Windows. In that case the drive accepts the boot so it would not step on to PXE but would generate either file corruption
 messages or "Missing Operating System"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "A disk read error occurred" indicates it cannot read the boot sector itself. Hopefully that is all that is a problem but it could be more serious. Normally the next option would be to boot from Windows media and attempt a repair but that involves making
 changes to the disk which MIGHT compromise recovering files if they are important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend making no changes to the disk, instead remove it from the computer. Use a USB adapter to plug it into another PC and see what can be read, that may give you the opportunity to recover important files before anything else is tried.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are normally 3 possible&nbsp;reasons for that error you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. BIOS Boot Order set to Boot to Network: Check BIOS settings for Boot Order.</p>
<p>2. <span>Check cable connections between Motherboard and Hard Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Failed Hard Drive.</span></p>

<h2>            Touchpad gestures and three or two fingers for middle click option missing in windows 10...&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My laptop is a Samsung NP300V4, first I had problems with the touchpad and FN doesn't working but I install an old driver and then let windows to update and no it works correctly with:&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d5ac0c5e-2b5a-4ac5-ac77-8703b86fca94" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the basic functions are working (two finger scrolling, tapping etc) , FN are also working but with Windows 8.1 I used two fingers tap to simulate a mouse middle click in my browser so open new tabs was very fast and easy to navigate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now with Windows 10, this option is not available, just three fingers tap to open cortana (that isn't available in my country!) and two fingers to right click.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the three fingers gestures aren't working to swipe left/right, just the swipe down lot see open apps/programms or swipe up to open file explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>How can I make my three finger tap to work as a mouse middle click?</li><li>How can I enable three finger gestures?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I too am having this issue, I looked through all of windows settings and the only thing I could assign a three finger tap to was the action center, search with cortana, and nothing. I know this isn't really a practical fix, and I honestly hate having to
 do this while using my touchpad, but it definitely beats right clicking then opening in a new tab. Try Ctrl + click on a url, this will open it in a new tab. Again this is only a small time saving tip, I really wish there was a real solution to this problem..
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit:&nbsp;</strong>Oh and if possible, I highly recommend getting a wireless mouse for your laptop use as 80% of the touchpads on the market are terrible to begin with. I know this is a bit redundant, but I'm just trying my best to alleviate your problem
 since I'm not Microsoft! :P </p>

<p>Hey guys its been awhile since ive last used the xbox forums so bear with me but i had a quick question and was hoping someone could help out. i seem to have unlocked the cyber sub zero alternate costume from the krypt before unlocking the actual character.
 the problem is now that i have the actual character&nbsp;i dont seem to have access to the alternate costume. im also concerned this will prevent me from unlocking the youve got style achievement (once an achievement *** always an achievement ***). has anyone else
 experienced this problem or have any idea how to fix it? any help would be appreciated and thank you&nbsp;in advance.</p>

<p><span>Hi
<span>nam_fons,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As I understand you are trying to run
</span><strong><span>iriver plus</span></strong><span> program on the computer but, it crashing with an error
 message.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may want to try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong><span>Check if there are any updates available from the program manufacturer’s website</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></strong><span>Put the computer in clean boot and test to see if you can run the program</span></p>
<p><span>Follow
<strong>Step 1 </strong>in the link below,</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.
</span></p>
<p><span>After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software
 you can consider uninstalling it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> - Remember to put
 the computer back to normal startup <strong>follow step 7</strong> in the link.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may want to check with iriver for any known issues</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.iriver.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.iriver.com/</a>

<h2>            Halo the Master Chief Collection Multiplayer Matchmaking not working</h2>
                    
<p>I try to find a game but it never finds it. when will the matchmaking be fixed this is a disgrace. first I had destiny multiplayer problems kicking me from games and then sign in problems and now this. The Xbox 360 was way better than the Xbox one. It is
 a load of rubbish. For every good game they bring out they are going to have servers down. Microsoft is just bad. disappointed customer. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's not just you my friend. </p>
<p>I got suckered into buying an Xbox One just because of this game after I saw an ad on TV at the gym.</p>
<p>No disclaimer that the game is broken.</p>
<p>They are pushing a bad product to sell their system and once you crack the box you're stuck because most places will not give you a refund on an open video game console or game.</p>
<p>Plus I spent the money for Xbox Gold just go online to play this.</p>
<p>I have a thread going btw, I am opening the can of worms to get a class action lawsuit going.</p>
<p>If you're interested, hit the thread up so I can keep track.</p>

<p>I just got the game and have been lucky if I have been able to play a dozen or so matches. I have even gone back to my 360 and using matchmaking on Reach because a 20 minute wait time to connect to a game on Master chief is just too long when I want to get
 blown up 10 times by homicidal maniacs lol.</p>

<p>According to 343 Industries, there is an update that went live on 11/26 that is supposed to help with matchmaking and other problems. So I guess we should stop badgering Microsoft and turn our attention to 343 who apparently is the ones having the problems.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it was a 4 on 2 lagfest. WHAT THE ***!</p>
<p>I feel like $70 was stolen from me. Halo MCC and Halo 5 were the main factors involved in me buying an Xbox One in the first place. So its really like I was duped out of $570.</p>

<p>I really don't know why they will not enforce team balance and just turn on the dedicated servers so we don't have to play on peer to peer. It's very annoying but they seem to have some reasoning behind it. Don't ask me what that reason is though..</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 home to Windows 10 education</h2>
                    Hello I have a question regarding my windows edition. My class is required to use microsoft hyper-v and it can only run on win pro higher so our school provided us free win10 educ keys for us from onthehub. i think the product key has limited time. In
 any case the win10 educ license expires, will i be able to revert back to my old win10 home? i bought my laptop from a mall and it was already complete with office and os. Thank you and Godbless.

            Hi  Ambeh
<br />
<br />No need to worry, when you activated Windows Home on your laptop, a digital entitlement for that laptop was stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers.
<br />
<br />So, if you ever need to re-install Windows 10 Home there will be no problem with activation

            Hi Ambeh, you can reinstall Windows 10 Home at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10

<h2>            XBOX live keeps disconnecting</h2>
                    So my xbox keeps randomly disconnecting from xbox live, it could be every 5 mins or every hour its random. It generally only happens if im not actually playing anything, like downloading demos, dlcs or making emblems etc. It will happen sporadically during
 games but not so much, in addition if in party chat with people but not in their specific game i will constantly drop from the chat and sometimes rejoin instantly every couple of minutes. It happens in all games i play and every modem/router. I know its not
 my internet connection as home computers dont lose connection its just the xbox. Heres all the usual info; What Country/State/Province do you live in? Australia Modem brand &amp; model number: Netgear N600 wireless dual band gigabit ADSL2+ modem router DGND3700
 Router brand &amp; model number: Netgear N600 wireless dual band gigabit ADSL2+ modem router DGND3700 If Wireless, are you using a white or black external adapter, or an internal (Xbox 360S) adapter? my connection is wired I

<p>Should that fail, then I would try a sequential power cycle, a very successful step in clearing connection problems.<strong><em> The order and timing of the steps is important to success:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p>1) turn off the Xbox &amp; unplug its power cord then</p>
<p>2) unplug power from the Netgear gateway</p>
<p>3) Wait <strong>at least 5 minutes</strong> then replug the&nbsp;Netgear power.</p>
<p>4) Wait 'til the light on the front of the Netgear which says ONLINE, READY,&nbsp;BROADBAND or DSL is on solid (not flashing), then plug in the&nbsp;Xbox and turn it on. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hiya Kiwi,</p>
<p>Do you have any others devices like PCs connected to your modem router at the same time? If so, just as an isolation test, could you try and switch off all the other devices so that only the Xbox 360 is using your modem router and try that out for an hour
 or so?</p>

<p>Alright no worries - next step, you mentioned in the first post that you are using wired. Are you able to try wireless and see if that is any different? Also it's possible that your network cable could be faulty, so it may be worth trying a different cable
 from the Xbox to the modem router.</p>
<p>Also given that you've tried modem router and a different modem and the problem remains, it could very much be a problem with your ISP and Internet connection.</p>
<p>You may want to contact your ISP to see if there are any known issues.</p>
<p>If you don't want to contact your ISP, you could try and take your Xbox 360 to a friends house or family member's house to test it on their Internet connection to see if there is any difference. That will determine if the issue is with your ISP/Internet
 connection.</p>
<p>Let us know how you go!</p>

    <title>Ethernet Port not detecting Cable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crestedspore990  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ethernet Port not detecting Cable</h2>
                    
<p>I recently switched on my Xbox 360 but when I tried to connect to Xbox Live, it doesn't let me. I went to the "Network" settings and I am unable to select the "Wired" connection; therefore, the Xbox is not recognizing my ethernet cable. I tested out the
 Ethernet cable to make sure it works, and it does. I also cleared out anything that might have been lodged in the port but it still didn't work. I tried connecting it directly to the router and modem, but nothing worked. After that I decided to open the Xbox
 and check the solder to make sure it has a solid contact with the mobo. There hasn't been any lighting or rain or something to cause a power surge that could fry it. Everything seems fine (ie. All of the pins are aligned and nothing preventing then from making
 a connection). Since I believe that the port is a Magjack, could I just replace it with another one from a desktop or would that not work? Please help.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span><br />
<br />
<span>Unfortunately, if you've already gone through the steps of trying different&nbsp;</span><span><span>Ethernet</span></span><span>&nbsp;Cables, directly connecting the&nbsp;</span><span><span>Ethernet</span></span><span>&nbsp;cable to the Cable/DSL
 modem and then the other end into the Xbox 360 and it's still not being detected then it definitely means that there is an issue with the consoles&nbsp;</span><span><span>Ethernet</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>port</span><span>&nbsp;and there's really
 no fix for it.<br />
<br />
Something like this can definitely occur if you've had a power surge of any sort as power can go through the&nbsp;<span>Ethernet</span>&nbsp;cord to the port of the Xbox 360 and short it out.<br />
</span><br />
<span>You would need to send the&nbsp;</span><a href="http://myservice.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>console in to get repaired</strong></a><span>&nbsp;if you'd like to make sure of the&nbsp;</span><span><span>Ethernet</span></span><span>&nbsp;portion of the
 console otherwise you can try using wireless either internal if available or using the wireless adapter.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
Since you've taken it upon yourself to open the console, we are unable to help you with do it yourself fixes to your console unfortunately. You should never do any self repairs on a console, if anyone does not work even official Microsoft out of warranty repair
 would not accept your console for repair. Your only option to get the Ethernet port working would be to purchase a new console now.<br />
<br />
Please refer to the <strong><a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/legal/livetou" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">terms of use for information</a>&nbsp;(specifically section 1.12)</strong>&nbsp;on what is and isn't allowed when using your console.</span></p>

<p>I actually bought the console with the RRoD and fixed it (the previous owner had already opened it), but I don't see how there is no way to fix it, it couldn't have been shorted because I always unplug the Ethernet cord when I am not using it.</p>

<p>Sorry, as I stated previously, no one on this forum will be able to help you with self repairs. It is against the terms of use and thus not allowed to be discussed on the Xbox Support forums. Making 3rd party repairs to the console can make it so when there
 is a system update the console will be unusable.</p>

<p>You could buy an Xbox 360 &nbsp;Wireless adaptor and use the USB port on the back of the console to connect to xbox live although if you did a self repair its against the CoC and ToC which if you connect to Xbox Live you could get console banned.</p>

            <p>i have the same problem! what i notice,is when i start the console,the modem is detecting the cable (port led iluminates) ,and stays activated until i switch on tv.&nbsp; usualy,console does not boot,until it detect a video input source. Imediately after detecting it and start boot logo,ethernet turns off and it cant detect it :( . No solution to this. Maybe it has something to do with latest update,unfortunately,it cant be downgraded.&nbsp;&nbsp; From my point of wiew,is a software problem,not hardware. This happens suddenly,it works before.</p><p><br /></p>

                    I have checked compatability and updated drivers. when that didn't work I scrubbed my cmputer but it is still doing it. I have a new graphics card that is well capably of running the game and plenty of RAM &amp;&nbsp;process,&nbsp;&nbsp;anyone have any advice for what this
 could be? No errors accure and my anti virus isn't finding anything. Now I am using an on board ethernet card and some have suggested I upgrade this.

    <title>Windows 7 KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR with strange problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> economichaircut  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR with strange problems</h2>
                    I reformatted my laptop less than a month ago, dual booting Windows 7 Professional and Ubuntu 11.04.&nbsp; Since then, I've been noticing strange things on my Windows partition.&nbsp; At first, it just started to have random slow moments, explorer might hang, my
 mouse might hang, etc.&nbsp; Then, little over a week ago, it seems like networking-related processes started to hang after resuming my computer from sleep.&nbsp; This doesn't happen when resuming from hibernate.&nbsp; I can't open the Network and Sharing center, can't go
 to connect to any network, can't <span style="font-style: italic">see</span> the list of networks, etc.&nbsp; Shutting off WiFi with the hardware switch on my computer doesn't change the icon.&nbsp; Sometimes it would say that there are no network connections for some
 reason shortly after resuming, disconnecting me from WiFi and showing the network icon with a slash through it.&nbsp; A day or two after that started happening, I started getting random blue screens. I took a picture, this is what it says:<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">A problem has been detected</span> <span style="font-style: italic">
and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.<br />
<br />
KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR<br />
<br />
If this is the first time you've seen this Stop error screen, restart your computer.&nbsp; If this screen appears again, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
-----(normal blue screen instructions)-----<br />
<br />
Technical information:<br />
<br />

Contact your system admin or technical support group for further assistance.<br />
<br />
</span>This error is different from the usual not less or equal to that I'm used to seeing.&nbsp; It's happened twice, after resuming from sleep.&nbsp; The computer had said network problems, then slowed to a crawl, then boom.&nbsp; I use Ubuntu as my main OS now, but I have
 had to go into Windows several times since this started happening, whenever I resume from sleep the hard drive indicator light is solid (geez, busy huh?) for significantly longer than it should be after I log in, I force shut it down instead of waiting for
 BSOD.&nbsp; I basically can't resume from sleep anymore without instability, resuming from hibernate is fine.&nbsp; Like I said, this is a new clean installation of Windows, no OEM tweaks or anything, and I haven't installed much since installing Windows.&nbsp; Ubuntu has
 stayed fine, no problems, which is disconcerting - everything I read suggests this is hardware related, but the Ubuntu kernel hasn't had any trouble with the same hardware.<br />
<br />
Any ideas would be much appreciated, I'd like to avoid going to the trouble of reformatting again only to have the same issue happen again or something like that. Thanks!<br />

            <p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE (9f)</strong></span><br />
<br />
<em>This bug check indicates that the driver is in an inconsistent or invalid power state.</em>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>BugCheck 9F, {3, ffffe000bb6e7470, ffffd001008f8930, <strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ffffe000bc121cf0</span></em></strong>}</p>

ffffe000bc121cf0: Could not read Irp</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">We cannot see what driver is blocking the IRP, therefore we'll need the aid of Driver Verifier:</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Driver Verifier:</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<strong>What is Driver Verifier?</strong><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier monitors Windows kernel-mode drivers, graphics drivers, and even 3rd party drivers to detect illegal function calls or actions that might corrupt the system. Driver Verifier can subject the Windows drivers to a variety of stresses and tests
 to find improper behavior. <br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be causing the issues at hand, enabling Driver Verifier will help us see which specific driver is causing the problem.<br />
<br />
<strong>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</strong><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8/8.1 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How to enable Driver Verifier:</strong><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (only on Windows 7 &amp; 8/8.1)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (only on Windows 8/8.1)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
<strong>6.</strong> Check EVERY box that is <strong>NOT </strong>provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
<strong>7.</strong> Click on Finish.<br />
<strong>8.</strong> Restart.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
- Perhaps the most important which I will now clarify as this has been misunderstood often, enabling Driver Verifier by itself is
<strong>not! </strong>a solution, but instead a diagnostic utility. It will tell us if a driver is causing your issues, but again it will not outright solve your issues.
<br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD. To expand on this a bit more for the interested, specifically what Driver Verifier actually does is it looks for any driver making illegal function calls, causing memory leaks, etc. When and/if this
 happens, system corruption occurs if allowed to continue. When Driver Verifier is enabled per my instructions above, it is monitoring
<em><strong>all </strong></em>3rd party drivers (as we have it set that way) and when it catches a driver attempting to do this, it will quickly flag that driver as being a troublemaker, and bring down the system safely before any corruption can occur.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will detect it in violation almost straight away, and
 as stated above, that will cause / force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
<strong>If this happens, do not panic, do the following:</strong><br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<strong>If your OS became corrupt or you cannot boot into Windows after disabling verifier via Safe Mode:
</strong><br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
<br />
-- Note that Safe Mode for Windows 8/8.1 is a bit different, and you may need to try different methods:

5 Ways to Boot into Safe Mode in Windows 8 &amp; Windows 8.1</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</strong><br />
<br />
I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier. I will usually say whether or not I'd like for you to keep it enabled any longer.<br />
<br />
<strong>My system BSOD'd with Driver Verifier enabled, where can I find the crash dumps?</strong><br />
<br />
- If you have the system set to generate Small Memory Dumps, they will be located in
<strong>%systemroot%\Minidump</strong>.<br />
<br />
- If you have the system set to generate Kernel Memory Dumps, <em><strong>it </strong>
</em>will be located in <strong>%systemroot% and labeled MEMORY.DMP</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Any other questions can most likely be answered by this article:</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>What is Driver Verifier?</strong><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier monitors Windows kernel-mode drivers, graphics drivers, and even 3rd party drivers to detect illegal function calls or actions that might corrupt the system. Driver Verifier can subject the Windows drivers to a variety of stresses and tests
 to find improper behavior. <br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be causing the issues at hand, enabling Driver Verifier will help us see which specific driver is causing the problem.<br />
<br />
<strong>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</strong><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8/8.1 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How to enable Driver Verifier:</strong><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (only on Windows 7 &amp; 8/8.1)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (only on Windows 8/8.1)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
<strong>6.</strong> Check EVERY box that is <strong>NOT </strong>provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
<strong>7.</strong> Click on Finish.<br />
<strong>8.</strong> Restart.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <br />
- Perhaps the most important which I will now clarify as this has been misunderstood often, enabling Driver Verifier by itself is
<strong>not! </strong>a solution, but instead a diagnostic utility. It will tell us if a driver is causing your issues, but again it will not outright solve your issues.
<br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD. To expand on this a bit more for the interested, specifically what Driver Verifier actually does is it looks for any driver making illegal function calls, causing memory leaks, etc. When and/if this
 happens, system corruption occurs if allowed to continue. When Driver Verifier is enabled per my instructions above, it is monitoring
<em><strong>all </strong></em>3rd party drivers (as we have it set that way) and when it catches a driver attempting to do this, it will quickly flag that driver as being a troublemaker, and bring down the system safely before any corruption can occur.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will detect it in violation almost straight away, and
 as stated above, that will cause / force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
<strong>If this happens, do not panic, do the following:</strong><br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<strong>If your OS became corrupt or you cannot boot into Windows after disabling verifier via Safe Mode:
</strong><br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
<br />
-- Note that Safe Mode for Windows 8/8.1 is a bit different, and you may need to try different methods:

5 Ways to Boot into Safe Mode in Windows 8 &amp; Windows 8.1</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</strong><br />
<br />
I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier. I will usually say whether or not I'd like for you to keep it enabled any longer.<br />
<br />
<strong>My system BSOD'd with Driver Verifier enabled, where can I find the crash dumps?</strong><br />
<br />
- If you have the system set to generate Small Memory Dumps, they will be located in
<strong>%systemroot%\Minidump</strong>.<br />
<br />
- If you have the system set to generate Kernel Memory Dumps, <em><strong>it </strong>
</em>will be located in <strong>%systemroot% and labeled MEMORY.DMP</strong>.<br />

<h2>            Purchase pending for 4 days&#63;</h2>
                    So this is my second time trying to purchase anything from the Microsoft Store (online) and boy has this been a frustrating process. 4 days ago I attempted to purchase the Surface Pro 4 for school. I configured over a couple grand of hardware into it,
 attempted to purchase it, and was denied. I wasnt understanding why. I had the money. More than enough actually. So I go to my purchase history and find out that instead of just declining my card the transaction &nbsp;amount I would've spent retrying elsewhere
 is pending. I thought to myself "why would you decline my card if my order went throug?". So I went to my email, no order confirmation, looked at my bank account to see my funds: funds have not returned. I thought this might be a business hiccup and Im recieving
 information slowly...no again. I proceded to wait it out even though Im without a pc for almost a 3 months. Whats a couple days gonna do. My problem is that not only am I without money now and nothings happened these past 4 d

            That is yet another problem.... I tried to uninstall reader but it won't do it, it will say that another program is being installed (not the case).&nbsp; When I try to just delete the adobe files straight from the folder, it will say that I don't have permission
 (yet I am logged on as administrator).&nbsp; I cannot get any answers from Adobe.com, seems other folks have the same problem.&nbsp; There was a post that said that the problem was with Vista.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just cannot get rid of the darn problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am unable to see pdf files
 and really need this feature to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for your thoughts though.
