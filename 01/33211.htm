<h2>            Xbox live still charged after enter the redeem code </h2>
                    
<p>Hi !!! I am just using Xbox live for 1 month and still a little confuse about it.&nbsp;At first, I used the promotion 2$/month for 2 months. Then, I decided to buy a redeem code for one&nbsp;year membership. But after one month, it stared to charge me 9.99$ for the
 xbox live monthly fee. Why? Please help me ?&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's called an auto renewal, when you purchased a gold membership for your account using your credit card. Microsoft will automatically charge you to renew your gold membership once it has expired monthly.</p>

<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>As far as I understood you account must have be automatically renewed to the standard Monthly subsc. as per the messagging that you must have seen when viewing the purchase details of the the promotion 2$/month for 2 months.</p>
<p>Also , if you had read the TOU , you would have know that the service is set to renewal untill you stops that renewal.</p>
<p>Any way , your subsc. must have been extended to a further month.</p>
<p>If you check your Subsc. , and these conditions are not available , then Call Xbox Support.</p>
<p>You can check your Subsc. and billing details @ <a href="http://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hello there,as others have said this is because it's on auto renewal which can be turned off also if you turn it off and buy more memberships from your Xbox it will turn renewal back on so whenever you purchase live on your Xbox auto renewal will start
 turning on but can be turned off it will also store your card until the membership ends but if you buy a redeemable card then auto renewal won't occur as redeeming cards don't require personal Information. I hope this helped!

<h2>            Microsoft Family blocking Chrome.</h2>
                    <p>So, I finally decide to add a Microsoft Account to my laptop.</p>
<p>I add my preexisting account, and bam. All is good.</p>
<p>Until I tried opening Google Chrome. Microsoft Family Features window pops up. (Keep in mind, I'm a child in a family but there shouldn't be any restrictions.) Tells me to ask permission. So I exit out and try again and it just keeps popping up.</p>
<p>I decide to remove my account to reset my laptop to the original local account. I click "Sign in with a local account and the account seems to be gone. Log in. Click Google Chrome. Nope, Microsoft Family pops up again.</p>
<p>Tells me this time that I need to sign in. I click Sign In to see if I could try making a separate account with no family on it. Nope, I can't even access the login page. It just asks to switch to another app, and I click "Yes", and then nothing. It just
 closes, never to appear again.</p>
<p>I go into settings. Can't see an account ANYWHERE. Can't even use the Virtual Agent since if I click on a link, the popup opens again.</p>
<p>But OF COURSE, Microsoft Edge works PERFECTLY fine.</p>
<p>No offense, but I hate Edge. I want Chrome back.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>
<p>(P.S, this is also Windows 10.)</p>
<p>(P.P.S, I'm going to try resetting Windows. Not just resetting power, but resetting Window fully.)</p>

<h2>            Lost files and favorites after the update.</h2>
                    <p>Just upgraded a laptop from windows 7 to windows 10 this evening just to see what it was like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything looked to have worked OK, but I then kicked off a windows update, and it now seems to have&nbsp;DELETED all my files on the next boot up and defaulted the installation (so&nbsp;changes I had made to Edge such as home page were lost, favourites disappeared,
 and even the colour scheme on the windows button menu has changed).&nbsp;&nbsp;Thankfully there wasn't much on it and I have a backup in any case, but this was rather disturbing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add insult to injury, when it booted back up, it actually&nbsp;put up a nice little reassuring message&nbsp;to the effect that your files are still there!&nbsp; I've checked the windows.old directory and nothing in there + done a whole disk search and there is no trace
 of any of the files. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The updates it installed were as follows. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. </p>

            <p>No it didn't help at all I'm afraid Krishna.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took the opportunity to install an SSD in said laptop at the same time, which meant I could also revert quickly to where I was by re-fitting the&nbsp;conventional hard disk if anything went drastically&nbsp;wrong. I also wanted to start from a clean position so
 decided not to go for the SSD data transfer. As I potentially have several machines to do, I took the opportunity to create a win10&nbsp;ISO DVD disk too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sequence of events was as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Backup up the files on my conventional hard disk to USB stick</p>
<p>2. Install the SSD</p>
<p>3. Installed windows 7 on the SSD from my laptop recovery disks so the upgrade to win10 was starting from a completely clean win7 install</p>
<p>4. Kicked the upgrade process off from the win10 DVD</p>
<p>5. Took the option to do the win10 updates&nbsp;LATER rather than during the install</p>
<p>6. Copied my files and favourites across to win10 from USB stick</p>
<p>7. Finally, when I was happy things looked OK, ran windows update</p>
<p>8. Jumped up and down and swore a lot when I saw&nbsp;the files I had restored, and settings changes I had made,&nbsp;had disappeared</p>
<p>
</p><p>My theory is the windows update actually made quite a few changes to the win10&nbsp;DVD build, and perhaps took no&nbsp;steps to protect my&nbsp;"new" data from what it was doing as it wasn't there during the original upgrade process - it was introduced afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, that&nbsp;ANY update should result in complete loss of&nbsp;USER data is shocking. &nbsp;&nbsp;Thankfully in this case, I only lost my confidence in Microsoft and haven't completely lost my data having (effectively) two backups of it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This laptop&nbsp;is my wife's machine which in all honesty, is as simple a build as you're ever likely to find, but my&nbsp;OWN machine is in a completely different league in terms of what it is used for, what applications are on it,&nbsp;and the complexity of the build.
 I cannot possibly contemplate upgrading that to win10, if these are the sorts of issues I can expect.

            <p>Just an additional point on this - I have found the favourites I originally loaded.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I had them on my USB stick, when I'd done the win10 upgrade, there was nothing to import. So I copied my favourites into the IE11 view within Edge, and then imported them into Edge if that makes sense!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this update, they had been lost from Edge, but I found they were still in the IE11 view, so I simply hit the button to import them again.

I have already been charged for the FIFA points and have found no way of them being added to my account. Is there any chance you can add them manually?

<h2>            hevc codec won&#39;t work in Resolve</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I thought i would get the&nbsp;<span>HEVC Video Extensions codec in the Store to help with support when trying to create h.265 videos in software like Resolve. But even with this i get no extra support for the file type,
 heres what the description on the store says</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>HEVC Video Extensions enable Windows 10 devices to play video using the HEVC format in any app. They're designed to take advantage of hardware capabilities on modern devices, including Intel 7th Generation Core processors
 and newer GPUs in order to support 4K and Ultra HD content. For devices without HEVC hardware support, software support is provided to enable local playback capabilities though the experience may vary depending on the resolution of the video and performance
 of your computer. In addition to supporting HEVC playback, these Extensions also include support for encoding HEVC content on devices that do not contain a hardware encoder.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Am i missing something or will it not work for editing the h.265 files?</p>

<p>Hi Podge Papin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Yes that is correct. MPEG-4, H.263, &amp; H.264 are just some of it's predecessors for 4k videos. That being said, codecs are needed in order to create these kind of files, which is packaged on the program to ensure that it would be successfully created. That
 being said, I would like to clarify a few things, so I'd be able to assist you better:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you getting issues when playing HEVC enabled videos?</li><li>Do you get errors when creating videos of other file types?</li><li>Have you tested reinstalling the program that you use for creating videos?</li><li>What is the version and build of your Windows?
<ul>
<li>You can have this checked by pressing the <strong>Windows button + R</strong> on your keyboard to open the
<strong>Run</strong> box, and type <em><strong>winver</strong></em> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>In the meantime, I suggest that you uninstall and reinstall the program that you use. This is to ensure that the integrity of your program is intact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please don't hesitate to keep me posted for me to assist you further.</p>

<p>Hello, I tried this but no luck. My OS version is 1803 and the build is 17134.137</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now with the HEVC codec installed my videos, which are played through VLC, look like this</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/280a16a7-3946-432c-bafa-40019667181d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/280a16a7-3946-432c-bafa-40019667181d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled, cleaned any files then reinstalled the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>the Microsoft HEVC codec</li><li>Da Vinci Resolve</li><li>VLC</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In Resolve my H.264 files work fine, but still the H.265 files will load the audio into the editor but no picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Podge,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue continues even after uninstalling and reinstalling the program, I suggest running the troubleshooter for Video Playback. You will need administrative permission to perform this operation.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Select the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span><span>
 button.</span></li><li><span>Type
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Troubleshoot</span><span> and then hit
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Enter</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Select
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Video Playback</span><span> under
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Find and fix other problems</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Run the troubleshooter</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Follow the on-screen instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Should the issue still remain, I suggest contacting the video player software developer for further assistance. There's a possibility that the playback issue is caused by a misconfiguration with the program itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Stuck After Restart Into Diagnostic Mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to fix issue on Windows Start, I try to restart to Diagnostic Mode but after restart the computer stuck at dot circling. When I power-cycle the computer it doesn't allow me to login and goes directly back to dot circling. How do I restore the computer
 so it would start in safe mode or normal mode?</p>

            <p>Hello William,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try using power drain and check if the PC comes out of loop. To do so, kindly forcefully shutdown the PC by pressing power button. Remove the power cable and battery. Press the power button after removing power connection and battery for
 5 minutes. This will drain all the power from the laptop. Reconnect the battery and power cable, restart the laptop and check if issue is resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. </p>

Hi JB,<br />
<br />
<br />
To assist you better, kindly provide us more details by answering the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>When did you start encountering the issue?</li><li>Have you made any changes to your computer prior to the issue?</li><li>Are you able to log in to your computer?</li></ul>
<p>Meanwhile, to help resolve your concern, you may access the <strong>Windows Recovery Environment</strong> by making your computer think that the startup is failing. To do so, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn on your computer.</li><li>When you see the loading dots, immediately turn off your computer.</li><li>Repeat steps one and two. Three times will be enough for the computer to think that you are having issues with startup.</li><li>Once the computer boots up for the third time, you will see the loading dots on the screen and the message
<strong>Preparing automatic repair</strong>.</li><li>Afterwards, your computer may turn black then it will show <strong>Diagnosing your PC</strong>.</li><li>It will ask you to restart your device or proceed to the advanced options. Choose
<strong>Advanced Options</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Once you're in the Windows Recovery Environment, you may go to <strong>Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings</strong> to access
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>. Check if you will encounter the same issue while in Safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>There is no in-game support for keyboard or mouse in terms of game controls. There never will be. The 360 is a console, not a gaming PC.</p>

<h2>            Bugcheck 0x0000009f &#40;auto reboot &#43; blue screen&#41;</h2>
                    Frequently when I shut my computer down, it auto-reboots and displays a blue screen with the bugcheck 0x0000009f. I would like solutions for fixing it. I have done my fair share of googling and tried about a hundred different solutions and none of them
 work. One solution was to uninstall the virus program I was using (Avast) and that actually seemed to work as it kept the bugcheck away for over a month (previous to that it was happening about once every 3 days), but the error came back last night. I know
 you're probably going to request the minidump but I have tried for the past hour to upload it to Skydrive but I can't because that website complains of it being an "empty file" and when I try to upload it to a filesharing site, my computer complains about
 me not having permission to access the file and to contact the administrator.<br />
<br />
I have a Lenovo running Windows 7.<br />

            I just installed Windows 8.1 and have since begun having these errors. I have tried adjusting the power saving settings on all root USB hubs due to the AMD USB EHCI host controller issue stated above. That worked for a day but this morning at 3:52 it rebooted
 again and the event log listed a bugcheck and this error.
<div>Can someone help?</div>

<h2>            My DVD Drive won&#39;t read DVD discs, but will read game discs, and CD&#39;s that contains files.</h2>
                    <p>I have been searching for the past couple of months now.<br />
Never had issues before and ever since the major 1803 windows 10 update, my driver is still not working properly. This is ridiculous.<br />
My driver will read certain cd's containing files.&nbsp; Game cd's work fine.&nbsp;<br />
Does not read my blu ray discs or dvds. The ONLY dvd I was able to have playing was 'Domino' but that was because I had a pop up option to download InterActual Player which I am assuming the software came with the dvd it self and was able to watch it through
 that.</p>
<p>Otherwise when I pop in a dvd, I can hear it trying to read the disc then it stops. If I right click on my driver and click format, nothing happens, if I click burn it says please insert CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've uninstalled the dvd driver in device manager. </p>
<p>Tried to troubleshoot on my devices and didn't find any issues.<br />
I looked up under disk management&nbsp; to see if I had to delete upper and lower filters and those were not even listed on there.<br />
Autoplay is checked on.<br />
I've even went through recovery mode to reset my pc.</p>
<p>And no the discs are not scratched.<br />
<br />
here's my computer info<br />

<p>Yeah neither of those didn't work either.<br />
<br />
In order for me to use a third party, the drive needs to be able to read the disc in the first place. Instead I get this error when I choose open disc then select my D drive.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/527fce38-6ee0-4e89-95b0-599247e4df93?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/527fce38-6ee0-4e89-95b0-599247e4df93?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And no I do not have a yellow exclamation point next to my hard drive. Driver is up to date.&nbsp;<br />
Tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it.<br />

<h2>            password reset when administrators password is the one that is forgotten&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    please help....my 10 year old received a dell inspiron mini with windows 7 for xmas - she of course set it up herself &amp; guess what - now cannot remember her password! I can't do the system reboot/repair thing because I can't sign in to the computer since
 she set herself up as administrator (I guess). I know in a perfect world this shouldn't happen because the parent should have set it up but she did it before we had a chance.... is there anything that can be done

            Since the mini doesn't have an optical drive, you'll need to create a bootable USB stick and put the Windows 7 DVD on it OR get a USB optical drive in order to follow the instructions below. Doing all of this
<span>requires a certain level of computer skills. You know yourself best and whether taking the machine to a competent local computer tech (not a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place) is the better solution for you. Or just restore
 the mini to factory condition and it will be a good lesson (and not terribly harsh) to your daughter about writing down passwords.<br />
<br />
</span><span>If you have a Windows 7 installation DVD (not a recovery DVD) you can boot the system with it. Select the default language, then choose "Repair your computer". Then select "Command Prompt". At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:yes [press Enter]<br />
net user [insert your user account's name here] [insert new user password like 1234 here] [press Enter]<br />
<br />
[Note: Do not type the brackets!]<br />
<br />
Remove the installation DVD and reboot the computer. Now you will be able to log into your user account using the password you set; i.e., 1234.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a Windows 7 installation DVD (only have a recovery disc), the computer mftr. may have given you the Windows 7 System Repair option (not a System Recovery!) on the diagnostic menu. This diagnostic menu is the same one where you can choose Safe
 Mode. Get to this menu by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting up. If you don't have this option you can make a bootable Windows 7 Repair DVD from the file at this link:<br />
<br />
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2009/windows-7-system-repair-discs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2009/windows-7-system-repair-discs/</a>
<br />
<span><br />
Note: All the Neosmart recovery disc downloads are torrent files. There is a good explanation of torrent files at the Neosmart website. You will need a torrent client such as
<a href="http://www.utorrent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">muTorrent</a> to get the files. The torrent client will download the .iso file with which to create the bootable DVD. If you are creating the bootable DVD in an older operating system (XP, Vista), you will need to use third-party
 burning software such as Nero, Roxio, or the free ImgBurn (<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com</a> ) to burn the .iso as an image, not as data. Windows 7 can burn .isos natively.<br />
<br />
Once you have fixed things, log into the extra administrative account you will make per the suggestions below and disable the built-in Administrator account again for security purposes:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: cmd<br />
When cmd appears in Results above, right-click it and choose "Run as administrator" [OK]. Now you will get the command prompt. At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:no [enter]<br />
<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP, Vista and all other modern operating systems, Windows 7 is a multi-user operating system with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, and Guest. These accounts should be left
 alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges in Windows 7 because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily work and that
 account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult.&nbsp;</span> <span>
It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it may be more than you want to do. Better not to put yourself into a bad situation to begin with.</span>
<span><br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. Running as a Standard user is best practice for security
 purposes and will help protect your computer from infection. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).</span> <br />

<p>If you want to put your computer to sleep and wake up where you left it without having to sign in go to
<strong>settings</strong>&gt;<strong>accounts&gt;sign in options</strong> and under <strong>
required sign in</strong> set it to <strong>never</strong>. This only works in sleep mode not logout or restart.&nbsp;In the power option settings set
<strong>choose what closing lid does</strong> to sleep&nbsp;then all you have to do is close the lid and when you return lifting the lid will awaken laptop to the point&nbsp;where you left it , no sign in, obviously that's for laptops. Desktops just put to sleep. You
 can safely leave your computer in sleep mode for as long as you want, it will enter reduced power mode on a laptop to preserve battery power whilst sleeping but it will still use the battery.</p>

                    <p>So my laptop ran out of memory (16 GB) and screen turned off, everything else was working, fan, disks, etc. So I assumed it must be video card crash.. There were no signs of BSOD, only screen turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I forced shutdown, when I turned on I checked BSOD logs and found that actually BSOD happened and most likely it was caused again by NVIDIA drivers. (I have posted before of NVIDIA drivers that cause BSODs , they all start with nv.... .sys)</p>

<h3> bruce w darby  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media Creation Tool</h2>
                    I 'reserved' my copy of Windows 10 over a month ago. I can understand the stress and strain on the download servers run by one of the largest software companies in the world. My question has to deal with the Media Creation Tool. We are advised that if
 we're 'tech-savvy' we can download the installer, create installation media and then 'upgrade' our Windows 8.1 OS to Windows 10 without having to wait for 'our place in line'. This is a bald-faced lie. Spent three hours yesterday downloading the 'update' installer
 and then creating a USB 'upgrade' device, only to be told by the installer that I need the CD-Key. I called Microsoft Technical Support and was told that I could not use the 'upgrade' media I created to 'update' Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. I have to wait an
 undetermined amount of time for Microsoft to decide it's 'my turn' to get my upgrade, download it to my computer, in the background, and then notify me that my software update is ready to install. I can then use my 'upgrade' me

 am currently at 17% on the Windows 10 upgrade on one of my Toshiba laptops. Second laptop is currently downloading the software for itself. Since I am not sure&nbsp;how I got the Option in the Media Creation Tool to install the update, I checked using the Windows
 10 Update Tool and it still shows me as being 'in line' to get my upgrade at some unspecified date and time in the future.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were a couple of things that I found in separate threads that could have helped initiate the upgrade...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. An edit to the <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Current Version\WindowsUpdate</strong> key. Changing the Value of the
<strong>OSUpdate</strong> key from 2 to 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Open Computer and navigate to <strong>C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download</strong> folder. Delete all files and folders that are 'inside' that folder. Open the command prompt as an admin and running the command
<strong>wuauclt.exe /updatenow</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try running Windows Update 'after' trying number 2 above, but was told that there were&nbsp;no updates available, so not sure that helped anything for myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Technical Support needs to 'get with their program', pun intended, and work out how to help folks get the results they desire rather than simply telling them to 'have patience and wait your turn'.</p>

            Well, Halfway successful! I was able to update both of my computers to Windows 10. I have two Toshiba laptops, one an L875D and the other a C70D. The update to the C70D went well, albeit a bit slow. Windows 8.1 Pro was updated to Windows 10 Pro. However,
 on the L875D, my Windows 8.1 Pro was only updated to Windows 10 Home. Could not uninstall the Windows 10 Update, so I resorted to the dreaded, this is for the proper feeling of impending doom, factory reset of the hard drive. Now when I try to reinstall my
 Windows 10 upgrade, I'm getting the same 'Something happened' error as soon as I launch the Media Creation Tool. On the off chance that this is actually an issue with the Recovery Media tool created by Toshiba themselves, I have ordered the recovery media
 directly from Toshiba at a cost of $40 dollars. Free upgrade? Well, time will tell.

<h3> stevetaillon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Iphone,itunes,downloading</h2>
                    <p>My sister much to my dismay got an iPhone . I am not happy about this because I am her support for all her devises.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I do not like the iTunes download and steer clear of apple products. I am a die hard Microsoft and Android user. Eventually I will make the leap to
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows phone ,&nbsp;but&nbsp;I&nbsp;think they have a little ways to go before I make that commitment.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anyways my question is . </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can I sync her contacts that are on her IPhone without downloading iTunes on her computer.???</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would like to take all her music and contacts and sync them to windows media , and google (Gmail).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>According to Apple the process of syncing all her information includes downloading icloud, iTunes .
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't want to do this . I just upgraded her laptop to Windows 8.1..</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I did this before she got iPhone.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks </p>
<p>Steve&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>One more question : I tried downloading iTunes on my sisters laptop running 8.1 and after I selected download iTunes box I was not asked if I wanted to
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>run&nbsp;&nbsp; save&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp;&nbsp; cancel&nbsp; .&nbsp; That box that comes up on my laptop when I select download iTunes did not come up on her laptop.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What would cause this to not happen . We both have IE 11 . My laptop shows it hers doesn't . It just says thanks for downloading iTunes and nothing
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>happens . I look for iTunes in her files and programs and it is not there. It is not downloading.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            You have an "authored" DVD, and there's no direct way to copy it in Windows 10. There are free third-party programs that can do this (<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">imgburn</a>, for instance).&nbsp;&nbsp;
 What you need to do is create a disc image on your computer and then burn that image to a recordable DVD.&nbsp; Windows can do the last bit.

<h3> mikeklepfer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 installation problems</h2>
                    <p>I'm having problems installing Windows 10.<br />
<br />
I've tried both the Windows Update download and install route and using the Media Creation Tool to try to install off a USB drive. Each time I've tried to upgrade, the installation will download completely, start to setup, and then restart into Windows 8.1.
 When I check my Windows Update history, it says that the installation failed. The most consistent error message was accompanied by the code 8000405. When I've attempted to use the Media Creation Tool, the same thing happens, except when the computer restarts
 into Windows 8.1, there's a prompt that says "Something happened," with the accompanying message saying that the installation failed. I've cleaned my registry using CCleaner, uninstalled my antivirus software, and restarted into a clean boot, and then tried
 the process again, and the same thing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reading other entries about error code 8000405, I've used both the Windows Update Troubleshooter and resetting Windows Update Component tools. I've also used the command line to apply fixes. When I've used command line scans with sfc /scannow, I see that
 there are errors in CBS.log. I've run the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">Deployment Image Servicing and Management Tool out of the command line,
 and it said it fixed the errors that it found, but that didn't help when I tried to install again.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">I've tried
 to install Windows 10 11 times and nothing has worked. What should I do?</span></p>

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue could occur if you have any third party services&nbsp;running in the background.</p>
<p>
</span></span><span><span>You may disable antivirus software and third party anti-virus installed on the computer and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
<strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span><span>
</span>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I suggest you to disconnect all the external devices connected to the computer (except the mouse and the keyboard) and then try to update. This is to
 check if the issue is caused by any external devices connected to the computer.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Like I said in my first post, I tried disabling my antivirus software and then uninstalled it completely, and then searched around the internet for fixes including cleaning my registry. I don't have any peripherals physically connected, aside from a Microsoft
 wireless mouse. I have some antivirus software running now because I've tried to install this OS 20 times, and I'm not going to use my computer without it while I continue to wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some help from another website involving some command line fixes, I still can't install Windows 10, either by using the update notification that appears on my startup tray, or by using the Media Creation Tool. The last command line fix removed Windows
 10 as an upgrade option and installed Windows 8.1 updates that were pending but inaccessible after the Windows 10 update appeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most recent error code is 80240020.</p>

    <title>Account issues with Microsoft Minesweeper - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Account issues with Microsoft Minesweeper</h2>
                    
<p>I have been trying to play Microsoft Minesweeper on the same account as the account with my Xbox Live profile. However, this is not the primary account for my laptop and minesweeper has just automatically signed in with the primary account for the laptop.
 I've uninstalled and reinstalled the app while signed in on both accounts with no luck. I have since downloaded a few other Microsoft games with no issues there and I haven't been able to find any settings on the game to switch accounts.</p>

            <p>same problem here, the app always login to the main account, the "solution" is to NOT have a main account, instead, have a local account (your computer wont be synced anymore) but the every single app will ask you which account you want to use, but this is a bad solution, as now the computer is not synced...</p>

<h2>            What does Windows 7 task manager processes priority do, Is it safe to make Dragon naturally speaking priority high if dictating is my main task</h2>
                    I frequently am using my PC as a sort of thin client to dictate in notes Through a VPN to&nbsp;a &nbsp;RDP running my medical software. I use Dragon NatSpeak to do this,.It makes frequent mistakes, and drops words, runs somewhat slowly, my desktop is a Dell Inspiron
 w/ an Intel I3 550 @ 3.2 GHz w/ 6GB DDR3 RAM&nbsp;, 6 MB L3 cache.OS is Win7 pro 64 bit, sp1.&nbsp;I am just wondering if Raising priority of natspeak.exe from normal&nbsp; to high might help? Also in task manager what does it mean when you click on View, get the drop down
 and it has a setting for speed?

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />

===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />
