<p>Even with a Silver you can still buy &amp; DL stuff from the marketplace right?&nbsp; Even if you can't do it on the 360 per se I think you can purchase it through the marketplace here &amp; then simply DL it when you hook up your 360.&nbsp; I've done that a couple of times,
 though granted I've got a Gold membership.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As another poster wrote if you can wait for the GOTY edition that we all know is gonna come.&nbsp; Not only will it have all the DLC it's gonna be more stable.</p>

<p>Yes, Silver members can buy games and add-ons. &nbsp;The main thing that gold membership gets you is the ability to play online with other gamers, which is not an issue with the Fallout games since there is no online play.</p>

<h2>            cmd promot opens and closes</h2>
                    Just as the Title says, I go to the start menu and type cmd in the run bar, i then double click the cmd.exe and I see the window come up then disappear. I have tried to open as admin, I have tried going to the file location I have tried changing the rights
 and then logging in as guest and typing in my password. Nothing I have tried will get the cmd prompt to stay open long enough for me to do anything.

            Hi Justin!<br />
<br />
Try to open it in Windows Explorer by right-clicking your C: drive while holding the shift key down. The menu should include the option "Open command window here".<br />
<br />
Just to be on the safe side I would also suggest downloading free Malwarebytes Antimalware and run a FULL scan:

Ok, Just to give you a little back ground: I love computers and have been working on them for friends for years. One them brought me his computer to look at a clean up before I move. The first thing that I always do other than msconfig is install malwarebytes.
 I ran it and it found 4 things that did not look to bad. So I got rid of them and updated windows and all the other software, like Java and Adobe. I then tried to run the cmd.exe to start windows defender because it was not running and I have had this problem
 before, and from the cmd line I can fix it. The problem is that no matter which way I try to open the cmd prompt on his computer, including the way that you suggested, is that I see the window pop up then in a split second go away again. Is looks like it functioning
 I just cant get to it, and this is the first time in over 10 years that I have had to ask for help to fix something. I have literally tried everything that I know to do.<br />

<ul>
<li>Check the %comspec% environmental variable. It must point to&nbsp;%SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe.</li><li>Boot into Safe Mode and check if the problem persists.</li><li>Boot into Repair Mode and see what happens when you open a Console.</li><li>Check the properties of cmd.exe. On my machine (an AMD machine) they look like so:<br />

            What happens if you copy cmd.exe from C:\Windows\System32 and paste it somewhere else? Does it work then?<br />
<br />
You could have a look in regedit.exe under HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\ and check if you see anything strange there like an Autorun key set to exit or something...<br />
<br />

            OK so everything looks fine and when I paste C:\Windows\System32 somewhere else it still pops up and then in a split second disappears. I think its working properly I just cant get it to stay open. I also looked at the regedit.exe and all looks well there.
 I have another laptop running the same version of windows that is working fine so I exported the registry entry for the command processor, and then tried again just to get the same response. I also tried the file system check, I had to do it with the windows
 disk because I can not get the cmd prompt to type the command. The only response i could get out of that was that there was an active recovery running and to restart the computer. I was trying to get into the cmd prompt to fix another program and have since
 found another way to fix that program but this is still driving me nuts.

Because I can not get the window to stay open to type commands I had to do it with the windows disk in repair mode. I said that because there was a in process repair it could not complete the scan.

            wow I feel really stupid. <br />
<br />
Boot into Safe Mode and check if the problem persists. No it still closes instantaneously.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Boot into Repair Mode and see what happens when you open a Console. It opens but I cant do anything because it says that it's in the process of a repair and that I need to restart the computer.<br />
<br />
Check the properties of cmd.exe. On my machine (an AMD machine) they look like so:&nbsp; This is an Intel machine but I don't think in this case that it matters, It looks the same from your screen shot and just to be sure I looked at another Intel machine "My own
 since I am having this problem on a friends computer" and that also looked the same. (I could just be missing something, I do miss stuff alot)
<br />
I also checked all the other tabs just to be sure., And just in case I missed it I copied a working copy to the new machine, to no avail it still closes.
<br />
<br />
Check the %comspec% environmental variable. It must point to&nbsp;%SystemRoot%\system32\cmd.exe.<br />
As far as this goes you are reaching the limits of my abilities, I know that I can figure it out I just have not had much time with part of windows and I am still learning, but I managed to find this and it has the same name. If I could apologize for my prior
 verbiage I was not trying to offend just that I was stating that I had tried all the suggested fixes and It was still not working., thus my short temper, not with you or anyone else Just that I am a perfectionist and I have not been able to figure this out.<br />
<br />
Yours and everyone Else's help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; <br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forum. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please be assured that we would do our best to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer the following questions so that we can help you.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Have you installed any third party security software?</li><li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li><li>Are you using any proxy connection?</li></ol>
<p>I suggest you to follow the methods below and check:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to refer the article below and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(112, 48, 160, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968003" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(112, 48, 160, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968003</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Make sure that the date and time are correct on the computer.</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Check the setting for Date/Time by choosing the Desktop tile and then left click on the date/time in the corner.</span></li><li><span>Click on change date and time settings. And then verify the time zone is correct as well as the internet time tab has the option to Synchronize with Internet time server.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 3 </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Place the computer in Clean Boot and install the updates.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts<strong>.&nbsp;
</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the article below to perform clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(112, 48, 160, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(112, 48, 160, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Please refer to the section: <strong>
<span>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot
</span></strong>of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 4</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since you are not able to access the Windows Store, I suggest you to disable the proxy connection and check once again.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click the <strong>Gear</strong> <strong>box</strong> at the top right corner in internet explorer.</span></li><li><span>Click the <strong>Tools</strong> button, and then click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click the <strong>Connections tab</strong>, and then click <strong>LAN&nbsp;settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Uncheck <strong>Use a proxy server for your LAN</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 5</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Scan for Viruses</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to scan your computer with <strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>, which would help to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The <strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong> is a free-to-download security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One possible reason why the network data usage isn't showing up may be due to a third party program causing it not to work properly. To isolate your concern, we'd like to ask a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you using a third party app to monitor your internet usage?</li><li>Are you on a metered connection? To check, click this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/633571e5-3591-437d-bf6a-071a243305a7/metered-connections-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Metered connections in Windows 10">
link </a>and follow the steps.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<h2>            Circle scratch xbox 360 elite</h2>
                    
<p>The other day a week ago my xbox tipped over while I was playing GTAV. I knew immediately it tipped it was scratched because I heard about the xbox circle scratch previously. My Xbox model is older then the models most people have today. (I think) it is
 a Xbox360 elite. I have also heard about older xbox's crashing when playing GTAV, but mine doesn't do that. Now that the background information is done let me go on to the real problem. The scratch has made it so that I can't play the game. Now I'm wondering
 can microsoft reimburse me for the disc since the xbox broke it not me. I hope they can reimburse me for this.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Yeah, your console tipped, and the disc scratched that's not Microsoft's fault, unfortunately. They tell you not to move the console in the manual and even on the sticker that first comes with the console when you get it on the disc tray.<br />
<br />
If the disc is within it's first 90 days of ownership you can reach out to Rockstar Games and ask them for a replacement as long as you have your receipt. You should be able to reach them by visiting this page
<strong><a href="http://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> and filling out the ticket request.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Are you genuinely asking me the question of "<span><em>How does this pertain to Windows Update functionality?"</em></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How doesn't it? Before my upgrade from windows 7 premium to windows 8.1 pro everything worked perfectly. Since I upgraded the software, I have been hit by number of glitches as mentioned above. I have had to put in so many hours to research, find the necessary
 info, etc to try and resolve this so I can get everything up and running again like it was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just so you know, as a consumer I also own a macbookpro and trust me I have NEVER EVER faced any issues irrespective of which OS software I have updated from. And talking about that, I have so many friends, colleagues and relatives too owning macs and I
 have never heard them complain about any such issues. So as a consumer, I see this as Windows 8 issue. Simple. I bought into windows upgrade and all it has done is caused problems/issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is more frustrating is that on reaching out to Microsoft Windows customer support I was told that I need to pay an additional $99 - $149 to help resolve the issues? On what basis &amp; Why? If a customer is upgrading his software from a previous software
 of yours, this should be FOC and if there is going to be a fee involved, it should be mentioned right upfront at the time of the upgrade. So we know the cost of buying into the software + support ecosystem. So for me, I have been CHEATED! This is what is called
 day light robbery. All I know is, this is the last time I every buy into a windows product. No wonder Microsoft needs to downsize and restructure the company. Satya Nadella has a massive challenge on his hands to revamp the organization and keep it from dying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways coming back to my issue, yes I did use the upgrade assistant. On upgrading, the windows software automatically recommended to use this option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS - This is not an attack on you. I just want people to read and understand the kind of ecosystem they are buying into and how it works.

            <p>How can it be not related to upgrading a computer to Win8.1. I too am an Ideapad Z580 owner. Ever since the upgrade I am facing exactly the same problems but these problems are just subset of all my other issues that I am facing with Windows 10 pro upgrade.
 I tried to find the compatible drivers for the Lenovo utilities. Luckily at least could find only a few.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I regret my decision of going for windows laptop rather than taking mac PC.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's wise to run the Upgrade Assistant which examines the hardware in your machine and identifies issues which might arise when you upgrade. Better to be forewarned so to speak.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you're past the point now. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What I suggest you do now is to go to the following Lenovo support link, click the
<em>Window 8.1</em> button and then click the "Troubleshoot" button which will appear underneath.
<a href="https://support.lenovo.com/gb/en/windows-support#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.lenovo.com/gb/en/windows-support#</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are quite a few links there which might help in your present predicament.

<h2>            Start menu inoperable and nothing working after reset of new 2017 Surface Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just traded my 2017 macbook pro for an equivalent spec 2017 Surface Pro, and did a full reset to factory with the full disk clean option to ensure there was nothing lurking in hiding on the SSD, and after the reset process finished reinstalling windows
 nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>Left clicking the start menu does absolutely nothing. Right clicking it brings up the secondary menu, but only task manager, run, and Powershell seem to work.<br />
I have done a bit of reading and have already tried the sfc and dism commands through powershell.</p>
<p>Sfc came back with 0 faults, dism command seemed to do nothing.</p>
<p>I have tried the regedit tweak changing the value of start to 4 in the registry</p>
<p>I have reset the System 4 times in total with zero variation in results.</p>
<p>I tried forcing an update with run - wuauclt which seemed to think about doing something for a second, then resumed doing absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>And I have tried reinstalling windows apps via power shell with the command "<span style="color: rgba(58, 58, 58, 1)">Get</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 192, 203, 1)">-</span><span style="color: rgba(58, 58, 58, 1)">AppXPackage

</span><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 0, 1)">"$($_.InstallLocation)AppXManifest.xml"</span><span>}"</span></p>
<p>this last action seemed to shed the most light on the cause of the problem as the whole screen filled with red error messages telling me that
 the action could not be completed as the path didn't exist for any of the apps it was attempting to install.<br />
I'm thinking that somehow the recovery partition of Windows on this 2017 Surface Pro has a problem and isn't installing any of the windows apps when it installs the base system.</p>
<p>At the moment I've made a new recovery USB on my old Lenovo windows10 rig and am using that to try and force it to download an update and then probably reset it for a 5th time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's getting to be a bit of a joke at this point though.&nbsp;<br />
Any time I had to reset any of my old macbooks I have just told it to reset and come back 20 mins later to a fresh install. Zero problems, zero fuss.<br />
I made the switch back to windows because some apps that would make my work much easier are only available on windows, but so far I am most disappointed with the whole experience. Isn't Microsoft one of the world leaders in computer technology? How can a simple
 reset on one of their premium models be such an arduous task?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this problem? and if so how did you manage to fix it?<br />

            Hi there Josh, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />I understand your frustration - system issues like this can be tricky to fix. It sounds like you've tried every single step I would normally recommend, so all I can say now is to continue with the repair from bootable USB drive, as that's the last thing I would normally suggest before taking the PC back to the manufacturer for repairs.
<br />
<br />You mentioned you've already done a fresh install of Windows, but here's some more information about clean installations in case there's any steps you missed:

<p>Hi Graeme,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah, I'm hoping the bootable USB will fix the issue, but I'm not heaps confident about it.<br />
The Surface Pro seems to refuse to boot directly into the USB no matter the UEFI Boot configuration. I even had External USB set as the ONLY boot option and it wouldn't give me results.<br />
<p>
</p><p>As for returning it to the manufacturer, it's a Microsoft Surface Pro, So the manufacturer is Microsoft, but I obtained it second hand, through a trade for my macbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure where it was originally purchased from, or whether Microsoft has a similar Limited Warranty process as Apple, in which the serial number functions as an indicator of remaining warranty, or whether I'm going to need to try and get a receipt from
 the guy I swapped with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although, I did have a play with it prior to us resetting it, and before the reset, it worked perfectly, so I can't see it being a hardware fault. Surely it's a fault in the installer.</p>

            Sounds like you're right, a fault with the installer. The link I provided above to create installation media for a fresh install should fix that issue, however if it doesn't, you could try installing an earlier version of Windows, one before 1803. It might help. Otherwise we'll see what else we can try!

<p>Alright, it's fixed now.</p>
<p>If anyone else is having this same issue, here's how I fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1/ I had to download a Windows 10 media creation tool from microsoft and make a new bootable recovery usb on a different computer, since edge didn't exist on the broken installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2/ Getting the surface to boot from the USB seems to be impossible, but you can open the setup.exe from in windows explorer on the broken installation. You can choose to keep personal files or wipe everything and start fresh. I chose to keep personal files
 (there wasn't any on there, but I figured the ssd had been wiped enough through all the other failed installations)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3/ leave it alone while it does it's thing</p>
<p>
</p><p>4/ create new recovery drive on the SSD once installation has finished</p>

<p>Hello joshmurray1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't thank you enough for pointing me to the solution to this problem.&nbsp; I was all set to pack up the computer and send it back my Surface Pro (Series 5) to Microsoft to fix at a cost of GBP 333 (because it's out of warranty).&nbsp; So I owe you a couple of
 beers I think!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously though, I wasted most of today trying to work this out, time I shall never get back :-( &nbsp; I used to think if I got everything Microsoft, no cutting corners, everything would work as it should do out of the box.&nbsp; But it doesn't.&nbsp; I don't know what
 the answer is.&nbsp; Patience, I guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With best wishes.</p>

<h2>            Reusing Windows 7 license after free upgrade to Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if I will be free to reuse my Windows 7 license key after the free upgrade to Windows 10 this July 29th.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already reserved my copy, and yes I'm quite excited. The only issue I see is because this is an OEM version of Windows 7 for Sony VAIO, so maybe it won't be compatible if I use it in a new computer? If I can at all?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you guys understand my question and good day!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your present Windows 7 OEM License becomes part of the Upgrade to Windows 10 process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you can not reinstall Windows 7 either as a dual boot in your Sony or move it to another machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OEM Licenses you can not transfer anyway.</p>
<p>OEM Licenses are tied to the first machine they are installed on and die when that machine dies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

<h2>            WINDOWS 10 DOESNT RECOGNIZE USB ATTACHMENTS SUCHS AS DIGITAL CAMERAS</h2>
                    When I attach my digital camera, which is a Nikon coolpix L620, it recognizes it as an unknown device and then as a Nikon coolpix L620. then it says it cant locate drivers online or in the operating system itself. Then it shuts off. I have noticed many
 other people have this problem. IS WINDOWS 10 doing anything to solve this problem?

            Well, I have another digital camera that works fine when you connect it to the PC with Windows 10 or Vista. &nbsp;I'm beginning to think its the camera, not Windows 10 or Vista, that's causing the problem. Some camera manufactures sell thier drivers on a CD
 that that comes with the product and is only good for whatever operating system it was designed for, what's more, they do not include those drivers on the Internet. In other words, if you lose your CD, your out of luck unless the manufacturer sells you one
 for $20 to $30. The camera in question is a Nikon Coolpix L620 that was out only 3 years ago.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>When I connect it the screen on it gives me an option of USB or I can use it as a cam. When I select either it connects</p>

            Exactly, my first digital camera ( the one that works on the computer) also gives me an option to connect to the computer and if nothing is selected, it shuts off after about 2 minutes but the other camera, the Nikon Cooplix L 620 camera, when I connect
 it, &nbsp;there is no option on the camera &nbsp;to connect to anything and &nbsp;Windows recognizes the camera in the device manager as an unknown device and in the sub folder as a Nikon camera, then I update the drivers and after that then it starts searching for the drivers
 online or in the computer and then tells me it can't locate any drivers for the camera. It tells me to contact the manufacture of the device. It could be a " mass storage device" problem on the camera itself, but I can't find it on the camera &nbsp;so l suppose
 only Nikon would know how to handle that issue. I don't know, it's weird. It should work but it doesn't. Very frustrating indeed.&nbsp;

you should install this</a> before you connect the camera.</p>

            <p>After checking that link you provided, Nikon says that it's not available for my device (Nikon Coolpix L620) . I've also tried connecting the camera without a hub ( direct USB connection) the same thing happens, the computer will recognize it in device manager
 as &nbsp;an unknown imaging device and ask me if I want to update the drivers for the device. I say &nbsp;yes, so it search online and then inside of the computer itself to see if it can find the appropate drivers , then it tells me it can't find the drivers. I don't
 get it. I have another &nbsp;digital camera that works fine when I connect it to the PC without having to search for drivers. I feel the problem is with the camera itself. It may have something to do with "mass storage mode" which I cannot find on the cameras set
 up menu. This camera is. a Nikon Coolpix L620 that was discontinued only 3 years ago, so it's still somewhat current, &nbsp;I don't have the original CD that came with the camera and I feel that if there are any drivers, they were on that CD and NIkon doesn't seem
 to be offering them on their website. The camera may have beern damaged by being dropped on the ground although everything works fine. I'll I try calling Nikon and see what they have to say. If I can't get it to work with the computer then, I'll have to take
 out the SD card after every shooting and place it in a card reader. Thank you for your advice, I appreciated it.&nbsp;</p>

            I couldn't see anything there. Nikon said there isn't anything available on that particular model on that particular download link. After contacting Nikon and explaining the problem to them, they said to download certain software which they gave me a link
 to and this software a has the drivers in it for the Coolpix L620. Okay. If this doesn't work then there is one more thing that could be causing the USB connection problem, this concerns the " mass storage mode" which can interfere with USB connection. I don't
 know where that is on the user manual or the settings menu on the camera. I will have to contact Nikon again and see what they have to say about that. If all else fails,I won't be able to hook up the camera with a USB connection so I will have to &nbsp;take out
 the SD card and put it in a card reader to view and transfer videos and photos. Thanks for all your help I appreciate it.

                    <p>I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 yesterday, and one of the things I noticed is the new settings layout for wallpapers. That's all well and good, but how do you

<h2>            Assigning a keystroke to my Comfort Mouse 3000 magnify button</h2>
                    Is there a way to assign Windows-M, for 'minimize all', to the magnify button of my Comfort Mouse 3000? It only seems to accept key combinations with Alt, Ctrl, or Shift. And assigning 'show desktop' does not work for what I want it to do. That also gets
 rid of necessary widgets on my desktop that I need to see. Windows-M does the trick, but I can't figure out how to assign that to the side mouse button. Thanks.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the IntelliPoint only supports ALT, CTRL, and SHIFT as you found out. There maybe some<br />
3rd party software that can do this however if there is I have no clue as to what it is.<br />

<h2>            Nowadays in 2019&#58; second hand Xbox 360 Slim or Super Slim&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello guys!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am planning to buy a Xbox 360 in a second hand shop. There are several options and I am not sure which of them could be the best. My last console was the super nintendo, so I am a bit lost and I need some help please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- There are 2 options in my mind: Xbox 360 Slim or Xbox 360 Super Slim?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have heard that the Slim has stronger outside plastic. Any problems with the outside plastic of the Super Slim?</p>
<p>Also the buttons are different: tactile for the Slim, normal for the Super Slim. Any problems with the tactile buttons?</p>
<p>What about the refrigeration? it is maybe the same?</p>
<p>and the noise?</p>
<p>what console give less problems or has longer life?</p>
<p>and what it is easier to maintain?</p>
<p>we are in 2019... is the Slim too old to buy it second hand? or both consoles can be the same old? (probably they kept producing both consoles at the same time?)</p>
<p>any other difference between both consoles?</p>
<p>what console of these two do you recommend me to buy nowadays in a second hand shop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking forward to hearing from you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

            Personally, if were me I would not buy the 360.&nbsp; I would look for a used Xbox One if I were going to buy a used console.&nbsp; Just a word of caution make sure the console has not been banned permanently no matter which one you decide to go with.

<p>Why not just get an Xbox One? Is there something specific you're looking for on the 360?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I had to choose between the two though, I would go for the slim.</p>

<p>thank you very much for your response Parity and Galaxy Golden,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have any problem with the console I can ask for a replacement. In that shop there is a warranty of 2 years. Maybe if it is banned I could ask for a replacement? maybe... i am not sure... anyway, that is a good point, and I will ask this to the shop.
 Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>yes I understand what you mean... the thing is that the Xbox One is twice the price of the Xbox 360 second hand... and also the games are much cheaper for the Xbox 360... but maybe in a future not too far I can upgrade to the Xbox One.... actualy I am a
 bit lost and I don't know if the Xbox Live gold includes any games for the Xbox One to be downloaded monthly... I don't know, but the prices of the Xbox One games are out of my budget. As I said, my last console was the super nintendo... and I just want to
 play to explore the these "new" consoles and "new" games (they are new for me)... and the Xbox 360 is a good console with good graphics and a lot of games and they are very cheap. I just want to play and I think the Xbox 360 it is very affordable for me and
 suitable in my case... I just want to play and explore... and maybe in a future I decide to upgrade to the Xbox One... but right now I think that it is not affordable for me to do what I want to do, as I said before... anyway, if you think that I am totaly
 wrong, tell me why please</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyway at the same time, I am waiting for more responses to the original question that I made in this post,</p>
<p>

            it looks like more people prefer the Slim... even being a little bit older.... but why not the super slim? it is just for the outside plastic? maybe it gives some kind of problem? thanks

            sorry i am a bit lost... why a Xbox One instead? i don't know if there is a way to enjoy so many games like with the Xbox 360 without worry too much about the money... definitly it is not time for me to buy a Xbox One... I would like to play to a lot of
 games... but this is not affordable for me with an Xbox One... I don't know if in the Xbox live gold it is affordable, but in the shop it is not at all. Do you mean to play to Xbox 360 games? thanks. All the best

<p>Also I need some help to choose the Hard Drive of the console please. If you can help me, that would be great!:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the shop there are several options about the Hard Drive that comes with the console (both for the Slim and the Super Slim): No HD, 4GB, 250GB, 320GB, 500GB</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>any of these consoles are more recommendable than the rest? or they are the same but with different hard drive? which of them are older models?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have heard that in the case of the 4GB, the 4GB are integrated in the motherboard and there is still a free slot to add the common Hard Drive. It is that true? Any problems with the Hard Drive of 4GB? Could
 I get the Xbox 360 with 4GB and add a 250GB hard Drive for example?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>How many GB of hard drive do I need to enjoy the Xbox 360 games without problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How many GB do you recommend me for the Xbox 360?</p>
<p>
</p><p>and what about the non-official Hard Drives? there are problems of compatibility?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking forward to hearing from you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best</p>
<p>Thanks a lot guys</p>

            Hi , this is Andre from the Microsoft Community. 

Lets see if we can get your problem resolved.

Are you saying, adjusting the Scale and layout in Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display and choosing (Recommended) does not help?

Have you tried uninstalling then reinstall your display adapter to see if it helps?

Press Windows key + X
Click Device Manager
Expand Display adapter
Right click the adapter then click uninstall, then click uninstall. 

Best,
Andre

<h2>            Microphone jack recognized as line in</h2>
                    <p>Hello, &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>after installing the VIA Audio driver on my pc, the microphone stopped being correctly recognized, when i plug the mic on the
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">pink jack(the microphone jack)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;the program see it like it was plugged to the&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">line in</span>&nbsp;port as in the screenshot bellow:&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>also, the port set as default &nbsp;goes away when i unplug the conector.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i dont have a front panel jack, but the system thinks that there is one. </p>
<p>is there a way to re-assign the jacks?</p>
<p>
</p><p>any suggestions please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>when i roll back the driver, the mic starts to work again, but then, the driver doesn't recognize my headphone, just the hdmi ports from my GPU:</p>

    <title>High Definition Audio Device causes cursor lag spikes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hypernova0  say:</h3>
<h2>            High Definition Audio Device causes cursor lag spikes</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have been having mouse issues for several hours. About every ten seconds, the cursor will freeze in place, and then catch up to where my mouse is about a second later. As mild as it is, it's very annoying. I went through the usual steps, updating mouse
 drivers, graphics card drivers, plugging into different usb ports etc. In safe mode, this didn't happen. Task manager showed no spikes in disk or CPU usage when the cursor lag happened. I finally found a tip that audio drivers can sometimes interfere with
 the mouse. In my device manager, I have two audio drivers. "High Definition Audio Device" by Microsoft, and NVIDIA High Definition Audio. Disabling or uninstalling NVIDIA High Definition Audio does nothing, but when I disable or uninstall High Definition Audio
 Device, the lag spikes don't happen. Of course, then I have no audio. What can I do? Do I have to choose audio or functional mouse?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time.</p>
