<p><span>Hi Georgia John,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Windows Vista answers forum.</span></p>
<p><span>Sometime user account automatically logs off if the there is a change in the registry entry due to some viruses
 on the computer. To solve this problem you need to make few changes in the registry.</span></p>
<p><span>However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you
 follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, follow the steps as in the KB Article:<br />

<h2>            Help Finding&#47;Downloading these specific drivers</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A wonderful member of this forum recently diagnosed a BSoD problem for me.&nbsp; As part of the solution, it was strongly recommended I update a set of 7 drivers on my system.&nbsp; I think I have successfully done 2 of them.&nbsp; I absolutely cannot find the correct
 website or location from where to do so.&nbsp; He gave me direction to go to carrona.org and sysnative.com, which I've done and found all but 2 of these.&nbsp; For the most part, the links from those sites don't get me anywhere.&nbsp; Straight out Google'ing these has gotten
 me nowhere (mostly)&nbsp; The list is below, with some notes on how&nbsp;far I've gotten so far.&nbsp; I'd appreciate ANY direction anyone can give me on these:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>livecamv.sys&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2/5/2007 4:36:46 AM

<li>Made by Creative, Inc. for a Live Cam System</li><li>Found on my system in Device Manager under Sound, Video and Game Controllers as "Live! Cam Virtual"</li><li>Found the Software under Programs as Creative&gt;Creative Live! Cam &gt; Live! Cam Avatar and Avatar Creator, but no software menu options to check for updates.</li><li>Found on carrona and sysnative, but the links are to Creative website and I have no idea what actual camera I have in my monitor.&nbsp; Not to mention the driver sounds like it's more for software since it's a virtual avatar creator.&nbsp; I'm debating uninstalling
 it cause I never use that program...EVER&nbsp;since '07 when I bought this thing.&nbsp;</li><li>This one I can't find anywhere on the internet doing traditional search.&nbsp; </li><li>Found in the System 32/Drivers folder though as dated.&nbsp;</li></ul>

 the old file resided.&nbsp;&nbsp;That included the System 32/drivers folder as well as overwriting the newly created Microsoft xbox accessory under program files.&nbsp; It wouldn't allow me to overwrite the Driver Store/File Repository, which I assume is good in case of
 rollbacks.</li><li>It is now in System 32/drivers with a date of 2/25/2015.</li><li>I'm just not sure if this is acceptable way to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>NOTE:&nbsp; I DID THIS ONE AND THE ONE&nbsp;ABOVE FIRST AND FORCED THEM IN THIS WAY CAUSE THEY BOTH HAD KNOWN BSOD ISSUES ACCORDING TO CARRONA.ORG</li></ul>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read the link and tried the compatibility mode on a couple of the programs.&nbsp; I don't have problems running any programs now in Windows 7 or before in vista.&nbsp; I am only trying to update those drivers cause you recommended to do so from my other thread (cause
 of the crashes and blue screens I thought).&nbsp; I can't even find any driver update programs or anything for those drivers.&nbsp; I can't even find anywhere to download just the driver and do it myself for about 3 of them.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>
<p><br />

</p><p>Look, if you are not crashing I would not be worried about an oldish driver.&nbsp; You may not be able to find a newer version (or in some cases any version).&nbsp; I have a database of over 150,000 drivers and still find 5-10 a day that I do not have.</p>

</p><p>Yes, the crashes stopped.&nbsp; And no, I can't find 4 of those you listed at all yet.&nbsp; I'll try another little bit then give up.&nbsp; The crashes have stopped entirely since uninstalling Norton.&nbsp; Thanks so much!!&nbsp; You (all) are awesome!!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
As OEM HP is responsible for the proper operation of the printer/scanner<br />
and their supplied drivers. Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation <br />
and&nbsp; drivers, and ask in their forums. <br />

    <title>A folder was deleted or moved after updating to Windows 10, and I - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shawnschroeder  say:</h3>
<h2>            A folder was deleted or moved after updating to Windows 10, and I cannot find it</h2>
                    I had a very important folder with numerous subfolders, files, etc (mostly MS Office files) for work saved on my desktop. After updating to Windows 10, it is gone and I cannot find it. When I try to open files that were saved in the folder through MS Word,
 PPT, etc, I receive a msg saying the folder has been moved, renamed or deleted. This is an extremely important folder, but since I had read that the update would not affect files, I didn't feel the need to back it up. Now I am extremely frustrated at the thought
 that the update would have deleted this folder. Please help.

<p>Windows may not be done re-copying your files back after the upgrade.&nbsp; You should start by simply restarting the computer from the Start&gt;Power menu (don't just hold the power button, use the menu).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it still doesn't show up, your files will be in:</p>

            <p>I have restarted and the folder still did not show up. It is not in either location your suggested.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is showing up under Quick Access, but when I click on it, I get a msg saying the location is unavailable. It does give me the following location of the folder I am looking for. It is: C:\Windows.old\Documents and Settings\Owner\desktop\SCC. BUt the folder
 is not there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried searching for the folder by name, but with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to go back to my previous version of Windows and recover everything as it was before?</p>

            <p>Cool - you can go back by going to Settings app, then Update &amp; Security and choosing Recovery.&nbsp; You'll see the roll-back option as long as you didn't install from a CD/USB stick.&nbsp; The roll back is only possible if you did a direct upgrade, not a custom install
 yourself -- and only if you came from Windows 7 or 8.1.</p>

            Hey Shawn, I just did some looking -- that path you mentioned that starts with "C:\Windows.Old\Documents and Settings" -- that "Documents and Settings" should be called "users" in newer versions of Windows (7 and forward, I can't remember if Vista did
 it).&nbsp; So I suspect perhaps you came from Windows XP.&nbsp; That shouldn't a problem so to speak, but it might mean you need to manually explore those folders to find the files.

            That could be, but when I restore it says my previous version is Windows 7. I've tried to manually open those folders, but the folders I'm looking for are no where to be found. I've tried many different things at this point. When I restored back to my
 previous version of windows, the files and folders are STILL missing. The shortcuts I had created on the desktop have been restored, but the original files are gone so I still cannot access them. I've tried many different things to gain access to them (i.e.,
 right-clicking on the shortcuts and trying to restore previous versions, other options under properties, etc) , but with no luck. It is very weird; it's like the original files have somehow been completely deleted from my hard drive during the conversion to
 Windows 10. All of my recent files are visible when in the programs like Word and PPT, but when I click on them I get a msg stating the files have been moved or deleted. ?<br />

            <p>Try this out:&nbsp; open your C: drive and then type kind:document into the search box at the top (example video&nbsp;below). This will take a while, but it should find every document on the entire computer, and hopefully find the missing ones.</p>

            Thanks for your help, but no, they are gone. No sign of the folder or its contents anywhere on the C drive or anywhere else on my computer. I wonder if the folder was corrupt, or if it wasn't saved or stored correctly when I updated from Windows XP to
 Windows 7 years ago?? I had been using the shortcut on my desktop for so long, I guess I lost track of where the original file had been stored on my computer. I thought I had created the folder directly on my C: drive. I had this hard drive partitioned in
 the past, but removed the partition years ago. Wonder if that has had an effect somehow?<br />

I appreciate your interest in windows 10 . I understand the inconvenience you faced. I will&nbsp;help you with this.</div>

            <p>Done that repeatedly but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did not have this problem on Win7 with exactly the same app and hence it must be Win10 related - and logically it cannot be machine-specific.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Threads on the community forum suggest that regserv is somehow to blame for FM20.dll not writing to the registry - running regserv from the cmd line is however above my proficiency unless I have explicit step-by-step instructions.</p>

            <p>Hello Saikalycharbel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Command+%26+Conquer%3a+Generals+and+Zero+Hour&amp;vendor=EA&amp;ModelOrVersion=1&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=Windows+8.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em>article</em></a> Command &amp; Conquer: Generals and Zero Hour, isn't compatible with Windows 8.1 as the specification of the program is not made (by it's software publisher) for Windows 8 or Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most programs created for earlier versions of Windows&nbsp;should work in&nbsp;Windows 8 or&nbsp;8.1, but some older programs might run poorly or not at all. You can run the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter on most programs to detect and fix common compatibility problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A. Run the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter. If issue is still not fixed,</p>
<p>B. Change compatibility settings manually</p>

<h2>            Remove Audio, Not Mute Audio in Movie Maker Project.</h2>
                    <p>I do not want to mute audio in my Movie Maker Project, I want&nbsp;the complete audio file(s)&nbsp;removed.&nbsp; Do I have to recreate the video portion?&nbsp; Mtuing means the sound data is still present, resident in the project, but has been ignored by the sound hardware.&nbsp;
 I&nbsp; want the bits gone.</p>
<p>Muting the audio and adding a new sound means I have two sounds in the project, but one is muted.&nbsp; This is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Any advice or should I just get Adobe, FinalCut Pro, or Vegas?</p>

            <p>All editing within Movie Maker works on a copy of your original source file.&nbsp; The original file is untouched.&nbsp; So when you say you want to "remove audio", the only way to do that is by saving a copy of the movie without audio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two ways to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>By muting the audio track and then saving your movie.&nbsp; This is the method that PapaJohn mentioned.&nbsp; I believe this creates a file that still has associated audio, but it is just blank (e.g. a volume of zero).&nbsp; I don't believe this should be a big problem,
 but if you truly want a file with no audio, see method #2.</li><li>When saving your movie, instead of picking one of the default output profiles, scroll to the bottom of the list and choose 'Create custom setting'.&nbsp; You can set your video settings.&nbsp; When choosing the audio settings, pick the last option of 'No audio'.&nbsp;
 Give that setting a name and then use it for saving your movie.&nbsp; In my testing, a 2 minute file was about 200k smaller without the added audio, compared to the muted audio.&nbsp; Not huge, but perhaps it is enough to warrant making a custom profile if you plan
 to do this frequently.</li></ol>

<p>
</p><p>We realize your requirement in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you concerned about downloading Windows spotlight images?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Spotlight is a great feature that comes with Windows 10. Windows Spotlight will slide images on the lock screen, that which comes from Microsoft
<span>Bing.com. It will also allow you to rate your experience with those images. Basis to that, images will be displayed on the lock screen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, currently we don't have an option to download those images. I mean to say, there is no way to download those images, due to some privacy restrictions. Post your feedback on this using Windows Feedback app, which will help us to look into this
 option with future update. It also help us to improve your experience.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Keep posted if you require further assistance.</span></p>

<p>Not all programs are listed in "Set Default Programs."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel, however, is one of the listed programs.&nbsp; On the other hand XML is not a file type that generally is associated with Excel, and thus it is not included in the list of default file types for Excel.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I no longer have Office 2010 installed, but Excel 2016 will open at least some XML files (I dragged and dropped an XML file onto the open Excel window) and I assume that Excel 2010 will do the same:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d019b88-74a3-4254-bb99-07bf8399795a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d019b88-74a3-4254-bb99-07bf8399795a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Assuming that you really want Excel to open XML files (and not XLM files), right-click on any XML file and select "Open with &gt; Choose default program ..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel is not likely to be in either the list of "Recommended Programs" or "Other Programs," so click the "Browse" button and navigate to C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14 and select EXCEL.EXE (if you have a 64-bit installation of Windows, go to
 C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14). </p>
<p>
</p><p>To make this the default, be sure to check the box to "Always use the selected program to open this kind of file."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click OK</p>

<p>I re-installed Office with help of MS support a week ago (all doc were opening saying another version already open).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although in associations excel is listed as default, when I right click on xlsx receive message "The file does not have a program associated....." although properties says opens with excel.</p>
<p>If I click to open I get message "There was a problem sending the command to the program" say OK and a new (blank) worksheet opens.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>This is now a different problem, correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds to me as if something got corrupted during the re-install.&nbsp; I don't have a solution, but I have some suggestions to try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Set Default Programs, select Excel 2010 in the list, and click "Set this program as default" to assign to it all file types and protocols that it can open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't fix things, go to Set Associations and set xlsx to open with something other than Excel, for example Notepad.</p>
<p>After you make that change, double-click an xlsx file.&nbsp; It should open in Notepad (but the contents will not be useful).</p>
<p>Now go back to Set Associations and change xlsx back to Excel 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know what happens.</p>

<p>Office14 is Office 2010.&nbsp; Office15 is Office 2013.&nbsp; The two designations were in sync for Office 2016 (Office16), but now Office 2019 is still Office16.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Office15 entries in the Registry are probably for some viewer or other component you might have installed at some point.&nbsp; I suggest
<strong>not </strong>deleting anything in the registry manually.&nbsp; If you can't resist the urge to manually edit the registry, at the very least, make a registry backup and/or a System Restore point first.&nbsp; There is no "undo" function in the registry; changes
 take immediate effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had thought about trying to give you a *.reg file to restore the .xlsx file association, but it's just too complex for me to know all of the registry entries that are involved.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>Here's what is probably a relatively safe procedure (I assume that you have some sort of installation media such as a CD or ISO file).</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Make sure you have the Product Key for your version of Office (Office 2010).&nbsp; Ideally, this would be on the packaging from when you purchased Office, but you can also use ProduKey from Nirsoft to recover the Product Key from a working installation of
 Office:&nbsp; <a href="http://nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html</a> (the link under "Related Links" is for a commercial version, not the free version; the free version should be adequate for almost all purposes related to MS Office).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Uninstall Office in the normal manner, from Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Download and run the free trial of Pro version of Revo Uninstaller (<a href="https://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html</a>).&nbsp;
 Use the "Scanning for leftovers after the standard uninstall," "Forced Uninstall," and "Extended scanning for leftovers" methods (there's probably some overlap in these tools, but you should try to get rid of as much as possible).</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Reinstall Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You've reached the limit of my knowledge on this subject.&nbsp; If the reinstall doesn't fix things, I suggest that you start a new question thread in the Office 2010/Excel section of Microsoft Community:&nbsp;

    <title>Slow internet connection issue. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopher mistopher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow internet connection issue.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I recently bought an ASUS laptop and am currently running windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a bit of trouble with my Wifi connection. The wireless LAN card currently installed is the Ralink 802.11n Wireless LAN Card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been getting very low speeds, ranging from 0.5 mbps to 2.0 mbps when running my laptop under normal conditions on a range of networks that I should be getting much higher speeds, 20~50Mpbs. I have updated, uninstalled, reinstalled, and reupdated the
 driver for this LAN card a few times now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But here is where my problem gets interesting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When booting up in safe mode with networking and minimizing software interactions, I am easily able to get speeds over 20mbps, so I have ruled out that card itself. I know the LAN card works and its driver works fine. My problem is that something on my laptop,
 when running under normal conditions, is causing my speeds to fall drastically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried analyzing network activity and my TCP connections in the Resource Manager, but have not found anything out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run numerous virus/malware scans and have explored my registry a little bit, deleting obviously malicious keys (don't worry I looked up the keys before deleting)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions for pinpointing the cause of the drastic speed loss would be greatly appreciated. I'd rather not do a full system wipe, but at this point that's what I'm considering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm able to get perfectly normal speeds when connected directly via ehternet cable, so it is something affecting my wireless card only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Original title:How can I pinpoint what is limiting my wifi connection speed so drastically?</p>

<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for providing the detailed information regarding the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>As I understand you are getting a low internet speed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You have also mentioned you tried few troubleshooting steps like uninstalling and re-installing the network adapter driver, running antivirus scan and placing the computer in safe mode with networking.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Wireless signal may show low if your PC is too far from the wireless router or access point or if some other device which is connected to wireless router is utilizing the network strength or due to third party
 software conflicts. If any devices like these are near your computer, turn them off temporarily or move them farther away. You may move your computer as nearer as possible to the router and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Have you installed </span><span>any third party security software?</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As you have mentioned you get a proper inter speed while placing the computer in safe mode with networking.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to place the computer in a clean boot and check if it resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Clean boot is one of the troubleshooting techniques which allows you to get the computer to a state where you can perform diagnostic tests to narrow down to the elements of the normal boot process which are
 causing problems.</span></p>

            <p>I appreciate the quick response. As suggested, I tried running a clean boot by disabling all my startup programs as well as non-Microsoft services. However, it had no affect. The slow speeds persisted.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Christopher,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response. Sorry for the inconvenience as the issue still persists.</p>
<p>As you have mentioned Clean boot troubleshooting didn’t fix the issue, you have also tried several steps like Virus scan, uninstalling re-installing network adapter drivers, placing the computer in safe mode with networking and connecting the computer directly
 with Ethernet cable. You have also mentioned on different networks you get the proper internet speed.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
</span><strong>*This issue</strong> can be caused if the wireless router is old or not working properly. I suggest you to perform the speed test on the other computer or device connecting with the Wireless router you have and check the internet speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other Reason </strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">that can impact the internet speed.</span><strong>
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When connecting to a wireless network (Wi‑Fi), your Internet connection speed can be affected by both where your computer is located and whether other wireless devices are in the same area. Wireless networks operate on frequencies that are similar to those
 used by other devices, such as microwave ovens or cordless phones. Operating a 2.4 gigahertz (GHz) cordless phone next to your 2.4 GHz wireless laptop can cause interference, or completely block the wireless network connection. If you want to make phone calls
 while surfing the web, either use a wired telephone or a cordless phone that operates at a different frequency than your wireless network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
</span>Hope this helps. If you have further queries, we will be happy to help.</p>

<p>Hi Weslyb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post. If after the solution posted earlier has not affected the issue, the console may need to be serviced. For servicing options check out our
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Device Support</a> page to check your warranty status and create an order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi Weslyb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We don't recommend or encourage others to look into self repair or third party repair. If the console is in warranty you can use that to get your console serviced. Any tampering with the console will void any warranty the console may have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the device support page is not working for you then you will need to contact customer support for your region to assist you with a console service order.
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us">
<p>
</p><p>If the support link does not work for you either, then check out this thread for international support numbers to call the support number for your region:
