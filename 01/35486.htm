            <p>Thanks Robear ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I have simply&nbsp;did&nbsp;"Reset PC" to get it back to my factory setting (Though I lost all of my data, but I have back up of it ) . Then I used "Norton Removal Tool" to remove&nbsp;Norton which was there in orginal factory setting.
</p>
<p>Now I tried to start "Windows Defender" &amp; "Windows Firewall" both are running without any problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for help.</p>

<p>Hi Mikrose,</p>
<p>a. What is the make and model of your netbook?</p>
<p>You may need webcam drivers for Windows 7. I‚Äôd suggest you to visit the manufacturer‚Äôs website and download the Windows 7 compatible drivers and update the same.</p>
<p>Refer the link below</p>
<p>Refer the links below for more info on updating drivers:</p>

I've already updated my drivers too. I've tried asking MSI if there is a fix about this they say that the webcam is already on the OS or something like that.

            Hello,<br />
<br />
I am experiencing the same issue, and it is similar with many folks that I have spoken to on-line.&nbsp; The drivers are on the computer initially, it just does not work with the Windows 7.&nbsp; Then if you research and download the drivers it finds, it makes things
 worse.&nbsp; It may be downloading a different driver that does not make sense.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Very annoying that it is not compatible.&nbsp; I do not want to switch back to Windows XP and reload everything again.<br />
<br />
This issue is for all MSI Wind U100 notebooks.&nbsp; MSI is aware, but not doing anything since the drivers do work on other operating systems.&nbsp; It is an issue specifically when you load Windows 7 - the drivers are there, they are not compatible.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Ariel<br />
<br />
BTW - Now the webcam cannot be located by the typical Fn + F6.&nbsp; Then, when you go into device manager, it is no longer there.&nbsp; The issue begins as the webcam is there, then you can automatically update the driver.&nbsp; That makes things worse by eliminating the
 device from device manager, and then you can no longer enable it from the usual function - this is the current state.&nbsp; The device is just not there anymore.&nbsp; But it never will work with Windows 7 without a proper fix.<br />

<p>Working on similar issues on the U100/N1000 with Win 7 Pro (32bit). So far I have made progress but not to complete resolution. I've managed to get the webcam light on, now just trying to get a picture. So far this is what is successful. I'll keep you posted
 with updates as they happen. If anyone else has positive results please post. The solution could be something that gets pooled together.</p>
<p>What's looking positive.</p>
<p>- Webcam is reconized in the Device Manager as USB 2.0 Camera by default with Windows 7 Driver<br />
- Install Bison Cam (ftp://usftp.clevo.com.tw/M66xSR/Optional/Camera_VU.zip). The most recent drivers are for Vista but this will at least activate the camera on 7 and change the name of the
 device in the Device Manager.<br />
- Install the System Control Manager to get status of devices when toggling on/off through FN + F? (<a href="http://www.msi.com/index.php?func=downloadfile&amp;dno=8300&amp;type=utility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.msi.com/index.php?func=downloadfile&amp;dno=8300&amp;type=utility</a>)</p>
<p>The MSI website is the only one providing some updated drivers for 7. Avantec will not support any other OSes other then XP.</p>
<p>What's Next</p>
<p>- Install Video&nbsp;Drivers for Windows 7 as spcified on the MSI site. Possibility that a combination of specified drivers is needed to get the webcam working again.<br />
- Look for any Sonix Drivers for 7 or Vista.<br />
- May installed a different Virtual Machine that will allow the proper drivers to be installed.<br />
- May install other&nbsp;Cleveo software &amp; drivers. <br />
- May make some registry changes based on other forums to get video working.</p>
<p>Previous Scenarios</p>
<p>- Installed Virtual PC (MS based) w/ XP mode. The integration features won't allow the installation of previous drivers on XP Mode.<br />
- Installed updated version of CyberLink YouCam since it was there bundled with XP. No effect.<br />
- Removed USB 2.0 Camera from Device Manager and restarted to reload drivers. No effect</p>

You have to right click your camera in device manager &gt; update driver... &gt; 2nd button (explore my &nbsp;computer...) &gt; button (let me choose from list...)&nbsp;

            I have done all that was recommended for this problem and tried it on two Win7 computers with no luck. It lists the webcam in devices and printers, and also device manager. THere is just no way to turn it on. Webcam is an Vimicro USB Camera (Altair) Model
 C120a. I am running Win7 Pro. Any help is appreciated.

            <div>Hi <strong>Pamela</strong>,</div>
<div>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community!</div>
<div><br />
It seems like you have an issue with printing barcode from a website. </div>
<div>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. We are here to help and guide you in the right direction.</div>
<div><strong>I may need a few more information to understand the issue better.</strong></div>
<div>1. Do you face this issue only while printing from particular website?</div>
<div>2. Did you make any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue?<br />
3. What is the make and model number of the printer?</div>
<div>4. Which web browser are you using?</div>
<div>If you are using Internet Explorer try these steps and check if it helps.</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong><br />
I would suggest you to try printing a webpage running Internet Explorer as an Administrator. Check if there is any permission issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> You must use an account has administrator permission to change account type from Standard to Administrator.<br />
<strong><br />
To start Internet Explorer as an Administrator, follow these steps: </strong></div>
<div>a. <strong>Close </strong>all <strong>Internet Explorer </strong>windows. </div>
<div>b. Click <strong>Start </strong>and click on <strong>All Programs.</strong></div>
<div>c. <strong>Right click </strong>Internet Explorer and select <strong>Run As Administrator.<br />
</strong><br />
Browse to the website and try test printing the page that contains barcode, while running as the Administrator.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: </strong><br />
If the issue persists, try printing after disabling Protected Mode. Check if it helps.<br />
<br />
a. Click the <strong>Tools icon </strong>on <strong>Internet Explorer.</strong></div>
<div>b. Click the <strong>Security tab </strong>and <strong>uncheck </strong>the checkbox beside
<strong>Enable Protected Mode </strong>(requires restarting Internet Explorer). <br />
c. Click <strong>Apply</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>. </div>
<div>d. <strong>Close </strong>all open Internet Explorer windows, and then <strong>
restart </strong>Internet Explorer.<br />
e. <strong>Browse </strong>to the website and try test printing the page while running as the Administrator.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3: </strong><br />
If the issue is not resolved, try printing after disabling Add-on. Check if it helps.<br />
<br />
a) Open <strong>Internet Explorer </strong>in <strong>No Add-ons Mode</strong>.<br />
<br />
b) Click on <strong>Tools </strong>and click on <strong>Internet Options.</strong></div>
<div>c) Click on <strong>Programs </strong>and click on <strong>Manage add-ons </strong>
.<br />
<br />
d) Select an <strong>Addon </strong>and <strong>disable it</strong>.<br />
<br />
e) <strong>Restart </strong>Internet Explorer and <strong>Open </strong>Internet Explorer in normal mode.<br />
<br />
f) If the problem is solved after <strong>step d</strong>, than uninstall that Add-on from
<strong>Control Panel</strong> through <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong>.<br />

<h2>            Dear Epic - my opinion of things to fix in Gears of War 3, hope you read this</h2>
                    
<p>There needs to be a way when checking what new ribbons that you got that you can just search for new ones.&nbsp; when you scroll down through the menu it erases the gold exclamation point and I have no idea what I just got or not.&nbsp; maybe sort things regarding
 last match or newest ribbons.&nbsp; the things pop up so fast on the screen it is hard to keep track.&nbsp; very hard to track this.&nbsp; same with the medals.&nbsp; also I have no idea what ribbons or medals are for, or why you pick a default medal.</p>
<p>The snub pistol is way underpowered and so were the melee hits.&nbsp; I like using the beatdown to combat the shotguns in gears 1.</p>
<p>There needs to be a way to kick someone out of a public match.&nbsp; I know many times people were just signing up and not playing, getting credit for matches played because they can't be booted.&nbsp; The only way was to quit the match, but that sucks for all the
 players stuck on a team with these people.&nbsp; Maybe do a timed idle mode thing like they do in left 4 dead 2.</p>
<p>As for the **** rifles and shotguns, I think they were all weighted greatly.&nbsp; My rifles were very effective against the gnasher that I hate using.&nbsp; the retro was great.&nbsp; thanks for this.&nbsp; please do not make the shotguns more powerful.</p>

<p>snub pistol is slightly underpowered, then again it is a pistol, and most maps provide at least one or two weapons to switch the pistol with such as the boltok, so i wouldnt change the pistol at all</p>
<p>gears 3 has dedicated servers, no person within the game should be able to boot another person, one of the things that still bothers me about gears 1, the ability of a host to boot me after i *** them 3 times in a row, idle time resulting in a boot is a
 good idea</p>
<p>i dont think you have to worry about the rifles or shotguns changing much, everything is gunna stay the way it is, changing anything that drasticaly at this point after thousands have played the beta and know what to expect from gears 3 would only have support
 from very few in reality</p>
<p>melee is pretty much the only thing that shud be fixed, melee should still take 2 hits to down someone, 3 to kill, but if i put 50 bullets in someone, it should not still take 2 mellees to down, at that point the person should already be severely injured
 and should only take one melee to be downed, did anybody else experience this?</p>

<p>Melee is perfectly fine in the pistol, it was way to abused in Gears 1 and a cheap killing method.</p>
<p>Epic was banning people who were idle boosting in matches, and you get kicked out for not playing after a while.</p>
<p>Also, no one from Epic views these forums if you want them to see what you posted, then do it on their forums.

<p>I was fixing to say If you go idle for a few minutes during a match you get booted for "not participating".
</p>
<p>I'll admit the snub is a bit underpowered, but it never was an issue.The only thing I think that needs fixing is the range of the mantle kick, and there are a few times where the gnasher doesn't feel consistent. Oh and the TWO hammer of dawns on trenches....
 one is plenty.</p>

            I am having the same problem. I need to refresh my settings but when I go into recovery it tells me that my hard drive is locked and I need to unlock it. This happened after my PC froze during an update and now all my apps and tiles are gone from the start
 menu.&nbsp;

            Hi thanks for the help.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Sadly i have already done what you have said multiple times.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If i click on pc settings the purple backround with cog will load for 0.5 seconds then dispensar. Nothing happens, exact same with the store app.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Not able to access the oc settings at all</div>
<div><br />
<div>My pc is running windows 8.1 eyeinfinity, latest amd display drivers and one of the latest bios. Since i installed avg oc tuneup this problem occured. Didnt realise that i couldnt access pc settings so i backed up, not realising that i can use pc settings.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I cant refresh pc because i cant get access to the pc settings, when i boot to safe mode i cannot select a language even using a ps/2 keyboard and changing the bios to accept usb&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Im considering letting a Microsoft engineer access my pc to change the settings remotely.</div>

            After the microsoft engineer on the phone told me what i already knew, another engineer here on the forums helped me out here. This is a copy of the solution i found for anyone else who may come across this in the future :)

<ul>
<li>Sometimes, after upgrading to Windows 8.1, the Store App may not start.</li><li>It might still show the number of available updates on the Live Tile.</li><li>Starting the app may show a progress ring&nbsp;but it may not finish loading.</li></ul>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>To fix this, run the following in a Command Window (CMD) to re-register the Store App:</li></ul>
<p>
<span>powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $Env:SystemRoot\WinStore\AppxManifest.XML</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>If you get&nbsp;error&nbsp;<strong>0x8007064A</strong>&nbsp;after executing this, it means that the registry key "<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</strong>\Software\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AppModel\Repository\<strong>Packages</strong>"
 does not have<strong>SYSTEM</strong>&nbsp;as the owner.</li><li>Change the owner back to SYSTEM as explained&nbsp;<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc786173(v=WS.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&nbsp;and try again.</li></ul>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>To fix&nbsp;three other system apps such as PC Settings, run the following:</li></ul>
<p>
<span>powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $Env:SystemRoot\camera\AppxManifest.xml</span></p>

    <title>Not able to set up Windows Hello - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aye tee why  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not able to set up Windows Hello</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer I have is a Dell Inspiron 13 7378 2-in-1. With version 1709</p>
<p>
</p><p>For about 2 months now I haven't been able to use Windows Hello. It seems like it maybe reset somehow. Everytime I go back to Face Recognition and Set-up I go through the process of looking in the camera then putting in a pin number and hitting ok. But after
 that it doesn't seem to confirm anything. It still says Set-up and I try to do it again and nothing. I have updated the drivers as well. So I was wondering if this was a Windows thing or maybe even Dell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 2: So I created a PIN and it let me do that. It says remove or change after doing that. But now when I try to do the facial recognition I put my pin in and the camera won't even load. It just sits on the white screen and all I can do is hit cancel.</p>

<p>Hello Aye Tee Why, <br />
<br />
I'd like to get more information regarding this so we could further check and provide a more established workaround.<br />
<br />
Any changes made to the system that might have caused the issue?<br />
<br />
Since you've mentioned to have updated the driver, I recommend manually downloading the latest driver from the hardware vendor‚Äôs website to make sure the one installed on your PC is updated. Outdated or incompatible drivers could cause issues such as this one.
<br />
<br />
Moreover, try deleting everything within the NGC folder and try to add a new PIN code. The easiest way to do this is by resetting the through the Command Prompt. Here's how:
<br />
<br />
1. Press the <strong>Windows </strong>key + <strong>X</strong>, select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.<br />
<br />
2. Enter the following command: <br />
<br />
<strong>icacls C:WindowsServiceProfilesLocalServiceAppDataLocalMicrosoftNgc /T /Q /C /RESET</strong><br />
<br />
3. After doing this, you'd get a confirmation once the action is complete. <br />
<br />
4. Retry to add a new PIN code.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />

<p>I feel like whenever I updated to 1709 is when it stopped working. I'm not quite entirely sure. I haven't done much to the machine besides windows updates. What drivers to you recommend me updating manually?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried deleting the contents within the NGC folder and adding a new PIN but to no avail. It did the same thing where setting up face recognition it asked for the pin and after I hit ok the camera never comes on.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Thank you for getting back to us, Aye Tee Why.<br />
<br />
Manually update the driver from your camera. See if the issue gets sorted after. <br />
<br />
Since you've confirmed to have performed the suggested resolution of clearing the NGC folder, let us know if manually updating the driver also didn't sort the issue.

<h2>            Why do people who cheat almost never get banned</h2>
                    With my experience with the Xbox Live I have noticed that only people who swear and send hateful messages that people are always getting banned but people who cheat or hack never get banned this is a serious problem and I hope that it can be fixed because
 it's very annoying

            Hi, actually a lot of users who cheat or hack do get banned or suspended. You have to remember the enforcement team get hundreds of reports a day, and they have to investigate each one thoroughly before they make a decision on whether or not the account
 was involved in these sorts of activities, and if the are found to be that they have, then the relevant action will be taken.

            The Enforcement team always gets a huge influx of reported accounts. So while it takes time for action to be taken, it does happen. So continue to report people who are hacking/tampering and cheating.

            It does sem like that, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs true. Cursing will het you banned very quickly, but it moght be because it‚Äôs easier to investigate. People being investigated for cheating probably takes longer.&nbsp;

<h2>            All browsers slow &#40;except Edge&#41; on first search.</h2>
                    <p>Both Chrome &amp; Firefox are very slow on first search when I'm connected to my home Wi-Fi. But Edge connects seamlessly. This problem only occurs when I'm connected to my home Wi-Fi (for other Wi-Fi's no problem is there). After the first search, both Chrome
 and Firefox works smoothly like there is no problem. Is it my home Wi-Fi error or it has something to do with my Windows or some malicious software.</p>
<p>Thanks :)</p>

            Could be Windows or the browsers are not optimized. Do you have the latest versions installed? Have you tried uninstall then reinstall Firefox/Chrome?
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down
<br />Click Network adapters
<br />Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />If not, press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network adapters
<br />
<br />Right click your adapter
<br />Click Uninstall
<br />
<br />Exit Device Manager, restart. Windows 10 should detect the network adapter then reinstall it. Check if you can connect and browse.

<h3> david_aus  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows locks up - disk large response times</h2>
                    My windows 7 gets sluggish and can lock up for 5-20 seconds semi randomly. (ie I click on the start button and nothing happens for a while.) I have observed that the HDD indicator light is continuosly on during the lock up period and that the resource
 monitor indicates the drive has very large response times like over 10,000ms, although I am not sure if that is the cause or a byproduct.<br />
<br />
I have tried running the windows memory check.<br />
I have tried reinstalling the OS&nbsp;and only installing nvidia drivers (latest) and a few other programs.<br />
I have tried with and without a virus scanner.<br />
<br />
I have fresh Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit installed on intel core 2 duo with 4 GB RAM.<br />
I have a WDC WD10EADS 1TB hard drive.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Go to WD site and download their diagnostic software and let it check out the drive. Sounds like the drive has some kind of problem.

<p>Updates come in three flavors. The first are Important, or Critical, Updates, which are

</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The second type is Recommended updates, which are updates to various components of the operating system that

<p>The last type, called Optional Updates, are new features, updates, or Ultimate Extras that are

            <p>Yes. Security and bug fixes will get installed using Windows Update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can configure, to some extent, which updates to install. Personally I do not like Windows Updates to install device drivers so I have disabled these updates, but kept the others.</p>

    <title>Want to add recovery console option to boot.ini on system running SP3. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mbroom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Want to add recovery console option to boot.ini on system running SP3.</h2>
                    I only read about adding the RC to boot.ini after installing SP3. KB898594 explains why I cannot perform the operation from my original XP CD. Contrary to 898594, neither my SP2 nor my SP3 CD (both obtained from Microsoft) has a \i386 folder, so 898594's
 Methods 1-3 won't work. The only copies I have of WINNT32.EXE are the 2002 versions on the original XP CD and in c:\i386. Now what? Short of reinstalling the original XP (which I last did, and don't ask why, two days ago) and then adding the RC to boot.ini
 before installing SP2 &amp; 3, is the option no longer add-able?<br />

<p>My bad for not being clearer.</p>
<p>I'm using 32-bit Windows XP. I did neither a <em><span>Clean nor an Upgrade installation, but a re-install over the existing XP SP3 that seemed the least painless
 way to try to repair the OS after some software problem I couldn't specifically diagnose left Windows in a state where it would load the desktop and a very few startup programs, but otherwise wouldn't run at all in normal mode (though it ran fine in Safe Mode).</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>Not a mirror system.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>The articles you pointed to don't address my specific situation (unable to install the RC files from the original XP CD after I have installed SP2-3, unwilling
 to spend the hours needed to again re-install XP just for the potential eventual convenience of having the RC on the boot menu). If there's an efficient way to do this, though, I'm all for it.</span></em></p>

<h2>            Windows Firewall wont start, Error Code 6801 in Eventlog viewer </h2>
                    When i try to manually start my windows firewall it just states that it cannot be run.<br />
I have checked that the Firewalls dependencies are running via services.msc<br />
(RPC) Remote Procedure Call is started and set to automatic<br />
DCOM Server Process Launcher also started and set to automatic<br />
Those are the only 2 mentioned in the dependency tree.<br />
<br />
Ive tried going into regedit as per the http://forums.techarena.in/vista-security/754147.htm<br />
But could never find the query%set values they mentioned let alone how to make them.<br />
<br />
Installed Antivirus program is ESET 4.0 with Firewall.<br />
Tried disabling all startup services and non microsoft services via msconfig, but the firewall still wont start.<br />
<br />
My system is running Windows Vista Premium.<br />
<br />
I have no idea why the firewall just quit on me, i disabled it when i installed ESET smart security 1-2 years back.<br />
I have been fiddling with the startup services to try to make my computer boot faster, might be something i have done there,<br />
still i tried activating them all to no avail.<br />
<br />
Im gonna do a complete Virus Scan to see if that might be the culprit but its higly unlikely methinks.<br />
Any Input from the Forumites here would be appreciated as i really need to get the windows firewall service to start to be able to install my Drivers for the new printer i just bought<br />
(part of its installation require it to start the windows firewall to configure it, when it fails it cant complete the install)

            I solved it thnx to DaGreenOne, <br />
<br />
It wasnt enough to simply disable the ESET firewall, <br />
you have to completely uninstall the whole ESET program for the windows firewall to work again.<br />

<p>I will not say anything more as I do not want to ruin any story line for anyone. I kinda want to hear what everyone else has to say. Really hoping not everyone is a big Leon fan. lol</p>

<p>I have to say, they made Sherry Birkin a really likable character. So glad she's in the game and not Ashley from Resident Evil 4. Jake is pretty awesome too, but sometimes, his one-liners can be really cheesy (i.e., This cabin is invitation only).
</p>
<p>Overall, I have to say Ada Wong is my favorite character. She's pretty much the lovechild of Batman and Catwoman. Grappling hook much? Doesn't need a co-op partner to get *** done. A total badass.</p>

<h2>            How can I tell Microsoft how miserable my Windows 10 Experience is&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Am I the only one having a miserable Windows 10 Experience? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I love change and I love new features, but Windows 10 has to be the WORST product ever made since the Edsel. I'm shocked that Microsoft thinks this product is fit for market. I thought Windows 7 was fantastic. Windows 10 forces updates that bring my PC to
 a crawl/halt and my life too. I thought maybe it was my PC so I got out my wallet and bought a new PC. Same crappy experience.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm ashamed of Microsoft. I was a staunch defender, but this OS is the crappiest experience ever (I never experienced Windows 8). What's wrong in Redmond? I'm thinking someone is sabotaging things.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 PCs and I know when an update (like every other day) is coming because my PCs stop working and I might as well get out a magazine or something because I won't be able to use my PC for the next 15 minutes or so. Really people, is this the best you
 can do? Please Fire some people responsible for this ****. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it may be time to try something from Cupertino again; something I haven't done since Windows 95.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand that must make you feel upset and we will work toward fixing this situation for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows updates are installed automatically whenever it is available without the need for you to install the updates manually. These helps improve the performance and functionality of the operating system.</p>
<p>It is unusual that the updates would cause your PC to slow down. Just to clarify, is the issue specific to a particular update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What exactly happens when the updates are installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do get back to us with more details about the issue for further assistance. </p>

            <p>This post compelled me to reply even though my better judgement told me to&nbsp;just let it slide&nbsp;by&nbsp;but after reading it again&nbsp;I can not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, to be direct, my experience with Windows 10 Pro 64bit has been quite positive, in fact, very enjoyable and completely trouble free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your apparent rant has no factual basis in that you give no information as to&nbsp;the hardware configurations of either of the two machines that you now own, nor, any&nbsp;specifics other than you can't turn off update's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you not update your 3rd party software regularly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just because, as you state, you "pulled out your wallet" does not mean that you did so wisely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're going to get into something new learn how to make/change the settings to your&nbsp;needs, as in, there is no reason that a restart should be happening during a time of day that would be inconvenient for&nbsp;you. If your machines aren't powerful enough to
 handle a download in the background&nbsp;while still being able to support&nbsp;the current work&nbsp;session in progress that's your bad for not doing your do diligence&nbsp;research, not the OS's. Again, also,&nbsp;there are settings that can be changed to help accommodate the performance
 of lower powered systems to some degree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your new "PC" doesn't perform up to expectations I can assure you that&nbsp;that is the OEM's&nbsp;deal and any recourse accordingly&nbsp;would be on their end, however do note this, they will require that you&nbsp;open up your wallet once again to upgrade to a more powerful
 machine to get the performance that you expect, unless it has defective hardware components of course, that would be warrantied, or, they may offer an OS downgrade for free, perhaps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, all that being said, do you have a specific problem or complaint or was this all just about of a&nbsp;venting of&nbsp;frustration's in general?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if you are indeed having legitimate problems you are certainly not alone, just not&nbsp;within the majority.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well, I was definitely venting my frustrations, so thanks for not going off on me. I have a reasonable amount of PC knowledge, but just feel the whole overall experience has been less than reasonable to expect one to tolerate this. If the OS has minimum
 requirements, these should be qualified at installation during a system interrogation upon which the install be aborted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is an HP Pavilion with a 2.2GHz i7 processor running 8GB RAM and 64Bit Win 10. From my perspective it seems worthy of handling the upgrade. I did disable updates (metered connection) but felt that was unwise so that didn't last long.
</p>

HP Pavilion dv7-6c80us - 17.3" - Core i7 2670QM - Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit - 8 GB RAM - 750 GB HDD

</p><p>The 2nd PC I bought was not a big investment, but it had Windows 10 standard. It was just a small Acer tablet/laptop running a dual core processor
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>1.6GHZ Intel Celeron N3050 dual-core processor </li><li>2GB DDR3L SDRAM Memory</li><li>32GB solid-state drive</li><li>Windows 10 operating system</li></ul>
<p>Neither of these dig life when an OS is under-foot. Features quit working such as Start Menu, and the mouse gets jittery and it's hard to tell what I'm doing from delayed reactions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I'm a Windows user (haven't been Mac since System 7), I'll probably buy a nicer PC, but again, I just expect more from Microsoft.

            <p>I have the same problem with my wife's new HP Laptop. We just upgraded to 40 Mb also because we thought the connection was too slow and somehow affecting the downloads.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens, during the multitude of updates, is that items associated with Windows 10 such as stated prior, the Start Menu and Edge are not operational, on occasion the whole system is unavailable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife is on her laptop daily, normally in the mornings checking email and I hadn't realized that she knew&nbsp;those kind of words. It is truly frustrating. Strangely enough Explorer, although slower, keeps on working. Which makes sense I suppose since Edge,
 etc are integrated into the software and IE is essentially an App. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be super nice if there were a means to tell the users that there are updates ready to download and allow us to designate when we are ready&nbsp;for the&nbsp;download. Honestly, we really are smart enough to make those decisions, OK, most of us</p>
<p>
</p><p>In closing I'll just say that&nbsp;we all bought our systems for&nbsp;OUR use when&nbsp;WE needed them, not Microsofts use whenever&nbsp;they needed it.</p>

    <title>Turning off Windows directory&#47;file indexing. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hack_875  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turning off Windows directory&#47;file indexing.</h2>
                    
<p>Ever since Findfast was introduced over a decade ago, the windows file search function has been problematic. In the past, I just simply stopped the service (or in early operating systems just simply deleted FindFast.exe and it's related registry entries).</p>
<p>Is there a way to totally turn off indexing and force the search to always look at the folders and it's sub-folders?</p>
<p>Search doesn't find half the files it should, and the indexing doesn't appear to be "sticky" in that I find I have to re-index quite frequently and when it does it on it's own, programs stop responding for minutes at a time while it hogs the drives.</p>

            Actually I have since disabled it and it does NOT hang when doing the searches. In fact the system slowdowns and hanging have all stopped since I disabled indexing. Yes, sometimes on the detached drives it is slower, but not terribly slow, and the machine
 is 10 time faster for other tasks (mainly office and web browsing which were slowed way down with indexing).<br />
