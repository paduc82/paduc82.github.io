<h2>            signing in to skype</h2>
                    <p>I recently changed my security info and have messages saying it takes 30 days to come through - no problem. &nbsp;However now when I try and sign in to Skype on my macbook or iMac, I get signed in, I get a message saying will take 30 days but carry on using account,
 I push next and then it is a blank white sheet with no functionality. &nbsp;However I can sign in to Skype ok on my iPhone. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled Skype on my computer but still no difference. &nbsp;Any ideas why his has suddenly changed. &nbsp;Grateful for any guidance.</p>

    <title>Gimmicks and Convenience is not the Future of Gaming. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> contentedentree  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gimmicks and Convenience is not the Future of Gaming.</h2>
                    
<p>Before I start, none of us are against digital stores or the idea of a digital library that can be shared in a family plan, most of us actually like the idea of those things. We just don't like the restrictions that came with those things, and quiet frankly,
 the DRM restrictions are not needed for those online conveniences to work, those DRM restriction are only put in place for Microsoft to control us and maximise their own profits and their partners profits.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>What’s my whole? Well it’s the mugs getting upset that they “may” or “may not” have the family sharing library anymore, they say that without that, the Xbox One is nothing but an Xbox 360 2.0 with better hardware… Statements like that make my brain numb,
 because they care so much about little conveniences like that, which are nothing but little gimmicks that progress nothing. A digital store is a GIMMICK, having a family sharing library is a GIMMICK, not having to use your disc when the game is downloaded
 is a GIMMICK! NONE of those things actually progress actual gaming AT ALL!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Gimmicks like digital stores and family sharing is not the future of gaming. Garbage like that holds back the future of gaming. The future of gaming is better hardware, better graphics, new and revolutionary gameplay and just a whole new and better experience
 while PLAYING games. The future of gaming is in new and better ways to immerse yourself in the game and test yourself mentally, intellectually and to just have fun in new and exciting ways.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>So let me remind you all once again, convenience is a GIMMICK! Convenience is not progress!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The machine becoming more powerful and thus allowing more possibilities with games is PROGRESS!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Let me put it this way.</p>
<p>-Moving from foot to a horse is PROGRESS!</p>
<p>-Moving from horse to a car is PROGRESS!</p>
<p>-That car becoming faster and safer is PROGRESS!</p>
<p>-That car becoming more comfortable with luxuries is a Convenience, it’s a GIMMICK!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>-Moving from a cave to a tent is PROGRESS!</p>
<p>-Moving from a tent to a house is PROGRESS!</p>
<p>-The house becoming more sealed up, better constructed/ more stable, access to plumbing and water, having a place to store food and becoming safer to live, which is called PROGRESS!</p>
<p>-The house having comfortable chairs to sit in, having a pool in the backyard and having pretty carpets and wallpaper, which is a Convenience, it’s a GIMMICK!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Now before anyone brings up the irony of a gaming console also being a luxury item and also a convenience, I am aware of that, but my point still stands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Throughout history people have innovated, it hasn't just been a leap, from foot to horse, nor from cave to tent.</p>
<p>People have slowly transitioned between things, just like the car, it becomes more powerful overtime, more efficient.</p>
<p>Just like the Xbox 360 slowly evolved, it had multiple software updates, fine-tuning its hardware with how the resources are managed over-time.</p>

<p>If what you are saying is true, then when they Wright brothers first took to the air with the airplane, then what we fly on now commercially each year.. is just a "gimmick" because it's still an airplane.</p>

<p>Er, considering modern planes move considerably faster than the Wright brother's plane, and can cover far greater distances, no, they are not gimmicks. Well, to rephrase, the technology behind their design, their propulsion, their navigation and communication,
 those are all progress because they improve the plane's primary purpose (to fly.) The capacity to watch television on the backs of the chairs are gimmicks, because they make the flight less dull, yes, but don't actually make the plane move any faster.</p>

<p><span>No, you are reading what I wrote wrong!</span></p>
<p><span>What you talk about IS progress. Something becoming better, safer and more powerful is progress! Even the little kitchen inside the plane is progress, as are the toilets and chairs that change in to beds. The minibar inside the plane however, that
 is not progress.</span></p>

<p>I did, I agree completely with him, I'm disagreeing with your interpretation of his post. He wasn't referring to the development of technology behind the consoles, he was referring to the policies that were being implemented. Family Share would not make
 games 'better.' Easier to access, yes, assuming it did everything promised, but the game would not suddenly increase in graphical quality, or personal enjoyment, because my cousin in L.A. can suddenly have a shot at it. DRM DEFINATELY would not make games
 'better' either.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>An innovation WOULD have been cloud computing, if it worked as promised, because it would have (supposedly) made games function better. Keep in mind, I do not mean the 'A.I. Driver That Races For You While You Are Offline', that is a gimmick, because it
 does not increase your enjoyment while you're playing; you could achieve the same rewards by getting a system that regularly distributes game money. It MIGHT function as an innovation if these A.I. were functionally better than traditional server A.I., giving
 more of a challenge, but who knows.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>But clould computing that could assist with whatever calculations-diggies needed to process a game would indeed have been an innovation, because, whether better A.I. or prettier skyboxes, it could improve a game directly, with a tangible effect, just as
 a more powerful engine improves a plane's performance, regardless of how many or how few drink coasters it is outfitted with.</p>

<p>For a lot of people, being able to buy, sell and lend their games however and whenever they wished and being able to play offline at extended times whenever thy wanted to is more comfortable and enjoyable for them. It also is not just more comfortable and
 enjoyable for them, it is also their lawful right under many Countries laws. That is why we complained in the first place, they were defending their rights as a customer.</p>

<p>Having a digital store and a family sharing library is no ones lawful right.</p>

<p>I still understand what you are saying though.</p>

<p>Having a console that you can use isn't a lawful right. :/, I mean if it's something you can't use or whatever, and you know this before you buy it, you just don't buy it? I don't really get your meaning there.</p>

<br />
<br />What anti-virus are you using.  I'd disable or uninstall any anti-virus to see if the problem persists.  If not then try running with built-in Defender which always offers best Windows performance and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.  
<br />
<br />Clear your browser cache.   In Edge go to Settings (...) then Choose What to Clear, clear History.  
<br />
<br />Establish a Clean Boot, Check for Infection and then check System File integrity from Steps 4, 7 and 11 in this checklist:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br /> Right click task bar to open Task Manager.  If necessary show More Details
<br />
<br />On Details tab look for msiexec.exe, highlight to End Task.
<br />
<br />Now try install or uninstall again.
<br />
<br />If this doesn’t help you can try to Fix problems that block programs from being installed or removed:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17588/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17588/...</a>

    <title>Windows 7 logon screen saver can&#39;t access Flash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jt65  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 logon screen saver can&#39;t access Flash</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 7 Enterprise x64.&nbsp; I have installed Flash 10 and my corporate flash-based screen saver.&nbsp; the screen saver works properly when I'm logged in, I get the following message when the screen saver attempts to run:<br />
<br />
Flash Player not found.&nbsp; This application needs to have Flash player installed.<br />
<br />
Since it works when a user is logged in, I'm assuming this is a permissions issue, but I admit I'm grabbing at straws.<br />
<br />
I read a post elsewhere that told me to copy my Flash OCX and rename it Flash6.ocx.&nbsp; I did that and registered the OCX, but it still doesn't work.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If i'm not mistaken you're not going to be able to do this as the screensavers which are possible to run at the logon screen are limited.&nbsp; I responded to a similar post about this
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7desktop/thread/a437ee54-6f7f-48fd-8413-7338480948d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>&nbsp;and also wrote a little post on my site <a href="http://www.insidetheregistry.com/content/viewarticle.aspx?articleid=1824" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> explaining how to set a logon screensaver however the problem being that Direct 3D is not available.<br />
<br />
With this in mind, i'm willing to bet that this is what you're comming accross here.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this helps,<br />
Jon<br />

    <title>Windows Live Mail - Export emails is only exporting one email from a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markwingfield_815  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live Mail - Export emails is only exporting one email from a storage folder</h2>
                    I am trying to transfer emails in personal Storage Folder from Windows Live Mail on my Windows7 laptop to my new Windows laptop.<br />
<br />
Firstly, exporting all folders is only attempting to export the specific folder and not sub folders beneath e.g. i have a Finance folder that has a&nbsp; sub folder called Banks but selecting the Finance folder does not pick up the Banks folder or anything in it<br />
<br />
So I tried picking each folder individually (very long-winded), exporting this and then imported into my Windows 8 machine. On viewing the folders after import, only one email in each folder had been imported.<br />
<br />
Currently, this seems fairly hopeless as I have years of emails to transfer.<br />
<br />
Is there a tool that will work?<br />
<br />
Please help anyone!<br />
<br />

            For a successful export, follow these guidelines:
<ol>
<li>Set Windows Live Mail to <em>Work offline </em>before starting. </li><li>Create a temporary folder on your desktop to contain the exported messages. </li><li>In the export wizard, select the temporary folder and select <em>All folders.*</em>
</li><li>When it's finished, check that the number of files in each folder within the temporary folder is one more than the number of messages in the corresponding WLMail folder.
</li><li>Copy the temporary folder to its final destination. <br />
If you use a non-NTFS drive to do this, you will see a warning that some file properties will not be copied with the files. This can be ignored.</li></ol>
<p>*&nbsp;<em> If you want to export selected folders only, select each one that contains messages. Sub-folders are not automatically selected by default.</em></p>

            I don't know of any relationship between the 2 problems you noted.  Sorry, I don't know what could be causing your power settings problem.
<br />
<br />But there should be a fix for your Restore Point problem:

<p>Thank you for the reply. </p>
<p>I WAS able to find a solution and there was a connection , not sure how but when I solved the power option issue I was able to solve the 'restore point' one as well.
</p>
<p>As for your suggestion , I choose to pray and then laugh.</p>

<p>Here is where i found the solution .I had to do it in reverse because the solution was to use a "selected power option " only.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.thewindowsclub.com/specify-custom-active-power-plan-windows</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Open <em>administrative Command Prompt</em>. Type <strong>
POWERCFG /LIST</strong> and hit <em>Enter</em> to get list of available power schemes; here * implies active plan. Please note down the
<em>GUID</em> for the plan you’d like to set as a specific plan.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fthewindowsclub.thewindowsclubco.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f03%2fUse-Specific-Power-Plan.png" height="241" width="640" /></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Press <strong>Windows Key + R</strong> combination, type put
<strong>gpedit.msc</strong> in <strong>Run</strong>&nbsp;dialog box and hit <em>Enter</em> to open the
<strong>Local Group Policy Editor</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fthewindowsclub.thewindowsclubco.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f01%2fPrevent-Store-Apps-From-Pinning-To-Start-Screen-When-Installed.png" height="215" width="416" /></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> In the left pane, navigate here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Computer Configuration</strong> -&gt;<strong> Administrative Templates</strong> -&gt;<strong> System</strong> -&gt;<strong> Power Management</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fthewindowsclub.thewindowsclubco.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f03%2fUse-Specific-Power-Plan-11.png" height="329" width="607" /></p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> In the right pane of the window shown above, double click <strong>
Specify a custom active power plan</strong> setting which is <em>Not Configured</em> by default to get this:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fthewindowsclub.thewindowsclubco.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f03%2fUse-Specific-Power-Plan-2.png" height="502" width="550" /></p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> In the above shown window, firstly click <strong>Enabled</strong> and then in the
<em>Options</em> section, input the <em>Custom Active Power Plan</em> (<em>GUID</em>) as we copied from
<em>step 1</em>. Click <strong>Apply</strong> followed by <strong>OK</strong>. You may close the
<em>Local Group Policy Editor</em> now. Now if you try to set power schemes manually by clicking battery icon in the taskbar notification area, you won’t be able to do so:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fthewindowsclub.thewindowsclubco.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2014%2f03%2fUse-Specific-Power-Plan-3.png" height="480" width="608" /></p>
&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>**** In number 5 above it states to 'enable' but since mine had been enabled I had to uncheck that part' and when I went back to the power options the "locked part was gone" . Halleluia&nbsp;&nbsp; I now can simply choose which power plan I want or if I do all the
 above it will lock onto the one I choose . (That is what I had done quite some time ago ) but was having issues with that option recently .</p>
<p>Hope this helps. </p>

<h2>            Removing Microsoft Visual C&#43;&#43; 2010  x86 Redistributable - 10.0.30319</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Long story short:<br />
I have windows 10 with x64 processor. I wanted to play an older game. installation failed because it was impossible to install an &nbsp;c++2010 SP1 x86 redistributable. So I tried to install it manually: the installer gave me 2 options that both didn't work: repair
 or uninstall. Both times I got an error telling me that another version is installed and I need to remove it through the programs/ window. Big surprise: no SP1 redistributable listed.<br />
<br />
There was however an Microsoft Visual C++ 2010&nbsp; x86 Redistributable - 10.0.30319 (so NOT&nbsp;with&nbsp;SP1) installed. But I can't remove it because it can't find it's vc_red.msi.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I really hope that someone can help me. Installation through windows update also failed. I ran an "problem solver" for windows update, but&nbsp;to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Below you can find the error log that the installer for the C++&nbsp;2010 SP1 gave me:</p>

            <p>I wanted to let everyone know that I was able to solve the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>After looking&nbsp;online for more information about&nbsp;the installers and msi-packages, it seemed important to&nbsp;find the GUID-key for the 2010 redistributable version 10.0.3019 (the old version) and looking it up in the registry, So I found 2 entries in the registry,&nbsp;but
 removing the key located in : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Installer\UserData\S-1-5-18\Products\D04BB691875110D32B98EBCF771AA1E1</p>
<p>made it possible to reinstall both the 10.0.3019 version, as the SP1 version (10.0.40219)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made backups ofcourse in case something went wrong :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to thank you, Arun for responding to my question and I hope this information can help others.</p>

<h2>            Skype for Mac v. 8.12.0.2 - MacBook Pro - can&#39;t access &#40;Mac&#41; Contacts</h2>
                    <p>After installation of new Skype version&nbsp;v. 8.12.0.2 on my MacBook Pro (MacOS High Sierra 10.13.1) - UNLIKE with all previous Skype versions - I have not been able to access (from Skype) my (Mac) Contacts - I have even gone to System Preferences/Security
 &amp; Privacy/Contacts and deslected and selected agan "Allow Skype to access your contacts" - and restarted my MBP - nothing - no access from Skype of my (Mac) Contacts ...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
At the same time, on my iPhone (iOS 11.2) - I have also installed the new Skype version - here I AM able to access my (Mac) Contacts no problem !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas anyone?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that the new Skype version for Mac does not have an ability to synchronize your Mac contacts. We are already aware of this, however, if you wish to access your Mac contacts in Skype, I can only suggest to install the classic version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To install Skype classic version, please refer to the steps below:</p>

<p>Hello GunnerMidget,</p>
<p>I cannot find specific information about Dazzle DVC 100 being compatible with Windows 7. So I would assume it is not compatible.<br />
You might want to try and see if the Windows Vista drivers from the Pinnacle website would work with Windows 7.<br />
Try and install the Vista drivers in Windows Vista SP2 compatibilty mode as Administrator.</p>
<p>Right click on the Dazzle setup file. Go to properties. <br />
Click on Compatibility mode. Place a check in the box for "Run this program in Compatibility Mode" and choose for Windows Vista SP2.<br />
Also, put a check mark for "Run as Administrator" and say OK.</p>
<p>I suggest you post on the Dazzle Forums. <br />
They should be able to give you a more definitive answer on whether you can run Dazzle DVC 100 on Windows 7.<br />

Okay, two years ago I purchased a brand new Lenovo netbook...it is all genuine windows installed (which is Windows 7 Starter &nbsp;32 bit)..then right now after two years, it shows signs of problems that I never knew..When I start my netbook...both cores shows that
 the CPU is running on 100% and I doesn't have any idea on what to do...it stays for 30 minutes and then fluctuating back to 40-60% and then suddenly becomes idle back to 1%(<b>both CPU was 100% busy even there is no workloads</b>), I have done what I supposed
 to do such as cleaning the harddrive, running chkdsk (check disk), scanning for viruses,malware.rootkits, and defragmenting, formating the windows &nbsp;whatsoever&nbsp;<b>(I have tried formatting for three time with same genuine windows DVD but still happen the same
 thing). Also, the NT kernel from task manager process list shows NT Kernel consume 90% of the CPU workloads but I can't terminate the process because it gives an error when I'm trying to delete it. &nbsp;I also can't update the BIOS.</b>

            There is no separate driver/software needed for copying videos from a tape camcorder (from DV stream), if you are using IEEE port for transfer of videos. You need to choose the input video source in the software being used, like Windows Live Movie Maker.
 Once done, you can copy videos from the tape to the PC.

    <title>App purchases for child accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> manilabeans  say:</h3>
<h2>            App purchases for child accounts</h2>
                    (All previous posts on this topic date back prior to Windows 10, so I am posting again, hopefully we'd have better options now than what we had before)<br />
<br />
I am currently setting up several PCs, tablets and laptops which will be jointly used by 3 children and 3 adults. My primary question is, will I be able to set these up so that I will be able to make app purchases for the 3 children?<br />
<br />
I am interested in getting a general solution for all types of apps but I am also immediately interested in how to get this working in the case of MineCraft for Windows 10. The app requires an xbox account login so I supposed I would have to purchase the app
 for each of the child accounts that I would install it on? Not really a problem as long as I would be able to make all purchases from my own Microsoft Account and not have to register a billing account, or load a gift card for each child every single time
 I would want to make an app purchase for them.<br />
<br />
Thanks to anybody who could give me any help.

            Thanks Syed!<br />
<br />
It looks like I got it working now though. And I was surprised at how painless it was.<br />
<br />
All I did was add the child accounts to my profile, enable them for logging in on the computers they should have access to, and then had them log into their profiles.
<br />
<br />
I have already bought Minecraft for Windows 10 prior and when I went to the store to purchase it for one of the child accounts the store figured out that I have already bought it and just offered the INSTALL button.
<br />
<br />
Of course each child would still be using their own Microsoft accounts for the app though. But I am really pleased with how it went. Pretty painless, like everything else Windows 10 :D

            I just purchased a windows phone for my daughter. She cannot buy apps, games or music. Are you saying she is unable to do anything but free apps/games and no music? What's the point of family safety settings if you don't allow anything but free stuff?

            <p>Hi Philip,</p>
<p><br />
Place the computer in clean boot state and try to sync the phone.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot</p>
<p>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>Note: Refer "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot" under more information to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If he still has issues, ask the him to&nbsp; uninstall HTC Sync Manager and reinstall HTC Syn Manager
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
HTC Sync Manager (Free Download)<br />

<h2>            BitLocker and FIPS 140 Compliance</h2>
                    Can any body tell me authoritatively if BitLocker is FIPS 140-1 compliant?&nbsp; I can't seem to find any reference to FIPS at all, which is strange for a full drive encryption product.

    <title>Being reported in a game for not wanting to do what another player - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hoodie x jerry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Being reported in a game for not wanting to do what another player wants you to do</h2>
                    This is a well-acquiring issue in the Xbox community especially in NBA 2k18 and NBA 2k19. I've been reported and even suspended for not doing what another player wants me to do. It can be really annoying when your 100% in your right and a person tell you
 to play another game mode but you have been waiting so long for this game. As a gamer myself I think of this a bullying and it's not right. If you haven't done anything but do what is right then I think the person who reported you should have a warning themselves.&nbsp;

            Reporting is a tool to help gamers keep the community safe, yet it shouldn't be abused. In case you have done nothing to violate the Code of Conduct there is nothing you should worry about, just keep playing as normally.&nbsp;

<p>Report the player if they are harassing you, Also i would not worry about a player telling you they will report you, Reports for unsporting conduct are generally a waste of time if filed against you unless they are filed in very large numbers to drop your
 rep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I receive messages daily when playing dead by daylight from salty players that im being reported simply because i am in a team with friends and the killers don't like it, I just block them and move on because their report is worthless unless you have broken
 the xbox live code of conduct.</p>

<p>As long as you do not respond to a player in a way that violates the code of conduct, you will be safe from suspension.
