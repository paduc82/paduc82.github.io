<h2>            Cannot add User Account to my computer.</h2>
                    <p>I tried to add a user account (my wife) to my Dell Inspiron 15 Laptop running Windows 10. I went through the procedure and everything seemed to work OK. The symbol for her account appeared and when selected she was asked to "enter password" as is normal.</p>
<p>However when she entered her MS password the following message appears " You can't sign into your device right now. Go to</p>
<p>account.live.com to fix the problem or try the last password you used on this Device."</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does this mean? Can anyone help? </p>
<p>It seems a little bit ridiculous that basic requirement cannot be achieved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>?????</p>

<p>Hey hey man, I gots a solution for ya :D </p>
<p>So what you should do is delete the netflix app, clear your system cache (click Y on storage device in system settings), and then on the screen of available storage devices, put in this button combo: lb, rb, x, lb, rb, x. That combo on that screen will prompt
 you to wipe your system updates. This will require that you update everything again, but after this, redownload netflix, and it will be good to go.</p>

    <title>Windows Photo Viewer...Changing File Order - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> workhog  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Photo Viewer...Changing File Order</h2>
                    <p>Over the past several years I have taken most of my old photographs and snapshots and scanned them into .jpeg files. I have carefully named these files starting with the year and month they were taken. In the current computer I am using I utilize Windows
 8.1 and typically use it's Photo Viewer as a primary editor and slideshow viewer. Today I noted when I open a photo file folder in Photo Viewer that the order of the pictures appears to be more&nbsp;by the date they were scanned rather than the date (file name)
 I created. How do I force Photo Viewer to display these files by using the file name (as File Explorer would). Thanks.

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You might be facing this issue because Windows Photo Gallery is taking the feature "Date taken" to sort the photos. However, you may sort the photos by "File name" as you renamed the pictures according to the year and month those were taken.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to try the steps suggested by Vasudev on September 30, 2014 in the Microsoft support article below to rearrange the photos.
<div><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/gallery-program/how-to-rearrange-photos-in-photo-gallery-manually/7a8b8678-3275-415c-a5f6-c9939c0188c3">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/gallery-program/how-to-rearrange-photos-in-photo-gallery-manually/7a8b8678-3275-415c-a5f6-c9939c0188c3</a></div>

<p>Hi Rishikesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If in case that you encounter an error such as <strong>Couldn't turn on the camera. Make sure it's working properly
</strong>when setting up pin for the Face Recognition feature in Windows, this could be due to either an outdated camera driver, or corrupted system files. We'll need to gather a bit more information to better identify what's causing this. Kindly answer the
 following: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the make and model of your device?</li><li>Are you using a separate webcam or the camera is built-in on your device?</li><li>If in case that you're using an external webcam, have you tried checking if it's connected properly?</li><li>Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial troubleshooting, we recommend that <span>you run the Hardware and Device troubleshooter to ensure the hardware drivers are properly installed. To start the Hardware and Device troubleshooter, select the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Start</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>button,
 and then go to<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot</strong><span>, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Hardware and Devices.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, you may check for available driver update for your device since this can be a possible driver issue. You can follow the steps provided in this article:

<h3> mrex  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth drivers &#47; installation error &#40;RunDLL - missing entry&#41;</h2>
                    Hi! I cannot solve my problem related to updating bluetooth drivers and getting Rundll error message.<br />
<br />
I have upgraded my Asus Zenbook U500VZ from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1. Now after Im trying to update my BT-drivers (intel centrino advance n 6325) with the latest Intel driver package (or from Asus support site) I get this message after restarting my laptop:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/68184093-c871-404c-90c3-ea7b36b476cb" /><br />
<br />
I have tried several times (and with "run as administrator") to uninstall/reinstall/fix-install those drivers but no help. I also tried older driver version (for win8) and same error. If I removed drivers and let windows install some old microsoft generic drivers
 from 2006, I dont get that error message but neither my bluetooth works. <br />
<br />
In the start-up section there is two items related to btmshellex.dll<br />
- fsquirt<br />
- windows host process (rundll32)<br />
<br />
I also tried:<br />
1) CMD -&gt; sfc /scannow =&gt; didn't fine any problem. <br />
2) sfc /scanfile=btmshellex.dll =&gt; windows resource protection could not perform the reguested operation.
<br />
3) CCleaner to clean registry etc. =&gt; didn't help. (Also clean the register after uninstalling bt-drivers and then reinstalling them.)<br />
4) Troubleshoot for hardware didn't find anything. <br />
5) Safemode didn't help to solve the problem. Tried installing driver there. <br />
<br />
Solution:<br />
I installed new VGA-driver for intel hd4000 and now the error message is gone! But my Bluetooth doesnt work correctly... Need to figure this out too.<br />

            Thanks for your reply! Like I said, installing newest VGA driver for Intel HD4000 (from Asus site) fixed the problem. VGA-driver from Intel site wasn't correct - well, doesn't work with my laptop althought their automatic update service asks me to install
 them. Anyway...<br />
<br />
Magically my BT started to work. It didn't find my phone yesterday (my phone found my laptop). Now I tried to pair BT headphone, it works and after that it also finds my phone and they are paired. Now I have seen all!<br />
<br />
Win8.1 causes headache as much as Vista did... Now I keep this on this state, because I got it work and won't install any driver updates...<br />

    <title>Keyboard Backspace Speed Changes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gabalicious47  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard Backspace Speed Changes</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my computer every single day for my job. To put a little bit of my issue in perspective, I'm using my computer for 8 hours straight throughout my work day. Without it I cannot do my job. I work a typing heavy job that requires me to be typing lots
 of text and information down; which is why the issue I'm having is quite frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having trouble with my computer's speed changing when I hold down the backspace button, or any other button on my keyboard. I keep my keyboard repeat rate on the highest level, and the repeat delay on the shortest level. It works great! I love it! It
 does exactly what I need it to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I put my computer to sleep to go on lunch break, or I'm away from my desk for a period of time and my computer sleeps, after I wake it back up the keyboard repeat rate and repeat delay change. They go from being super awesome fast to being super
 annoying slow. I change no settings on my computer throughout the day, the keyboard speed simply changes between the time my computer falls asleep to when it wakes back up for usage again. The only way I've found to fix this is to do a full, complete restart
 of my machine. Then my keyboard repeat rate and repeat delay go back to the settings I've set them to be at. But this is quite frustrating and inconvenient to do throughout my work day. I'd seriously need these settings to NOT change at all. &nbsp;Any idea as to
 what could be causing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>GM</p>

<h2>            Unable to change &#34;Save Content Location&#34; from Drive &#58;C to any partition on Windows 10 1803 OS Build 17134.18</h2>
                    <p>As per the Screen shots attached, I am unable to change the <em><strong>Save Content Location</strong></em> for Apps and Offline maps to any other disk partition on this newest Windows 10 build.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OS Build info</strong> :</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>On Selecting to change location for apps I'm getting this error :</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7f805e6e-cb10-4c98-8abd-ebc364a8cff7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7f805e6e-cb10-4c98-8abd-ebc364a8cff7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After clicking ok, The offline maps location as well reverts back to C drive partition.</p>
<p>On searching for the error code, relative articles says to run a file to FIX your Windows update issues (if any)‚Ä¶.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Because of this, I did a clean installation of Windows 10 to check &amp; confirm if it fixes this, But it failed..</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">This error comes on both online (Microsoft account) as well as a Offline account having administrative rights.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other solution to this pertaining issue with this version of Windows 10 besides rolling back to the previous build ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Sorry you are experiencing this issue.
<br />I do have a workaround that has worked in the past if you want to try it.
<br />
<br />Try the following.
<br />Go to file explorer 
<br />Click the view tab
<br />Click options
<br />Click change folder and search options
<br />Click view
<br />Select Show hidden files, folders, and drives 
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Still within File explorer
<br />Go to C:\Users\yourusername\Appdata
<br />Right click folder called Packages
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Security
<br />Click Advanced
<br />Click Change (at the top by Owner, should be set to system)
<br />Click Change
<br />Click Find now and select your username
<br />Click to replace all subfolders
<br />Click OK twice.
<br />
<br />Now try and change the default storage in settings and see if that works.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you have any further questions.

<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>Nope no external drive is being used as I've increased the drive partitions with more than sufficient spaces in each. And all the drives are functioning.</p>
<p>Well, It got fixed now after I reset the OS from within the Recovery option menu again as Before this I managed to get it temporarily fixed by adding my Local admin account to all the drives and inheriting all permissions from a "<strong>Account Unknown
 Profile"</strong> but the moment I did this all the basic features of windows 10 i.e the Start menu, Action Center and any menu, folder or app ceased to open up, that's why I had to reset it again and now it is working for the time being.</p>

<h2>            Possible Memory Leak in the Groove Music App</h2>
                    <p>Good Day to you all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to post all the issues I encounter with Windows 10 and the first I want to discuss is the possible memory leak in the Groove Music App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app works fine for about 30min of continuous play but then it starts using insane amounts of RAM.</p>
<p>Usually it uses about 200MB which is normal but after a while it stops playing and does not respond&nbsp;to commands but it does not&nbsp;"Freeze" then&nbsp;it uses up 2GB and it keeps climbing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is an issue Microsoft can easily fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>Jaun-Luc</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>The issue might also be caused due to corruption in system files on the computer. Try running a System file checker scan.

<p>
</p><p>I did as you suggested the sfc/scan came up clean, so I did a health check anyway it also found no issues. The Media Streaming option just does appear on the page under network and sharing.This is all I get.</p>

            <p>hi,</p>
<p>If you shutted down your computer, it would restore your earlier windows.you have to start the download/installation again.it might take more than 4-5 hours to upgrade, shutting the machine down in 2 hours isn't a good idea.</p>

<p>I been a member of gamefly for almost 2 years...and when it comes to new games you should strive for making sure you have nothing out and then you get it immediately otherwise it could take a few days. but once your game is shipped to you It will arrive
 in &nbsp;2 -3 days. try my link I have had several friends of mine talked into getting it. I advertise it because I so far believe in the product.</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt; Contact me On Xbox live. And Ill talk to you more about the queues and certain tricks u can learn. I got some time now to get on if you like to.JC86</p>

Hi,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Windows Vista answers community.<br />
<br />
1). Does the audio CD play with Windows Media player or any other third party software?<br />
<br />
2).Were you able to use this feature before? If so what are the recent changes made on the computer?<br />
<br />
Windows does not play CD-ROMs automatically if you are using only real-mode CD-ROM drivers. Protected-mode drivers are required to play CD-ROMs automatically when you insert them in your CD-ROM drive.<br />
<br />
To change your CD auto play settings manually in Windows Vista<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the Control panel by going to the start menu.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double click on the Default programs icon.<br />
<br />
Now choose the third setting down. Change Auto play settings.<br />
<br />
</span></span>
<p><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.tips4pc.com%2fimages%2fcd+auto+play1.jpg" />
</span></p>
<span><br />
<br />
</span>
<p><span>4. Now you can choose what action to perform&nbsp; with what program.<br />
5. Press on the drop down menu to make your choice. <br />
</span></p>

<p><span>Hi dennisbaum,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you able to send fax to other numbers apart from the number which results in ‚Äúno answer‚Äù?</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you using any third-party online fax services, by chance?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes, "no answer" notification means that your fax machine did not receive a delivery confirmation signal from the other machine, so receipt
 was not verified.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In other words, it may have sent, but for one reason or another, the receiving machine failed to notify your machine that receipt was actually
 confirmed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If your computer is having problems with a recently installed device or other hardware, try using the<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Hardware
 and Devices troubleshooter</span></a> to fix the problem. It checks for common issues and makes sure that any new device or hardware attached to your computer was installed correctly.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>You may also remove and add ‚ÄúWindows Fax and scan‚Äù service.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft article for more information:</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows system may require an official driver signature from Microsoft to install on a Windows computer. There are several reasons why the driver couldn't be installed and one of this is by an antivirus software. For us to help you install the printer
 driver, we'd like to know more. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you getting an error message whenever you try to install the printer driver?</li><li>What is your current antivirus software? Have you tried disabling your antivirus software and install the printer driver?</li><li>Have you encountered any issues on the previous printer driver of your HP printer?</li><li>When did you encounter this issue? Have you made any recent changes to your computer?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>
<p>

<p>This behavior when trying to install older drivers to Windows 10 is by design. We would recommend that you contact your printer manufacturer for updated drivers for Windows 10.
