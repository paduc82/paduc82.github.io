            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think that your problem is IE 10, although it could be...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been having a similar problem for the last couple of days, but things seem to be back to normal.</p>
<p>I suspect at least in my case that there was a problem with my ISP provider, and possibly a problem with some web sites themselves...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was having a lot of problems with these forums, my email, and several others....</p>
<p>Websites have problems, and service providers need to do maintenance, which can cause disruptions..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible that you have a problem with your own machine though, especially if you are connected wirelessly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can happen for more reasons than I can probably think of...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your security program may be blocking them...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The website may be having issues...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link to the website may be obsolete...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be a problem with your browser... For instance, I have read reports that some websites will not allow access with Internet Explorer ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still using Internet Explorer 10, that may be part of the problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also a possibility that there is an actual internet disruption of some type between you and the website...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just yesterday encountered a problem with Microsoft's web page for downloading Insider Previews installation media... The web page would constantly keep trying to reload, but never ever finishing...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can suggest is to try another browser and see if that helps...</p>

<h2>            Connection&#47;NAT issues with ATT NVG589 Uverse Modem&#47;Router</h2>
                    
<p>I have been using ATT Uverse and Xbox Live for a long time now. Always had an open NAT using UPnP through the Uverse modem. I recently upgraded my speed through Uverse and they gave me a new modem. It is an ATT NVG589. The NVG 589 does NOT support UPnP.
 With that being said when I connect to Xbox Live, I can connect however I always get a moderate NAT. This is with the Xbox set to Automatic in the network settings.</p>
<p>I then proceeded to create a static IP for the Xbox 360 and forwarded the Correct Ports. I can still connect to Xbox Live but NAT is still moderate at times. Sometimes it is open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore. When I boot up my Xbox it does not automatically connect to Live now. If I try to sign into Live manually it gives me an error about the internet connection. I then go into my network settings. Test the connection. Everything tests good. Then
 I can sign into Live. But I cannot sign in as soon as the machine turns on without doing a "Test Connection"</p>

<p>Hey there Juiced,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear you're having issues connecting using your new router.<br />
<br />
I would definitely recommend reading through the suggestions in our <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/9/t/157383.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to Open NAT</a> sticky thread. It has some great steps for port forwarding and further solutions if you're still having NAT issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please let us know how those all work for you and we'll go from there.</p>

<h2>            Cumulative Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems &#40;KB3081424&#41; Does Not Download or Install</h2>
                    I upgraded to Windows 10 Professional&nbsp;a couple of&nbsp;days ago, and got four updates, one after the other, on August 4, right after the Windows 10 upgrade. Three of the Windows Updates, "Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems,"&nbsp;installed successfully.
 They are&nbsp;(KB3074678), (KB3074686) and (KB3081704). The fourth update, Cumulative Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3081424), sits in the queue waiting to download and never downloads nor installs. It has sat in the queue since August 4, two days.
 I ran Window Update Troubleshooter and it found nothing wrong. Is the problem at Microsoft? I am at the decision point for my business network of replacing all the Windows based systems to Apple computers. I have iMac 27 computers running Windows 10 Professional
 in Parallels 10, and they run beautifully. The PC based Windows based systems are fraught with errors. Continue to get Internal Power Error shutdowns and restarts on Windows systems running 3 and 4 year ol

            I am having the same issue. My update is stuck at 3% and it says waiting for download. Unfortunately, I ran the Update Troubleshooter and got 'Service registration is missing or corrupt', so I guess you are better off. Hopefully, Microsoft will hook us
 up with a solution 'cause I don't know what to do at this point.&nbsp;

<h2>            Wireless Adapter Not Connected</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having trouble with windows 10 not recognizing any wireless connections. Under 'network properties', my wifi adapter is not present, even though it was working approximately an hour ago. I've had this problem before and solved it with the kludgy solution
 of using another comp to download drivers from dell, attempting to install, and restarting. They never actually installed, but whatever happened it worked. No luck this time. I know the wifi router is working; I'm using it on my phone to write this. Suggestions
 on what to do/check?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            I can connect again, but I'm not sure why; I booted it this morning and the adapter was working again. The problem was that the wireless adapter wasn't even listed on device manager (there were plenty of devices under network, just not the wireless adapter).
 I checked the properties just now and unchecked 'allow the computer to turn off this device to conserve power', but it was working and on before that.

<p>It hangs for a long time and finally fails: time-out occured 0x8100101</p>
<p>Try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the eventviewer i see error:</p>

<p>So i disabled all disk the recoverypoint - using system recovery menu - enabled it again using the suggested amount of space and tried again to create a restorepoint.. Same error still.</p>
<p>I looked in VSS admin and all status of providers/writers is ok.</p>
<p>I check system &nbsp;files (SFC), no errors. I did run checkdisk on c: no errors.</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue? -&gt; I tried to instal windows10 but it complained with weird errorcode 800703f1. After some research in the MS windows10 forum it looked to be a
 diskproblem: windows setup could not determine if enough diskspace is available..&nbsp; As this was not the case, all disks, also system partition have Gb's of free space, i'm confused.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Since how long are you experiencing this issue? -&gt; for me it looks like started with the several attempts to get windows10 on the system. Looks like it changed something...but not the good..<strong>

</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Have you installed any third party programs on the system?</span> -&gt; there is running more than only MS windows and office yes.. Anti-virus as base and many other programs. none of these have been changed/upgraded/installed.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>As of this problem I found no way to upgrade i tried to startup in safe mode to see if that could get the job done. But it took hours on the boot... nothing on the screen to complete as of the disk access led burning almost contentious. ...I decided to kill
 this startup and started again. I then found my system with very few services running. I needed to change most service from disabled (most of them were set that way) to automatic and reboot in order to have a running system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From that my system responded at least as normal, although&nbsp; i lost my personal screensettings.</p>
<p>But still.. no windows update to run, to win10... win and office patches still apply normally.&nbsp; Most likely they do not fail on a recovery point not being able to be taken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I drilled down now till the problem that VSS does not want to take a snapshot, nor a recovery point can be taken. I expect recovery point creation needs VSS to operate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Response to methods:</p>
<p>1. all services are running.</p>
<p>Running a backup fails as well as it wants to take a VSS snapshot. </p>
<p>Backup product Nova still runs but complains:</p>
<p>--- Warnings -------------------------------------------------------------------<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : The operation will continue without VSS support</p>
<p>
</p><p>-----</p>
<p>When it started?</p>
<p>as above mentioned when i killed an attempt to boot in savemode to see if the windows10 upgrade would go succesfull.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will run method 2, but as this takes time i can not use this pc it takes time for me to schedule a suitable D/T. Let yoiu know when done..</p>

                    <p>This is to add to the plethora of "Headphones not working" post. But no solution has worked so far</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP Pavilion Laptop</p>
<p>Windows 10</p>
<p>headphones, no microphone, trs jack</p>
<p>
</p><p>Headphones worked fine in windows 8. Headphones still work fine in other devices (ipod)</p>
<p>updated to windows 10</p>
<p>Windows/the computer does not recognize the headphones when they are plugged in. It continues to play through the speakers</p>
<p>In sounds/playback devices, there are only Speakers (High Definition Audio Device), even with show disabled devices checked</p>
<p>in Device Manager, under sound vido and game controllers, I have High Devinition Audio Device and Intel Display Audio.I tried updating/uninstalling both of these</p>
<p>I tried updating and "Let me select my own driver"</p>
<p>
</p><p>USB headphones DO work</p>
<p>
</p><p>I solved this problem on another computer playing with the settings in Realtek Audio Manager. This laptop does not have realtek</p>

<p>I've noticed it uses AzureAD/[username] as the username while the other computer that I can connect to uses a microsoft account email address as the username. I'm not sure why they got setup differently but they should still be able to work I would think?
 I'm just not sure what needs to change to get this other computer to work since the first one does. Thanks.</p>

            Hi Jake, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />These problems usually have to do with the way your network and security settings have been set up. One of the accounts involved may need permissions changed by the network administrator to fix the error.
<br />
<br />The AzureAD account would be your company's domain account, while the Microsoft Account would likely be someone's personal account. It's possible you'd need to use a domain account on both PCs to successfully RDP, but it depends on your network's configuration.
<br />
<br />Do you know who your network administrator is? You can get in touch with them for further support and they should be able to get you connected.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if I can help any further! Thanks!       
        </p>

            I tried downloading through Realtek but wasn't able to succeed. Finally used a Realtek link submitted by One of you kind folk and it worked! I'm so happy and so thankful for all you people in this community. You've helped me many times to figure things
 out and I'm very grateful.&nbsp;

<h2>            WIn 8.1 and Bluetooth issues - BSOD and sporadic reboot</h2>
                    <p>I have an issue with my Yoga 2, where it will suddenly give a BSOD, and reboot, or I'll get up in the morning and find that it has rebooted over night. &nbsp;Looking at the system logs, I found the Dump
 below which points to the Bluetooh driver files. &nbsp; Anyone else have similar issues? &nbsp;Solutions? &nbsp; I've reloaded the drivers a couple of times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another issue that seems to be
<b>separate</b> is&nbsp;that I'm using a lenovo Bluetooth mouse, and on occsion it stops working, and will not reconnect,&nbsp;bluetooth seems to "lock up" and I can't access it at all). &nbsp;i have to unintstall the bluetooth under device manager and sometimes reboot for
 it to work again.</p>
<p><br />

2. Uninstall Bluetooth drivers, restart, and then download and install the latest drivers via the manufacturers website (NOT Windows Update or Device Manager).<br />

3. If you're still crashing after the above, disable Bluetooth via the BIOS or return the product as it's likely hardware at this point.<br />

            Just FYI, I was preparing to follow the instructions in the prior post, when I decided to try something I read elsewhere in a forum.&nbsp;
<div>I unchecked the box that says "Allow computer to turn off this device to save power". &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since doing that, I've had several days without the failure. &nbsp;SO, I'm keeping an eye on it, but hopefully that resolves my issue long term.&nbsp;</div>

<p>This simply points to the API documentation for the Update-Help cmdlet, it does not discuss this issue or how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to update quite a few cmdlets due to this error, which is occurring because the Help URL associated with those modules is no longer valid (the URL indicates where Update-Help should look for the help files it needs to import).&nbsp; How do I find
 the correct URL and then how do I update the HelpInfoUri property of the module?&nbsp; Or is that the end of the story - once a module's HelpInfoUri URL is broken, you can no longer update it's Help?</p>

<h3> matts persic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need Help Installing WinDriver Virtual Device Driver on Vista &#40;how do I override the &#34;installation prevented by policy message&#34;&#41;</h2>
                    I am trying to install a driver for a USB Oscilloscope in Windows Vista Home Premium.&nbsp; I receive the error:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;"The installation of this device is forbidden by system policy. Contact your system administrator. E0000248"<br />
<br />
How do I change the group policy to allow installation of this driver?<br />
<br />
Other information you may need to help me is: driver type = legacy; device&nbsp;class = {8ecc055d-047f-11d1-a537-0000f8753ed1}; physical dev obj = 0000004F; class short name = LegacyDriver.&nbsp; I would like to configure a group policy to allow installation of *ALL*
 drivers as I do a lot of work embedded systems.&nbsp; This is not a internet connected computer, so I don't have virus software or firewalls enabled and I'm not worried about viruses.<br />

            Hello David,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I had already&nbsp;read&nbsp;the article you referenced and it was of no help as I can not find the group policy editor on my installation of Vista Home Premium.&nbsp; Specifically, step 2 fails,&nbsp;the section I am referring to (from the article) is:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<ol>
<li>Log on to your computer as <strong>DMI-Client1\TestAdmin</strong>. </li><li><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">To open Group Policy Object Editor, click the
<strong>Start</strong> button, type <strong>mmc&nbsp;gpedit.msc</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>. </span></li><li>If the User Account Control dialog box appears, confirm that the action it displays is what you want, and then click
<strong>Continue</strong>. </li></ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li>In the Group Policy Object Editor navigation pane, double-click <strong>Computer Configuration</strong> to open it. Then open
<strong>Administrative Templates</strong>, open <strong>System</strong>, open <strong>
Device Installation</strong>, and then open <strong>Device Installation Restrictions</strong>.
</li></ol>
&nbsp;<br />
Do you have any suggestions for who to access the Group Policy Object Editor?&nbsp; I don't find it when I do a search.&nbsp; There is a "mmc.exe" but there is no Group Policy snap-in.&nbsp; Nor can I find anything in the Help Search.&nbsp; I have also checked User Accounts and
 Admin Tools - nothing there either.&nbsp; I did find "Group Policies Client (Local Computer)" but most everything was greyed out and I did not see anything that looked like a place to set permissions.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I would greatly appreciate if you could provide a bit more detail/direction on how to install this driver.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Hi, Matts!<br />
<br />
Group Policy Editor is, unfortunately, unavailable on Vista Home Edition. However, if policies forbidding device installation are introduced in GP, Windows stores them in
<strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Device Install\</strong>. I suggest you first running
<strong>regedit</strong> and browsing to this key. If this key is actually present, and you do NOT need ANY device install restrictions, I suggest you delete it.
<br />
<br />
Remember to back the registry up before editing it!<br />
<br />
Please, inform us if this helps or you need further assistance!

<p>Hello Gloria,<br />
<br />
I do not understand the purpose of your suggested KB article?&nbsp; I am not getting an "Unsigned Driver" message; nor am I trying to "Group Policy setting from a Windows Vista-based computer to a client computer" as the article states.&nbsp; Also, nowhere on my HDD

The reason I suggested that article, even though it was not your exact situation, was because it gave you the tools to change the group policy regarding installing drivers, without having the group policy editor tool on your version of Vista.&nbsp; I thought it
 might work to allow the changes to be made to your security policy so you could install your driver.&nbsp; I apologize if it did not work for you.<br />
<br />
One thing you might try is turning user account control off temporarily and then try to install your device:<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/58b3b879-924d-4e08-9358-c316055d3eae1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/58b3b879-924d-4e08-9358-c316055d3eae1033.mspx</a><br />
<br />
I hope this helps resolve your issue.&nbsp; Please let us know if you need additional assistance.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<p>Yep, I keep UAC off all of the time because it causes too many problems with other software.&nbsp; I also run at the lowest possible security level and permit all macros.&nbsp; This is a software development laptop running Pilz PSS IDE, Rockwell Automation ControlLogix
 IDE and National Instruments LabVIEW.&nbsp; I scan for viruses about monthly, but keep the VS software disabled for day-to-day development.&nbsp; I would much prefer to run XP Pro as I don't have these problems with XP -- unfortunately the new laptop came with Vista
 and the mfg. does not have XP versions of critical drivers (i.e. audio, wireless, et cetera)... I already tried.<br />
<br />
Basically, the information I need is how to completely remove/disable all of Microsoft VISTA's control over the hardware and user activities so it behaves like a root operating system (like DOS did).<br />

I have a couple of questions for you.&nbsp; With the answers to these questions we will better be able to assist you.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Is your Vista Home edition 32 bit or 64 bit?<br />
2.&nbsp; What is the make and model of the oscilloscope you are trying to connect?<br />
<br />
We look forward to the answers so we can provide further assistance.<br />

    <title>white vertical line on desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karimlyn  say:</h3>
<h2>            white vertical line on desktop</h2>
                    I see a white vertical line that starts on about midway on the right on the screen then goes straight down, about as wide as a pencil. It seems to only affect the desktop as it's not visible when I open programs nor go to Metro. Even changing wallpaper
 it still exists. What could possibly be the the problem?<br />

            It's likely being drawn by some kind of program. For example, does it appear immediately when you login, or does it take a moment to appear?&nbsp; Also, try clicking it, then pressing Alt+F4 to exit whatever it is.

            It happens after a while after using the computer. I don't see any active program that could cause this line to be 'drawn'. It is transparent, showing the wallpaper behind. It doesn't show when any program comes up in that area of the screen. Even if I
 right-click on the line the context menu on the desktop appears before it. As previously said, only on the desktop and it still exists even after wallpapers are changed.

            <p>In that case there's not a ton of options, but a few do come to mind.</p>
<ol>
<li>Surgical option:<br />
There's a Microsoft program (they acquired) called <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Process Explorer</a>, and it has an ability to find out what window handle belongs to a process executable. On the toolbar of the program is a little crosshair icon. You can drag that icon and drop it onto any part of the screen, and it will tell you what process
 belongs to it.&nbsp; This might help track down the culprit.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Shotgun option:<br />
Press Ctrl-Shift-Esc to show the Task Manager, and disable everything on the Startup tab.</li></ol>

            <p>I tried 'Process Explorer'...didn't find the problem. Whenever I dropped the cross-hair icon over the area of the desktop with the line, it kept directing me to the 'explorer.exe' process. That wasn't much help since putting the icon over other aspects of
 the screen (taskbar, desktop icons, pinned apps, start menu etc.) it always pointed to the 'explorer.exe' process so I couldn't identify that process as the direct culprit as it seemed to control so much of the desktop area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did come to notice is that the white line rested directly in the same area as a scroll bar on a Sticky Note. I moved the note to a different area of the screen and restarted. The line has not returned (as yet). I will let you know if it (the white
 line) reappears and in the new area that the note is placed. </p>

            The white line has reappeared, in the same spot I placed the Sticky Note. I simply moved the Note once more and then minimized it. The line disappeared. I expect it will reappear sooner or later in the future and would like to know if there is a solution
 to this. It doesn't hamper my performance or activities so it doesn't bother me (just aesthetics) yet, I am wondering if this is a precursor to something greater and more harmful coming in the future.<br />

<p>No, I have not tried that. I did delete the Sticky Note and the line has not reappeared since. The issue seems to be with the Sticky Note and&nbsp;its&nbsp;scroll bars. That worked for me.</p>

<h2>            Windows Updates after reinstall......</h2>
                    I had to reinstall Windows 7 and now it is wanting to download 132 Windows updates. I think some of the updates caused the problems to begin with, so how do I know which ones I should or should not install?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you are having problems with Windows Updates, it is trial and error as to the "problem" ones.</p>
<p>This should assist you:</p>
<p>Sometimes Microsoft gives you Updates for 3rd Party Hardware: Graphics, Network Adaptors, etc.</p>
<p>You should only obtain the latest Drivers for them from the&nbsp;particular Hardware or Computer&nbsp;Manufacturer's website, as Microsoft normally does nor have those latest Drivers available as Microsoft relies of the 3rd Party Hardware Manufactuer to supply them.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, the only way to find out which is the problem update is to install them one at a time, until you find the "problem" one for your setup.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;you are still&nbsp;worried about it, you could try installing them "x"&nbsp;number of updates&nbsp;at a time to narrow down the odds of having to&nbsp;find a "problem" Update..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But remember you normally only have problems with 3rd Party Hardware Drivers. The other Updates are&nbsp;to enhance&nbsp;your System's Performance and Security</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 will not let me sign in to my Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>I tried to use Cortana as soon as I had Windows 10 installed and when it asked me to sign in to my Microsoft account it brought up a window that said "Something Went Wrong". All other apps that were pre-installed, like Xbox, Windows Store, or the Music app
 tell me that I'm either not connected to the internet -- which I am -- or that "something went wrong". The Windows Store says "The server stumbled" and gave me the error code 0x80072EFF, but its the only one that does that. Can somebody please help?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Home - Static &#47; Fixed IP problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ccwking  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Home - Static &#47; Fixed IP problem</h2>
                    <p>I am sure this issue has been reported already but I am not sure if a permanent fix was found, but hopefully someone can assist me here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my PC running Windows 10 - Home edition, it has a fixed static IP of 192.168.0.3 and a gateway of 192.168.0.1 (subnet mask of 255.255.255.0)</p>
<p>However after windows updates (or large Window update deployments) it can lose the fixed IP, so it then has no internet access after it has rebooted, this causes me problems logging on again using my PC account as it needs internet access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night it lost the Fixed IP again and when I finally managed to get logged in, it had the radio button of "Use the following IP address" but all the boxes were null/blank.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So as to resolve it, I have for now, switched it back to DHCP, I used Fixed/Static IP as there is some software I use on this PC that needs certain ports on my router enabled and I have configured it purely for this PC's fixed IP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that if I search the web there have been reported issues with the static IP not holding or losing the settings, as this is a home PC, is there any way to encode the fixed IP into to the registry ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>

            sorry, misread your question. i have a folder in documents i have called batch and i put all my batch files in there. because i want them included in the backups. as you are not intending to call the batch file without using the shortcut, it doesn't matter where you put it, but avoid moving it after creating the shortcut.

<p>You can set your router DHCP Settings so that PC's MAC address is associated to predefined IP-address and every time when that PC ask IP it will always get same address. This way you can leave PC settings to default "Obtain an IP address automatically".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is one example, but to specific instructions you need to see your router manual.</p>
