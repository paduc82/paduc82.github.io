<h2>            How can I disable the auto sign in of the Xbox app on WIndows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to completely sign out of Xbox on Windows 10 so that retyping in a password is required to sign back in?
<br />
<br />
I set up a child account for my son but our computer (we share it) is also saving MY Xbox account info so he can basically just switch to my Xbox account and then have access to everything. If I sign out it will just auto sign me back in if clicks on switch
 user and then picks my Microsoft Account email from the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even completely deleted the Xbox app through the Powershell, restarted the computer, and then reinstalled it and it STILL saved my password and auto-signed me back in right away.</p>
<p>This is REALLY frustrating. What is the point of setting up a child account for online safety if my child can just switch to my full access account and be auto-signed in anytime they want?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALSO, I was really disappointed that when we signed in to HIS Xbox account it said it was going to auto sign him into all Microsoft Apps as well. This includes the Windows app store which I do NOT want him to be able to sign into a download apps on his own.
 WHY would it be set up this way? It undermines any kind of child safety set up. Argh!</p>

            Hi SL.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What happens if you assign separate Microsoft Accounts for the parent and child, each with it's own password, then sign out of yours when you are finished on the PC.  It should require the child to sign into his/her account separately and if not something is not set correctly.  
<br />
<br />Is it set to require the password when it wakes from Sleep at Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign in Options at the top in the dropdown menu?  
<br />
<br />If this is not the issue exactly then please explain how it is set up and what's causing the child to be able  to access your account if you sign out at the end of your sessions?  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            The problem is not with the general Microsoft Accounts. It is specifically in the Xbox app on Windows 10. The Xbox app has a sign out button but it does not actually sign you out. If you click to sign back in after "signing out" it signs you back in automatically
 without asking for a password. This happens with ANY person who has signed into the Xbox app so it is saving all the passwords of anyone who has signed into the Xbox app on a given computer. The Xbox app USES your Microsoft account to sign in and uses your
 Microsoft password as the sign in password. Since we have a shared family computer, if my son "signs out" of his Xbox account and then clicks on change user, he gets a list of all the Xbox accounts used on that computer. MY Xbox account shows up on that list
 and if he clicks on it it automatically signs him into my account without requiring him to type in the password. THIS is the problem.

            As I said you need to sign into and out of your Microsoft Account on the PC which is what is controlling when you are using the WIndows Xbox app.

            Thanks but I am not interested in our computers having to be linked to Microsoft for sign in and for every moment that we are using them. It feels invasive to me.
<br />
<br />
The issue is not about the Microsoft account. It's about the Xbox app having a way to sign out completely when you sign out. The Windows Store app uses the Microsoft Account sign in BUT when I sign out it signs me out completely and I have to retype in my password
 if I want to sign back in. Xbox is not giving us this option. It is just saving all passwords and auto-signing in any that have been used historically on a given computer.<br />

            You already have your Microsoft Accounts and Family rules set up, correct?
<br />
<br />Then why wouldn't you want to use them on the very devices that you need them used on?  Xbox is only an app in Windows 10, not the player itself which is something else where you'd use it's individual sign-in.  Once you play on the Xbox app in Windows 10 it needs to have Windows 10 sign-in to apply Family rules.  
<br />
<br />If you want to interact with a representative for Microsoft Family who might be able to offer another solution, use the Comments section in this thread or his Twitter handle given there:  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security-winpc/troubleshooting-family-safety-features-in-windows/29533738-5766-4ba5-881c-c588e45201dc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />I could also refer you to Xbox forums or Support but they mainly service Xbox players and not the WIndows app which falls more under Windows.  When it falls under WIndows, to use family you need to sign in with your Microsoft accounts to apply family rules.

            It's not about using family rules, though. The Xbox app is apparently set up to store password of anyone who has accessed it from a given computer and then auto signing-in any of those passwords with just a click. Setting up or signing into Microsoft accounts
 is not going to change this fact. There is nothing in the Microsoft Family setting that will make the Xbox app fully sign out when you click sign out. That is the issue I am concerned about.<br />

<h2>            No metadata in media player</h2>
                    I have recently built a new PC with Win7 Pro as the OS.&nbsp; My old PC ran XP Home.&nbsp; I moved my Media Player files from the old PC to the new PC.&nbsp; The problem is when I insert a music CD for playing or ripping into the new PC, no metadata is found, it just
 shows Unknown Album for everything I insert,<br />
The strange thing is that when I go back to the old PC, the problem is the same (I haven't made any changes to the settings there).&nbsp; On top of this, I tried my wife's Win7 Home PC (that I have not used Media Player on before) and my Vista Home laptop and the
 situation is the same on all of them.&nbsp; What's going on here?!

<p>Have you, for whatever reason, stopped WMP from calling home (the database) ?</p>
<p>Check your Firewall settings and also make sure that within the Options of WMP the two references to connecting to the Internet are both checked.</p>
<p>Also worth noting : if the length of the ripped song (wav or mp3 format) differs in any way&nbsp;from the data base reference, then that could also be a reason why the titles don't appear - WMP couldn't successfully compare the source and the data base. Idem
 for the album art. Another reason why I do it all manually.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jerry</p>

<h2>            microsoft edge not playing videos in some web pages</h2>
                    <p>I am using windows 10 and Microsoft edge for my web experience and have done so for some time now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>everything worked fine up until a couple of weeks or so, ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>now, when viewing some websites that have videos in the content, some of those videos open up and after it looks as though they will play, the screen just goes black.</p>
<p>not all videos on those websites, just some.</p>
<p>
</p><p>have recent windows updates caused that problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>what do you think needs to be done?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thx</p>

            Hi GE.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Check the flashplayer with this tool:  <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html</a>
<br />
<br />I will walk you through the fixes for Edge to try progressively until it's fixed: 
<br />
<br />Back up your Favorites first in Edge Settings &gt; Import from another Browser &gt; Export to a File.  If it won't open you can reach Favorites to back them up to an HTML file using the tiny app Manage Edge Favorites here:  <a href="http://www.emmet-gray.com/Articles/EdgeManage.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.emmet-gray.com/Articles/EdgeManage.html</a>
<br />
<br />You can reset Edge in Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Feature, scroll down to Microsoft Edge, highlight it, choose Advanced Options, then Repair, or if that fails, Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then try re-registering the app following Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary you can reinstall it from this link:  <a href="http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-reinstall-microsoft-edge-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-reinstall-mic...</a>
<br />
<br />I would have several other browsers available to choose from on the Task Bar since Edge is a work in progress and unreliable.  I use Firefox, Edge and Chrome in that order of preference.  You can import Favorites from each other easily in Settings.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            The video plays in Edge and Firefox here but is choppy and renders poorly.  I think it's the website because this is not normal for streaming here.  
<br />
<br />Do you have the same problem with other streaming sites?  
<br />
<br />Can you compare on Firefox and Chrome?  
<br />
<br />Try all other steps I gave.

<p>Hi Warren, </p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The name's Darren not Warren, but close enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Realtek audio device used to support DTS prior to the Windows 10 Creators update, however since this update I got the warning "DTS Audio is unavailable for the specified audio device" at Windows Startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now resolved the problem myself by downloading and installing a newer version of the Realtek Audio driver from my motherboards manufacter (ASUS). &nbsp;This driver install has resolved the problems the Windows update caused. &nbsp;DTS Audio now works correctly
 and the error message not longer appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as a note Microsoft, just telling people to disable DTS is hardly offering a solution.</p>

<h2>            Tell me how to play movies.</h2>
                    I tried to download some third-party software from the store so that I could play some movies. But those don't work. I need a good and reliable one that is free. And I think that it's bull that I have to go out of my way to download a third-party app in
 order to watch a movie. Shouldn't something like that come with Windows 10 by default?

            <p>Hallo, im offiziellen englischsprachigen Supportforum gibt es dazu einen Sammelthread. Kannst dort einen entsprechenden Kommentar hinterlassen, dass du auch davon betroffen bist.</p>
<p>Das Problem ist mittlerweile bekannt und es wird an einer Lösung gearbeitet. Mehr Infos hab ich leider nicht. Ich drücke dir die Daumen.</p>

<p>Ich war vom Enforcement Team für xbox live und &nbsp;Kommunikation gesperrt bis 17.10.15, nun funktioniert wieder alles Standardgemäß bis auf den Party-Chat. Ich höre alle Party-Mitgleider und wenn ich spreche wird auch angezeigt mit dem Kreis das ich rede, jedoch
 hört mich keiner. Hoffe das wird so schnell wie möglich behoben. Bitte um Hilfe. Danke. &nbsp;Gamertag: &nbsp;cookie 303</p>
<p>Vielen Dank</p>

<p>Seit gerade eben funktioniert weder mein Partychat noch meine Nachrichten. Angeblich aufgrund fehlerhaften Verhaltens. Heute habe ich eine Nachricht von Xbox Live bekommen, diese war allerdings ohne Inhalt. Wurde ich jetzt gesperrt? Wie lange geht diese
 Sperre?</p>
<p>Und vor allem, bin ich mir nicht mal einer Schuld bewusst. Ich habe gestern vllt ein, zwei Stunden gespielt. Wurde ich von irgend einem Randomspieler gemeldet, weil ich seiner Ansicht nach nicht richtig gespielt habe?</p>
<p>Das ist äußerst ärgerlich, vor allem so kurz vor dem Release von Halo 5...</p>
<p>Ist das erste Mal, dass mir sowas passiert, daher bin ich gerade etwas ratlos. Kann mir jemand helfen?</p>

<p>Verstehe ich nicht. In dem Sammelthread wird darüber gesprochen, dass nach Aufhebung des Banns der Partychat nicht funktioniert. Ich rede hier allerdings über die ungerechtfertigte Sperrung mit Gründen, die alles andere als wahr sind.

            <p>Direwolf - Vielen Dank das du dich hier meldest.</p>
<p>Das hier ist aber die falsche Anlaufstelle - Hier gibt es niemanden vom Support oder vom Enforcement-Team. - Es arbeitet noch nicht mal jemand hier für Microsoft.</p>
<p>Die regionalen Foren sind Community betreut zum Beispiel hier durch cRaZyLIZARD76. - Community betreut bedeutet das cRaZyLIZARD76 ein Spieler wie du und ich ist.</p>
<p>Wenn du ein Problem hast kannst du dich zwar hier melden - Aber du wirst hier auf keinen Microsoftmitarbeiter treffen der dir helfen kann.</p>
<p>Wenn du ein Problem aufgrund einer Sperrung hast, dann musst du dich an das Enforcementteam bzw. an den technischen US-Support wenden.</p>
<p>Ich hoffe ich konnte dir nun die Struktur näher bringen.</p>

<p>Es ist interessant zu sehen wie viele Leute das ganze betrifft.</p>
<p>Ich wurde auch bis zum 05.10.2015 gesperrt, wegen unangemessenem sprachverhalten... Warum auch immer!</p>
<p>Jedenfalls bringen die so gut gemeinten Tipps hier relativ wenig!</p>
<p>Ich hatte dort schon 2 mal hingeschrieben und nie eine Antwort erhalten, geschweigedenn irgendeine Reaktion auf die Nachrichten.</p>
<p>Einfach eine Sauerer! Sperren können die alle ganz fix wegen nichts und wieder nichts, aber entsperren geht dann plötzlich nicht mehr? Dann dürfen die keine Leute sperren, wenn nicht zugesichert werden kann, entsperrt zu werden!</p>
<p>Auf der Seite haben die schon lange stehen, dass sie sich Mühe geben das Problem zu beheben.</p>
<p>Merke ich leider relativ wenig davon!!!</p>
<p>Wie immer Microschrott!</p>
<p>Ich werden die MüllBox One niemanden mehr empfehlen.... Der Zug ist für immer abgefahren!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 &#39;Class not registered&#39; errors</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my system to Windows 10. It worked fine for the first couple of days,&nbsp;</p>
<p>but now when logging in my desktop is unusable for around half an hour, it seems to restart all the icons on the tastbar.</p>
<p>Following this I can not use the start function or any windows applications due to an 'Class not registered error'. Only my Google Chrome works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found and removed malware after updating my AVG antivirus, but I still cant get on any windows functions. I've tired a &nbsp;sfc/ scannow, which didn't work. Please help?</p>

                    This box keeps popping up over and over again and is very annoying.&nbsp; I saw a post about this from 2015. I did what the person said. Holy windows key and hit R. Then shut off the windows installer.. but this issue continues and I do not know how to fix
 it. Help please.&nbsp;

<br /> 
<br />Right click task bar to open Task Manager.  If necessary show More Details
<br />
<br />On Details tab look for msiexec.exe, highlight to End Task.
<br />
<br />Now try install or uninstall again.
<br />
<br />If this doesn’t help you can try to Fix problems that block programs from being installed or removed:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17588/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17588/...</a>

            I downloaded BitDefender. It is installed and seems to run okay. This issue started after that. I cannot find that file in my running processes and I cannot find BD on the list of programs that need to be installed after I clicked the link you sent. Thank
 you for responding though. :] Hoping for more help!&nbsp;

            You said BitDefender is installed.   Is it listed at Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features?  If so I'd Uninstall it and default to built-in Defender which assures best Windows performance and is built by Microsoft who know how to protect their operating system best.  If you have any worries about infection just install Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner to do on-demand scanning.  
<br />
<br />If it will not uninstall then follow all steps I gave.
<br />
<br />If that fails I would run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

<h2>            Not Enough Space for Windows 10 on HP Stream - Out of the box</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Stream 13 that came with a "free Windows 10 upgrade."&nbsp; Problem is, the 32gb solid state drive doesn't have enough space to download and install Windows 10 (this is out of the box - I haven't downloaded or installed any additional content).&nbsp;
 Wondering if anyone has a simplified solution to this.&nbsp; I've seen a few responses about installing on a USB drive, but I'm not confident I know how to perform a install that way.&nbsp;

<h2>            My headphones suddenly stopped working</h2>
                    Ok, here's the thing:
<div>I have a dual boot machine with Windows 8 and Arch Linux.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Everything was working, then I rebooted into Arch Linux, and rebooted into Windows 8 again.</div>
</div>
<div>Now my headphones aren't working anymore on Windows.</div>
<div>But they are working on Linux and any other devices.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, it's not a headphone problem. It's not a computer jack problem.</div>
<div>It's a Windows problem.</div>
<div>I didn't updated anything on Windows nor Linux.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have installed new (and old) Realtek drivers, messed with registry, but nothing seems to work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What could I possibly do to fix it now?</div>

<div>The bug, I would say, is bigger than that. Probably a driver or software incompability that I couldn't find yet.</div>

<div>Not sure what an equivalent would be on systemd, but if you're on SysVInit (*buntus [*buntae?] are) this will work as-is. I'm gonna be trying to find an equivalent for systemd (I'm an Arch user), as the main reason Windows has existence on my PC is for
 games. And people tend to glare at the explosion noises, so headphones are necessary.</div>

<h2>            How to force connection via ethernet</h2>
                    For the last few days ive been having issues streaming my xbox to my pc. My xbox only allows connection when my pc is connected to the router via WI-FI. Both the xbox and pc are connected to my router via ethernet but when i disconnect from the WI-FI network
 the stream disconnects even though both are connected to the same network via ethernet. Spoke to support and updated windows to latest version but didnt fix the issue. Any ideas?

            Make sure both are connected to the cable before turn on. Obviously if you disconnect the wifi the streaming will disconnect too.

            Sorry, maybe i didnt word that all too well. Both the pc and the xbox are plugged into my home network via ethernet and powerline adapter. When both are turned on and my pc is disconnected from wi-fi my pc wont connect to the Xbox. However, when I connect
 my pc to wi-fi i can connect and stream but the quality isn't where i want it to be. Not sure what i need to do differently.

            You want force Ethernet connection for xbox or pc? If you connect Ethernet cable to Xbox, and evertyhing work normally (dhcp server give ip address, etc) xbox one ALWAYS use Ethernet cable connection. I think, your powerline&nbsp;adapters NOT configured right,
 do you remember pairing powerlineadapters? Can you test Ethernet connection? Maybe you can use laptop or something another pc to test Ethernet connection connectivity... Mayby your pc is configured static ip? And pc working well when you use same Ethernet
 cable, but when you connect Cable to xbox you cannot connect to Internet, because your Xbox want use dhcp.... Can you move xbox temporarily to same room where you router or modem is it? And test connection straight, modem/router to xbox, ? Problem is powerline
 adapter and/or network configuration via dhcp... I think powerline adapter doesn't paired...

    <title>Windows update breaks my network driver. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beenbean  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows update breaks my network driver.</h2>
                    <p>So, the latest windows update completely breaks my network driver. I have been unable to connect to the internet at all after installing the update, and have reverted to the previous version every time. I know for a fact it is the update, as when I reverted
 back to the previous version, things began working as normal. I checked device manager and the error I get when I have the update is a code 10 (device cannot start). No fixes I found on the internet have worked. This would be fine if I wasn't forced every
 time I shut down the computer to install the latest update. TP-LINK has yet to release a new driver and hasn't since august of last year, so a fix soon seems unlikely. Is there any way I can prevent the update from installing, or any fix to the problems it
 causes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I forgot to mention the model of the card, it is a TP-LINK Archer T9E</p>

<p>Hi Zoltan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As what the error messages imply, the issue that you're having can be caused by a corrupted file. To resolve such issue, we suggest downloading the Windows 10 installation media and use it to restore from a system restore point or to reset your computer.
 You can go to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> and perform the steps under <strong>Use installation media to restore or reset your PC
</strong>section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us if it addressed your issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Gears of war 4 download keeps reseting</h2>
                    Hello. I have tried to download gears of war 4 from windows store 3 times. First time it downloaded about 60gb then the download reseted and it started to download from scratch. Second time it downloaded about 72gb and reseted, third time about 70gb. Why
 does this keeps happening? This is very frustrating for me because of my slow internet. For me to download 70gb takes about 20 hours. What can I do? I read that clearing windows store cache might work, but for me it didnt work.

Because I have noticed that downloading the apps from the Windows Store will not complete if the computer has updates that are waiting to be installed.</p>

</p><p><span>CC cleaner is an Optimizer Program design by third party Manufacturer. In order to download CC cleaner you may search in internet. Well, Microsoft doesn’t recommend any third party optimizer software to install or to use in the computer.</span></p>

<p>This information is useless because you have no idea of what you are talking about. A disgraceful comment from a supposed "Microsoft support" person. Shame on you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, back on topic.</p>
<p>You can't install applications from outside the store. End of. </p>
