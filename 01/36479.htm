<h2>            Why Windows 10 Update 1803 has broke multiple things in my system</h2>
                    <p>Today I had some windows update installed in my system - and it looked like a pretty big update. I have checked after the update has finished that the update was indeed Windows 10 Update 1803 (aka Windows 10 April Update). However this update has broke two
 things in my system:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Alt + Tab. Pressing it will result in nothing. However Win + Tab still works&nbsp;<br />
2. All the connection to Microsoft Services and even Skype will result in error saying cannot connect. Microsoft Service includes Microsoft Account, Microsoft Family ect. The bug report in windows menu wouldn't work either I guess - that's why I'm posting here</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is where do I report those bugs and is there any workaround to fix them?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<br />HOW TO REPORT PROBLEMS WITH MICROSOFT SERVICES, INCLUDING ONEDRIVE (NO EMAIL REQUIRED, BUT NO REPLY) – TWITTER, FACEBOOK, SOCIAL
<br /><a href="http://www.7tutorials.com/how-report-problems-microsoft-services-including-onedrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.7tutorials.com/how-report-problems-m...</a> 
<br />One of the good things about Microsoft’s services is that they offer a quick way to report when you have issues. Also, Microsoft provides complete service status history so that you can find out what issues have happened in the past and when they were fixed. If any Microsoft service is not working for you (MS Account, OneDrive, Outlook.com, Family Safety, etc), here’s how to report your problem in just a couple of seconds
<br />SOCIAL MEDIA- TWITTER - MAKE YOUR PAIN PUBLIC, MAYBE THEN MS WILL FIX THE PROBLEM – AND THEY USUALLY REPLY
<br /><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/microsofts-twitter-based-tech-support-puts-apple-in-the-shade-7000016997/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.zdnet.com/microsofts-twitter-based-t...</a> 
<br />Sorry, there is no good answer to that. If you, and all the others with this problem start tweeting it, making it more public, maybe then MS will finally be inspired to find the fix to the problem.
<br />Microsoft has a number of dedicated teams that do this kind of support explicitly: @WinPhoneSupport, @XboxSupport, @MicrosoftHelps, @WindowsSupport, @Office, @Surface, and @Microsoft
<br /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.facebook.com/Microsoft</a> 
<br />You can reach out to key folks on the Windows Engineering team through Twitter

            Thanks for all the reply!<br />
<br />
It seems like the Alt + Tab issue only appears intermittently. It went normal yesterday morning but broke again at night, and it seems ok again now. I have no idea why it's going this way after the update but I have no interest in figuring out as long as it
 works right now.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Issue regarding to Microsoft Service seems like a DNS issue. I got INET_E_RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND when trying to visit any website using Edge or IE. I have no idea what part of the update broke it but I'm suspecting it's something regarding to windows defender.
 For now I'm just trying to fix it as a stand alone bug because I'm tired of trying to think what MS does in this wonderful update.

<p>Update - I just end up rolling back the update as I have discovered other issues - my screens are showing weird colors, one screen looks very dimmed and no colors look faded, while the other two looks like over exposed and contrast is way too high.</p>

<p>I too did my update, on Saturday June 9th. It was a fairly big enough update, of which I didn't realize there was one, till I had to reboot my computer, and it stated the old saying *<strong>Update and restart</strong>* or *<strong>Update and shutdown</strong>*,
 well I don't usually do updates because they have been known to break things that are going good in your system...….so, since windows didn't give me any other option then to do either of these, I chose *Update and restart*…… and damn wouldn't you freaken know
 it,, as soon as this update comes back into windows after updating, I lost my <strong>
2TB HDD</strong>....so, I rebooted, and it found it again...…. then I tried playing one of my games *<strong>State of Decay 2</strong>* that I have played so many times, and *<strong>CSGO</strong>* sooo many times and *<strong>WoW</strong>* so many times, and
 wouldn't you know it, my stupid system freezes for 20-30 seconds. <strong>NONE </strong>
of this ever happened and I mean never in the last year, before this update...…..So I spent the next 8 freaken hours, trying to get my system to boot off a USB stick after trying to get a boot to USB setup, and before I did this, I stripped my system apart,
 putting in 1 piece at a time, to try and recognize my <strong>HDD</strong> so I could save something on that 2TB. Finally after 3hrs of playing with it, it recognized my
<strong>HDD </strong>again, transferred my stuff over, made the boot USB n rebooted n started the install. After windows was installed and newest&nbsp; Graphic drivers installed again and wouldn't you know the update again for windows downloads without asking me,
 it installs AGAIN I lose my <strong>HDD</strong>, again I reboot a couple of times to try and get it back again and when I do, I try running my games see if at least that's working with no problems...…...nope same thing. This last update was crap and I am
 still haven't problems right now. My games are freezing, and my <strong>HDD </strong>
keeps losing connection and I have to keep rebooting multiple times to get it back, EVEN if I leave my system running like I did last night before bed, the
<strong>HDD</strong> without computer usage disconnected and was not working till I rebooted 3 times. SO to make a long story short*er*, this update broke my system, how can I go back to the old setup since I have already formatted and lost the previous setup,
 and this setup now is garbage, how can this be fixed. I ran <strong>HDD </strong>
scanners and defragmentation and the <strong>HDD </strong>is good, I ran <strong>
GPU </strong>testing and clocking and its good but the system for this windows is broken. Also as of right now, I have tried to reboot a few times, and every damn time, my system says *<strong>Update and restart</strong>* or *<strong>Update and shutdown</strong>*
 it won't go away WTF...... Anyone have help here on how this can be fixed , is there a fix for it already, I don't know.....I turned off the windows update and will not install another one again.</p>

                    My Computer has Windows 8.1 installed. So i have this OS for about 7 months. When i started my computer yesterday. I experienced "Check disk/Automatic Repair". So i am worried about my other files because they are all saved on that computer. So when the
 check disk/automatic repair is done doing its work. I saw all my programs in my desktop is&nbsp;<strong>ALREADY GONE!</strong> So &nbsp;i explored/checked my other files in the drive. I am getting annoyed because of auto search of drives in the windows explorer. So
 i opened "Task Manager" to Restart "explorer.exe". Afteri restarted it. It browses finely. After some minutes. The explorer is not responding. So i am getting annoyed too much because of this problem. Some days later. I am getting angry because of problems
 is getting worst.&nbsp;<strong>I HAVE 2 PROBLEMS NOW.&nbsp;</strong>My 2nd problem is "The proxy is refusing connections" From firefox, Windows Update, Steam!. So i have to ask here at Answers Microsoft if someone can fix my problem. A person can fix my problem is greatly
 appreciated :) ;) 😊😄😃😀😉😌😔😞😣😭😪😥😰😩😫😤😡😑😵😲😮😐😟😧😦😕😯.

Yes, you can set up a second auto attendant as your required with the same steps as the first attendant.<br />

            <p>I have the same issue.&nbsp; In explorer or otherwise if I click new file it causes explorer to crash since upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp; I was trying to clean up my filing system in a folder and create sub-folder structure for files and it will not allow me to do
 this by either right click or by selecting "new folder".&nbsp; Let me know when they find something besides disc checking. I have run all of the above processes, I scanned my computer for malware.&nbsp; I even deleted the process and created a new Windows Explorer exe
 process. This does not fix the problem.&nbsp; I can not create a new folder in Windows Explorer without it crashing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Win10Pro 64bit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran sys/ scannow ; checked DCIM, disc check, cleanup, uninstalled reinstalled mouse and keyboard (both Microsoft) with up to date drivers and they are both listed as compatible products, sound and video are up to date, &nbsp;updated BIOS. I can use CMD/adm to
 create a dir and copy and paste into it. The new file button (icon) causes file explorer to crash in 20 seconds-I have multiple critical errors from trying this after every fix and no solutions show when I check. I tried resetting folder and file options to
 defaults, no change. I can not use ctr shift n, can not use icon to create a new file. Malware is 0 I have scanned my system with both Norton and PCMatic, I have Norton installed and is up to date and both are win10 compatible. They were not active during
 upgrade. I even reinstalled win10pro64 from disc upgrade tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am certain in 2 months someone else had this happen and knows how to fix it???&nbsp;</p>

            I eventually found the issue. Whenever the menus (such as New, Open With) contain an item of the Windows Store Apps, the window will "freeze". Microsoft, please fix it soon.

            More info: while the right-click menu froze (e.g., right clicked an html file and then clicked Open With), I killed a dllhost.exe process (but no thread number) in the Analyze Wait Chain of explorer.exe (in Task Manager). Then (before Windows or explorer.exe
 was restarted) the issue was gone (e.g. an html file could be opened with Edge from the Open With menu).

    <title>Windows 10 Reboot loops after running provisioning package to upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Reboot loops after running provisioning package to upgrade edition</h2>
                    <p>Build 1511 - I have a provisioning package that only does the edition upgrade with the UpgradeEditionWithProductKey setting. I run it on a freshly installed Windows Pro edition and it successfully upgrades the edition to Enterprise, reboots, and then displays
 the notice that the edition upgrade was successful and I can see that it changed the edition and activated in system properties. It then starts into reboot loops in which I can see CHANGEPK.exe running and then prompting me that it must reboot. This happens
 continuously (rebooting every few minutes for a day now).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reproduced&nbsp;this experience&nbsp;on VMs and on OEM hardware delivered with Windows 10 Pro installed that I am trying to reprovision w/o loading a new image. Any ideas why I am getting the constant rerun of the changepk? I have used 2 different MAK keys,
 one from my partner and one from my business.</p>

<h2>            Xbox one muy lento.</h2>
                    
<p>¿Qué onda, gente?</p>

<p>Llevo como 2 días con muchos problemas al iniciar sesión (tarda mucho) y me pone que hay un problema pero no menciona cual. Además, cuando por fin logro hacerlo, mis juegos en línea están exageradamente lentos. Imposibles de jugar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Por ejemplo, no me conecta a los servidores de EA, pero sólo es el problema en One, ya que el 360 funciona bien.</p>

<p>¿tienen alguna idea de que pueda ser?</p>

<p>De antemano, gracias.</p>

                    <p>I bought a new Xbox one on Tuesday (11/15/16)&nbsp;the 500gb system where you could pick a game and you would get the code to download it.&nbsp;I logged on to the Xbox website and picked Gears of War Ultimate Edition, and never received my code. It said i should get it in about 2 days. What should I do to get the code?</p>

    <title>Unwanted items on Windows 10 taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neeluly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unwanted items on Windows 10 taskbar</h2>
                    Since the latest Windows 10 upgrade ninety percent of the space on my task bar is completely taken up with not only the icons for, but also the titles of the following unwanted items: My name; This PC; Libraries; Network; Control panel; Recycle bin, and
 Control panel (again), each one taking up three cms. of space. This leaves about two cms of space on the left-hand side of my laptop for a couple of the icons for the apps I use, the rest having to be retrieved by way of an up/down arrow. On the far right-hand
 side, there are the usual system icons. While I can unpin any of the apps from the task bar if I want to, I have completely failed to find a way, via the settings options, to unpin these specific, unwanted icons and their titles from from it. Can anyone tell
 me how, please?

            <p>Hi NeeLuly,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the&nbsp;above settings being eliminated as causing your issue with the Taskbar I did some further investigation&nbsp;and believe I was able to duplicate what you are describing on my PC, and if so, it is settings related. Here's a snapshot:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/53018112-6c3a-434b-a623-9fe9c55a3a2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/53018112-6c3a-434b-a623-9fe9c55a3a2e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to me that the Desktop toolbar is turned on and is expanded to the left. To keep it on but take up minimal&nbsp;space on the taskbar you can do this:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34229437-339f-4d85-ae11-3d0b08d34cba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34229437-339f-4d85-ae11-3d0b08d34cba" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll then have this in the Taskbar:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/85e735a9-941d-4efa-93c0-83a4b811066b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/85e735a9-941d-4efa-93c0-83a4b811066b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To then use it do this (I like it this way and will now be using it myself):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cd0edb7-0999-4838-a3ac-e3ec8c8bb6d1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cd0edb7-0999-4838-a3ac-e3ec8c8bb6d1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can turn off the Desktop toolbar completely: </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/071d1beb-2db0-4b8f-a055-e99f6ce7a668" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/071d1beb-2db0-4b8f-a055-e99f6ce7a668" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll then have this in the taskbar:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d60bda1-a270-4f9a-bff7-82a99f6a6b65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d60bda1-a270-4f9a-bff7-82a99f6a6b65" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this solves your problem, if it doe's,&nbsp;please mark this reply as the Answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck!</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try to run the Windows Media Player Library troubleshooter to fix any issues with corruption in the Library
 as it shows that the ‘tracks are ripped to the library’.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-Library-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-Library-troubleshooter</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also run the Windows Media Player Settings troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-Settings-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-Settings-troubleshooter</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the troubleshooter does not fix the issue then try to rebuild Windows Media Player Library database.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Clear the Windows Media Player database. Try the following steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<b>Start</b>, click <b>Run</b>, type <b>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Media Player</b>, and then click
<b>OK</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select all the files in the folder, and then click Delete on the File menu.</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Note:</span></b><span> You do not have to delete the folders that are in this folder.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Restart Windows Media Player.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not tell us why you want to wipe the Hard Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To wipe everything this method works, but be very careful using it:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dban.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dban.org/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>_________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can not format the System partition from within a running Windows Operating System.</p>
<p>Windows won't format itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>_________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>To format the Hard Drive, re-install the Operating System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can contact your&nbsp;Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.</p>
<p>Manufacturers normally do that for a small cost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you never received a Recovery Disk when you purchased your Computer there should be a Recovery Partition on the Hard Drive to reinstall&nbsp;Windows back to how you bought your Computer.</p>
<p>The Recovery process can be started by pressing a particular Key or Keys&nbsp;combination at Boot. (Power On / Startup)</p>
<p>Here are the Key/s to press at Boot to start the Recovery Process back to Factory Settings (new condition). Under each Manufacturer in the list below are the instructions in the respective links for you to follow on how to use their Recovery Partition</p>

</p><p>And if you do have a Manufacturer's Recovery Partition on your Hard Drive, you should be able to make your own Recovery Disks from it to reinstall the Operating System.</p>
<p>Look under Programs &gt; your Computer Manufacturer's name &gt; then their System Tools or Recovery Software Headings for them, depending how it is worded.</p>
<p>If you can not find any reference to it, contact the&nbsp;Manufacturer for advice on how to make those Recovery Disks.</p>

<h2>            Still No New Skype For Android Tablets&#33;&#63; AFTER 6 MONTHS</h2>
                    Hi there, I have skype on my Samsung tablet and the last update for it came out in May, version 7.46. Does anyone else here have Skype on an android tablet and haven't gotten the new Skype update yet? I think it's kind of crazy that after 6 or 7 months
 there is still no update for Skype on android tablets. I hope that the update will come soon.&nbsp;

    <title>why can&#39;t my laptop read east asian characters&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidguy3237  say:</h3>
<h2>            why can&#39;t my laptop read east asian characters&#63;</h2>
                    For some reason, and this has been a problem for a long time now, my laptop has been unable to display East Asian characters such as Korean, Japanese, and Chinese. However this seems to be a problem at specific places. I'm using Google Chrome and while
 i'm browsing the internet, the characters display just fine. This also seems to be fine when i type Japanese onto Microsoft Word, I am able to see what I am typing and it doesn't appear as boxes. However when I look through My Documents and on iTunes as well
 as when searching stuff through the start menu, the characters appear as boxes and I am no longer able to differentiate between a lot of the different files I have. They are for the most part just songs though. I recently installed a windows update titled
 "Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2709981)" and when I restarted my laptop the characters were being displayed normally again. That was yesterday and now I find out today that the characters reverted back into boxes so I no longer know what the
 problem is. If anyone can help me then i would greatly appreciate it.
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My laptop is currently using Windows 7 Home Premium and here are the specifications for my laptop if it is of any help.</div>
<div><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c02732805&amp;tmp_task=prodinfoCategory&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;product=5083664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c02732805&amp;tmp_task=prodinfoCategory&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;product=5083664</a>
</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>P.S. I tested out other languages to see if it would display correctly and when I made a random folder and used arabic, it displayed just fine so I am thinking it's got something to do specifically with East Asian characters.</div>

 my problem but after like a day i saw that the characters returned back to boxes. I apologize if I put this under the wrong topic</span>

            1. Yes, when the Norton free trial expired, I decided to look for a free antivirus &nbsp;program and the first one I chose was avast and since I didn't have any problems with it I have continued to use it.
<div>2. I believe I did uninstall Norton before I installed avast but whether or not I did "<span>(b) download/run the Norton Removal Tool [1] &amp; reboot" I wouldn't really remember since it was so long ago that I did
 it.</span></div>

<div>4.&nbsp;<strong>Windows Internet Explorer 9 for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems&nbsp;</strong><span>is currently being offered as an optional update however I chose not to install
 it since I do not use Internet Explorer.</span></div>
<div><span>5a.&nbsp;</span><strong>Service Pack for Microsoft Windows (KB976932)
</strong><span>was installed on 10/30/2011 according to the update history.</span></div>
<div><span>5b. I believe Windows Update automatically installed the service pack however I don't remember.</span></div>
<div><span>6. I don't use IE8 since a friend of mine&nbsp;recommended&nbsp;Google Chrome to me and I like it so I continue to use it. However I just tried out the internet explorer that's installed on this laptop and it seems
 to work fine.</span></div>

<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I am a kind of unpatient gamer. So I fixed the 5.1 toslink update with a little black box called HDMI to toslink Audio Extractor, there are many companies offering this hometheatre equipment. Perfect dolby digital sound with toslink. This box costs at least
 30€. And you can plug it between your ONE and display. This extractor "steals" the audio from the hdmi and puts it in your headset. Just switch the audio settings to hdmi 5.1.</p>
<p>Done!</p>

<p>That statement is inaccurate. COD is developed by two studios that leapfrog each other every other year, so COD: Ghosts was in development for the same length of time as Battlefield 4.</p>

</p><p>Many thanks. That explains why I couldn't set up my Australia Skype Number as Caller ID because I can't receive the code to verify when setting up.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Hard Drive Failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marklynch2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hard Drive Failure</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I inherited a computer from my father that had Windows 8 installed when it was purchased. I participated in the free upgraded to Windows 10 over a year ago and the hard drive failed a few days ago. I plan on purchasing a new hard
 drive but my father was not provided any recovery disks for the OS (which seems to be a common practice with computers purchased from "big box" stores such as Best Buy). Question - do I need to install Windows 8 on the new hard drive and then upgrade to Windows
 10? Also, I have read that the 25 character product keys are stored on the BIOS. If not, what should&nbsp;I do if prompted to enter them during the install since any costs for the license was accounted for when the PC was purchased? Thanks.</p>

<h3> ewe333  say:</h3>
<h2>            No &#40;blank&#41; file system shown in Disk Management</h2>
                    I'm using Win7 and I've got a 2 TB external SeaGate FreeAgent USB drive.&nbsp; I was trying to copy a bunch of files at once and it just kinda froze.&nbsp; The drive has about 800 gigs of data on it.<br />
So, here's the situation with it now:<br />
-It powers up.<br />
-The drive shows up in Windows Explorer but freezes when trying to read it and just shows as a drive letter (not the FreeAgent name like it did before).&nbsp; After 5 minutes, it says drive not recognized.<br />
-When I click on the little systray gadget that you click to eject a removable drive, it does show up there as a FreeAgent drive.<br />
-In Device Manager its recognzed as FreeAgent USB Device.<br />
-It shows up in Computer Management under Data Management<br />
-In Data Management it says: Healthy and it is assigned a drive letter (S).<br />
-It says Layout=Partition, Type=Basic, File System=(blank) while my other internal drive and it's partitions say NTFS.<br />
<br />
So, it seems I've got a bad file sytem<br />
Here's what I've considered doing:<br />
-Clicking on "Make Partition Active"<br />
-Running a chkdsk /f /r.&nbsp; But, I've read too many bad things about what those may do to otherwise good sectors.<br />
-Sending it in to a drive recovery specialist<br />
-Using a utility called testdisk<br />
-Run sfc<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on how I can more positively attack this?<br />
TIA<br />

            Actually....under Windows 7 in Data Management the File System=RAW.&nbsp; But, when I tried connecting the drive to my other XP system, it just showed a blank.&nbsp; Don't know if that difference really means anything.<br />
<br />
Also, after a while Windows Explorer pops up a box saying something like data error reading device and it gives a CRC error (cyclical redundancy check).<br />

            Hi, thanks for your input.<br />
Yes, the drive is recognized as a Seagate FreeAgent in device manager and in Disk Management.&nbsp; The post referred to above said that if it's recognized, then copy the data to another drive.&nbsp; But, there is of course a difference between the drive being recognized
 and being able to read it.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
My system and two other systems I've tried it on cannot read the contents and do not see that it has a file system.&nbsp; If I could get the contents copied off, I would wire it clean with a full format but I'm trying to figure out how to get the NTFS file system
 recognized.<br />
<br />
Any further thoughts from anyone?&nbsp; I mention a few of the ideas I have in my original post above but I'm afraid what each approve might do.&nbsp; I don't want to do anything irreversible.&nbsp; To that point, does anyone know of software that will do a sector/low? level
 copy of all data on my drive to another drive so I can keep whatever is there intact?&nbsp; I know I can't copy the actual files, but if i can just copy the raw data from this drive, then I'd feel more comfortable trying things like fixing the MBR or making the
 partition active and stuff like that.<br />
<br />
Thanks all.<br />

<h2>            I keep getting error code 0x8027025d</h2>
                    <p>getting error message 0x8027025d on Tom Clancy's GHOST RECON: WILDLANDS since the latest update when trying to start the game. I tried clearing persistent storage, uninstalling and reintalling the game, restarting the xbox, resetting my internet connection, and now I'm out of ideas. Anyone know how to fix this issue?</p>

            <p>Hey there!&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Are you still running into this issue?&nbsp;If so, since you've already tried many of the other steps we would normally recommend, I'd suggest trying to <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">factory reset</a> your console. You can keep your games and apps while you do this so don't panic just yet.</p><p><br /></p><p>Give that a shot and if you're still having issues, you'll want to try the full reset. </p><p><br /></p><p>Let us know how it goes.
