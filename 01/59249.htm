<h2>            How do I work the task scheduler&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I set up a radio station (NPR: WAMU) to play then schedule Audacity to record at predetermined times throughout the week.&nbsp; This only works if I remember to set up the radio station as I cannot seem to figure out how to have the scheduler enable it.&nbsp; This
 has not really been much of a problem but now I have a second radio station (NPR-KTOO) I want to schedule to play to when the first is not playing something I want to record. Actually, now I have a third one (NPR-WNPR)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like&nbsp; switch on and off radio stations as if it was a TV DVR changing stations to record.</p>
<p>What is my solution?</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>The task scheduler can only start programs for you, it cannot set options or anything inside those programs for you.</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, you are not correct here.&nbsp; After posting that message, I scouted around and yes, to some extent it can do what I want and even stop the action through a setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered that in a task, I can set the action similar to programming a shortcut.&nbsp; The "Action" contains program script where I instruct it to use a browser and the arguments are the path to the web site location where the program is playing.&nbsp; However,
 if other clicks are needed such as activating Itunes, then I am out of luck.&nbsp; Many moons ago someone told me how to create a batch file for that and I am initializing Audacity as well as start, pause, and stop recordings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can stop the program by using the option in the trigger to "Stop task if it runs longer than: __ " and it works well because all programs I want are in multiples of hours. It would be nice if it had a more diverse list of options other than 30min, 1hr,
 2hr, 4hr, 8hr, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have two associated questions though:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) Can I rename a task or is it necessary to delete it and recreate it?&nbsp; <br />
2.) Is there a way to duplicate a task and make small changes?</p>

            <p>As I said, the task scheduler can only start a program (a task) for you.&nbsp; It cannot, by itself, perform actions without that program for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the program you want it to start is a script (a PowerShell, batch file, shell script, whatever), then the script can take actions for you (but then it is not Task Scheduler doing those things.&nbsp; In other words, it just started the process.&nbsp; It dropped
 the first domino and watched them fall.&nbsp; In essence, that's all the Task Scheduler can ever do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned stopping a task, but that is also not the task scheduler doing so: that's you doing it by your own actions.&nbsp; You could have done the same thing from Task Manager instead of Task Scheduler.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your specific questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rename a task: not from the Task Scheduler UI no.</li><li>You can export a task, then import it as another name (effectively duplicating it) and then editing one of those copies.&nbsp; Right-click a task to export it.</li></ol>

            <p>You seem to want to persuade me to not even try.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have it working to my liking without any external files.&nbsp; The "Actions" tell the scheduler which web site to open, the "Triggers" tell when to run activate the site.&nbsp; I use "Stop Task if it runs longer than: ____" to stop end each program.&nbsp; Presently I
 have Saturday and Sunday 6am - midnight programmed for about 30 programs to play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To activate a recorder for recording was a learning curve but were extremely simple two line files.&nbsp; I start and stop the recording to create tracks of recorded material which is useful I if I want to replay something I missed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scarely a few hours of work and I am extremely satisfied.</p>
<p>I guess I answered my own questions.<br />
Anyone interested should contact me.</p>

            <p>I'm not trying to dissuade you, I just want you to understand that the Task Scheduler cannot send commands to a program.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can never have Task Scheduler open a program and then also
<em>do something inside that program</em>.&nbsp; You have to write your own scripting language for that, using whatever you want (HTML, JavaScript, C#, Windows Script, whatever you want).&nbsp; But the Task Scheduler by itself can only start the process, it can't take
 actions.</p>

<p>Not totally true</p>
<p>One trigger in my program initializes the software.<br />
Future triggers send commands to it.</p>
<p>I can even use that first trigger to kill the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With various triggers in the scheduler I can, </p>
<p>Initialize a recorder then</p>
<p>start the recording then</p>
<p>pause or stop the recording.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking into sending a file name to save the track and close the program.</p>
<p>It may be a lot of work for one function but it is the creativity that keeps me going.</p>

            <p>One big solution is the "Stop task if it runs longer then" option. FOr the ost part, it is working.&nbsp; I have even exported to do mass editing and then import.</p>
<p>

            <p>Yup.&nbsp; What that does is sets a timer and then actually fires off an internal <em>
taskkill.exe -PID</em> request to end the process.&nbsp; It doesn't actually send a shutdown command to the running program and control it like you think.&nbsp;For example, the program does not behave as if a user had clicked the X and offer to save anything.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>For my situation, to simply kill the program is what I want.&nbsp; For that event, nothing is to be saved.&nbsp; I am not sure why but the stop does not seem to be reliable.&nbsp; I realize that events more important than mine seem to be running fine.&nbsp; Maybe they all time
 out on their own and run a self-shutdown without the task scheduler doing it.&nbsp; Sometimes, it looks as if the task manager stop is not working at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the URL for a specific location in a web site that requires no further action, just the URL.
</p>
<p>For example "http://www.whyy.org/91FM/whyy.asx" starts but does not stop.</p>
<p>http://stream.wnpr.org/ Starts and stops as needed.</p>
<p>I have others but they need to be tested.</p>

            <p>I would think that it is because the why.asx is not "running" after you launch it.&nbsp; For example, if you start that yourself from the command prompt or Run box, you will not find a why.asx running process name. Instead, you'll find that it launched the associated
 program (probably some kind of media player).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution: make your scheduled task more specific.&nbsp; Don't lunch the asx file, launch the specific media player and pass the asx file as a parameter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same example but different file type:&nbsp; don't launch just "report.txt", but instead launch "notepad.exe report.txt".&nbsp; When you do the later, you'll see that notepad runs, and opens the file. But since the executable process notepad.exe is the one being executed
 (because it's an EXE file), it has the ability to be ended.</p>

<h2>            Looking for gamers for YouTube and twitch</h2>
                    
<p>Ok so I'm looking for gamers then are on often for my live streams and videos. While I'm not popular as my YouTube has 72 subs and I just started twitch it would be nice if you guys could join me that will be sick! The videogames that will be streamed or
 recorded on will be Minecraft,COD,Battlefield,Roblox,Tom Clancy Stuff,Star Wars Battlefront,Plants Vs Zombies,Destiny,Far cry 4, and a few more. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here are some things that are important 1.good internet-while I myself don't have the best internet if
 you do that will be great! 2. Speak English- &nbsp;i should be able to understand you. 3.mature and humorous-while sometimes we have to be serious sometimes we are just messing around and also no swearing as I try to keep a kid friendly thing. 4.Same time zone-while
 this isn't very important it will help when I have plans and I need to tell you the time I make video or I stream. Ok I'm done. &nbsp;YouTube: Steven The GamerSTG Twitch: thegaminglucky</p>

            <p>Hi Lea,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community. I understand that you want to know how to login to Windows 10 without a password or pin.
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I will surely help you to fix this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a Microsoft Account, you have to use the email id and password associated to that Microsoft Account for logging in to Windows 10. Signing in with an email address and password lets you use your favorite apps and your unique settings and
 preferences on any computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also use a Local Account to login to Windows 10. Signing in with a local account (with or without a password) lets you use the files, settings, and apps on your local computer only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer the article for additional information.</p>

<h2>            Windows XP PC &#40;with files&#41; to Windows 10 laptop &#40;brand new&#41; file transfer&#47;sharing - How to&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have just bought a new Windows 10 laptop and would like to transfer my files over from my old Windows XP desktop before I donate the latter to charity.</p>
<p>The XP computer doesn't have internet connection really as it is so slow and hasn't been used in years. I wanted to transfer the files using a cable and/or via the home hub (BT). Is this possible and how do I go about it?</p>
<p>I assume I need to share the files on the PC which I have done. I also assume some sort of network needs to be set up to allow the transfer and a cable of sorts to attach the computers directly or via the hub if necessary. However, can someone please talk
 me through all the steps in more detail as I have been looking online and trying different methods and so far I can't even see the other device from either machine (plugged in directly...I assume with the correct cable).</p>
<p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>James</p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>Have you tried to run "sfc /scannow" yet from an elevated command prompt?&nbsp; If not, click Start, type in "cmd" (without the quotes), right-click it, and Run as Administrator.&nbsp; The SFC program will actually look through your system files and try to replace
 any that are corrupted.&nbsp; If it can't, it should give you a log with details.</p>

<h2>            Toshiba Canvio External Hard Drive not recognized in Win 7 explorer</h2>
                    This external hard drive isn't showing up in Win 7 explorer, but registers in the device manager. Since it does't show up in Win 7 explorer, using is as a back up external storage device makes this impossible.According to Microsoft, this device is compatible
 with Win 7 explorer. I also have the same problem with my Seagate external hard drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Does anyone have a fix for this problem??? Thanks in advance

            Hi JM.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I would manually upgrade to the latest version 1903 by opening the Media Creation Tool from this link:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>, choose Download Tool Now, then open the tool and choose Upgrade This PC Now.   This saves your files, apps and most settings in place, is the most stable method to change versions, brings your Updates current, resolves most problems.
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If the Version has problems I will work with you to try to resolve them. If the problems are intractable, you have ten days to roll it back in Recovery settings.  
<br />
<br />Most problems are resolved by doing this gold standard Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> . So read it over and see if its something you want to learn to do. 
<br />  
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thank You For Your Reply. I Have Been Studying Windows Computers For Five Years&nbsp; Now And I Have Been Trained By Microsoft America India And United Kingdom. I Also Have Been Taught By Tech Fix Support From India. I Have Seen Otherworldly Futuristic Technologies
 Employed And Configured Right In Front Of My Eyes. I Am Now In The Stage Of Developing Computer Applications And Sideloading Them Into My Windows 10 Mobile Phone. I Am Currently Working On Ways To&nbsp; Input Windows Computer Programs Into My Mobile Device And
 Modifying Them So That They Will Be Operational. I Have Created The GodMode Application Into My Phone With All The Applications Stored In It Into The Phone. I Posted Another Question About Whether My Ideas Is Original Or If It Has Been Created In A Windows
 Phone Yet. I Did Online Searches And Contacted Microsoft About It, And They Want Me To Speak To MSDN Developers And Pitch My Idea. My Goal Is To Be A Level 3 Tier Network Administrator With The Gpedit.msc Settings. That Is Probably Wishful Thinking Though,Lol.
 Though I Would Like Your Feedback On Creating Computer Applications And Inputting It Into The Windows 10 Mobile Phone. Thank You For Your Kind Response Earlier And Reading Me Exude Onward.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It could be the most annoying feature for people who like their OS bareboned; however, If you update to the newest windows version, have your settings in windows store set to not auto-update apps, and in windows settings/apps uninstall App Installer + App
 Connector, I believe the haunting of these ridiculous apps goes away!</p>

            <p>Thanks Firedog, but that didn't work for me. The article I found here did though -</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://fsymbols.com/character-maps/windows/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the 'Symbol groups' section on the above page. </p>
<p>After step 3, below the screenshot of Character Map, I found the 'tick' mark I wanted (&amp; many other useful symbols too) in the 'Symbols &amp; Dingbats' section of the Unicode Subrange.</p>

            Hey, I the Microsoft boards have been no help to me on this issue.&nbsp; My LifeCam program would come up, but the screen would be black.&nbsp; Tried all of the Microsoft suggestions (update driver, etc.) with no luck.&nbsp; I've had issues in the past with other USB
 devices, and sometimes problems get resolved when you plug your device into another USB port.&nbsp; After a couple hours of no luck trying Microsoft suggestions, I remembered this quirk and gave it a try.&nbsp; Wallah!&nbsp; Success.&nbsp; After switching USB ports, the LifeCam
 began functioning again.&nbsp; I suspect that when I had plugged in a new thumb drive into another USB port that it did something to the overall USB connectivity that caused the issue with the LifeCam.&nbsp; My camera was a LifeCam VX-5000.&nbsp;&nbsp; Give it a try before all
 the other Microsoft mumbo-jumbo suggestions that take forever to find and try, usually with no success.

<h3> killernme  say:</h3>
<h2>            Live TV picture quality</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having the same problem.&nbsp; Picture quality is definitely not 1080p through the Xbox One.&nbsp; I tried the settings on both the Xbox and the satellite box, neither made any difference.&nbsp; I know the Xbox One is 720p for games, but is supposed to have 1080p support
 for Blu-ray discs.&nbsp; If I can't get the quality back, I'm also disconnecting the satellite box... so much for the "media hub".</p>

<p>The Xbox One is 1080p... watch a few BR movie and looks great... this seems to be an issue with the HDMI passthru and many many users are having this issue. &nbsp;Hang in there... hopefully there can be a firmware update that can solve this in the future, if
 not, then the passthru / TV integration is simply not worth it. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Picture quality is absolutely degraded on my system. &nbsp;My wife and kids have noticed it too. &nbsp;It's very clear to see. &nbsp;The picture is not as sharp and blacks are completely crushed. &nbsp;Maybe it's easier for some to pick up on, but I have a 60" plasma. &nbsp;It's
 bad enough that I plan on getting rid of the HDMI pass through unless Microsoft can fix the problem.</p>
<p>My cable box is from Time Warner. &nbsp;It's a Samsung SMT-H3272. &nbsp;I hope this is being worked on. &nbsp;As a main advertised feature of the Xbox One, this isn't cutting it. &nbsp;Surprised it wasn't caught during development.</p>

<p>I have Dish Network (hopper). &nbsp;Video quality when using the xbox one passthrough was degraded. &nbsp;Not severely degraded--the difference was relatively slight. &nbsp;Still, there's no point in using it when I can just as easily route the set top box through my receiver
 as usual and get the expected video quality. &nbsp;Kinda disappointing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm certain I had the correct service, television, receiver, etc. selected in setup. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>+1</p>
<p>Exactly the same problem as alpha45 signals. Same symptoms. And the 4 incriminated (OneDrive related) services are accessible only in the registry (not visible in services.msc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to solve/repair, please ?</p>
<p>

            Errors still exist in Windows 10 build 10532. &nbsp;As I see it, the issue is not that the specific service was terminated ungracefully, &nbsp;the specific OneDrive services can't handle a graceful shutdown or reboot. &nbsp;While there is no data loss risk to this issue,
 the issue is important because the Event Viewer gets populated with many false positives errors. &nbsp;Support professionals use internal Windows tools like Event Viewer and Services.msc proactively to monitor and and repair systems hopefully before productivity
 is lost. &nbsp;A faulty system component that spits out false positive errors, can't be managed with establish system tools, and can't be disabled or removed is not helpful to the support community and undermines confidence that the new OS is ready to leave home.

<p>These 4 error messages in the event viewer are caused by Microsoft One Drive services in a Microsoft Windows OS.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Black Screen, no cursor, can&#39;t interact with anything.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm having another problem again regarding with the same computer I had on my previous question, (Dell Inspiron etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time it was completely different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once I was able to log back on, I saw that there were a bunch of failed attempts to update something on the computer. I think the
<strong>code thing had an F</strong> in it? I don't really remember the exact numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to let it update so that hopefully the computer's attempt to update will be successful, but the next morning when I turned it on, all it showed was an
<strong>empty black screen</strong>. <strong>No cursor</strong>, <strong>anything on the keyboard won't work</strong>, and
<strong>pressing the desktop's brightness buttons on the right side to maximum brightness just makes the screen flash in colors white, red, green and blue</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried unplugging the desktop's cable, forcing it to turn off. But when I plug it again, the power on/off button on the right side flickers on, as if I have pressed it and it was already turned on. I tried to search on the internet for opening up Task
 Manager, but that doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I <strong>can't</strong> <strong>get to the log on screen</strong>, <strong>nor open up settings</strong> or anything, and the
<strong>blue error screen won't come up</strong> either, so <strong>I can't System Restore it or fully reset it
</strong>and delete everything. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello, thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried installing the media creation software, and successfully was able to burn the ISO file onto a CD. The thing was that once I inserted it in the disk drive, it wouldn't run. Nothing was happening. It was in the same state as before, only with a CD
 inserted in the disk drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pressing on the keyboard does nothing, there's no cursor once again. And colors red, blue, green, white and black just flash. It seems it's like the only purpose you can do with the computer now is use it as a disco light.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Summing things up, the link you gave me didn't help much..</p>

<h3> greaving  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bizzare Verizon Fios Firewall Issue &#40;Slow connection&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I have Fios and a MI424WR Rev .I Router and struggle with lag and latency with all call of duty games. Now Im not the only one but Ive been having this issue for a while now Ive tried everything from port forwarding to DMZ and I have a wired connection.
 I had Verizon installed recently and my down and upload speed are where they should be. Throughout my research I think its due to a firewall issue that I cant seem to pinpoint. Something is slowing my connection and it frusturates me to not know.My router
 automatically Port forwards ONLY port UDP 3074 when I turn on the console and connect to live. I dont have a UpNp option anymore on my router due to the new firmware so I cant disable it. This makes DMZ conflict with the port forwarding rule and it wont work.
 Any ideas on what the problem might be? Id appreciate all the help I can get.</p>

<p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Arkham,<br />
<br />
Okay, for that router it may be necessary to go into the port forwarding section and delete any listings for Xbox or that point to port 3074. It may also be necessary to go into the UPnP section and check “Enable automatic cleanup of old unused UPnP services”

<p>To Mister Fizzle </p>
<p>I actually tried your solution again and it worked! , for a little while that is because randomly one day I turn my xbox on the port forwarding rule automatically reappeared again. Then I noticed a problem with my connection so I tried your solution again
 , I deleted the 3074 port forwarding rule went to the direct link to UpNp and checked the automatic cleanup box then the publish all WAN connections box , hit applied then when I turn on my xbox again the 3074 forwarding rule appears again! I don't know what
 happened but its not working anymore I rebooted the router and nothing happens , I need it back to the way it was because it worked!!!

<p>Hi Arkham,<br />
<br />
Hey that's good news. We are making some headway. <br />
<br />
<strong>Would you please provide the bold info I requested in my post above?</strong> This is greatly help in the troubleshooting effort.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As for the port forwarding reappearing, have you followed the following steps to properly setup port forwarding?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a web browser. </li><li>Enter 192.168.1.1 in the address bar. </li><li>This device has several sets of login information: (admin/password, admin/password1, admin/password on sticker, admin/serial number beginning with CSJ).
</li><li>From the menu at the top choose Firewall Settings. </li><li>Select Yes when prompted to proceed. </li><li>From the menu on the left select Port Forwarding. </li><li>Select the "New Entry" link. </li><li>Check the box for "Specify Network IP Address" and enter the IP Address of the Xbox.
</li><li>In the dropdown box labeled Protocols select Show All Services. </li><li>Select Xbox Live from the next dropdown menu. </li><li>In the dropdown box labeled "Forward to Port" select "Same as Incoming Port".
</li><li>Select OK. </li><li>Select Apply on the next screen. </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Let us know, and we can work from there. &nbsp;</p>

<p>[/quote]Where in your router's web utillity interface do you see Port Forwarding rule appear? I think your looking at the NAT table of this NAT device, so it would make sense that you see port 3074 being forwarding for Xbox traffic.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 setup stuck at Making sure you&#39;re ready to install</h2>
                    Hello, I am attempting to install windows 10 on my windows 8.1 device. I have checked the system requirements on the windows website, and I am in compliance. I have been stuck at making sure you're ready to install for about 7 hours. I am using the&nbsp;Media
 creation tool. I have turned off windows firewall and windows defender. According to my task manager, "Modern setup host" is using very little resources. What can I do here? should I restart the process?

<p>Hi Matt,</p>

            This is not a good answer.&nbsp; "Corrupted Systems File" is a cheap excuse, this issue has occurred for me on machines that have never been used before. Additionally, SFC / DISM should be able to easily find and fix "Corrupted Systems Files". The reality of
 the situation is that Microsoft doesn't care and is trying to forget Windows 8 ever existed. A clean install might work for a single workstation, but I am trying to deploy a windows 8.1 -&gt; 10 upgrade on over 100 computers, and the time requirement required
 to do fresh installs on all those workstations is significant and not a good solution.<br />
<br />
In nearly all of the forums I have been to about this issue, they all give this same lame response, wipe it clean, something is corrupted. Another way to look at it is that the Windows 8.1 to 10 upgrade process isn't robust enough to handle any sort of deviation,
 and that's unacceptable, Microsoft. Can you please attempt to actually help users fix these issues as opposed to giving easy answers like "I don't know, try wiping it." That's not an answer to the issue.

                    I am taking a class and have to zip folders.&nbsp; My files are zipping as winrar, and the teacher can not open them.&nbsp; I need to change this to the native zip program.&nbsp; I can not find a Winrar program on my computer to uninstall. (I am assuming that this is
 the way I would want to go about doing this? - yes I know it was a paid program but it is causing me headaches.)&nbsp; How can I get rid of Winrar and set my computer to zip files with the native program?&nbsp; I run Windows 7.&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

            Try the free Revo Uninstaller to remove any fragmented or incomplete installations. There have been many success stories where&nbsp;the freeware&nbsp;<a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Revo</a>&nbsp;uninstall
 utility will locate and allow you to completely remove partial installs that may not be showing up in conventional program lists.&nbsp;There is a Freeware and a (paid for) Professional version. The Freeware edition should be more than sufficient for your needs.

            <p>That sounds like you might have a new issue.&nbsp; Because nothing with the ZIP file itself (or the settings for it) should impact your ability to attach it to an email.&nbsp; The email program should&nbsp;be agnostic, it doesn't know or care what kind of file is getting
 attached, or what 3 letters show up at the end of the file name.&nbsp; You could name it something.stuff instead of something.zip and test it out for example.&nbsp; Or maybe just drag-and-drop it into the email?</p>

<h2>            Cannot connect to DHCP server</h2>
                    
<p>I cam access Xbox live and the dashboard fine, however I cannot access any online multiplayer features.e.g. black ops 3 servers or EA servers.</p>

<p>When I test my connection I am told it 'cannot connect to your DHCP server, I have tried contacting my broadband provider (virgin) they set up some new ports, however the issue still remained, I then &nbsp;contacted Xbox support and I was told the best thing
 t do wa to play on a wireless connection, however my wireless connection is awful.</p>

<p>has anyone got any advice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I believe your wifi connection comes from the same router (device) which you have your ethernet cable plugged to that goes to your Xbox. In this case, the DHCP server should work for both (wireless and wired). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Try using a different ethernet cord, do you happen to have one so you can test it?
</p>
<p>Make sure your advanced settings are set to automatically obtain an IP address. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 not taking input from Keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edwardhopkins1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 not taking input from Keyboard</h2>
                    <p>Everything worked fine yesterday on my HP computer.</p>
<p>Today, the mouse works and I can press any key on the keyboard to wake the computer or make it bring up the login screen.</p>
<p>However, when I type my password or PIN the letters do not enter on the screen but the 'enter' key does work and it tells me I have entered incorrect PIN or password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried booting in safe mode but while it recognizes me pressing the F8 key, it doesn't recognize the ESC key and then boots normally.</p>
<p>I've successfully tried the keyboard on another computer and unsuccessfully tried another keyboard on my HP computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I rebooted 3 times to force the power on assistant and the correct UK keyboard layout is selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't want to reinstall everything but don't know what else to try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards</p>
<p>Edward</p>

<p>Does your issue solved after the third reboot?</p>
<p>Are you login in your PC?</p>
<p>Are you able to use different keyboard?</p>
<p>Try on screen keyboard and login.</p>
