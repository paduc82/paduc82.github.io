                    <b>--I have asked this question many times yet no good answer that helped--</b>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>About a month ago<br />
</b>
<div>
<div>I have&nbsp;experienced a problem with loading the following webpages: Google, Bing, Tumblr, Youtube, Yahoo, Ebay, Facebook, Paypal and many more.</div>
<div>I never use, or even go to Facebook, Ebay and Tumblr.</div>
<div>I first&nbsp;encountered this today like 4 hours ago, and I was like, why isn't this working. All I did today was use MyRepoSpace.com to update some of my tweaks for Cydia, and download&nbsp;Minecraft. Also I was Skyping with my friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>When I try to access the website directly I get a&nbsp;totally&nbsp;different website saying that it has noticed my problem and wants me to download a program on fileice. I right clicked and viewed the page source and found the link of the file it wants to me download.
 &nbsp;<a href="http://fileice.net/gateway/mygate.php?id=4b657a36454271536742557152773d3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://fileice.net/gateway/mygate.php?id=4b657a36454271536742557152773d3d</a></div>
<div>I don't know if the file is safe or stable.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also on my bookmarks that are a google and bing directs it gives me this:&nbsp;</div>
Not Found
<p>The requested URL /webhp was not found on this server.</p>
<hr />
<address>Apache/2.2.14 (Ubuntu) Server at www.google.com Port 80</address>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also took screenshot so please look at them for more info. By the way I have Windows 8, and I tried the websites on Fire Fox, Google Chrome, and Internet Explorer, but no luck. I have deleted all my cookies for a chance of luck, but didn't&nbsp;receive&nbsp;any.
 The only way that I can access these websites are from my other Computers and if I use a proxy server such as, www.nurbax.com</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 Buzzing Sound &#43; Crash, sometimes BSOD, Multiple Different Errors. Also, microphone issue.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intermittently for the last year or so, ever since I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to 10 (This issue had not occurred even once before the upgrade),&nbsp;I've been having an issue where my computer, in&nbsp;the middle of activities (usually gaming), will suddenly freeze,
 make a buzzing sound come from my headset&nbsp;- sometimes quiet, sometimes nearly deafening - then crash and restart itself. Around 40% of the time it will bluescreen, but the other 60% it will simply completely shut down and restart without any error messages.
 I can't figure out what makes&nbsp;the computer&nbsp;crash other than some games seem to cause&nbsp;crashes more often than others, but it crashes on everything sooner or later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried reinstalling Windows 10 repeatedly, as well as manually disabling, enabling, uninstalling, and reinstalling my drivers, thinking those might've been the issue, but nothing I've done has stopped the crashing. Additionally, it's been happening much&nbsp;more
 often in the last couple of weeks than ever before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The bluescreen errors I've had:</p>
<p>
</p><p>error:SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (mmcss.sys)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop Code: SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop Code: ATTEMPTED_WRITE_TO_READONLY_MEMORY, What failed: dxgkml.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The dmp files from 2 very&nbsp;recent crashes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ah1Qbu2Yncr_hQ67ylPcnF3Y3y8V</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The other issue I've been having is that recently, about a month ago, my computer randomly stopped picking up that a headset was plugged into the microphone port. The problem isn't the headset, as I tested with a brand new one once it stopped working - my
 pc simply seems to refuse to acknowledge that anything is plugged in. The audio works fine, but my microphone won't work whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>System specs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>GPU: Geforce GTX 970</p>
<p>CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5820k CPU @ 3.30GHz</p>
<p>Memory: 16.00 GB RAM</p>
<p>Resolution: 1920x1080, 60Hz</p>
<p>Driver Version: 372.70</p>
<p>Operating System: Microsoft Windows 10 Home</p>

<h2>            Computer stuck in black loading screen during start up after mandatory windows 10 update</h2>
                    I left the room, and when I came back windows 10 had started automatically updating (without asking). &nbsp;However, when the update was finished my PC was unable to start up, stuck in a black loading screen with the spinning dot icon on the screen. &nbsp;I waited
 1 hour before force restarting, &nbsp;However, since then I have force restarted 5 times all yielding the same result. &nbsp;I do not know how to fix this problem. &nbsp;Help would be much appreciated.

<h3> edcau  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bitlocker encryption&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 6 months ago I purchased a HP Spectre x2 2-in-1 laptop which came with Win 10 Home, but had Bitlocker Encryption turned on on the hard drive by default. &nbsp;However, I had to reset Win 10 due to malware infection, but lost the Bitlocker Encryption on
 HDD on reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can get the Bitlocker Encryption restored on my HDD, without upgrading to Win 10 Pro? &nbsp;As it came with encryption turned on by default at time of purchase, I am hoping there is a way to restore it without costing me anything but time and
 effort?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know how i can fix this?</p>

            <p>Frankly Bitlocker does not natively run in Home.</p>
<p>If you reset the OS the link between the OS and bitlocker has been broken and you will not be able to access that drive without formatting.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I do understand that bitlocker is a Win 10 Pro feature, and not Home, however, I think the manufacturer HP figured out a way to get it to be installed by default on my purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Win 10 home was reset, the reset process formatted the drive, but disengaged bitlocker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to restore bitlocker encryption without making another purchase of win 10 pro?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know?</p>

            After trying everything, I performed an in place upgrade, using a DVD I had of my version of Windows 7. Don't forget to write down your activation code before you do it.<br />
<br />
After inplace upgrade SP1 installed with no issues. I have no idea what was wrong, but W7 performs same as before.
<br />
<br />
MS needs to sort this out with a Fix-It link.<br />
<br />
Only clue was that the inplace upgrade notified me that dot NET 4 was e corrupted and needed a reinstall which it downloaded and reinstalled. Hope that help someone.<br />
<br />
Best of luck. <br />

            Right on.&nbsp; I also did an in place upgrade (or what some others call a repair installation), and SP1 installed after the 1-2 hours it took to redo the installation.&nbsp; Pain in the butt, but it worked.&nbsp; I'm surprised no one from the Microsoft support team
 has posted this as a possible solution on these forums--I've only seen it mentioned by community members like NickMoul.<br />

In an attempt to resolve this issue, I thought I could try disconnecting my PC from my Microsoft account, and reconnecting to see if it would reset. However, when I go to Settings, Change PC Settings, Your Account, and click on Connect to a Microsoft Account, it lets me enter my password for the local account currently used, then says This service isn't available right now- please try again later. I have tried restarting and connecting a different account. I have checked under services and see that Microsoft login assistant, user profile and remote procedure call services are all running. I am unsure of what to do now. I really do not want to refresh my PC, since everything works normal except for the connection to my Microsoft Account and I do not have time to reinstall all my programs. Thank yo

            <p>Okay, thank you for the response. Unfortunately, none of these efforts helped to fix my problem. After doing these things, however, I did remember that before this problem arose, I had just tried to connect Visual Studio to a Qt Command Prompt. I now have
 the normal command prompt, a Qt 4.8.6 Command Prompt, a VS2012 ARM Cross Tools Command Prompt, a VS2012 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt, and a&nbsp;VS2012 x64 Cross Tools Command Prompt that show up when is search "Command Prompt" from the windows 8.1 desktop.
 Could having this multitude of command prompts be causing some sort of problem? I have no real evidence towards this, but my recent installation of this has me questioning if this is causing the problem. Thanks for the help!</p>

<h2>            How to stop Windows 8.1 from downloading automatically</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 8.1 Not wanted. How can I stop it from automatically downloading?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP Pavillion 15 Sleekbook (15b142dx according to the box) that i've had for a little over a year now. I've used it for school work, or playing games. It came with windows 8 (NOT windows 8.1) installed. It's a good operating system, and i love the
 amount of control it gives me over the slightly more advanced functions that I know how to tinker with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it first came out, I tried installing windows 8.1 and immediately ran into some problems:</p>
<p>- My USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports didn't detect anything that was inserted into them. My portable mouse, or my PX21 turtle beach headphones. Things that worked perfectly normal until the update.</p>
<p>- The Dolby Advanced Audio v2 program that I so loved using was apparently absent from my hard drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- My audio jack didn't work.</p>
<p>- I couldn't customize anything, all the options seemed to be removed, save for changing backgrounds. Battery options, touchpad, and a few other things that I can't recall were affected so that I couldn't change any of their options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't like this. Luckily, I was able to do a system restore to a point BEFORE the godawful 8.1 update, and all functionality was restored. I have since rejected any reminders from windows to install 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of the posting of this topic, I have shut down my laptop and unplugged all power supplies. The reason being is because my laptop is being forced to update to 8.1, something that I don't want.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want 8.1's "improvements" in my laptops hard drive. From what i've been reading all over your forums, 8.1 has been a thorn in everyone's side since it came out.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My family isn't wealthy enough to pay for a new laptop that will function correctly with the 8.1 atrocity in an immediate fashion, since I am currently in my senior year of school.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to stop it from installing? Or am I going to hafta live with no USB ports, audio, or customized advanced options?</p>

                    Hi all, I can't download latest version of Windows 10 as there is not enough storage on my laptop. I have a Lenovo notebook with 27GB of storage, which is full, and the download requires 8GB. How can I process this download using an external 1TB USB drive
 instead? Many thanks! Melissa

            Hi Melissa, you would be amazed how many users with 32GB (27GB usable) of internal storage ask the exact same question here every day . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer,  backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you more internal storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Hi, Melissa,
<br />you may move some programs and files to external drive.
<br />Please check if your Windows is compacted by command
<br />compact /CompactOS:query
<br />if it not compacted you may free space by compacting, if yes - it is still possible to free some space with better compacting but making laptop some slower.
<br />Please check, whether disk is cleaned including system cleaning.

            Igor:
<br />
<br />I just started learning about CompactOS today, from an earlier question. Are you very familiar with it?
<br />
<br />This article:
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/compact-os" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardwa...</a> 
<br />
<br />says you can save just under 5GB on some Windows 10 installations.
<br />
<br />I haven't seen much, but the implication is that CompactOS only acts on the Windows installation, and some of the installed applications.  I'm guessing only the "Store" apps, not "normal installed" applications in C:\Programs folder.   Can you confirm that one way or other? 
<br />
<br />So I'm GUESSING that Compact OS is not full disk compression. It will NOT affect user files.  Right or wrong?

    <title>Battery drain in sleep mode win 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jankon&#225;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battery drain in sleep mode win 8.1</h2>
                    Hello, I'd like to ask you about a thing which has been bothering me for a while. I recently switched from win 7 to win 8.1 and everything works fine except when I put my laptop into sleep mode after a few hours the battery is almost empty. Before I didn't
 encounter a problem like that. I could have my laptop the whole day in sleep mode and after waking up I had the full battery. Now after 5 hours in sleep mode I'm not able to use my laptop which is anyway Asus Zenbook. I've read many recommendations but no
 one helped me to fix the problem. Also the laptop doesn't support the Standby mode. I've only found one answer which may cause the problem and it was that the laptop in sleep mode is still prepared to wake up as fast as possible and that may rapidly drain
 the battery. There was also mentioned that this is a windows bug which can't be solved. I'll appreciate your help a lot. Thank you much.

<div>2. Select settings in the drop down menu below search and type Troubleshooting.</div>
<div>3. Click on Troubleshooting and select the view all option on the left pane.</div>
<div>4. Click on Power troubleshooter and follow the prompts.</div>

            <p>Hi Rizwan Pasha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for your time and great advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably, I have worked it out by turning off the wifi before going to sleep mode.. that works great for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I tried your first method and ran P<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ower troubleshooter in the way you said. It helped me to fix two problems though I'm not sure if it solved the main problem. It just adjusted brightness and
 time to sleep.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Otherwise, I'd love to find out what's draining my battery, but as I wrote in the first post, my laptop doesn't support Standby (</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">connected).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In the past, I adjusted current power plans but it didn't help me at all, so I'll try to create a new one but I'm afraid that I won't help me to fix the wifi problem. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Regars, Jan</span></p>

<h2>            Game DVR not working &#40;0x82323012&#41; </h2>
                    
<p>Game clips dont record. I try every length and i get a sorry cannot record error 0x82323012 and if i press start record manually, when i end the recording it just sits spinning endlessly with no end product.</p>

<p>A hard reset fixes the issue for about 2 clips and then the fault returns. Obviously it is annoying having to unplug the console for a few minutes whenever i want to record something....and doing so loses the thing i want to record anyway.</p>

<p>Ive seen alot on this topic online but no fixes and no comments from Microsoft about this. Just knowing they are working on a patch would be something....</p>

<h2>            Weather App not working with Glance screen.</h2>
                    <p>So I was waiting for the Weather app's update that will cause it to work with glance screen as it was used to in Windows Phone 8.1 update. No such scene yet in Windows 10 Mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Due to so many troubles with Windows 10 Mobile, I decides to rollback to Windows Phone 8.1 for a restart. But here comes a jolt, that awesome thing of Weather app with Glance screen is not present even here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Time, notification, etc are working fine EXCEPT THE WEATHER APP my glance screen. So where exactly is the problem? Is it with the Weather app itself? Or something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please help. I miss those clouds in the glance screen.</p>

            Hi Donald
<br />
<br />I totally agree with you with regards to their own Office applications not being automatically being allowed through - that is really strange
<br />
<br />The 'Friendly' apps are those purchased from the Microsoft Store, because when a developer wants to add an App to the Store, Microsoft first checks the App's coding for any sort of bug or malicious code
<br />
<br />Then, as you say, there should be a list of apps that you can add, but there is not . . .
<br />
<br />To add an application to that list you must first know where it is located on your hard drive:
<br />
<br />1. Start An Applications
<br />2. Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
<br />3. On the processes Tab find the application, right click and choose 'Open File Location'
<br />4. once you know the location, you can then add that to the list       
        </p>

            <p>Hey there mamolear!<br /><br />What happens when you try to view the photos on your console? Does it just not register the DVD-R at all?<br /><br />You could try putting the photos on a formatted <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/accessories/usb-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">USB drive</a> and viewing them from there.<br /><br />You could also try setting up media streaming from your PC to your console to view your pictures like that. Here's a link to our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/audio-video-setup-and-use/media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">stream media using Xbox Music, Xbox Video, or Windows Media Player</a> support article which should walk you through everything you need.<br /><br />I hope that helps! ^_^&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Timothy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It can be a driver issue that is causing your keyboard issue. We suggest that you update the driver of your keyboard in the device manager. If the issue still persists, try reinstalling the driver:
<span>Open<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Device Manager</strong><span>, right-click (or tap and hold)&nbsp;the name of the device, and select<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Uninstall</strong><span>. Restart your PC and Windows will attempt
 to reinstall the driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Let us know if you have any other questions.</span></p>

<p>I've seen a lot of threads about this problem. Had the same myself but after some digging found this bit of info:<br />
Go to the RegEdit address HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\i8042prt\Parameters</p>
<p>The value of mine was 2ee0.</p>
<p>I changes it to 1</p>
<p>Since then haven't had an issue, key strokes normal behavior, so far.....</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

    <title>Why does my computer keep shutting down and giving me error messages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> krissyledbetter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does my computer keep shutting down and giving me error messages</h2>
                    My computer has been messing up for about 2 weeks now and Im completely at a loss on how to fix it. I have a Dell 2400 desk top, with Windows XP. First, Google Chrome crashed, then Windows. &nbsp;It told me in an error report to try uninstalling any new drivers...I
 had installed Silverlight about a week before this happend, so I uninstalled that, I ran CHKDSK, I ran a defrag, I deleted all the temp internet files I could, and restarted the computer when I was done...It didn't really help. &nbsp;The computer would run for
 minutes before shutting down again, and telling me a problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer, other times it would run longer, and just restart on its on. &nbsp;I'll get an error box telling me sometimes that
 the error report &nbsp;is corrupted. &nbsp;Sometimes when I start the computer, I get a screen that says Windows didn't load correctly, so I have to use the last known working config...sometimes I get a blue screen telling me to disable any anti-virus, disk defrag or
 backup utilities, to check the hard disk config, updated drivers and run chkdsk/f...I do everything it tells me, and it still messed up, over and over. &nbsp;I tried system restore, It didn't work, it said something about having to rename cache files, but the problems
 on the computer were still there. &nbsp;I even cleaned out the motherboard...it was dusty, to see if maybe it kept turning off cause it was over heating, but that didnt really make a difference either. &nbsp;It will run for hours sometimes, and others, it restarts or
 gives me that blue screen every few minutes. &nbsp;I ran all the tune up utilities I could, had things corrected, my system is suppose to be fully optimised but I still get the errors. &nbsp;I found alot of hidden drivers on my comp, but as I dont really know what I
 need and don't need, I left those alone. &nbsp;I've been told to check the memory, and BIOS, to disable caching/shadowing, to use windows update to check for updated drivers, and the only thing that is the same all the time is when I click on the purple error box
 that shows up when I turn the comp on, I check for details, and it says the same two things all the time, and, again, I dont know what they mean:

<div>C:\Docume~1\Krissy~1\locals~1\Temp\wer151.dir00\sysdata.xml</div>
<div>Hope I haven't confused anyone too badly cause I really really need help to fix this mess.</div>

<h2>            Can&#39;t change my account type</h2>
                    
<p>There are 4 user accounts on my computer.&nbsp; Right now I'm signed on as "Administrator".&nbsp; I click on Control Panel, then User Accounts.&nbsp; My Account Name is "Administrator," that's how I signed in.</p>
<p>When I click on "Change your account type" I have the choice between "Standard User" and "Administrator."&nbsp; but it won't allow me to choose "Administrator."&nbsp; I have my "Account Control Settings" set to the lowest level.</p>
<p>I know I faced this problem when I installed Windows 7, but I can't remember how I solved it.&nbsp; Would very much appreciate advice.</p>
<p>I recall that a true ADMINISTRATOR account is hidden in Windows 7, rather as it was in Vista.&nbsp; I want it accessible on the login screen, which is what I tried to accomplish by setting up an account called "Administrator."&nbsp; But I've forgotten/missed something.</p>

<p><span>Hi Ed,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you receive any error message/code, by chance?</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Could
 you please elaborate on “my ‘Account Control Settings’ set to the lowest level.”?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To change the user account type, please see&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-a-users-account-type" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Change
 a user's account type</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You’re right about the fact that the default administrator account is disabled in Windows 7, by default.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If you wish to enable the default administrator account, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 “Start”, type “cmd” in the Start search box.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 “cmd” and select “Run as administrator”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type
 the following command and hit Enter:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>net user administrator /active:yes</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Now, you may&nbsp;</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>create a new
 user account</span></a><span> with administrative privileges using the default administrator account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After creating the new user account, use the following command at the command prompt (as mentioned above) to disable the default administrator
 account:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>net user administrator /active:no</span></span></strong></p>

<p>Thanks for that answer, it never occured to me. I guess we will have to use something else on our phones</p>
