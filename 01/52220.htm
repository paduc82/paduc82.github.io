    <title>Programs won&#39;t install with Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Programs won&#39;t install with Windows 7</h2>
                    I got a new computer with Windows 7 already installed. It won't let me install any other programs, such as skype, kodak easyshare, or registry mechanic. I've gone back to the 3rd-party programs, and they assure me it is all compatible and have suggested
 things to try, but so far, nothing works.

            Hello kmartin898,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you try using the Microsoft Installer Cleanup Utility. Click <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> to download it.<br />
<br />
You can use the utility to remove installation information for programs that were installed by using Windows Installer. Be aware that Windows Installer CleanUp Utility will not remove the actual program from your computer. However, it will remove the installation
 files so that you can start the installation, upgrade, or uninstall over. <br />
<br />
Now try again to install the programs that were failing.<br />
<br />
Please reply back and let us know if this helped to now get the programs successfully installed.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
<hr />

    <title>Windows 10 Pro connect to Windows 2012 Server Essentials R2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fsu-law  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro connect to Windows 2012 Server Essentials R2</h2>
                    <p>Hello All, </p>
<p>I am trying to keep my composure while writing this post. The Free Windows 10 Pro upgrade has some strings attached. Take that back, it has an anchor attached to it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a small office. We have WSE2012 It has been running without issues&nbsp;for a year. It is running a DNS server,&nbsp;but DHCP is handled by my DD-WRT router. &nbsp;We have 7 client computers running Windows 7 pro. I decided to upgrade my computer to Windows 10 Pro.
 Upgrade went as planed, and no hitches during upgrade.&nbsp; The problem came when I tried to use
http://[servername]/connect&nbsp;in order to connect the computer to my server.&nbsp; Each time I tried,&nbsp;the browser would return an error saying it could not find the server.&nbsp; A couple of quick google searches suggested that
 I download the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Server Essentials Connector for Windows 2012 R2</a>. I downloaded the connector.&nbsp; Once I ran it,&nbsp;I would get to the step where the detector searches for the server. I kept getting an error stating "No Server Detected in the Network."&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried typing
 in the name of the server manually in the field below it, but I would get an error there too. The error says "Can not get information from server. Please contact Server Administrator" &nbsp;I can connect to the server using
\\192.xxx.0.xxx, but not via 
\\[Servername]. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to call Microsoft support. They suggested that I post the question here, or pay $500USD to talk to their support techs!!!!!!!! Are they kidding? Really? This is the cost of the free upgrade?&nbsp; That's extortion.&nbsp; So, I will post it my question here,
 and hope that someone has had a similar situation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can ping, traceroute the server.&nbsp;As I said before, I can connect using the ip address. Some web sites suggest that connecting via Windows 10 is more secure, but considering I can connect via the ip, I doubt that is the issue. I have dropped the firewalls,
 flushed the DNS, and still nothing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I upgraded a second computer to Windows 10. This on is the home version. It too could not connect to the server using the
http://[computername]/connect. So I downloaded the connector on that computer. I got the same error messages as above. So the problem isn't my client computers, it seems to be a problem on the server side.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there steps that need to be done on the server prior to connecting Windows 10 computers? Is there a best practices white paper or a server readiness tool?&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated!
</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 10 asking for password after resetting, which asked for pin - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> n0ope  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 asking for password after resetting, which asked for pin all the time before the reset.</h2>
                    After resetting my laptop to fix the little slowdown from about 30 minutes of gameplay, it is now asking for a password that I don't even remember putting. There is literally no other option but to enter my username and password, or email and password.
 I entered everything I could think of, and it just keeps saying that either one is incorrect. Is it asking for a microsoft password? I doubt it for it just said the password that was entered was wrong after resetting it in this website, and entering it on
 my computer. Please help quick.

            I can't even do anything in safe mode it seems. After restarting, it just says my account is disabled. What now? I don't have an ethernet cable, a usb, anything...but another old laptop I used previously. The account I used for my new laptop is the same
 as my old one. Will that help any?

            <p>I've been using windows 10 since August. It just updated again on December 22nd 2015. Since the updates I can no longer import pictures from my phone. I have been able to do so up until the most recent update. I already tried making a local user account
 with admin privileges. No luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, I'm really trying to be patient but this level of incompetence in the simple operations is ridiculous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm ready to go back to 7 and then switch to Mac the next time I need to upgrade. And for the record, I hate Apple but I just see things getting worse, not better at Microsoft.</p>

<h2>            Custom keyboard layout in Windows 7</h2>
                    I need to define custom keyboard layout, which was possible in Windows XP or Vista with Micosoft Keyboard Layout Creator. But the setup package created with this tool for 64 bit processors does not work on my PC. I have 64 bit Intel processor (i7 platform)
 and Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit. How can I do it?

<h2>            Video tdr failure - Nvidia GeForce 745m</h2>
                    Hello.&nbsp; Today I've updated my graphic card drivers to the newest version. I've used the ddu software to uninstall the previous&nbsp; version (http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html). After the update I'm constantly encountering
 a BSOD mentioning Video tdr failure and nvdmllmkn file. The bsod only occurs while playing a game (path of exile), right after the game finishes loading. What should I do? I tried reverting to a couple other versions of the driver but to no avail.

<h3> empyreus nova  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one power supply unit broken&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I was playing on my xbox one like any other day when a spark comes from the outlet it's plugged into and my console turns off. Now whenever I try to plug it back in the LED just stays orange for a second before fading back off. Is there a fix for this or
 will I have to buy a new power supply unit?</p>

<p>You will probably need to replace your power supply. &nbsp;If you have a friend that you could borrow one from to test to be sure that it is the power supply that is bad that would be optimum. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also try resetting your power supply. &nbsp;Unplug the cables from the console, wall outlet, and power supply itself.</p>
<p>Wait 10 seconds. Important Be sure to wait 10 seconds. ...</p>
<p>Firmly plug the power cable back into the console, and then plug the power cable back into the electrical outlet and the power supply. Connect the power supply directly into a wall outlet.</p>
<p>If you have to replace it then contact customer support. &nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../contact-us</a></p>

<h2>            cursor turns into auto-scrolling and automatically starts scrolling up and down.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: After the big Tuesday update, Oct 9, 2012 my mouse started acting and auto switch to scrolling without touching it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's mostly apparent when using any browser. I thought it was a conflict with Zone Alarm but after uninstalling ZA the problem persists. Symptoms is the cursor turns into auto-scrolling so moving the mouse alone will scroll the pages up or down. The other
 thing when I place the mouse over the favorites, it auto opens all the favorite links! I tried restoring to before the Oct 9 update but the problem still persists!</p>

<h2>            Sign-in is blocked &#63; How long until it gets unblocked&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I will not explain the full story but basically I wanted to see what my boyfriend was hiding from me because he changed his password because he knew I saw him talking to a girl who I particularly didn't want him talking to so that night, I&nbsp;put his email
 address into the sign in box on hotmail and clicked forgot password, then I selected customer support. I provided almost every piece of information about him and told it to send me a password reset&nbsp;to MY hotmail. The next day he's telling me he's been banned
 from everything with his windows live ID. Today I got the reset sent to me and I did as it said, set the password to what he told me to set it as so he could sort it himself but, when I tried to sign into hotmail on his account to see if it's accessable now
 the password is changed, it instantly says "Sign-in is blocked" . He needs to get to his emails ASAP. I am not sure to why it's done this. Hope someone can help soon! And tell me how long it will take to unblock his account . Thanks</p>

            Well I had to make my problem clear by explaining what I did, that's why I mentioned what happened from scratch! So sorry? The link you sent, I have already used many times over and it is no use AT ALL. I can only do what i've already done which is providing
 information to send a password reset to my email address. There's no way to get round it! Its just blocked. I want to know when it will be blocked and how. There is no forum to post anything either on the link you gave either

Is there any way someone could guide me through several different steps to try and solve my problem please ? It'd be much appreciated.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the description, I understand that you are getting an error message "
</p>
<p>Windows host process (Rundll32) has stopped working". I will definitely help you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>2) When exactly are you receiving this error message?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong></p>
<p><span>Step 1:</span><span> Place the computer in a clean boot state to check for the issue<br />
<span>Start your computer in safe mode<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
If the issue does not persist, then follow the article to find the cause of the same.</span></p>
<p><span>St<b>ep 2:</b> I would suggest you to place the computer in clean boot mode and check if the issue persists.
<br />
A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.<br />
You may refer the following KB article to set the computer in clean boot: <br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</b></a><br />
<b>Note:</b> After the trouble shooting steps, refer to <b>Step 3 </b>from the clean boot link to place the computer back to normal start up mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><strong><span>System File Checker (SFC)</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>SFC tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions.</span></p>
<p><span>To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a) Click Start, and then type cmd in the Start Search box.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue</span></p>
<p><span>c) At the command prompt, the following line, and then press <strong><span>ENTER:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7?</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></strong></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Try the above steps and get back to us for further assistance and with requested details, if the issue is not resolved.</span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Word 2016 - Developer Form Filling - Rich Text Content Control</h2>
                    I am trying to create a form in word. Something that I have never done before. I have set rich text content control boxes, for applicants to edit with commentary. To instruct the applicant where to type, the box is filled with "click here to edit text",
 which they click on and type over with their response. Is there a way to hide this text ("click here to edit text") from printing,&nbsp;UNLESS over-typed, but still visible to users for instruction on where to type? So that if the applicant doesn't need to fill
 in that section, it doesn't print the "click here to edit text" text. But if it is over-typed with an answer, it prints this text? I hope this makes sense and would appreciate any help. Thank you.

<p>
</p><p>Maybe our&nbsp;inability to find the answer to our question/s through our own searching indicates&nbsp;a deeper problem; one&nbsp;of not fully understanding the subject matter, therefore&nbsp;limiting our understanding of exactly how to ask the&nbsp;right question through search
 engines?! Leading us to these forums, where we can ask a broad question, in the hope that an expert might be able to shed some light on the problem we are experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thank you for guiding me towards the correct forum I should use. I have posted my question there and hope to find another kindly gent, like yourself, who will be able to give me some guidance on the actual problem at hand.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 64 bit windows defender no longer functions. Can it be reinstalled</h2>
                    <p>Hello, After a recent virus I can't use my Windows defender. It no longer works, I tried to use start-up repair tools in Windows 10 (64 bit), and they will not complete and make no changes to the system.</p>
<p>I tried to use system restore tool. That will not complete and makes no change to the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something is still pretty off even though everything else appears flawless.
</p>
<p>I am worried about re-installing since I have these "hidden" issues.</p>
<p>Any thoughts how to uninstall/reinstall windows defender? Or to reinstall Windows 10 without my key? This was a Windows 7 upgrade to windows 10, I used the magical jellybean tool to discover my windows 10 key and it only gives me the windows 7 key,
 so I feel stuck with no solution other than to buy a new key and create a new partition and install a new windows to that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't think of any way to repair my current windows.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Steve
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />It could be an issue related to the following:
<br />
<br />- There might be Malware on the system
<br />- The edition of Windows 10 you are running: Pro or Enterprise might be managed by your organizations system administrator.
<br />- You might need to reinstall Windows Defender using the steps below. 
<br />- A repair upgrade might by required to fix it.
<br />
<br />Enable Windows Defender:
<br />Open Start, type: regedit
<br />Right click regedit
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Navigate to the following registry key:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SecurityHealthService
<br />
<br />and modify the Start value from 4 to 2. Restart your computer to re-enable the Windows Defender Security Center Service.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Defender Security Center Service
<br />Double click it
<br />Set its Start up type to Automatic
<br />
<br />Click Start
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Restart
<br />
<br />If that does not work
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt, hit Enter, exit the prompt then restart.
<br />
<br />REG ADD "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender" /v DisableRoutinelyTakingAction /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
<br />
<br />If this does not resolve the problem, then you need to perform a repair upgrade. See steps:

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. 
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A. 
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD 
<br />Right click CMD 
<br />Click Run as administrator 
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter 
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times) 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download 
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work.. 
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD 
<br />Right click CMD 
<br />Click Run as administrator 
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter 
<br />
<br />Run these codes: 
<br />Net Stop bits 
<br />Net Stop wuauserv 
<br />Net Stop appidsvc 
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc 
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak 
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak 
<br />Net Start bits 
<br />Net Start wuauserv 
<br />Net Start appidsvc 
<br />Net Start cryptsvc 
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.

            There may still be remnants of th virus on your system:
<br />Try running these programs:

<br />
<br />If these do not fully remove the virus/malware then it will be wise to register with a malware removal site to receive dedicated malware removal instructions, an expert will remain with you throughout the process until confirmation that your PC is 100% clean.
