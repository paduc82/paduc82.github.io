<h2>            Random calls</h2>
                    I have received circa 5 call back messages in which the person states that I had made a call to their telephone however, I have not dialed the number(s). It seems my skype telephone account is randomly dialing out! Is this a common fault, is there a solution.
 I have done teh classic ie switch off and switch back on. Help and guidance much appreciated.

Many thanks, really helpful. I checked my history and there's no record of the calls having been made from my account. I've been in and changed my password as you suggested and also popped in to Google to update my limited knowledge about spoofing. Thanks for
 your help. Ray

<h2>            &#34;Your yahoo account settings are out of date&#34; pop-up windows when using Fiorefox on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: YAHOO ACCOUNT SETTINGS POPUP</p>
<p>
</p><p>An annoying small popup comes from the lower right side of my monitor that reads "Your yahoo account settings are out of date".&nbsp; It happens about every 15 minutes.&nbsp; I have re-set my yahoo password, but that had no effect on the continuing popup.&nbsp; I have
 Windows 10 and use Firefox as a browser.&nbsp; How can this popup be stopped?</p>

            <p>I'm assuming this is the pop up you are referring to (see picture, below). &nbsp;If my assumption is wrong, disregard the rest of this message.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=fac7818b-0a7c-4879-94d7-bed7b088df8f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dfac7818b-0a7c-4879-94d7-bed7b088df8f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It has nothing to do with any browser. &nbsp;The message is from Windows 10 Mail. &nbsp;You can resolve it by starting Windows 10 Mail and fixing the Yahoo account listed or deleting it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To start Windows 10 Mail:</p>
<p>1) click on the Windows icon <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2flibrary.csusb.edu%2fimages%2fwin10Start.png" />&nbsp;(lower left on taskbar)</p>
<p>2) start typing the word "mail" &nbsp; &lt;---no quotes</p>
<p>3) click on "Mail - Trusted Windows Store app"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. If you have two step verification on Yahoo Mail (a great idea), you will need to generate a NEW password just to use in&nbsp; Windows Mail.&nbsp; Instructions here: https://help.yahoo.com/kb/generate-separate-password-sln15241.html</p>

            <p>I now have concluded that MS Windows 10 was somehow causing/allowing this "yahoo settings popup".&nbsp; Getting nowhere otherwise, I paid the $150 for MS support.&nbsp; The MS technician was allowed to look into my computer to fix two other issues, and this annoying
 yahoo popup has disappeared.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Because Windows 10 would not support my older Epson Perfection scanner as did XP, I had to buy a new $200 scanner.&nbsp; The first issue happened after loading all recommended software for my new Epson Perfection V600 scanner.&nbsp; The result was that I could no
 longer open Word or Excel.&nbsp; The MS tech made some repairs to resolve that issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it was noticed that now another popup became the new nuisance: "Your outlook account settings are out of date".&nbsp; I never use Outlook.&nbsp; So the same tech came back, and after looking into my computer, was able to repair that issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All along the way, during the almost two months of having a new computer with the latest MS software, Word and Excel files are Terribly Slow in opening.&nbsp; Opening a blank/new file is also Slow.&nbsp; True, one Word doc file is almost 600 pages, but while it used
 to open within 1 second, now it requires 15 seconds.&nbsp; While typing a few characters (and I am a Slow Typist!), quite often those characters don't appear on the monitor and I see the message "Word not responding".&nbsp; So I wait and finally the characters appear.&nbsp;
 Then I save my little additional 100 characters, and again the program hangs up and the message "Word not responding" again appears.&nbsp; In disgust just last night I saved that same document as a docx, but cannot yet rule on any improvement in performance.&nbsp; It
 still is slow to open, that much is evident.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have concluded at least two things from my own experiences: (1) Window XP was a Far Better more Stable and Faster operating system, and (2) The MS designers need to take a hard look at Windows 10 and Office 2016 to determine why XP with Office 97 was so
 much better and faster.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Windows 7&#47;LogMeIn compatability problem&#63;</h2>
                    My old office computer had an older version of windows (either xp or me, i cannot recall).&nbsp; we would use a program called LogMeIn because my boss works in another city, and thats the program we used for remote access.&nbsp; that computer died, the new computer
 has windows seven.&nbsp; now it would appear LogMeIn is having issues with windows seven.&nbsp; We have used our new computer to access other computers, but we are having issues any time my boss tries to connect to mine from hers.&nbsp; it also appears that LogMeIn is screwing
 up some of the options with Aero.&nbsp; The main issue im trying to fix is my boss NEEDS to be able to use LogMeIn to get into my computer.&nbsp; If anyone knows how to fix the Aero problem as well, that would be great

            Hello. I use LogmeIn on my machine and I have no problem in connecting to other PCs and no problem with Aero either. I suggest you uninstall the LogmeIn application, download the latest version of LogmeIn Free at this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://secure.logmein.com/US/products/free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.logmein.com/US/products/free/</a>
<div><br />
<div>Also, try changing this options: in LogMeIn preferences&gt;General Settings uncheck "Use display accelerator" and "Disablewallpaper and user interface effects on host computer". These settings represent the "mirrored display" that LogMeIn uses that breaks
 the Aero display. With this option left unchecked, the Aero theme is maintained.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope that helps</div>

    <title>source tcpip, event id 4226 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elizabeth23  say:</h3>
<h2>            source tcpip, event id 4226</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am running xp pro, ie8, svc pk 3, 32bit. I have only received warnings intermittently. EventID and the warning report all say this is for xp with svc pk 2. When I check on netstat -no there is no SYN_sent in the state column, and every time it is for
 psia.exe. My secunia application runs fine. I only wonder as the error states a virus may be trying to run. I have checked out various sites thru bing on this warning. One talks about downloading a patch

            <p>A.&nbsp; I would <b>NOT</b> download that patch.&nbsp; It is for peer-to-peer sharing, a common way to get your computer infected (note that one of the comments at the site you linked says that NOD32 reports that the patch file is infected, while
 another claims that VirusTotal says that the patch is OK).<br />
<br />
B.&nbsp; If I understand correctly, when you run netstat -no, you see "no SYN_sent" in the state column associated with a PID that resolves to psia.exe</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As I understand it, psia.exe is the Secunia PSI Agent, which runs in the background.&nbsp; This "agent" is at least responsible for doing weekly scans and may (I don't know) also be the component that attempts to detect changes<br />
to the programs it monitors in real-time.&nbsp; These features of PSI are turned on if you check "Start the Secunia PSI on boot" and "Enable program monitoring."&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>During beta testing of PSI 2.0, the PSI Agent generated complaints of using too much CPU time, but in a quick look I didn't see anything like your issue.&nbsp; Still, psia.exe does "phone home" to Secunia periodically, so it might be responsible
 for the errors you're seeing.&nbsp; If I were you, I'd ask in the Secunia Community Forum:&nbsp;
<a href="http://secunia.com/community/forum/psi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://secunia.com/community/forum/psi/</a>
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>FWIW, the search function at the Secunia forums doesn't seem too reliable.&nbsp; If you want to search, use Google, enter your search terms and use site:secunia.com<br />

            <p>1. No. Sway app was broken too.</p>
<p>2. I restore system prev.build after installing Anniversary Update. I don't want use this update for a while (for a week).</p>
<p>3. All app's interface is in English while system interface language is different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. After some activity with lang settings I have broken it fully. Now most universal apps looked and named as English. And common thing with moving local language upper in the lang list is useless. :(</p>

            <p>Did all steps. No effect. First. When I changed language to English, lesser part of apps (that wasn't affected) changed it language and names. After reboot I checked it and returned language back to Russian - not affected apps changed locale to proper...
 But problem is still persist on other universal apps like Alarms &amp; Clock, Calendar, Sway and Photos of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want say you more details: After system was restored all that apps has Russian names but English interface. It was not only Sway and Photos. This is full list: Alarms &amp; Clock, Calendar, Get Started, probably Groove Music, Mail, Maps, Money, Movies &amp; TV,
 News, Phone, Phone Companion, Photos, Sports, Sway, Voice Recorder, Weather. Other universal apps aren't affected. After some time even names of affected apps was changed to English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think something was broken during system restore (removing Anniversary Update). I know you may say I must install this update, but please give me a time. I want to test my system before it. But now I have new problem... This one. I think the best solution
 will full OS reinstall.</p>

            <p>I found a half-solution today. In the Minimal Safe Mode (under built-in Administrator) all ok with apps names. They aren't start of course. Ok. I think we may close this thread because I'll reinstall Windows. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            I want to donate a desktop pc to a charity.</h2>
                    I want to donate a desktop pc to a charity but don't want it registered to my any longer. Can I re-install Vista without activating it?&nbsp; A clean install following the instructions from the Windows support site should clean all traces of me from the system
 but I don't want to be identified with the pc any longer after it is given to someone else.&nbsp; Any ideas?<br />

            <p>Hello Mike-Not-Michael,</p>
<p>Have you just activated Windows (which you must in order to use it) or did you also register the software on the Microsoft website?</p>
<p>Registration is optional and, frankly, even I don't register my Windows operating system products.</p>
<p>If you 'registered' the product then only Microsoft knows who you are and where you live - no one else will find out your details from Microsoft.</p>
<p>When you activated your copy of Windows Microsoft simply took an inventary of the hardware on your PC, gave it a specific identity number and Windows simply checks for that number every time you boot up.</p>
<p>If you want to give the PC away to charity then format the hard drive and re-install Windows Vista. When it comes to the point of asking for a user name etc, simply type in Admin or Adminstrator&nbsp;- do not use your own name. When the charity start to use it
 all files will be named as 'administrator' rather than 'Mike'.</p>
<p>With you talking about re-installing Vista I am assuming that you have a Windows Vista DVD from which you can install the operating system? If you don't and you are your PC came pre-installed with Windows, then the chances are that there is a hidden image
 on your hard drive which allows you to restore back to factory conditions. If this is the case then simply follow the instructions in your PC user manual to restore back to factory conditions. After the restore has completed, boot up the machine and, whne
 asked for your computer name and other personal details simply typoe in Admin or Administrator - or Owner if you wish.</p>
<p>If Windows was pre-installed then it is also pre-activated, so you don't need to bother about that. If you are installing Windows yourself then I would suggest that you activate it too. You don't know how long it will be before the charity passes the machine
 on and, if it takes more than 30 days, the chances are that, without you activating it, the machine will not work properly. This will obvioulsy cause distress to whoever buys it from the charity or uses it.</p>
<p>For more details on formatting and installing see these links from my website:</p>

<h2>            Internet works via Ethernet Cable but only partially via Wifi</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is the following : when I plug in my ethernet cable, internet works perfectly on my pc, but when connecting via Wifi, only certain websites (facebook, youtube, google and some others) are usable, when I try to open some others like twitter I get
 the message "ERR_ADRESS_UNREACHEABLE".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have any idea why that could be ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>I read every sign and I don't remember one saying how to "quickly" use the flask. I had to keep going into the inventory menu to use it. I figured it out eventually, but stll. I should have read the manual, but I never do. When I trade my games in I like

<p>sometimes there are so many sigils that are in an area that say 'praise the sun' or 'need chest', people tire of even looking at em anymore. probably not be the case in this situation. Clearly, he/she doesn't have an instruction booklet, as they mentioned
 in their opening post. looks like the questioned was answered though, maybe the OP got it figured out now.

<h3> tfrtron21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer hangs when executing tasks</h2>
                    As the title says, I've recently been having issues where explorer will hang up for no reason, be it on its own or through another program when I'm trying to save/load a file. Creating folders, renaming folders, moving files/folders, or deleting files/folders
 will cause the operation window to remain open even after the operation has completed. Even emptying the trash causes this to occur now. When this happens inside another program, that program is completely locked up. I can't close it, bring it back into focus,
 or anything. I've nearly lost a number of projects thanks to this hangup as the only course of action that fixes the issue is to force quit the process from the task manager. It's getting to be quite the annoyance and I'm at a loss as to what to do or why
 it's happening.<br />
<br />
Also, sorry if this is in the wrong location, I wasn't sure where else to ask. Heh...
<br />
<br />
Not sure what all is needed, but these are two error reports that pertain to the issues as far as I can see...<br />

<p>A Clean Boot for Explorer</p>

<p>It might be caused by a shell extension.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Explorer (explorer.exe) is the program that is the Start menu and taskbar, folder windows, and the desktop (which is a folder window).</p>

Explorer is built on addin programs called Shell Extensions. The standard ones are supplied by Microsoft but programs add their own.</p>

            Sorry taking so long to reply. I've been laid up in the hospital for a long while and I'm only just able to get back on the computer with the problems, which it unfortunately still has.<br />
<br />
To cut to the chase: I can't actually do any of the things you suggested. The simple problem that shuts all of the suggestions down is the fact that the Shift+Control+Right-Click menu doesn't have the "Exit Explorer" option that it should. It only has "Open
 Command Window here". I'm not sure what to do now, so I'm at your mercy.<br />
<br />
And as for all of the suggestions you posted, not all of them are issues I'm running into. Explorer.exe runs fine, and it starts up perfectly fine. Each time I have to kill the process in the Task Manager, it boots right back up automatically. Occasionally
 it'll ask if I want to end the task now and give me the option to look for a solution, but like usual with my machine, it never finds one. Or if it does, it never tells me. Also apparently I've lost my "Problem Reports and Solutions" program... It refuses
 to start, but "Programs and Features" runs just fine. Dunno if that has anything to do with anything.<br />
<br />
And in reply to DaveWilson43: No, I haven't had any hardware changes, and I haven't had any software changes that would affect operations of the system. And explorer doesn't freeze or crash on me oddly enough. You'd think it would with the information I've
 given, but that's not the case. Everything continues to run perfectly fine, it's just that there's an operation window in the way that won't go away. It only happens when I move something, delete something, or try to rename something. Renaming something causes
 the window in question to freeze, but everything else still works fine. It's a really weird bug. &lt;_&gt;<br />

            <p>You do shift + ctrl + right click on the Start menu. There will NEVER be an Open Command Prompt Here option on that menu.&nbsp;And I mean the Start menu not the Start button. And note where on the Start menu you have to click, there is only a few pixels to click
 on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or just do the last step. I'm only being tidy shutting down explorer in an orderly fashion, just kill it in task manager.</p>

<p><strong>Close Explorer and Start a Command Prompt</strong></p>

<p>The purpose of this is to stop you using explorer while troubleshooting it in some steps aand to provide a&nbsp; quicker way than rebooting for other steps.</p>

<p>So you can just not use explorer while doing this and you can reboot instead of stopping and starting explorer.</p>

<p><span><strong><span>Hi sobit2011,</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>1. Does the sound come distorted even when you try playing music files present on the
 local computer through windows media player? <br />
2. Does the issue occur only with some websites like YouTube, etc.?<br />
3. Since when are you facing this issue?<br />
4. What is the model number of the network card on your computer?<br />
<br />
</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I would suggest you to change the hardware acceleration and check if this helps -<br />
a. </span></span></span><span><span><span>Close Expression Media if it is open.<br />
b. Click&nbsp; <strong>Start</strong> and then click&nbsp; <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
c. Click &nbsp;<strong>Appearance and Personalization</strong>, and then click &nbsp;<strong>Personalization</strong>.<br />
d. Under&nbsp; <strong>Personalize appearance and sounds</strong>, click&nbsp; <strong>Display Settings</strong>.
<br />
e. Click&nbsp; <strong>Advanced Settings</strong>, click the&nbsp; <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> tab, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Change Settings</strong>.
<br />
f. Move the&nbsp; <strong>Hardware acceleration</strong> slider to&nbsp; <strong>Medium</strong>, and then click &nbsp;<strong>OK</strong> three times.
<br />
g. Close&nbsp; <strong>Personalize appearance and sounds</strong>. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>By default the hardware acceleration will be high, so reduce the hardware acceleration to medium level and check.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span><br />
</span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span>Method 2:<br />
</span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span>I would also recommend updating the network card driver and check if this helps.</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span><br />
</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span>You may refer to the below mentioned link and use the steps provided accordingly to update the display driver using windows updates.
 You can also contact the manufacturer to get the latest drivers for the device. Check if this helps -<br />

<p>What happens when you try to get into the other user account? Can you get into the built-in Administrator account?
<span>In XP Home, boot the computer into Safe Mode. Do this by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting up. This will get you to the right menu. Navigate using your Up arrow key; the mouse will not work here. Once in Safe
 Mode, you will see the normally hidden Administrator account. The default password is a blank.<br />
<br />
In XP Pro, you do not need to go into Safe Mode. At the Welcome Screen, do Ctrl-Alt-Del twice to get the classic Windows logon box. Type in "Administrator" and whatever password you assigned when you set up Windows.</span></p>

    <title>Minecraft Story Mode will not download on 360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pe0014  say:</h3>
<h2>            Minecraft Story Mode will not download on 360</h2>
                    I purchased the season pass for all the episodes quite some time ago but never played the game. &nbsp;It has been said to download the episodes before the end of June. &nbsp;I keep getting an error message when trying to download episodes 2 through 8. &nbsp;Any suggestions
 on how to get the episodes downloaded or can I get a refund?

            Have you tried either starting the game and clicking on the ep. to try to get it to download. Or sign in on a computer and search you purchase history and make sure that the pass is purchased. Make sure that the pass is installed as well because that could
 also be your issue

<p>I redownloaded the season pass with no issue. &nbsp;Went into the game and tried to download the episodes but I get an error message for each one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i also went into my account to see when I purchased the season pass, but unfortunately my history does not seem to go back far enough.</p>

    <title>username, password, and domain field at login screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> little bill  say:</h3>
<h2>            username, password, and domain field at login screen</h2>
                    I am used to using Windows XP.&nbsp; In Windows XP there was a way to turn off fast switching and also require users to use control+alt+delete to login.<br />
<br />
I would like to have the domain field be accessible like it was in Windows XP so that you could click the domain field and choose something else.&nbsp; I do not like how the username is listed as domain\user name and then there is a field for password.<br />
<br />
Having three fields for username, password, and domain is much simpler.&nbsp; How can this be done?

&gt; So the only way to login is to specify /username in the user field <br />
&gt; as opposed to having a third field where you can select the domain?<br />
&gt; <br />
<br />
<br />
Only if you're trying to log into a domain other than the one to which <br />
the computer belongs.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; I do feel it is much easier to have the domain name show because you can click <br />
&gt; the pulldown menu and easily select whether you want to login to the machine or
<br />
&gt; domain.<br />
&gt; <br />
in either the domain <br />
&gt; name or machine name in front of the username. That is more work and also when <br />
&gt; you do this on several machines you have to know what the exact machine name is
<br />
&gt; instead of it being conveniently stored for you in the pulldown menu.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've been doing that for months on all of the Vista machines at work, <br />
and don't really see how it's that onerous a task. Sure, for most of <br />
our less-than-computer-literate users, the drops down lists are helpful, <br />
but our trained IT folks don't seem to have much trouble. Knowing the <br />
"exact machine name" isn't a problem because the we use a consistent <br />
naming convention, computers are labeled, and out inventory database <br />
links serial numbers to computer names.<br />

            <p>One problem you will find--a windows install disk is usually required to complete the reinstall especially if windows 8.1 did not come on the computer when new. If you upgraded from windows 8, the disk with the win 8.1 installation can be used. If your computer
 came with windows 7, reinstall that if you have the dvd for it. The original operating system belongs to the computer. Check with the computer's support site to see what you need to access the Recovery Partition before doing anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are just recycling the computer by taking it to Goodwill, wipe the hard drive by formatting, using a utility&nbsp;or removing the drive. Hard drives can be reused in other computers or in enclosures.</p>

<p>Quieres descargar o asociar tu gamertag? ya que si te dice eso "ESTA CUENTA DE MICROSOFT ESTA ASOCIADA A UN PERFIL XBOX LIVE DISTINTO. INTENTELO CON OTRA CUENTA" eso sol lo dice cuando creas una cuenta nueva y la quieres asosciar a ese live id.</p>
<p>Ve a donde estan los perfiles en tu consolo y elige la ultima pestaña, donde dice Descargar Pefil, mete tus datos, correo y contraseña de hotmail y te descargar tu perfil.</p>
<p>El otro posible error es que alguien este usando tu cuenta en el momento que tu lo quieres descargar</p>

    <title>Can not buy Backward Compatible Games on the Marketplace or Can not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> omega chefe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can not buy Backward Compatible Games on the Marketplace or Can not get Backward Compatible Game with Gold - Solution</h2>
                    <div>Hello guys, Omega here.<br />
<br />
These days I had a problem with Marketplace getting games with gold or even buying Backward Compatible games, and I would like to share a resolution that I have found along with Microsoft's support department.<br />
<br />
<strong>The problem:</strong><br />
<br />
I was trying to get the Far Cry 2 for my Xbox with the Xbox Live Gold, but each time I clicked on the game the Xbox forwarded me for a new page asking to me to include a new payment method, but already I had two payment methods available and also subscription
 for the Gamepass, EA Access and Xbox Live Gold with these payment options.<br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>More weird in this history was, each time I tried to including a new payment method the Website itself was showing to me my old address from Brazil. I moved to Canada three years ago, and I am a permanent resident in Canada, so all my credit cards or payment
 options are from Canada. I have no more any payment method from Brazil. Also, my billing address and shipping address on my Microsoft Account are Canadian and updated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This situation made me unable to get my game or even buy games on the <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://marketplace.xbox.com/</a>.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Solution:</strong><br />
<br />
</div>
<div>After several attempts to understand what was happening with my account.&nbsp; The Microsoft Support's attendant informed me that I should migrate my region to Canada. Even though my address was properly set on my account as Canadian, the region within the
 Marketplace should be migrated to Canada. Through this link <a href="https://account.xbox.com/accountmigration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.xbox.com/accountmigration</a>, I relocated my region from Brazil-BR to Canada-CA.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If you move from your country or are in transit in another country, you can change your account to that region every three months. Only every three months.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The following link will help you migrate your account and resolve region incompatibility issues, making it possible to purchase games Backward Compatible on the Marketplace.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><a href="https://account.xbox.com/accountmigration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.xbox.com/accountmigration</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>NOTE: </strong>Be careful because you can move only your region every three months.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I hope this help you folks.<br />
</div>

<p>Hello Baltyofgod, Omega here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is not the case. Please, reread the post. I have tried did that, but I was unable, the Microsoft's support explain to me that even if I have correctly changed my address, region, and payment method within my Microsoft account, it is necessary to migrate
 the region through this link to avoid incompatibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I informed them that I was an ambassador and had already tried everything from my side.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>They provided me with this solution and encouraged me to share with you here in the forum.</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing your solution in details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have realised you had to have your account migrated at&nbsp;<a href="https://account.xbox.com/accountmigration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.xbox.com/accountmigration</a>. Xbox 360 games are not region free. And even if a game is free with gold it requires a valid
 payment option in your region as per your account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A code wouldnt matter the issue is you are trying to get content not.mrant for you</p>
<p>A code would.still.look gor.your account region vs your actual region</p>
<p>And yes they are region locked</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox 360 games.were never region free only some were</p>
<p>From.day 1</p>
<p>Even in the terms of use it states you must use your actual location for.the best experience with live</p>

            Thanks for the attencion . I think i will stay with my region config. . Saddly situation cuz i would love to have that classic in my library. I travell between Germany and Portugal every 2 months. As i never had this issue before ( only with FCry 2) .
 Migrating my account could give me more problems in future. Microsoft should be more carefull when choosing&nbsp; games for gold. The result is unhappy players with the service but the support here in forum is amazing. Thanks to all that try to help me and others
 w/same issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;Big Hug to all.

            <p>Hello Wael,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>We&nbsp;realize the inconvenience you are experiencing with deleting file from virtual desktop in Windows 10.&nbsp;We will certainly help you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>We have tried to reproduce the issue from our end and we are able to delete files successfully from 2nd desktop screen (virtual desktop). This possible cannot be a bug.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span>Have you checked if the issue occurs while trying to delete a particular files or with different files?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Have you installed all pending Windows updates?</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This might be due to corrupted files or virus present on your system. Let's try the below steps and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> </span></span><span><strong>Run Microsoft Safety Scanner.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Microsoft Safety Scanner</span></strong><span> removes virus or malware which is present in your system and might be causing harm to your system.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Data or files which are infected by malware might be beyond cleaning and have to be deleted entirely to maintain the integrity of your system, which means there might be a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Step 2: </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Use the DISM tool and System File Checker for repairing any missing or corrupted system files:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I have set up myself on each device as the local admin, with the same username and password. With some work after the Windows 10 upgrades, I get the mapped drives to work, except for PC 2 desktop (win 10 home)&nbsp;that failed to map the drives on PC&nbsp;1 desktop&nbsp;(win
 10 pro), and also the odd fact that PC&nbsp;3 (win 10 laptop) never showed up in the network when using the browse button during the mapping process, even though I still can map to it from the other devices by typing the network location directly!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error I got from PC 2 desktop when I tried to map drives on PC 1 (win 10 pro) was that&nbsp;I did not have permission. The odd thing is I can still do a remote desktop connection from PC 2 to PC 1 with complete access rights!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short:</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC 1 can map drives on PC 2, &nbsp;PC 3 and PC 4&nbsp; -- good</p>
<p>PC 2&nbsp;can map drives on PC&nbsp;3, PC 4, but not PC 1&nbsp; -- not good</p>
<p>PC 3 can map drives on PC 1, PC 2, PC 4&nbsp; -- good</p>
<p>PC 5 (Surface 2) can map drives on PC 1, PC 2, PC 3, PC 4&nbsp; -- good</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC 2, PC 3, PC4 can remote desktop to PC 1 -- good</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what is wrong with PC 2? Any suggestion I can fix it?</p>

            <p>Hi Martin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) How is your PC connected? Is it Homegroup/workgroup?</p>
<p>2) What is the exact error you get when you try to share files with PC2?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the below steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>1) Go to each computer in the homegroup and delete the following directory</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;C:\windows\serviceprofiles\localservice\appdata\roaming\peernetworking<br />
&nbsp;(This directory is protected, so you will have to confirm when you try to access it)<br />
&nbsp;Shut the computer down and leave it off</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>2) On a Windows 10&nbsp;desktop</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;connect it to your network.<br />
Setup a new Homegroup on your network<br />
Write down your password (At this point, you will need to put that password in a safe place)<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>3) Go to each computer and add them to the new Homegroup.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>4) Test and make sure you can get to your devices and directories</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>If you cant from one computer, leave the Homegroup and re-add the computer and try to share the files.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Please reply to us with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you, Anil, &nbsp;for the suggestion. I'll try that out someday if have more time. Meanwhile I do have access to the files I need with the options I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's just that the Windows 10&nbsp;file sharing is not as easy and obvious as Windows 7, complicated by the fact that now you have the local account and the Microsoft account. I know that if I need to login with the Microsoft account, as some apps need that,
 &nbsp;my file shares will break, after the restart. The popup screen that pops up for authentication when I click on the share would not take my local account password nor my Microsoft account password as valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that it could end up this way either through end-user's misunderstanding or the fault of the less-than-clear method of configuration is a weakness. I am an experienced user and have used up&nbsp;too much time to get it to work, mostly,&nbsp;and I would dare
 to say it would not end well with your regular home users who just want it to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't take me wrong. There are many things to like in Windows 10, and I would not want&nbsp;to&nbsp;go back to any earlier versions of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for you time and have a great day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Martin</p>
