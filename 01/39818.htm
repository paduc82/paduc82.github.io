    <title>Windows 10 Two-Account Login - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erniemacaulay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Two-Account Login</h2>
                    <p>I just installed Windows 10 and on the first boot-up there was a standard picture covering the whole screen, a current time in digital format on the lower left and a square symbol on the lower right.&nbsp; When I clicked on the symbol, I was given the choice
 of signing in in either my account or my wife's account [just as I had done with Windows 7 Home Premium].&nbsp; In subsequent boot-ups, I just have a message welcoming me with no availability of a sign-in for my wife.&nbsp; I checked the settings and my wife is listed
 in the "Family" area as an account holder with administrator privileges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been logging off by clicking the 'Start' icon and selecting "Power" and "shut down".&nbsp; Unfortunately Windows 10 has taken the regressive step of removing the "Switch User" functionality which necessitates a restart or reboot to change users.&nbsp; I am
 now in the position that my wife cannot access her e-mail or any of her files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who has a solution for this?&nbsp; Thanks .... Ernie</p>

            <p>Thanks for the prompt reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I am unfamiliar with Windows 10 and I am unable to determine whether my wife's account appears under C:/Windows/users.&nbsp; Formerly, there was a search option at the bottom of the screen in Windows 7 where I could search for files on my computer
 but the Windows 10 equivalent only searches the Web and Windows.&nbsp; As I indicated, the other account shows in the User Account area.&nbsp; I encountered the 'flashing screen' issue during installation [apparently because I had not uninstalled my Norton anti-virus
 protection] and had to call technical support.&nbsp; When the technician booted the computer in safe mode, we first saw a full screen photograph with a current time on the lower left in large font and a square symbol in the lower right.&nbsp; When we clicked on the
 symbol we had a screen with both accounts on the lower left with an invitation to sign in on either account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your instructions, however, there was no "Manage Accounts" command under "User Accounts".&nbsp; The closest command was "Change Account Type" then the "Add New User" routine.&nbsp; I had previously explored this area by simply selecting "Settings", "Accounts",
 "Family &amp; other users", then the "Add some one else to this PC" but was unable to do this without creating a Microsoft account.&nbsp; I experimented by putting my wife's e-mail address in the requested area but received a reply "Looks like this isn't a Microsoft
 account.&nbsp; Try another email or sign up for a new one."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want to create any domestic disharmony by requiring my wife to have to use an e-mail address, or any other credentials, to access our computer.&nbsp; I want the availability of equal access to the device by both of us.&nbsp; The failure to include the useful
 'switch user' feature from Windows 10 is a very regressive and, in my opinion, an unnecessary change.&nbsp; I can live with the inconvenience of having to shut down to change to another user but both users
<strong>must </strong>have equal access to the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get to an 'equal access' sign-in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks .... Ernie</p>

            <p>To update my previous message, I have been able to locate the User file and, yes, both my wife and I are on the C drive as Users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I was logging off, an update began to install and, strangely, my screen showed two closed&nbsp;boxes of dialogue where the technical support person had taken control of my device (with my consent) during repair under Case ID No. 1299644650.&nbsp; For some
 unknown reason, the first session terminated unexpectedly and she opened a second session.&nbsp; I was able to easily&nbsp;'X' them off the screen.&nbsp; I was unable to view either the current or historic footage of my security cameras so I left the computer to reboot that
 system [which didn't help either and I am currently unable to access my security system because of the installation of Windows 10] and, when I returned, my screen had reverted to the dual sign-on screen without human intervention.&nbsp; My wife used her account
 and I restarted it hoping to have access to my account but now it consistently opens my wife's account and I have no direct access to my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I experimented with toggling on and off every startup-related setting with no change.&nbsp; I also did another F9 diagnosis of my hardware with everything passing.&nbsp; I tried an F11 Microsoft Startup Repair Tool with no success.&nbsp; I used an F10 boot-up and an F5
 restore system defaults and, again, no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I note that when I use "Restart" there is a quick flash of the picture with the large date and time before it opens the screen welcoming my wife.&nbsp; As well, I note that the familiar boot-up sound only occurs when "Restart" is used and not when the device
 is&nbsp;"Shut down" and restarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks .... Ernie</p>

            <p>A further update - I called Microsoft Technical Support last Saturday evening on the issue of the flashing desktop&nbsp;and was surprised to be connected to a support technician in 22 minutes.&nbsp; Unfortunately, she deemed it to be an issue for a Level 2 technician
 and told me to remain on 'hold' and a technician would be available in a few minutes.&nbsp; I waited over three hours (listening to some background music and two commercials that included the false information that a technician would be with me "shortly" at an
 average of 45-second intervals) but no one ever picked up the line.&nbsp; I called Microsoft Technical Support again on Sunday and, after a 34-minute wait, I was connected to a technician in the Philippeans.&nbsp; She was very pleasant and competent and resolved the
 flashing screen issue in about two hours.&nbsp; I told her about my misapprehensions about the dual login feature as when I booted up I only received my welcome screen with no option to sign in the other account holder but, at the end of the session, it seemed
 to be functioning normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Microsoft Technical Support again at 9:55 PM on Monday and, after a 59-minute wait, I was connected to a technical support technician who seemed to have only average technical competence and virtually no specific knowledge of Windows 10.&nbsp; Obviously,
 English was an acquired language as her diction was difficult to decipher but she readily understood my side of the dialogue.&nbsp; I gave her access to my computer on two occasions and she tried to fix the login problem with frequent versions where I was on hold
 for either reference to manuals or assistance from a more knowledgeable technician.&nbsp; At 12:32 AM today she put me on hold for&nbsp;"a few minutes" but never returned.&nbsp; The chat session remained open and, at 12:51 AM, someone posted "B.. has stopped servicing requests;
 please wait".&nbsp; I waited but the only sound that I heard was at 1:32 AM the phone made what seemed like a few 'busy' sounds.&nbsp; I shut down the computer at 2:15 AM and it was still showing an hour glass and "Waiting for a technician".&nbsp; I logged on at 7:42 AM
 and the chat box was still there with a message that "A support representative will be with you shortly"&nbsp; Of course, that never happened.</p>

            <p><strong>LAST INSTALMENT:&nbsp; </strong>I called Microsoft Technical Support again this morning&nbsp;and, after a 14- minute wait, technician O.. came onto the line.&nbsp; I described my issue and the history and, after about 8 minutes, he concluded that it was a Level
 2 issue and offered to refer me to a Level 2 technician.&nbsp; I asked if it was possible for him to refer me directly to a Level 2 technician so he explained that it was a global process and the Level 2 technician could be from another site.&nbsp; He asked me to remain
 on hold for a couple of minutes while he checked about the status of the Level 2 queue.&nbsp; O.. never did return to the line but, six minutes later, the background changed to different music and commercials.&nbsp; Seventeen minutes later, J.. came on the line.&nbsp; He
 stated I was still at Level 1 but offered to attempt a remedy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>J.. was easy to communicate with and very pleasant and obviously skilled.&nbsp; He accepted my suggestion to immediately assume control of my computer and visualize the problem.&nbsp; He delved deeply into the Registry Editor, made some changes in Advanced Client
 Software and ran a scan of the system.&nbsp; The scan results showed no errors in the software although the login function was obviously not functioning correctly.&nbsp; J.. stated that this is the first such case he is aware of and thinks it is likely due to attempting
 the installation without first uninstalling Norton anti-virus software.&nbsp; Despite the earlier technician stating that Windows 10 has no 'switch user' capability, J.. showed me three methods to accomplish a switch user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>J.. stated that all the settings are correct and the only way to remedy the problem is to revert to Windows 7 and reinstall Windows 10 with the Norton software removed.&nbsp; I still have complete functionality by using one of the means to switch users if I choose
 not to revert and re-install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>J.. stated that it is only Norton software that has been causing this problem.</p>

            <p>I received an e-mail&nbsp;message today with a request to conclude this thread by either answering No that my question had not been answered or yes that it had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question was not answered i8n this thread - there was one reply from a Microsoft Support Engineer with a suggestion that I had already explored.&nbsp; I did get a solution by telephoning Microsoft support but it was not a permanent solution.&nbsp; Yesterday, I
 was unable to access Edge from my account but I could access Edge on my wife's account.&nbsp; I did a chat session with Technical Support and she concluded that my account was corrupt.&nbsp; She installed a 'TestAdmin' account and I can access Edge from that account.&nbsp;
 I can also access my e-mail accounts from the new account but not my contacts (including a distribution list of over 100 names),&nbsp;and the stored information on my calendar and tasks.&nbsp; This is a very awkward and unsatisfactory outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also checked the Windows 10 information on the Microsoft Web site today and did not locate any warning to uninstall Norton Anti-virus software prior to installing Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please consider this matter concluded without the question being answered.</p>

<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the

<br />
If not, then run the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/26512-dism-fixing-component-store-corruption-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />

<br />
If still not, then you could do a <strong><a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2293-refresh-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">refresh</span></a></strong> of Windows 8, or run a

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.
<br />
<br />
If still not, then you can use the steps in the TIP box in the <strong>OPTION THREE</strong> section&nbsp;to manually replace the files that SFC could not fix.

</p>
<div>
<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command 3 times restarting the PC after each time to completely fix everything that it's able to.
<br />
<br />
If not, then run the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/26512-dism-fixing-component-store-corruption-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command again.<br />
<br />
If still not, then try using <strong>OPTION ONE</strong> above to run the <strong>
sfc /scannow</strong> command at boot<br />
<br />
If still not, then you could do a <strong><a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2293-refresh-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">refresh</span></a></strong> of Windows 8, or run a

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.
<br />
<br />
If still not, then you can use the steps in the TIP box in the <strong>OPTION THREE</strong> section&nbsp;to manually replace the files that SFC could not fix.

<p>I don't have a proxy server, my IE and network settings are right. I use "Clear" as my ISP, they think it is a problem with Windows Meda Center. At home where I use Clear, I click on Internet TV I get a blue screen then a box in the lower right corner&nbsp;with

<p>I was facing the same problem. Got my new laptop with windows 7, very happy with the feature windows media center. Suddenly after clicking on live TV setup and I don't have any tuner connected&nbsp;windows media center messed up. After that whenever I tried WMS
 it always give message "No Content found". Tried uninstall, reinstall, changing the country setup to USA again,&nbsp;didn't work. I was still able to search through, guide is also working just not Internet TV.</p>
<p>After few days finally found a solution, open following link in browser IE, click on the box which was telling me that You have windows media center&nbsp;and it fix the issue.</p>

            <p>Hi Yang,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the Windows update troubleshooter from this link or manually follow the instructions given in this link to try to fix the Windows update issue first.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058/en-us</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the troubleshooter as well as the steps do not help, try to run the DISM commands and then try check if you are able to install the Windows update. (Install only 3 to 5 updates at once instead of installing all the updates altogether)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Type Command prompt in the Search Charms, right click on it and select Run as Administrator.</p>
<p>2. Type the following commands. Press <span>Enter </span>after each command.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</strong></p>
<p><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></p>
<p><br />
3. Close the command prompt, and then run <strong>Windows Update</strong> again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the Windows updates are installed Successfully, restart the computer and check if Windows 8.1 update is available.&nbsp; Make sure the update KB 2871389&nbsp; is installed successfully on the computer. Please refer to
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2871389/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2871389/en-us</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the update is still not shown in the Store, you may have a look at the information provided in
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/why-can-t-find-update-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/why-can-t-find-update-store</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try the steps as mentioned in the help articles and let us know the results.</p>

<h2>            Windows Hello Fingerprint not registering issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I'm running on&nbsp;<span>windows 10 Home on my laptop Lenovo T460s.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to use Fingerprint Login. However, in these days, there was something wrong with my laptop and I couldn't use Fingerprint anymore.</p>
<p>After that, I've tried to reset but I can't so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I want to register fingerprint but I can't when the system<span>&nbsp;</span>already has PIN.</p>
<p>After that, I remove the PIN and try to set up fingerprint but I can't register again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following video explains what happens when I try to set up.</p>

<p>Hi All.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just would like to share with you that my issue is fixed by Windows 10 April Update. I can register&nbsp;Windows Hello fingerprint now.</p>
<p>I guess there is something wrong between the device and OS. Anyway, It's maybe all right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I<span>&nbsp;contacted the manufacturer of my device but they said it was not covered&nbsp;</span>by the warranty which I had now.</p>
<p>I almost gave up at that time. However, after&nbsp;Windows 10 April Update comes, Windows Hello fingerprint works now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following is my device's specifications</p>
<p>-Edition: Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>-Version: 1803</p>
<p>-OS build: 17134.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your time.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to report the same issue. I'll add some further details:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the triggers LT and RT are not working properly for some games.</p>
<p>This seems to be some kind of software issue as this happens only on my Windows 10 machine and on some games. For example, the triggers work perfectly fine when playing Rocket League, or when using them on my Xbox One. But when playing on Hitman 2 (on Steam)
 or GTA V (not on Steam but still on PC) they do not work properly.</p>
<p>I noticed, that there is at least some kind of response: In GTA V when sitting in a vehicle LT will brake and RT would accelerate. When I try, nothing happens. But when I pull both triggers simultaneously, the braking lights of the vehicle light up (but
 still no acceleration).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My controller is connected via USB cable. I have tried different USB ports, without success.</p>
<p>I tried this with two different Xbox One controllers, but I have the same issue with both of them.</p>
<p>I have tried to update the controller, via Xbox One, and via device manager, both tell me that there is no update available.</p>
<p>I have tried to calibrate my controller, and to reset the controller to default calibration (both several times) without success, although the calibration recognized the triggers as z-axis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume this issue was introduced with one of the latest Windows 10 updates. I played Hitman 2 on 13th and 14th of November, and the triggers worked fine. In the night from 14th to 15th November, a Windows update was installed (KB4467702 and KB4467694).
 On Thursday, the 15th of November, the triggers stopped working in Hitman 2.</p>
<p>I have tried to uninstall these updates, but that didn't work either (although I'm not sure if I have restarted after uninstalling)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what can I do to fix this issue? I appreciate any help =)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Dominik</p>

<p>Hello Dominik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that on your Windows 10 PC, the Xbox One controller in use does not register the left and right triggers. We also understand that this occurs with multiple controllers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this only occur with Hitman 2 and GTA V?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, it is suggested to <strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/how-to-uninstall-reinstall-game-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uninstall</a></strong> both titles, restart the PC, and then install both titles once
 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this for us and let us know if this works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

<p>Hello Javier,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried reinstalling the games. Unfortunately, that didn't help. The games still don't respond to the LT and RT triggers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried a few other games and I can confirm that this issue occurs for Hitman 1, Tabletop Simulator and Payday 2 as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else can I try to fix it?</p>

<p>Hi there Dominik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out. I'm sorry to hear about the issue with game response on windows 10. If you are using the Xbox App, corrupted date may cause the app to not work properly.

<p>Hello Crystal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not using the Xbox App, so I don't think that's the problem. I still tried performing a clean boot and reinstalling the Xbox App, but neither did solve my issues. I purchased Just Cause 3 lately, and tried it there as well, and there I have the exact
 same problem. It doesn't recognize the triggers LT and RT on my Xbox One controller, while it works perfectly fine with my PS4 controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else that I could try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Dominik</p>

<p>I am having the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I find the device in Windows and look up its properties, I can tell there's no response to the LT and RT buttons in the pre-calibration screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get an indication in the graphics for right and left stick, and there is a list of numbered lights that correspond to the buttons. Every button seems to light something up except for RT and LT.</p>

 also the Windows 10 calendar.&nbsp; How do you sync the two calendars so that the entries in the Windows Live Mail calendar can be transferred to the Windows 10 calendar</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incorrect time settings may be the possible reason why your Photo app shows wrong dates. To better assist you, we'd like to gather more information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any recent changes prior to this issue?</li><li>Have you tried checking the system time whether it's set correctly?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Any response will be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you have not understood the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to explain again. The date &amp; time on my current pictures is shown correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only few old pictures are showing year as "2078" so I wish to correct it as 2010.
</p>
<p>This is causing problem as this being a future date, these old pictures keep showing at the top whenever I open the "Photos" app of Windows 10..</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you get it right, pl tell me how to correct it ??</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            This has been ongoing since buying this computer.&nbsp; It is NOT an issue with any recent changes, nor is the date/time on my computer (or ANY other programs on it) wrong.&nbsp; This is strictly an issue with windows 10!&nbsp; I am SURE they have been aware of it for
 YEARS but choose to ignore this issue, like they do so many others!&nbsp; It makes it very difficult to search for photos when some show a folder date of 2050, some January 4501 etc.&nbsp; I am so disgusted with Microsoft!<br />

            This only helps on a photo by photo basis.&nbsp; ALL the photos taken at my son's wedding are in a folder showing both the wrong month and year 2050!&nbsp; When I right click on the folder name (the date) in 'photos', it only gives me the option to 'refresh' not
 to change the folder date or name.<br />

Wow, I just don't get how you can so badly misunderstand!&nbsp; I am talking 1600 photos here, all in a folder that show a year in the future.&nbsp; I am NOT going to go in and change EACH PHOTO INDIVIDUALLY.&nbsp; I want to change the date of the ENTIRE FOLDER!&nbsp; AND I want
 to know when Microsoft is going to address this issue.&nbsp; I am not the only one with this problem but ALL the solutions act like it's something that can be addressed on a photo by photo basis instead of it being a gross software issue with Microsoft Photos in
 general!&nbsp; So disgusted with the REPEATED suggestions of correcting it photo by photo!<br />

<h2>            Media player freezing after 30 mins on Xbox one x</h2>
                    <p>I use media player quite a bit and after I got the Xbox one x it keeps freezing after 30 mins of use. It will freeze and back out of the app. This can get frustrating. Any suggestions would help!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Have been noticing the same issue immediately after the November 16th update, at first I thought maybe it was a hard drive or USB hub issue, replaced my powered hub with a new one, called tech support and they had me hard reset the console and all apps, reinstalled media player, same problem. It actually happens after closer to 25-26 minutes into any video though most say it's about 20-30 minutes, and will typically make a sound as if a button on the controller was pressed, totally freeze, and kick back to the home screen.</p><p><br /></p><p>ONE TIME this happened it displayed an error message, the message just said "again." As the message above the error codes, and the error codes were&nbsp;0xc00d11c6 and&nbsp;0x8007000e</p><p><br /></p><p>I'm surprised so few people have mentioned this as an issue, as the Xbox One was initially marketed as being a media center, if it can't even play a single movie file then it kind of fails at one of its primary functions!</p><p><br /></p><p>I understand the

            <p>Update: My friend who has an Xbox One S confirms that he has the same exact problem that I do, but it only applies to .m4v video files. Apparently .mkv files play fine and do not experience any problems even for over an hour, but .m4v files will CONSISTENTLY crash after about 25 minutes.</p>

            <p>I have this problem too.&nbsp; I can confirm it happens when streaming via a NAS drive also so it's not USB driver related.&nbsp; It's a function we use daily (playing films for the kids) so I know it times in with the update on the 16th.&nbsp; The other Microsoft&nbsp;player (I think it's called Film and TV)&nbsp; works OK without the problem if it helps.&nbsp; I also only use MP4's so that would tie in with what @NeutronOverload said...</p>

            <p>Having the same problem with media player on my Xbox One S 
playing .mp4 files off of a 2TB drive, exactly as described by 
"NeutronOverload".</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I switched 
over to ACG player for now which is only ok-ish. The ads are slightly 
annoying, popping up only once during binge play,  but playback is better than VLC, (the contrast issue)</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I hope an update fixes this issue with media player soon.

            <p>This issue appears to have been fixed, possibly with the December 10th system update, as I have just now successfully finished playing a video for over an hour with no more of this issue, which was apparently an "out of memory" issue (based on the one and only time I&nbsp;ever got an error message from it, which translated&nbsp;to "out of memory" according to an error message search)</p><p><br /></p><p>I am going to try a few other video files, and see if any changes I've recently done have anything to do with it (such as that I&nbsp;turned off game dvr earlier today), but it seems like this issue may be fixed!</p>

<p>Depuis deux jours, ma console est devenue très lente et je ne sais pour quelle raison !</p>
<p>Elle est lente au démarrage et surtout à se connecter au LIVE.</p>
<p>Quand elle fini par se connecter au LIVE (après un message d'erreur) ce sont les jeux qui bug !</p>

<p>J'explique :&nbsp;</p>
<p>Par exemple quand je lance Black Ops 1, le jeu reste longtemps figé sur un écran noir puis affiche directement le menu du contenu en ligne, il ne passe pas par la cinématique, "appuyez sur Start", et le menu principal du jeu (avec la télé). Il va directement
 au menu Multijoueur (même si cela m'arrange, ça m'inquiete).</p>
<p>De plus, avec Black Ops 1 toujours, il ne trouve pas de salon et un message d'erreur me dit que Black Ops n'est pas disponible actuellement.</p>

<p>Pour donner d'autres exemples, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 (que j'ai acheté sur le LIVE, donc pas de CD) est bien plus long à lancer qu'il y a trois jours ! Il fallait 2 secondes pour lancer un jeu dans les épingles et bien aujourd'*** il faut bien 30
 seconde pour que la console arrive à envoyer le jeu.</p>
<p>Pour ce qui est du contenu en ligne, les menus sont lents, le joystick reste figé sur un onglet, et surtout il ne me trouve toujours pas de salon ! ,</p>

<p>Bref ça fait péter les plombs !</p>

<p>J'ai pensé a un problème de réseau, j'ai donc reboot ma bbox, reconfiguré le réseau sans fil. Toujours rien.</p>
<p>J'ai branché un cable Ethernet et miracle Black Ops s'est lancé avec la démo et le menu principal, par contre les menus du LIVE sont toujours aussi long mais il trouve enfin une partie.</p>
<p>Donc je me demande si les baisses de performance de ma console viendrait de ma connexion Wi-Fi ou d'un problème de carte réseau.</p>

<p>Quelqu'un à une idée ?</p>

                    I had genuine inbuilt Windows 8 in my PC. Committed a mistake by changing it into an in-genuine Windows 8.1. Now I can't upgrade to Windows 10. Also lost my key. Can I recover my Genuine Windows key? How can I upgrade to genuine Windows 10?

<h3> vicious chicken  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Error Code 80151103</h2>
                    
<p>For the last two days I have been trying to sign into my Xbox Live account. When I attempt to sign in I'm being asked to do so with my E-mail and password. So I enter my correct e-mail and my correct password and the system attempts to connect to XBL. Just
 when I think it is about to connect I suddenly get this stupid code 80151103 and it tells me to try again later! Upon checking the error code it seems to be related to my password. So I reset my password and made sure it was correct and am even able to sign
 into my xbox.com account here because obviously I'm posting this post on the forums! But when I try to sign into XBL on my xbox console it is not allowing me to do so. WTH!!!!! I've tried looking for a phone number to directly contact Microsoft or xbox support
 and I can't seem to locate any phone numbers. Microsft is on my sh%#t list right now. I'm paying for a Gold Live account that I can't even get into right now. Really annoyed that Microsoft is quick to take my money but impossible to get some simple freakin
 support to fix my access problem.</p>

Is E drive an external drive? If yes, do you have that drive connected while booting?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Small storage devices, like devices with 32GB hard drives or older devices with full hard drives, need additional storage to complete the upgrade. If you did not have free space on your SSD while upgrade Windows might have saved additional file to a separate
 location possibly E: drive as you have mentioned. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Before trying any troubleshooting steps I would suggest you to disconnect all external devices if any (Printer, scanner, camera, or any other USB devices) except mouse
 and keyboard and try to restart your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are able to boot the computer to the desktop successfully after disconnecting all external devices, identify the faulty device by connecting them one by one.
 If the problem persists let’s try these methods below and check if that helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Windows&nbsp;10 have pre-activated recovery feature called “<strong>Startup repair</strong>” which automatically launches when it detects boot failure. However, in
 some circumstances where there are major system files corruptions it fails to initiate automatically. We can initiate these recovery options through Windows&nbsp;10 re-installation media.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you do not have a Windows&nbsp;10 reinstallation media you can create one.

<p><strong>Ok, So I've recently been having a lot of problems with my computer. A few weeks ago I would constantly get the Page_Fault_in_Non_Paged_Area blue screen after the windows logo at start up. This continued for about 3 weeks without me being able to
 get my computer to fully boot up. I popped in my XP OS cd and it started right up no problem. I didn't boot from disk or reinstall or anything but it worked so I didn't question it. In the past few days I've started getting the FakenIt spyware virus so I downloaded
 and used Windows Defender. I ran a full system scan last night and it said it located and removed or quarantined the viruses. So I thought "Great, it fixed my comp. I'll give it a quick restart and things will be all peachy." Unfortunately that is not the
 case. Upon restart my computer now goes to the blue screen of death every time after windows logo this time its not the page fault error message, it doesn't display an error except:</strong></p>
<p><strong>***STOP:&nbsp;0X0000007B (OXBA4E3524, OXCOOOOO34, OXOOOOOO, OXOOOOOO)</strong></p>
<p><strong>I can't boot from my OS cd, I can't use safe mode, I can't use last known good configuration...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Any ideas on what I should do?</strong></p>

            That error code is an "Inaccessible Boot Device" - ie Windows cannot load data from the system or boot partition.<br />
<br />
You say that you cannot boot from your OS CD - what do you do to try &amp; boot from the CD - do you press a particular "F" key, or do you go into the BIOS and configure the pc to boot from the CD drive?<br />
