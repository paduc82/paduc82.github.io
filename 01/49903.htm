 touch somethin to get picture back on your screen. And have to repeat this operation every 20 minutes!?!?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannon configure or do anything with screen saver settings as drop down menu is grayed out.</p>

            <p>Hi Deyett,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 7, the Local Group Policy Editor will only be available in the Professional, Ultimate, and Enterpise editions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any of the above Windows edition, then, you can try opening the Group Policy Editor by following these steps:</p>
<p>a. Click <strong>Start</strong> button , type <strong>gpedit.msc</strong> in the
<strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong> .</p>
<p>Then, you can follow the remaining steps:</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the left pane, click on to expand
<strong>User Configuration</strong>, <strong>Administrative Templates</strong>, <strong>
Control Panel</strong>, and<strong> Personalization</strong>. </span></p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Near the end of the year i will be moving to the UK. I signed up for an account 3 years ago in the US with a US account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anything i need to do to make sure my profile is not locked because its being accessed in the UK.And will i have access to the games and maps i have brought on xbox market place?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also are US games playable on UK xboxes and TV's? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for all your help</p>

<p>I think that if your DLC is downloaded to your xbox prior to your move, you shouldn't have much of a problem using the content so long as you don't delete it from your console, but if you do delete it, you will not be able to download it again until you
 are logging in from the US. </p>

<p>Some US games will work on an UK Xbox, it depends on if they are region free or not. For example I imported the Ghostbusters game from the USA and it works fine on my console.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that PAL and NTSC are display technologies and are a separate issue to region locking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a useful link to show which games can be played on a console from another region

                    <p>My friend can't play halo 3 ranked matches even though we share gold. We are allowed to play every other games, even backwards compatable titles! I don't know if this is an xbox problem or something in-game but hopefully it can be cleared up so we can play ranked matches together on halo 3! &nbsp;Hopefully microsoft will be informed about this problem.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> johnnymunoz22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blu ray Error&#34; Device error code 3</h2>
                    <p>I was try to burn blu ray discs using Encore CC and I have the message of error, the complete message is the next:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Blu ray Error: "device error", Code "3"</p>
<p>Note: CreateStcSequence: Fail to write M2S file&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I try to find the answer with the hardware manufacturer LG and the answer was these problem is not cause for the hardware the problem if from Microsoft, &nbsp;I contact Microsoft to ask the solution and they send me a couple options to resolve the problems
 and nothing did work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I using LG WH16NS40 M Disc BD Rewrite burner</p>
<p>
</p><p>My videos are a total of 10 GB and the Blu ray disc are 25 GB, my project is to burn 40 DVD and 20 Blu-ray discs of the same videos the resolution of the videos are 1920 x 1080 I start burning the Blu ray and I get these error message, I discard about 8
 disc try to burning, then I try to burn the project in DVD and it works I burn the 40 DVD with not problem, all the DVD/BLU RAY PROJECT is with Adobe Encore CC last version on 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After finish burning the DVD discs I need to start with the Blu-ray, today is Saturday and I need to finish for Monday, my client is coming to pick up, all the Saturday I looking in the internet to try to solve the problem before waste more disc, because
 are expensive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw some from LG and I try to fix and nothing happen, also some answers in Microsoft and in adobe Encore but nothing have the answer and resolve the problem I still have the same problem , and I waste two more discs. I see all the post are from 2012, 2013
 and from about 3 years Microsoft, adobe Encore or some trade marks on the burner like LG don't have the answers to these question?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was so tired to find the answer in one day, then I open my folder in my computer and I saw the burner icon and because I leave a bluray disc in the burner, it say "drag the data" and I did with Microsoft and dragging and burn it works I burn 2 different
 videos and it works, the questions is the problem is in Encore?</p>

            <p>A Google search on that error returns results about similar problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know anything about burning Blue-ray or Encore CC but I can relates some things that other people used to get things working when they encountered that error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What version of Encore CC are you using and has it ever worked properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it used to work properly did you start having problems after upgrading Encore?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lots of folks report that problem with Encore CC version 6 but it works fine when they go back to version 5 so if that is an option consider it (what version are you using).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other folks report success with another program called ImgBurn.&nbsp; ImgBurn is free.&nbsp; I like to use ImgBurn for burning ISOs (it is just a few clicks) and don't have anyway to test using Blue-ray but it might be just what you need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the link for ImgBurn:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I read it doesn't sound like a Windows problem - it reads more like an Adobe problem and lots of folks report the problem and they end up trying lots of things which sometimes work, most of the time don't work and they either go back to version
 5 or use ImgBurn.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do the Google search yourself and read through the results and hopefully come up with a solution and when you do figure it out, hopefully you will come back and report what you did to get it working:</p>

<h2>            Black and blue screen issue in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original Post[windows 10]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am mad as **** at the moment, I downloaded the free windows 10 onto my laptop. Originally after download it was very slow opening, it seemed to have a black screen for ages before it started opening. Then a couple of days later I turned on my laptop, and
 nothing but a black then blue screen, I don't even get a &nbsp;mouse pointer on screen. Can't even put comp into safe mode. Pleeeeeeze has anyone any ideas on how to fix this, or have I stuffed my computer up altogether. I downloaded the ISO and burnt windows 10
 to dvd hoping that when I put the dvd into comp, it would miraculously fix my problem, boy was I dumb.</p>
<p>Cheers Kristin</p>

            <p>Hi Anju, I don't receive any error message, in fact I can't do anything as I have no mouse cursor on the screen, the screen just keeps changing from black to blue. I downloaded the ISO tool onto a dvd and I am also having problems with that, when I try to
 open it my computer just takes me to a "burn" program, (this is on another laptop) I am getting more and more frustrated as the day goes on, I am tempted to throw the computer up against the wall.</p>

 with either your wireless settings in the router or with the wireless adapter you are using.

            <p>Hi SujataMoktan, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply and information.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to correct the taskbar auto hide problem I was having with Microsoft Windows 10.&nbsp; My problem was due to one of the hidden icons in the notification area (located to the far right of the taskbar).&nbsp; I removed the icons one at a time until the problem
 went away.&nbsp; I am not sure what icon was the offender because I did not pay attention to there names as I removed them.&nbsp; I removed them by left clicking on the icon and selecting exit.&nbsp; I am also not sure why the offending icon did not show its self as needing
 attention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like the new MS Windows 10.</p>

            Followed the smart steps by looking at the notification area icons.&nbsp; The offender in my case was the OneDrive For Business Icon.&nbsp; It had an alert asking for credentials.&nbsp; Once I re-entered my credentials into OneDrive For Business and it began syncing
 the toolbar auto-hide started to work again.<br />

            I am still encountering this issue. I have the taskbar set to autohide, it will work for a period of time, and then it stops. Working with the icons has not solved this for me. The only way I can fix it is by restarting the PC. It seems that it is probably
 somehow related to Outlook [from the 2016 Suite]. It seems to only occur while I am using Outlook, but, not every time I use Outlook.

                    Microsoft updated my Gateway FX4710-UB802A Vista 64 bit system and messed up the driver for my Netgear WN111v2 wireless device, so I thought. The update also appeared to have made changes to the&nbsp;SM Buss Controller driver, which&nbsp;might to be the cause of
 the problem with the Netgear device -- even returned the device for a new one. It also might have damaged the restore file (I tried several prior dates, all the restores failed giving an error message "RESTORED FAILED DUE TO AN UNSPECIFIED FILE ERROR". So,
 in following the directions while try to trouble shoot the Netgear problem it said to deleat and restore the drives with an (!) next to the driver. Well I did as instructed and now I cannot find the Intel SM Bus Controller driver I deleted. Help

            The SMB Bus Controller is included in your motherboard (chipset) drivers. You should get all drivers for your machine from Gateway. The exception to this is if you purchased the Netgear wireless adapter yourself. In that case get those drivers from Netgear.
 Change your Windows Update settings from Automatic to "download and notify me when updates are ready" so you can
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">look</span> </em>at what you're installing. Never install drivers from Windows Update. And now you know why.

<p><span>Hi Michael,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you make any changes recently to your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you able to login to your Netflix account on the Netflix website through Internet Explorer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, you can try changing your username on the Netflix.com website to see if that help you in fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can also try downloading the latest Netflix version by following the steps below.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>To download the latest Netflix version through automatic download</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Download
 now</strong> in Windows Media Center to download the latest Netflix on Windows Media Center installation package. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 Windows Media Center, click <strong>Tasks</strong>, click <strong>Settings</strong>, click&nbsp;<strong>General</strong> and then click
<strong>Automatic Download Options</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Download
 Now</strong>. If Windows Media Center prompts you to set up an Internet connection, complete the steps that are listed on-screen.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the <strong>Start Download</strong> dialog box, click <strong>OK</strong>. The download may take several minutes to finish.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>When
 the download is complete, restart Windows Media Center. Then, look for the <strong>
Netflix</strong> option to the left of <strong>Recorded TV</strong> in the<strong>TV + Movies</strong> row</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now try to sign in to your Netflix account and check if youâ€™re able to sign in successfully.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if you need any further assistance.</span></p>

<p>i have this issue as well. no problems logging into the website and watching.</p>
<p>the error "the login information you entered does not match a valid netflix account" is limited to my windows vista machine that is used in the bedroom to watch movies on. My 3 windows 7 machines log in and stream fine.</p>
<p>i have tried reinstalling netflixinwmc ive tried rolling sliverlight back to ver.3, deleting the login registry entries running a windows fixit that another mod here suggested. basically everything short of reformatting and starting over.</p>
<p>oh and changing my username(which was pointless since it works in windows 7)</p>

            I am having the same issue. Netflix won't login with WMC&nbsp;on Vista Ultimate. I can login to Netflix in IE and it works fine. Since this started happening after the latest batch of windows updates, I am suspicious that one of the updates broke the netflix
 login in WMC. Could this be possible?

            I'll just add another "me too" for this one.&nbsp; I hadn't used the "Netflix in Windows Media Center" plugin since about a day after it appeared (since vmcMyNetflix worked so much better and then I was able to get real HD from the PS3 Netflix disc) but tonight
 I decided to see if it had been updated/fixed/improved only to discover it would no longer allow me to log in.&nbsp; IE8 works fine, my other Netflix-capable devices work fine.&nbsp; It's just the janky MS-Netflix plugin that is broken.

<p>I just captured the WMC Netflix login session with Wireshark and obtained the following result. I did not include some of the information from the oauth_consumer_key line (noted with an asterisk *) because I believe that it includes my id and password. Anyways
 the reponse from Netflix, "ERR_401_INVALID_SIGNATURE", might give someone at Microsoft or Netflix an&nbsp;idea of where the problem is occuring?&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what gets sent to Netflix:</p>
<p>GET /oauth/request_token?</p>
<p>oauth_consumer_key= *&amp;oauth_nonce=*&amp;oauth_signature_method=HMAC-SHA1&amp;oauth_timestamp=1277061353&amp;oauth_version=1.0&amp;v1.5&amp;oauth_signature=* HTTP/1.1</p>

<p>Hi Dimitrie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to inform you that this is not a bug. The following button combinations are shortcut keys in Windows, ALT + F4 is for closing a window and ALT + TAB is to switch tasks. Windows 10 has a feature that monitors computer usage for children. You

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. What exactly happens when you try to search?</div>
<div>2. Were there any changes made to the computer prior the issue?</div>
<div>3. Do you get any error message?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer the following link and check:</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>Basic Windows XP Search Indexing Troubleshooting<br />
<br />
a. Confirm that you are logged in to Windows with an account that has administrative privileges. The account does not have to be named "Administrator" but cannot be a regular user account.<br />
<br />
b. Click the "Start" button, then click "Control Panel". Double-click "Administrative Tools". If you do not see this icon, click the "Switch to Classic View" link on the left side of the window.<br />
<br />
c. Double-click "Services". Double-click "Indexing Service" in the window that opens. If the value shown next to "Startup Type" is "Manual" or "Disabled", click the drop-down menu and select "Automatic", and then click the "Start" button. Click "OK". This should
 resolve the problem with the index; do not continue through the steps below unless the problem persists. If the Indexing Service is already enabled, close the "Services" window and minimize the "Administrative Tools" window.<br />
<br />
d. Click the "Start" button, and then click "My Computer". Right-click on your hard drive and click "Properties".<br />
<br />
e. Confirm that a check is present in the box labeled "Allow Indexing Service to index this disk for fast file searching". If the box is not checked, place a check in it and click "OK". Note that some time may be required to apply this change to all folders
 on the drive. If the box was not checked, checking it should resolve the issue. If you continue to experience a problem with the search index, continue to Section 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong> </div>
<div>Rebuilding the Windows XP Search Index<br />
<br />
a. Return to the "Administrative Tools" window, which should still be minimized. Double-click "Services".<br />
<br />
b. Double-click "Indexing Service" and click the "Stop" button in the window that opens. Click "OK", and then minimize the "Services" window. You should now be looking at the "Administrative Tools" window again. Double-click "Computer Management".<br />
<br />
c. Double-click the entry for "Services and Applications" on the left side of the window to expand the category, then double-click "Indexing Service".<br />
<br />
d. Right-click "System" under "Indexing Service" and select "All Tasks" and "Empty Catalog". This forces Windows XP to empty the search index. When you restart the service, the index will be rebuilt.<br />
<br />
e. Return to the "Services" window. Double-click "Indexing Service" and click the "Start" button. Click "OK", and then close all open windows. Allow your computer time to rebuild the search index before testing it to confirm that it works. If the issue is resolved,
 stop here. If you continue to experience a problem, it may be because search indexing is working properly, but certain folders on the drive are excluded. Close all open windows and continue to Section 3.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 4:</strong> </div>
<div>Configuring Windows XP to Index All Folders<br />
<br />
a. Click the "Start" button, then click "My Computer".<br />
<br />
b. Right-click your hard drive and click "Properties".<br />
<br />
c. Remove the check from the box labeled "Allow Indexing Service to index this disk for fast file searching". Click "OK".<br />
<br />
d. Select the radio button labeled "Apply changes to C:\, subfolders and files" and click "OK". Windows will exclude every file and folder on the drive from being indexed. Be patient, as this process generally takes a long time to complete. If you receive an
 error, it is because search indexing cannot be enabled or disabled for certain protected system files. Click "Ignore All" when prompted.<br />
<br />
e. Repeat Steps b-d while replacing the check in the box labeled "Allow Indexing Service to index this disk". Once again, be patient while waiting for this process to complete. If you or another user accidentally excluded any files or folders on the hard drive
 from being indexed, they will be indexed once again when this process is finished.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this information helps.</div>

            You need to tell us what "not working" means to you remembering that we cannot see your system.<br />
<br />
We also need to be sure what you are talking about...&nbsp; Do you mean when you click Start, Search to search for something nothing happens, you see an empty screen, you get an error message or something else?<br />
<br />
What is your XP version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
The Microsoft Engaged Support Engineer "expert" referenced Fix it will not work if you do not have the troublesome Windows Search 4.0 already installed and I would not install the troublesome Windows Search 4.0 unless you want your system performance to suffer.<br />
<br />
I also would not follow the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" advice to enable the Windows Indexing Service.&nbsp; That has nothing to do with Windows Search not working.&nbsp; As a matter of fact (for most configurations, I would set the Startup Type of the
 Indexing Service to Disabled and your system will reward you with better performance.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I do not have Windows Search 4.0 installed and my Indexing Service has been disabled for many years and my Windows Search works just fine.<br />
<br />
These are just another more of their Support Engineer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild-goose_chase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h3> sseibel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Install 32-bit Vista or XP on 64-bit laptop&#63;</h2>
                    Hi.&nbsp; I recently purchased new a HP Pavillion dv3500 with 64-bit operating system.&nbsp; It has Vista Home Premium installed and I've been led to believe that this is a 64-bit version.&nbsp; I want to run some older programs that might be more compatible with a 32-bit
 version of Vista.&nbsp; (I'm having lots of problems with these programs right now.)<br />
<br />
1) Can I&nbsp; get rid of my current 64-bit Vista and install a 32-bit version of Vista onto my laptop?&nbsp; Does this concept even make sense?&nbsp; Would I have to buy a new version of Vista?<br />
<br />
2) Can I get rid of my current 64-bit Vista and install Windows XP onto my laptop?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.<br />
<br />

            Hi sseibel,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting to answers.microsoft.com<br />
<br />
In line with all the applications and drivers that you want to work with 64 bit Vista, there can not be a guarantee on third party software or drivers of their ability to function with the OS platform.<br />
<br />
One step I would try when trying to run an older program of interest on my system is;
<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;If you have the programs&nbsp;on disk and all their product keys, &nbsp;I would uninstall all DRIVERS and PROGRAMS that were causing conflict at this time.&nbsp; Do a complete uninstall by selecting Control Panel / Programs and Features / Uninstall Programs then uninstalling
 all references to drivers and programs listed.<br />

2.&nbsp; Download all Vista 64 Bit if available / 32 bit if not drivers and programs into a Folder that you've created and placed on the desktop.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; If logged in as an administrator, I would navigate to the " .exe" file for the installation of the Driver or Program and RIGHT CLICK on it.&nbsp; After right clicking you should select RUN IN COMPATIBILITY MODE.&nbsp; This will run it, if available as compatibile
 to Windows XP SP2.&nbsp; Do that on all the .exe's that you are trying to install .<br />
<br />
Let us know if this assists you.<br />
