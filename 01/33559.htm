<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Screen brightness fluctuates when using programs</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ASUS laptop with Intel core i7-5500u with CPU @ 2.40GHz with ram: 8gb, 64-bit Operating system and Nvidia Geforce 920M.</p>
<p>I just recently bought this laptop which had windows 10 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure that I am not going crazy but it seems like depends on the program I'm using my screen gets dimmer. I searched over and over again. I even asked for tech help from where I bought it and they do not know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned off the adaptive dimming setting in advanced power option. I changed my intel graphics card options and it still does it.</p>
<p>If anyone had this problem but some how fixed it, could you help me with this problem?</p>

    <title>Can I install Windows 10 on a separate partition&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lilbro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I install Windows 10 on a separate partition&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Well, after Build 10195 hosed my PC I reformatted my hard drive to get rid of it and reinstalled Win 7 Pro. My PC dual boots Win 7 Pro and Linux Mint 17.2, which I need for work.
</p>
<p>Build 14316 looks a ton better than 10195 so I thought I might try it again. Since the Restore / revert function did NOT work in 10195, I do not want to give up Win 7 in case Win 10 is still a POS phone app.
</p>
<p>So, is it possible to have Win 10 create a new partition and not kill Win 7 Pro and Linux Mint on my machine?</p>

<p>It is against the forum rules to name and shame.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to complain about someone "bullying you", you should NOT POST THE LINK TO A VIDEO OF YOU BREAKING THE TOS, over and over &nbsp;and over.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The video starts with you whining and crying and saying the F word every other word......SO it sounds like, U MAD BRO!!!!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>PS. technically, the person who made the video did NOT break the ToS.... But the video sure does prove YOU DID. OVER AND OVER..... Also, it seems to me that you are the one that was BULLYING in that video...</p>

<h2>            Netgear WGR614 Wireless Router drops out often. Win 7 Home P. 64bit ASUS K72J</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>&nbsp;I use a Netgear WGR614 wireless router with internet input from a cable modem. My main PC is the ASUS laptop with both a wireless and ethernet link to the router. The rest of the home network is a collection of older PCs (XP) and Macs.&nbsp;Since the recent
 Win 7 update a number of my system settings reverted to MS defaults.</p>
<p>The problem I can't solve is the Router losing its internet connection frequently. The relevant info is:</p>

<ul>
<li>The cable modem remains online; </li><li>Checked ISP, there are no problems with my service logged at their end; </li><li>Can restore internet and network links by rebooting the router, but it drops the link to modem soon afterward. All other lights on router remain active;</li><li>Noted that on Win 7 laptop, Internet connection is via Wifi, but not Local Area Connection - i.e. if laptop wifi is off and ethernet in - no internet;</li><li>The downstream PCs off the hub get internet via the Local Area Connection; </li><li>The Win 7 network diagram shows my named Home network and Local Area Connection;</li><li>When I am in my city office it automatically hooks into the office wifi as a Work Group and can cope with an ethernet connection as well without the drop-outs;</li><li>Have checked cabling, rearranged cable groupings - Cable Modem &gt; Router &gt; Hub &gt; non wifi boxes;</li><li>There was an IP address problem on the home network. That has been fixed. </li></ul>
<div>Would appreciate a solution, it is a real pain. &nbsp;Thanks</div>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Assuming that this happens even if only one or two computers are connected to the Router via wire, and the connection is lost on the WAN side.</p>
<p>The WGR 614 is an old Router (was below average even when it was new) might be that it the time to get something newer.</p>
<p>It can also be the Modem frequent disconnection at the WAN side is one of the symptoms of dying Modem.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the ISPs make believe that their computers can evaluate correctly anything beyond the cable connection form the street to the Modem is grossly exaggerated.</p>

<h2>            System Error 5 with NET, i.e. NET LOCALGROUP &#47;ADD</h2>
                    In Vista Business SP1, I'm getting error 5 with any use of NET which needs administrator privileges, even though I'm using an administrator account. GUI actions work without any problems, such as changing an account from Standard to User with the User
 Accounts control panel.<br />
<br />
An example command that generates the error is:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net localgroup "Remote Desktop Users" myaccount /add<br />
<br />
I suspect I may have a registry problem.&nbsp; I have already fixed one problem where "HKCU\Volatile Environment" from my administrator account was missing.<br />
<br />
I tried creating a new account and setting that to be an administrator with User Accounts, and the new account also results in error 5, although GUI-based administrator actions work also with this new account.<br />
<br />
I have not tested enough to say if other CLI programs generate this error.

<p>You can change Group Policies by opening Group Policy Editor first. You can open it by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Log in an <strong>administrator account.</strong> If you are already logged in as an administrator, proceed to step 2.<br />
</li><li>Press <strong>Windows + R </strong>to open <strong>Run.</strong></li><li>Type <strong>gpedit.msc </strong>and press <strong>Enter.</strong><br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After opening Group Policy Editor, you can now make the necessary changes that you want.</p>

<h2>            Volume always high, no matter what level I have it at</h2>
                    Hi there, I seem to have a problem where no matter what volume I have set, it is always really high. The problem only occurs when using the speakers with Realtek High Definition Audio. When using a USB sound device, volume works as normal. Any idea what
 could be going on?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is quite interesting. To help us understand the issue better, we would like to know:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Does the volume issue apply to both Windows notification sounds and when playing media files (Mp3 or Videos)?</p>
<p>2. Have you made any changes to the computer settings, relative to the audio set-up or configuration?</p>
<p>3. What troubleshooting steps have you done so far to try to resolve the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to receiving your feedback regarding this matter.</p>
<p />

            Volume remains at the same high level with both notifications and media files. I have not made any changes to the audio at all. The problem began occurring when I was playing a game and using aux port headphones and the sound was completely silent on the
 whole computer, not just the game. After restarting, the volume started having the issue mentioned above and has not gone away. I have tried updating my audio drivers and have restarted multiple times to no avail.

 or downloaded into the computer. </p>

<h2>            Skype on Android Auto</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skype is listed as a supported app for Android Auto, but when using Android Auto, Skype messages aren't received as a supported notification, and I cannot reply by voice.</p>
<p>Notifications of messages are only received as standard phone notifications.</p>
<p>Is Skype still supporting Android Auto? And is anyone able to make this work?</p>
<p>Google Assistant states it cannot send Skype messages.</p>
<p>

            Hi!
<br />
<br />My name is German, and I am here to help you.
<br />
<br />Try disable a network adapter using Control Panel, use these steps:
<br />
<br />Open Settings.
<br />Click on Network &amp; Security.
<br />Click on Status.
<br />
<br />Quick Tip: You can also quickly access these settings by right-clicking the network icon in the taskbar and selecting the Network &amp; Internet settings option.
<br />
<br />Click on Change adapter options.
<br />
<br />Right-click the network adapter #7, and select the Disable option.
<br />
<br />Any other questions I am at your disposal.
<br />
<br />Have a great day!
        </p>

            Hi Phani
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, then just type cmd
<br />
<br />From the resulting list, right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Paste this into Command Prompt and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=disallow
<br />
<br />When that completes, close Command Prompt
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not remove that device, may I ask are you running a VPN or some sort of Proxy on your PC?

<h3> madakor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Elite controller service</h2>
                    <p>Looking on how to get my elite controller fixed. The LH bumper is broken and the LH analog stick moves vertically. I tried to use your site to schedule a repair but your site doesn't seem to want me to register the device. It may be that I'm putting in a
 wrong number as to the serial number. But your site does not provide a description as to which number it is. I tried them all and every time it states that there is something wrong on Microsoft's end.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Resets Time at EVERY Power Off</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p><p><br /></p><p>Not sure if this is the appropriate forum. My Xbox One resets the date/time to Sep 1, 2014 EVERY&nbsp;TIME&nbsp;I power it back up! This is very annoying and has the effect of screwing up the display and operation&nbsp;of my game Saved Files.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I've seen several other posts about the date/time reset problem, but I've not seen any solutions here. This seems to be something totally related to the Xbox One - I didn't have this problem with the 360. But, further, it seems to be something that "broke" recently, i.e., within the past few months. I don't recall having this problem with the Xbox One earlier in the year.</p><p><br /></p><p>Bryan</p>

<p>Hi sir </p>
<p>I was using <strong>genuine windows 7 Home premium </strong>edition until yesterday. after release of windows 10 on July 29, I didn't receive upgrade notification while&nbsp;I had reserved windows 10 formerly, then I download windows 10 home edition from Microsoft
 website and install it on my device. I have my product key of windows 7 now.</p>
<p>if I am eligible for free upgrade how could I <strong>activate</strong> my windows 10 that<strong> installed now</strong>?</p>
<p>thank you in advance.</p>

            I have dell laptop with genuine windows 7 home in it. I did clean install to windows 10 (made .iso) and formatted my windows 7 and installed windows 10! Now windows 10 asks for activation! I&nbsp;enter my windows 7 product&nbsp;key and it is not working! I get this
 error - &nbsp;0xc004f050. Yet again Microsoft disappoints! I don't understand why&nbsp;they try to make life so difficult for customers. I lost my windows 7 and dell don't provides .iso for Windows 7 due to Microsoft! If&nbsp;this issue is not solved I will install&nbsp;Ubuntu
 and format windows 10!

</p><p>
</p><p>From what I've read, I think you just install Windows 10 on top of Windows 7 and 10 takes the 7 product key to register it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you get it sorted.</p>

            Thanks Chris for reply, but the problem is I did not do an update to Windows 10! I made a clean install. I got Windows 10 in .iso format and formatted my Windows 7! Now I am in limbo! Windows 10 won't take my Win 7 product key. I can't go back to Win 7
 because I don't have Win 7 .iso from Dell! Is there a way this can be fixed? Is Microsoft going to help people stuck in same situation like me?

            my acer got hit by lightning.&nbsp; Fried everything.&nbsp; I'd bought an SSD and windows 7 pro upgrade for the 7 home that was on it, then opted to go to 10.&nbsp; Put SSD into an old thinkpad x201 tablet with 4GB of RAM thinking that it would at least be useful.&nbsp; Since
 this machine doesn't support UEFI there was no way just to get it running, so I reinstalled 10 thinking I could put my bought key or the key thank comes with the thinkpad but it didn't work.&nbsp; Please don't tell me I have to install windows 7 pro &amp; upgrade it?
