<h2>            Account signs out randomly</h2>
                    <p>Was hoping that somebody might be able to tell me why my account gets signed out randomly, after about 20-30 minutes of being online It disconnects me from any party that I am in but still lets me continue playing online, even though I have technically been offline for 30 minutes. Sometimes it signs me back in right away and others I have to hard reset my console multiple times. I don't get disconnected from live when I get signed out, cause I still have full access to the Xbox live store.</p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I am afraid, this product might not work with windows 7. You always have xp mode option open in such scenarios.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you can visit windows compatibility website to findout if any product is compatible with windows 7.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 - The System Image Restore Failed. Error details&#58; The - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 - The System Image Restore Failed. Error details&#58; The parameter is incorrect. &#40;0x80070057&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have seen many posts related to this issue everywhere, the usual fix is to remove the USB recovery drive before the restore process starts. But this solution is not working for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased my desktop in June 2013 (Windows 8), and I had some video card issues, so I made a disk image and placed it in a portable disk, then wiped out the desktop's hard disk and had&nbsp;the video card replaced&nbsp;by the manufacturer. I&nbsp;ran the restore process
 and everything went back perfectly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>8 months later,&nbsp;the desktop has already been&nbsp;upgraded to Windows 8.1, then same video card&nbsp;issues&nbsp;&nbsp;again. So I did exactly as before, did my image backup, placed it in portable drive, send desktop to manufacturer, then receive desktop back, tried to restore
 disk image, and&nbsp; bam.. "The parameter is incorrect" issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is exactly the same hardware as before, I tried the removal of the USB&nbsp; recovery drive workaround (before the process starts, during the process, and almost at the end of the process), and nothing worked, the error message appears at the very end of the
 restore process, at 100% of C drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent already 3 days on this, does anyone have a solution for this problem? I can't imagine how such a critical functionality in an OS is&nbsp;so buggy.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You have made an 8.1 System Backup image and you are using an 8.1 Recovery Drive to restore it?&nbsp; It just seems the problem is related to an OS mismatch somehow.&nbsp; Did the manufacturer send it back to you with Windows 8 or 8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also seen situations where the recovery drive may have been written to and caused it to no longer function correctly.&nbsp; Do you have any Install Media DVDs or can you remake the flash drive?</p>

<h2>            UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INSTALL WINDOWS IMPORTANT UPDATE&#58;  HP Wireless Button Driver - 47KB</h2>
                    <p>I received a windows notification that an Important Update needed to be installed and it was the HP Wireless Button Driver. &nbsp;I am a Windows 8 user and have an HP Envy dv6 Notebook. &nbsp;When I clicked INSTALL, I got a message the installation failed (Error code
 was 80070436). &nbsp;I've worked with troubleshooting with HP, Microsoft, Tech Support from Costco Concierge service (free since I purchased notebook from them) with no luck. &nbsp; I'm not a real techie when it comes to this stuff, but I checked my DEVICE MANAGER and
 when I clicked on the PROPERTIES section of the Wireless Button Driver and hit UPDATE DRIVER, I got the following message: &nbsp;"Windows encountered a problem installing driver software for our devise. &nbsp;Windows found driver software for your device but encountered
 an error while attempting to install HP Wireless Button Driver. &nbsp;The name already is in use as either a service name or a service display name. &nbsp;If you know the manufacturer of your device, you can visit its website and check the support section for driver
 software." &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did check the HP website (since I have abn HP notebook) and support section for driver software did not remedy problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Couple of questions: &nbsp;</p>
<p>Since my notebook still is working fine and I have no other issues than the fact that I cannot install this important update, is it really that critical that it be installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any ideas how I can successfully get this important update installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Costco Concierge is supposed to be calling me back shortly so they can continue to work on this problem but since I already have about three hours invested in previous phone call from them that did not solve my problem, I not incredibly confident they will
 be successful. &nbsp;Right now I have not had remote access with them so they can take over my computer to assist but I have just been speaking with them on the phone so it's difficult to communicate with them since they can't see what's going on with my computer.
 &nbsp;When I spoke to them yesterday, the technician said that today they would like to assist me in performing a SYSTEM RESTORE.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some network adapters that still need newer definitions to get compatible with Windows 10. In that case, you can install Windows 10
<span>by going to the Windows 10 Software Download page to download the Media Creation Tool. The Media Creation Tool can be used to create a USB or DVD media to upgrade your current PC to Windows 10 or install Windows 10 on a different PC</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the instructions on Windows 10 Software Download page: </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10</span></span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>When upgrading to Windows 10 using media, you must run setup.exe from within your Genuine and Qualified version of Windows 7 or Windows 8. If you want to boot from media, you must have upgraded to Windows 10 previously. Boot from Windows 10 media directly
 without upgrading to Windows 10 previously is not supported and will have activation issues.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Having installed Windows 10, if the drivers do not work then install the older drivers in compatibility mode as detailed below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>a. Locate the&nbsp;executable&nbsp;file (.exe file) for the driver installation program.</span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>b. Right-click the file, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>.</span><br />
<span>c. In the&nbsp;<strong>Package Name</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>&nbsp;dialog box, click the&nbsp;<strong>Compatibility</strong>&nbsp;tab.</span><br />
<span>d. Click to select the&nbsp;<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>&nbsp;check box, click&nbsp;<strong>Windows&nbsp;7
</strong><em>(or any compatible OS version)</em>&nbsp;with which it is compatible with in the Run this program in compatibility mode for list, and then click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</span><br />
<span>e.&nbsp;Double-click&nbsp;the executable file to start the installation program.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

This may not get you back as much disk space as you'd hoped to&nbsp;recover, but&nbsp;remember&nbsp;that the automated decisions have to be safe for everyone. More disk space will likely be able to be recovered through a manual examination of your data files (e.g. look for

<div>I don't know about you but I don't update Windows. If I would have done that then I would have been a great trouble by now.</div>
<div>I suggest if you format you machine completely soon just like me then provide Windows 7 with enough space next time.</div>
<div>By the way try re-installing the programs you have stored on C Drive to another drive if you have any on C and can be moved to another partition. Also try to move your documents to another drive too. You can even change the location of your documents to
 a different drive if you want to.</div>

</p><p>As suggested from other help forums on this topic, I clicked on the Home --&gt; Administrative Tool --&gt; Services --&gt; Windows Installer --&gt; Properties --&gt; I got stuck here, instructions say to change Startup Type from Manual to Disabled. However, the dropdown

<div>Hi karigar,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Do you remember any changes prior to the issue occurring?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>b. Which browser are you using?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You could follow the steps given below:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'd suggest you run a built-in troubleshooter using the below link. Also follow all the suggestions mentioned in the link.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Why is my Internet connection so slow?<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Why-is-my-Internet-connection-so-slow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Why-is-my-Internet-connection-so-slow</strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Start your machine in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode with networking</a> and check if the speed fairs better.</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure you have a wired connection while performing safe mode with networking<br />
<div><br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it does perform better, then there could be a third party software slowing the speed of your machine, hence I'd suggest you boot your machine in a&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a> state.</div>

            <p><span>Hi
<strong>John</strong>,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the issue description I understand that are unable to play lionhead studios game on Windows 8 computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if the game is compatible with Windows 8:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link-
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/Home</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the game was working fine in Windows 7, I would suggest you to install it in Windows 7 compatibility mode and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can also try installing the game in clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Put the computer in Clean Boot state to see if there is any software conflict as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After performing the troubleshooting steps in clean boot, follow
<b>Step 3</b> from the link to return the computer to <b>Normal startup mode</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps</span></p>
<p><span>Keep us posted if you face any issues on windows in future. We will be glad to help you</span></p>

            <p>I see that it's been a couple of months since your (John's)&nbsp;original post which may mean you fixed your issues with The Movies on Windows 8. If not, I can't add much from a technical aspect but I will say I just bought a Toshiba Satellite with Windows 8
 and the game runs great. A message warning of a possible&nbsp;compatibility issue did appear at the very beginning but I have had no issues after several hours of play. I'm up to the point where there are no remaining packs to unlock (well into the 21st century).</p>
<p>Like I said, that may not be a big help but at least you'll know it can be done.</p>
<p>Note: when I briefly had a laptop with Windows 7, I had to install the game using a special method. You'll have to Google it because I don't even remember the details. My point is, however, that I didn't have to do anything&nbsp;special with Windows 8. It simply
 installed without any problem.</p>

            My laptop crashed and I was forced into Windows 8 today, first thought will The Movies Game work on Windows 8? The Movies Game isn't on the list of capable games for Windows 8, but it should be.<br />
<br />
The Movies Game does work in Windows 8.&nbsp; The way to install;<br />
<br />
1) Let it read the disk, but do install that way.<br />
2) Go to computer<br />
3) Right click on The Movies Game.&nbsp; Click on <b>set up.exe</b> (the one above the one that looks like a little cog, if you click the other one it just gives you code)<br />
4) Run program.<br />
5) It should dance and sing, plus install the way you recognize (asking for product key).<br />
Please note It will get a little funny when it installs the DirectX 9, it will tell you there are
<span>compatibility</span> issues just click on by that,&nbsp; that's just because the game was running on a lot older version (it turned 11 this year).
<br />
<br />
If you are also trying to instal The Movies Stunts &amp; Effects do the same thing, but Windows 8 won't freak out when the DirectX 9 is installing, because it would have already found the most up-to-date version.<br />
<br />
Windows 8 seems like a smart cookie as long as you are hooked up to the internet it seems to find the solutions ON IT'S OWN.&nbsp; Windows 8 is like if a mobile phone and a computer had a baby together it would have produced my beautiful new laptop.<br />
<br />
I hope that helps, I'm not a computer geek, but I've played The Movies Game for 7 years now &amp; I will get upset the day I can no longer play it.<br />
<br />

            Hey there.&nbsp; I'm having a little problem with this...:(<br />
<br />
When I install the game, it says the "compatability issue" thing and asks me if I'd like to look for an online solution but, when I click it, it says there isn't any solution and closes.<br />
It says that either I'm running an older version of DirectX (which I have windows 8, so I have DX11) or my DX is disabled.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you help meeee? :)<br />

            <p>Hey! I know that it's been forever since this post, but I'm desperately trying to figure out how to fix this game, and you seem to be the only person I can find who got the game to work on Windows 8, so I figure it's worth a shot.<br />
<br />
I did the install like you said, and up until I got to about 1935, the game worked fine. From there, I've experienced random crashes every 15-20 minutes of game time, making it essentially unplayable. The problem is very similar to the problem listed on this
 forum:&nbsp;http://www.techsupportforum.com/forums/f59/solved-the-movies-pc-game-crashing-when-saving-windows-7-64-bit-657311.html.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, I would just put it in compatibility mode for windows 7 and make that fix, since that supposedly worked, but when I do that, I get the disc error provided here. But since Windows 8 already allows you to run the game on CPU 0, 1, 2, and 3 by default,
 I'm starting to think that's not the problem. Do you have any tips on how to make it work? I'm using the Toshiba Satellite laptop with a 17" screen.</p>

What I did doesn't include fancy boot up or whatever. I just put the disk in and went into "My Computer" and located "The Movies" there.<br />
What I did then was right click&gt;open&gt;scroll down to setup (application) and went from there. It should install! :-)</p>

</p><p>Hey! I had to completely wipe out my computer recently and re install everything.. But when it came to reinstalling The Movies it no longer allows me because like you it says it's not compatible. I think this game is too ancient to be played on today computers
 and now I don't have any answers haha.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            SvcHost Virus</h2>
                    So I've noticed a spike in my task manager and my computer running buggy recently. I've ran MalwareBytes, AVG Free, BitDefender Trial, RKill, and ESET Powerliks Cleaner but they all came up negative.&nbsp; Also I've ran the command sfc /scannow command or whatever
 and that came up negative as well. These SvcHost process' are all located in my System32 folder and not disguised as a different fake SvcHost like other viruses. I've tried of what I thought would be everything and I'm up to try anything. I've even done a
 Windows Refresh and the problem is still here Thanks in advance.

Sorry I never was notified of a response, but my problem still persists. I've tried what you've suggested and yet I still have the issue. I haven't installed or modified any programs of my knowledge so I'm really confused on why it's like this. At this point
 I'm thinking that a new SvcHost file might help if that's possible.

<p>it looks like a dvd player, which is fine. but not really any games were shown. &nbsp;just like the last 3-5 years of e3 for MS.. they said exclusives are coming but &nbsp;something tells me most will be kiddy kinect games or arcade games. the partnership with EA
 could be a winner if BF4 is 100% exclusive, but i doubt that will happen EA would lose millions of sales.</p>
<p>now they are showing cod ghost which is multiplatform, which doesn't help xbox at all. I am not impressed ( assuming the show is about over).</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Damn good looking Controller for something that has neither Games and "forces" Kinect? Really weird like that? Not to mention (but I am), the statement of 15 Exclusives and 8 new IP's.<br />
<br />
Graphically (for what was shown), it wasn't a "stunning" difference but more a Launch Title Xbox 360 compared to a Last Title Original Xbox. Given a year or so in Game Development and what Devs should be able to accomplish, 2014 should look like gorgeous eye-candy.
 I also noticed at what seems like a lot of Bloom. Maybe to make up for Coding they don't understand yet?<br />
<br />
Hardware wise, kinda what was expected. We'll have to see how much it holds over the course of the next six plus years to a decade. I think if MS really wanted this to be an "ultimate", they could have pushed that edge a little more. I'm keeping in mind not
 all of the Specs are available yet.<br />
<br />
The built-in "Video Capture" is kinda cool but to what ends? Yet to be determined.<br />
<br />
The name, thank god people can finally stop calling it the Xbox 720. Xbox One is pretty good. My guess would be to make a statement of "one" Device for Entertainment and to avoid being referred to as the 3rd Platform from Microsoft?</span></p>

<p>I was not able to watch this but the info I gather is as follows.</p>
<p>1. Xbox One (they have to be trolling us with that name. Worst console name in history since this is the 3rd xbox)</p>
<p>2. Forza 5 as launch title (Yup I knew that a long time ago)</p>
<p>3. Blu ray player (knew that a very long time ago)</p>
<p>4. Can we play used games?? I don't think that was answered yet?</p>
<p>5. Xbox One design looks okay. &nbsp;Nothing special but at least its black to match all my other electronics including 360 and PS3.</p>

<p>not really impressed..the whole console centers around voice commands which sucks because the original kinect didnt pick up my voice at all..the whole interface and dashboard seems overly complex..the console itself is so bulky..i still think kinect is watching
 us..not too happy with it especially since the drm always online issue was not addressed..they really didnt show anything I was hoping for..</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 Console with Digital Games To Xbox One Console.</h2>
                    
<p>I bought a lot of games digital on my Xbox 360 Console and I see alot of them on the Xbox One Store but for some reason I cant play Call Of Duty Ghosts , Assassins Creed 3 , Chivalry Medieval Warfare Etc. I payed a lot of money for these games and I dont
 want to have to buy them all over again. I am trying to transfer my Xbox 360 Games that have Xbox One Versions to my Xbox One console as Xbox One Games. &nbsp; "Xbox 360 Game To Xbox One Game".</p>

<p>The only way you can do xbox 360 to xbox one is backwards compatibles or upgrade offer usually limited to the first year of release of release of the one copy</p>

<h2>            How do you make a template for windows mail like in outlook express&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, When operating outlook express we had templates that we could use for sending emails. Unfortunately we do not seem to have this option with windows live mail. We would really really like to have this option as it looks good when sending emails on.
 Can someone please help us get this on windows live mail. Many Thanks :(

            <div>Outlook Express did not have a template option. Perhaps you mean MS Outlook?
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you want an e-mail with a standard&nbsp;text and perhaps recipients, create it in WLMail. When you're done, click on the Menu Button | Save As File and save it as an .eml file to the desktop. If you want, you can drag the icon created to the Taskbar for
 easy access.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When you want to use this template, just click on the envelope icon that was created and WLMail will open with your saved info. Add the extras and then send it.</div>

<p>Hi Xxcompo1696xX, what i suggest you try is to download the trial version of Castle Miner Z, and see if that lets you download it, and if it does then most likely it will let you purchase the full version while in the trial version. I hope this helps :)</p>
