<h2>            Epson XP-202 Home edition paper jam issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Epson XP-202 Home Edition and it recently started flashing up indicating there is a paper jam or ink issue.&nbsp; All my ink cartridges have been replaced and the mechanism seems to be running fine. This means the machine thinks there is a paper jam
 - however there is no paper jammed in the automatic paper feeder.&nbsp; I have read somewhere that if the paper is pulled out incorrectly that may have an effect on the paper sensor unit? It`s possible my daughter may have pulled out the paper incorrectly.&nbsp; In
 any event I have a machine with all flashing lights but it won`t feed the paper or print.&nbsp; How can I fix this? Any advice welcome</p>

    <title>MS Wireless Laser Desktop 7000 battery drain on keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MS Wireless Laser Desktop 7000 battery drain on keyboard</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>After installing Windows 7 X64 on my system I've noticed a markedly decreased battery lifespan on my Wireless Laser Desktop 7000 keyboard.</p>
<p>I've used both high capacity (2450mah) nimh batteries and standard alkaline - none of which last more than a few days before the keyboard dies.</p>
<p>I've tried googling and MS support but the keyboard is out of warranty.</p>
<p>Anyone here have any suggestions? I really don't know how Windows 7 would have affected the keyboard's battery life so adversely. The mouse is fine though.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sean</p>

<p>Cheers for the reply Afzal,</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I have the latest Win 7 drivers, but I'll take another look nonetheless.</p>
<p>In terms of hibernation being a potential problem, what should I have the settings as? Should I turn hibernation on or off etc? I didn't even know there were settings to have devices hibernate. I've never used that function before.</p>

            I don't know if it's the same, but I've noticed a similar issue with battery life but I haven't upgraded to Win7, still using XP.<br />
<br />
When I first got the keyboard the batteries lasted for pushing a year, now they seem to have run out every time I go to use the PC (admittedly I tend to use my laptop mostly these days). I'm using Duracell Ultras which should be good for longer than a couple
 of weeks surely?<br />
<br />
I wonder if there's been some sort of driver update causing the issue?<br />

            I am having the exactly same problem. The keyboard battery life span was fine until I upgraded to windows7, after which the battery would only last for a couple of days, regardless of the many battery types that I have tried (rechargeable, alkaline, etc.);
 whereas the mouse keeps running well for months without replacement.<br />
<br />
I have been using the "latest" drivers for the ergo keyboard ever since they become available each time, hoping this problem can be fixed. But no, the MS has never fixed it. Being a software developer myself, I strongly suspect that the windows7 or its driver
 is the culprit of this problem (one possibility: not sending off signal to the keyboard before system going into sleep or hibernation, even after "allow the keyboard to wait this computer" option is marked off for the keyboard driver in windows7, but why the
 mouse doesn't have this problem?).<br />

            Afzal, thanks for your info, but unfortunately it doesn't work. Please check with the driver's developers to make sure they fix this bug in windows7. Thanks.<br />

            Yes, I called MS. Before hand, I found my store receipt (purchase date still within 3 years warranty period), but the MS representative did not ask for it once he heard about my description of the symptoms. I just needed to mail back the old bundle before
 the MS sent me the new one, this time in an updated package with "windows7 compatible" label on it. I did have to pay for the UPS shipping, $20 or so, can't remember exactly, but still cheaper than buying a new set. No battery draining issue since. Good luck.<br />

<h2>            File Explorer folders all changed to OneDrive</h2>
                    With my most recent Windows 10 update all the default folders in file explorer (documents, pictures etc) have changed to the OneDrive folders I do not nor have never used.&nbsp; At first I thought the update had wiped my files but I was quickly able to find
 them the old fashioned way in C:\Users\username\Pictures.&nbsp; When I right click on the short cut for documents in file explorer, it shows the location is not on OneDrive and if I try to manually change or restore the default it gives me an access error "cannot
 move folder as there is a folder in the same location that can't be redirected, Access Denied"<br />
<br />
What do I need to do as I have no interest in using OneDrive to store my files

    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade on Dell Latitude ST Tablet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade on Dell Latitude ST Tablet</h2>
                    <p>So I work on computers every day for a living, and&nbsp;I use this tablet for 1 purpose only, to run ECMLink v3 in my car.<br />
It was working fine, with 7 has been kept virus free, and is almost never on the internet except to do windows updates.<br />
I finally allowed 10 to install, and I'm so ticked off I&nbsp;want to break&nbsp;the tablet in half.<br />
When I touch the screen to open an app, its so slow I never know if its working or not until 5-8 seconds later, after multiple clicks.&nbsp;<br />
And that's the least of my frustrations.</p>
<p>Its awfully difficult to do anything since my on screen keyboard has been removed, and the included one acts like a web page, where I can only access it when I put what I want to type into in the background.</p>
<p>So I've already disabled Cortana,&nbsp;how do I remove it for good&nbsp;and stop it from taking half the taskbar and CPU?<br />
How do I get my keyboard that stayed at the edge of the screen back so I can actually do something?<br />
How can I remove all the apps that I absolutely will never use? <br />
And I don't mean to ask how to disable them for the&nbsp;current user, I want to remove them.<br />
Where is my desktop? I see it for a split second now and then but can't make it stay.<br />
<br />
Geez, I thought this was supposed to be an improvement, not an exercise in frustration.<br />
No Wonder its free.<br />
</p>
<p>If I can't remove these things&nbsp;that I don't want, then I will be forced to go back to 7</p>

            The Skype user ID / password combination is not dependent upon OS. Be it Windows or Mac or iOS or Android, the same user ID / password will work. 
<br />
<br />Also, it doesn't matter whether you app or desktop version or web Skype, the same user ID / password will work.
<br />
<br />Hence, no need to worry about this,

            These update messages are rolled to billions of devices across the world. It is not possible for an organization to cover so many devices in one go. It gets rolled over a period of many weeks. That is why few will get the message now and few will get later on.

            It will not. Just go to your Playstore and update it. Just continue using it after the update.
<br />
<br />There is no plan for its discontinuation. You just need to update this. Latest version is 1.46.xxxxx

<h2>            Skype 7.56 high CPU usage macOS 10.12.6</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have massive problems with Skype when doing calls (audio &amp; video). The CPU load is extremely high and after a a few mins the fan of the MacBook will launch and the device gets hot. Eventually in video calls the video will start stuttering or completely
 stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this?</p>

<h2>            Recovery from USB not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mi Surface Pro 3 started to crash and going straight to BIOS at startup. Sometimes it retrained itself to do so and launch Windows (10), but progressively it started to always go into BIOS mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some research, I came to the USB recovery solution.</p>
<p>From a different windows 10 equipped computer, I've created a USB thumb drive from the Recovery Drive app. A 16Gb, Fat32 formatted thumb drive.</p>
<p>After the recovery drive was done, I've unziped the zip file I've got from my onedrive account, tailored to my registered Surface Pro 3 computer (I've used the Windows 10) file into my previoulsy made recovery thumb drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to my Surface Pro 3, I've inserted the recovery thumb drive, pressed the "volume down" button and taped the "Power" button. After the spiining dots appeared, I released the "volume down" key. As expected, it went into the choose a language and keyboard
 menu.</p>
<p>After selecting my preferences, I've wento to "Troubleshoot" -&gt; "Recover from a drive", but then I got an error. "Unable to reset tour PC. The system drive cannot be found."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried two thumb drives, both new, right from the package. One was a USB 2, 32GB and the other a USB 3, 16GB.</p>
<p>The error I got was the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I solve this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance, Henrique</p>
                </div>

            <div>Below are the complete instructions. If you have had failures with two separate</div>
<div>16GB USB drives, then it is likely that the SSD in your SP3 has failed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Go to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
<div>(with a different Windows computer if yours is not working properly)&nbsp; </div>
<div>and download a recovery image for your Surface. You will need a 16GB USB stick</div>
<div>formatted FAT32 (use a Windows computer). Use FULL format and not quick format.</div>
<div>Give the volume a name like surfboot.</div>
<div>Unzip/extract the recovery zip to the formatted USB stick and then-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:</div>
<div>Step 1:&nbsp; &nbsp; Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in (hold down the power</div>
<div>button for 30 seconds).</div>
<div>Step 2:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 3:&nbsp; &nbsp; Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the</div>
<div>power button on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 4:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.</div>
<div>Step 5:&nbsp; &nbsp; When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.</div>
<div>Step 6:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.</div>
<div>If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of the</div>
<div>screen.</div>
<div>Step 7:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This</div>
<div>refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 8:&nbsp; &nbsp; Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.</div>
<div>Step 9:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Choose Just remove my files.</div>
<div>Step 10:&nbsp; &nbsp; Select Reset.</div>
<div>Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process continues</div>
<div>(this can take a while).</div>

</p><p>I am trying to upgrade from Windows&nbsp;7 Home Premium to Windows 10 on an HP p6205uk.&nbsp; It has 3GB of memory in the Factory Image, of which 2.85 is available.&nbsp; There is tons of space on the C drive.&nbsp; Windows 10 starts to download but stops when the 3GB is consumed.&nbsp;
 Can the download be done to the C drive directly or do I have to create additional space on the Factory Image?</p>

<h2>            I&#39;ve been banned from xbox live for doing nothing except silently playing a game</h2>
                    <p>So about a week and half ago I&nbsp;was unfairly communication&nbsp;banned when someone else messaged me insults and I&nbsp;ignored them, I&nbsp;submitted the case review explaining this and yet it still was upholded. I&nbsp;excepted this and played with no communication and then stopped playing for 3 to 4 days. I&nbsp;then decided to play a bit yesterday and when I did, after 20 minutes of playing silently and not being able to communicate at all,&nbsp;I was messaged by xbox saying I was banned from xbox live for "harassment and threats". The problem with this is I was not able to communicate with anyone and haven't played for a couple days, so how could I have done that to be banned. I submitted a case review explaining this and yet they upheld that decision as well. How is that fair that I am getting banned for not even playing or talking to anyone, I don't understand this.</p>

            <p>We wouldn't be able to reliably speculate on this for you, as nobody on the forums has access to your Enforcement records. The&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;Enforcement team doesn't post here either.</p><p><br /></p><p>As you've already went to the <a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Enforcement website</a> and submitted your case reviews (only to have them "upheld"), there is unfortunately&nbsp;nothing left to do but to sit out the rest of the suspension.</p><p><br /></p><p>The only thing I&nbsp;can probably think of: does somebody else have access to your account? Is your account saved&nbsp;onto somebody else's console?&nbsp;If so, consider <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/microsoft-account/change-microsoft-account-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">changing your password</a>.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>If you payed attention to what I said, I&nbsp;didn't do anything because to get banned, it means someone else has to report you, and there's nothing for them to stop them from doing that as much as they want just because they don't like it. Also explain to me how I&nbsp;broke the rules for silently with no mic, playing a videgames PvE&nbsp;mode, is breaking the rules? because it's not. Also again, you can be ban for nothing if people just spam the report option just because they don't like them, so it does need to be fixed because I&nbsp;haven't done anything break them, including this most recent one which is complete crap because how can I&nbsp;harass someone or threaten them if I&nbsp;can't communicate through messages or chat. So obviously someone abuse the system to get me banned or something, because I don't know how else I&nbsp;would be banned for doing nothing then just peacefully playing the game.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Yet why then have I&nbsp;been banned from xbox live in general for nothing?&nbsp;What could they have found to ban me if for 3 to 4 days I wasn't even playing and then somehow I&nbsp;did something wrong by not talking to anyone in gamechat because I&nbsp;didn't have a mic to get banned for harassment and threats? It's hard to believe the enforcement team actually will do an investigation if they don't show to me the supposed evidence. Plus I&nbsp;doubt there was any for weeks or months ago because &nbsp;I&nbsp;almost never talk in gamechat and never message random people, I&nbsp;just stay silent or play with friends in private parties. I&nbsp;think it would be more likely that if someone just decided to file a lot of complaints against me, then they would just go ahead and ban then actually investigate since again, I&nbsp;never message and mostly never talk in gamechat, so there's no real point where I&nbsp;would decide to do such a stupid thing as harass and threat.</p>

<h2>            I&#38;&#35;39&#59;m being targeted and harassed on Xbox Live, What do I do&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>It started October 28th of 2014, I was playing Grand Theft Auto Online one night and few hours in I was constantly being harassed for using Passive, a mode where your limited on actions.</p>
<p>I mainly use it to just relax and have fun, but some people choose to talk it too serious, not long after one person started to constantly harass me cause I use this mode disabling the option of them killing me.
</p>
<p>I ask him to stop, he denies, I ask a second time, he ignores me.</p>
<p>I tell him "If you don't stop I will report you for harassment" </p>
<p>He takes this as a major insult, he starts ranting about how I can't do that, saying you can't ban me for playing the game, I replied, "I didn't say ban, I said report, I have a right to report anyone for any reason that the Code of Conduct says I may."</p>
<p>The conversation leaves voice chat and goes into Xbox Live voice and text messages, 2-3 hours pass and I have already told him that I reported him for harassment and blocked his communications.</p>
<p>the messages stopped, later that night, he returns with five of his friends, and they continue the same aggressive behavior, I ask them to stop, they don't answer, I notified them that if they continued, I would report them for harassment, few of them stopped,
 but only after they were constantly harassing me for well over two hours.</p>
<p>A few days go by, and I'm playing again and I get messages from someone I have never played before and it was the same person who was harassing me, he continues to send me messages with rude and vulgar messages, calling me names which I will not say, he's
 constantly sending them and not giving up, after the first twenty messages I told him, "If you don't stop harassing me, I will report you for harassment and block your communications again."</p>
<p>He continues trying to say that I can't report people for harassment when it's part of the game.</p>
<p>Days later, he targets me on the Rockstar social club and harasses me on there, as well on the Xbox forums.</p>
<p>12/24/14 I am getting more messages from the same person, he is targeting me and harassing me, he simply will not let this go.</p>
<p>So far he has used three accounts to harass me and I'm not sure if I'll ever get away from this person.</p>

<p>File complaints and block communications with them. That's really all you can do.
</p>
<p>For future reference, it's best to just do that right away instead of message them and tell them you're going to report them. That's usually what makes them want to continue to aggravate you.</p>

<p>You mostly have yourself to blame and need to learn how the internet works. You should have instantly ignored/ blocked communication with that person, they aren't forcing you to read their messages.
</p>
<p>Never respond and definitely don't tell them your going to report them, it's childish and pointless.
</p>
<p>Why did you continue to stay in the game with him? I haven't played gta online, but can't you find another game with people that aren't bothered by your play style?</p>
<p>Don't let yourself be a victim. You have control over what you see, nothing is forced upon you.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so I am including those steps at the end to try:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to restart PC three times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Startup Options here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>.  Try Last Known Good Configuration and then Safe Mode with Networking.
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br />
<br />Hardware Tests:
<br />
<br />Test your RAM overnight to stress it with a more reliable bootable test, following these steps which test both the sticks and the slots:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram-test-memtest86.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram...</a>
<br />
<br />Test the hard drive with Seatools bootable Long Test: <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>
<br />

    <title>How to prevent USB plug and play for a specific device - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simonpengelly  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to prevent USB plug and play for a specific device</h2>
                    <p>I have &nbsp;a plotter-cutter that is controlled directly from the software and not through a driver. It's USB connected. It works fine until Windows 7 decides to install a driver and this then blocks the program's access to the device.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows then refuses to fully delete the driver information and so uninstalling the driver and the device software doesn't fully clear the problem back to pristine pre-install conditions. Even going through the registry (after uninstall and device deletion)
 and deleting the masses of registry key references that remain doesn't clear the system out.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've installed the system on about five computers now and I'm running out.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What I need to be able to do is prevent Windows from taking control of this specific device without disabling USB or messing up other USB device operation</p>

    <title>No Output devices found&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gamingfrog18  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Output devices found&#63;</h2>
                    Hello! Just last night, my computer was working fine and the sound was coming out clearly, until suddenly my computer had restarted and then it had told me there were no output devices to be found. My drivers said they had errors and no matter how many
 times I tried to troubleshoot and restart, i always got the same result, the drivers continued to be errors. I use a corsair gaming headset and it never had problems, I check if there are new driver updates all the time. Sometimes I also use the speaker from
 my monitor. I kept getting a message about how Windows could not determine the status of the driver and I never installed anything that had malware on it. I kept uninstalling and reinstalling the driver for the headset and the monitor and nothing seemed to
 work. Even after checking for a new windows update, nothing still worked. Im afraid of reseting the computer completely since I have important projects for college in the files on the computer. Any ways to fix the problem?&nbsp;

<p>Have you rolled back the driver in Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option is to select Update driver and then select to Browse my computer and on the next screen select Let me pick from a list of available drivers. See if other listed drivers reset the audio, if there are other drivers.</p>

</p><p>A reset may be your only option in the end but yo should have your personal files backed up to and external device. There will be an option to keep personal files but all non standard programs/apps will be removed.</p>

            I have not attempted to roll back the driver, for some reason it doesnt allow me to choose the option even if i am an Admin. I tried searching for the driver in my files using the options you listed but that did not work either. I truly hope I will not
 have to reset the computer completely, currently I am just confused as to why the sound was working fine and then suddenly stopped when the computer reset on its own&nbsp;

<p>What is the make and model of the device, was it designed for Windows 10 or was it part of the free upgrade from Windows 7 or 8.</p>
<p>If it came pre-installed with Windows 10 from the manufacturer (HP, Acer etc) then have you tried asking them about the problem.?</p>

            Hey gamingfrog18, 
<br />
<br />It's my guess that a Windows Update driver messed up your audio. You should be ready to go to your manufacturer's website and download a previous version or the latest version available of your audio driver, as well as preventing the reinstallation of the driver, and you could do this in a couple of ways:
<br />
<br />1. Uninstall and reinstall your own driver, make sure you hide the driver update so that in the future it won't be installed (with WUShowHide): <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3073930/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-driver-update-from-reinstalling-in-window" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/307393...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Go to File Explorer, right-click This PC then click Properties. And on the left pane, click Advanced system settings &gt; Hardware (tab) &gt; Device Installation Settings. Select No and click OK, then reinstall your driver. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! Please let me know how it goes and if I'm able to help out further.

<p>I did the steps given but even so, I continued to get this message on the details when I went to look at the Properties of each of the sound drivers. I'm still confused as to why my computer restarted on its own and the drivers were shown as errors. Would
 doing a system restore to a point before the automatic restart of last night at 1 am be able to fix the situation?</p>

            gamingfrog18,
<br />
<br />Performing a system restore would certainly do it but whether it's a long-term solution or not is uncertain.
<br />
<br />Like I've mentioned, I believe it could be a driver in the Windows Update database that is deemed as the latest, and that driver would wreak havoc, despite the steps you were performing.
<br />
<br />Please feel more than free to post back seeing if a system restore would fix it or not.

            The problem has been fixed! I had to disable the driver signature enforcement through the advanced restart settings, and once I restarted the computer, everything was back to normal. Thank you for the help and advice though! I'll be sure to come back here
 in case I come upon any more problems. Thank you once again!!

<p>The external power supply has detected a fault. The power supply has several built-in safeguards to help prevent damage to either the console or to the power supply itself. The power supply will turn itself off under the following conditions:</p>
<p>•When there is too much current</p>
<p>•When the voltage is too high</p>
<p>•When the temperature is too high</p>
<p>Under these conditions, the light on the power supply will turn from green to orange or to red. Or, the light will turn off. When the power supply light is green or orange when it is connected to the wall outlet, the power supply is functioning correctly.

<h2>            problems with &#34;this week&#39;s&#34; WU &#40;KB4040724&#41; - it&#39;s shown as September. Also Flash.</h2>
                    <p>A site I visited said I needed to install Flash - but I have Microsoft's version which is updated whenever necessary. I opened Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security and checked for Updates. There was one, a Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1703 for x64-based
 Systems (KB4040724). After an hour, the download was stuck at 3%. I waited another 15 minutes and then the installation began. When it had finished though, here's what I saw in history:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1ae455f-4247-4cf2-a702-a286cd17369c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1ae455f-4247-4cf2-a702-a286cd17369c" /></a></p>
<p>As you'll see, it's shown as a September update, not October. I have my PC set to accept WUs&nbsp;as soon as they're&nbsp;available. Does anyone know why this WU has only just appeared mid-Patch Tuesdays, please?</p>
<p>Also, had the Download still been stuck on 3% and 75 minutes what should I have done? Just left it for hours? Could I have used the PC in the meantime? I never do normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS the site that started this is still wanting Flash to be updated so I'll have to start a new thread.</p>

            Thanks Monica. I'm happy to use the feedback form later but for now I'd like to find out if anyone else&nbsp;has had this strange "catch-up WU" in between Patch Tuesdays. This will then help the engineers to see the extent of the problem.

    <title>Cannot find my network profile to change it to Private - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scottrusso1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot find my network profile to change it to Private</h2>
                    <p>After a recent disk crash due to a faulty SATA cable, I noticed I had issue with my home network. I can connect my PC to the internet (Not using wifi), but I lost ability to use skype for business and my VPN.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I went back to a restore point, and refreshed my PC. No luck.</p>
<p>I went through most troubleshooting, Network troubleshooting states nothing is wrong.</p>
<p>The HomeGroup troubleshooting states I can't join unless my network is private.
</p>
<p>When I look at the network, it doesn't show anything. Usually you see the connection, with the adapter name, and if it's public or private. Mine is blank.</p>
<p>I believe I have a corrupt or missing network profile.</p>
<p>I opened powershell and ran get-netconnectionprofile</p>
<p>This returned nothing, not even an error, just the PS prompt.</p>
<p>I ran this same command on my laptop, and it returned the network adapter, and the ID number</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to the following location: "Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Network and Sharing Center"</p>
<p>It states "You are currently not connected to any networks"</p>
<p>When I go here: Network, it states; "This computer is not connected to a network"
</p>
When I click to connect to a network, it shows I am connected to 'Ethernet', yet I do not see the 'Manage connections' link.
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What can I do to fix this?</p>
<p>I tried the following:</p>
<p>Device Manager</p>
<p>Manually uninstalled the Network adapters in the Device Manager and then "Scan for hardware changes" to reinstall them.</p>
<p>Open Regedit as Administrator</p>
<p>Deleting the Config value in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Network</p>
<p>Opened the Network Adapter Settings to display the TCP/IP Settings, clicked OK, which created a new 'Config' entry</p>
<p>Restarted my PC. Opened powershell, ran get-netconnectionprofile but still no luck.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Thank you. I took a look at my registry, and went to "<strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\Profiles</strong></p>
<p>There are 5 networks listed, and 3 of them are set to private, and the other two are public. I have changed them all to private. I just need to reboot.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Will this create a new network profile?</p>
<p>Remember, I ran <strong>get-netconnectionprofile</strong>, and it returned nothing.</p>

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick response, but this does not help. The link you provided is for Windows 10 wireless.
</p>
<p>I need assistance for Windows 8.1.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I do not need help changing a profile from Public to Private. My issue is, I do not have a network profile, Even if these were the correct steps, they do not help.&nbsp; Please read my original issue, and you will see I do not have a network profile, or it's
 corrupt, since the get-netconnectionprofile, returns nothing.&nbsp; I am stuck with no way to change the profile at this time.</p>

    <title>Lost view of ALL tiles in window 10 plus menu and notification button - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maureenblack-64  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost view of ALL tiles in window 10 plus menu and notification button not working</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">After cleaning both keyboards today and working on the computer later on tonight....I noticed the "Notification menu" on the taskbar can not be used either regular or by right clicking.&nbsp; I also have the same problem with the "MENU"
 button and can only use a "right click" to open certain features....not the normal side apps displayed on Windows 10.&nbsp; It appears more like windows 8.1.&nbsp; I cannot figure out why I am not able to change the normal function of these keys back to what it is supposed
 to be&nbsp;for Windows 10. I've tried to restart it 2 - 3 times, but the notification icon, plus the menu icon is not working as it is supposed to.&nbsp; All tiles are not visible at all. &nbsp;I know there is a way to revert it back to the tile feature, but I am not able
 to locate&nbsp;where applicable in the settings.&nbsp; All settings are set normally to reflect windows 10 at this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the notification icon is on (but it is not functioning as the menu button.)&nbsp; The notification button is displaying solid (meaning there are possible
 messages waiting for attention) and the "quiet hours" feature is also turned off.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">If anyone can help with this problem, I'd truly appreciate it.&nbsp; Looking forward to a response on how to return windows 10 to it's proper functioning capabilities and features.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;hi Pawan:&nbsp; Thank you so very much for all your information and links after I sent my message concerning problems with notification and menu buttons.&nbsp; I will keep all the info you gathered for future reference, but at the last moment I decided to run "restore"
 and thankfully it rectified the problem I was having.&nbsp; I do not know what caused it, but it is now running as it did at the restore point I chose in late December.&nbsp; As usual, nothing was lost, but only my normal windows 10 features&nbsp;returned as they should
 be.&nbsp; I should have thought of that later, but I can't thank you enough for sending me those instructions.&nbsp; Thank you again for your expertise.</p>

<h2>            Entry in programs list won&#39;t uninstall, can&#39;t find the .msi</h2>
                    I used CCleaner to try and delete the entry, it said 'Cannot delete MSI installer'. The program is Apple Software Update.

I was 'denied from access' to the Windows Activation program. If I cannot re-explore my registration, how can I regain access to windows activation?<br />
Please answer as quickly as possible - I am losing from product performance every single second here.<br />

<div>Words from Noel D Paton:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Unfortunately, the error message here is rather unspecific, but it usually means that the a re connection problems between the PC and the validation components.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'd first try manually validating Windows at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate</a>&nbsp;and see what happens - if it passes, then you'll be offered MSE and IE9. If it fails, go to the Diagnostics
 site, and see if it recommends actions....&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/diag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com/genuine/diag</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>when you've done that, run another MGADiag report, and post it in your response.</div>
