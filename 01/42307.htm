<h2>            DirectX 11 Error&#58; Minecraft Story Mode - Intel Graphics Card</h2>
                    <p>I recently downloaded Minecraft Story Mode from the App Store for my daughter. When I go to launch it I get an Error Message, that says DirectX 11 Hardware is required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Her laptop has an Intel(R) HD Graphics 3000. Based on what I have read that Intel GPU can only run up to DX10, so despite having DX11 on my computer the game can't be played.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to get this to work or am I just out of $4.99?</p>

            <p>Your HD3000 does not support DX11. This is a hardware limitation.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(From Telltale games)</p>
<p><em>PC Minimum System Requirements</em><br />
<em>- Video Card: ATI or NVidia card w/ 512 MB RAM</em><br />
<em>- DirectX<strong>®:</strong> Direct X 11</em> -( Note that this means you need Win7 or higher as well as a DX 11 capable

<p>graphics processor. )</p>
<p><em>- Sound: Direct X 11 sound device </em>- </p>
<p>(The integrated audio or sound card also needs to be capable of using DX11. If your systems audio is
</p>
<p>DX11 capable this may be why your Win10 is reporting DX11)</p>

<p>
</p><p>(Interesting distinction - Driver vs the graphics processor. So even an HD4000 or higher that is capable

<p>
</p><p>- Laptops are also less likely to have Win10 specific drivers available from the mfg of the machine, which makes</p>
<p>them only borderline capable with Win10. Particularly regarding gaming graphics.</p>

<p>I'm not sure of what you're trying to do or where you got the idea that you needed wuau.adm but here are some things for you to consider:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Vista and newer versions of Windows use *.admx files rather than *.adm files</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Windows 7 does not have wuau.admx (or wuau.admx).&nbsp; It does, however, have multiple copies of WindowsUpdate.admx scattered among various folders.&nbsp; The copy in use probably is the one in C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; On the other hand, you probably don't need to worry about using WindowsUpdate.admx at all.&nbsp; If you start the Group Policy Editor and navigate to Local Policy &gt; Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Windows Update, you
 should find a whole bunch of polices already there (there's also a subset of these under User Configuration):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf5aaa48-ea41-4b2b-9a4e-53bcc265e7ec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf5aaa48-ea41-4b2b-9a4e-53bcc265e7ec" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; If, for some obscure reason, you don't have those policies and think that they will be included in WindowsUpdate.admx, you can download all of the *.admx files from
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6243" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6243</a>&nbsp; Depending on what it is that you're wanting to do, you may also need to download Remote Server Administration Tools (RSAT), as noted in the "System Requirements" on that page.</p>

<p>I was trying to change Windows Update schedule and usually i'm able to do so by going to gpedit.msc but none of the options would show there. I was able to do what i needed to via registry method explained in following link same link which explains about
 doing same thing via local group policy, but this won't show me regular options that i usually see in local group policy to change Windows Update settings. And same link also talks about adding "Wuau.adm" from "C"\Windows\inf", which i couldn't find &amp; never
 had to do before.</p>

<p>There is no wuau.adm policy template in Windows 7 and that article does not apply to Windows 7 (not listed in the Applies to section).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a wuau.adm in Windows XP:</p>

<p>But i remember one time i had to change Windows Update settings on Windows 7 Professional system i was able to do so going to local group policy, however, when i went to do same thing for this particular user. There was no options for me to change Windows
 Update settings in local group policy. So i was wondering if i had to install "<span>wuau.adm" on this particular machine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>That being said. I was able to follow registry method to change Windows Update settings, but i found it rather finicky, which is why i was digging into&nbsp;</span>"<span>wuau.adm" thing.
 Thanks for your explanations (y).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Though, still wondering why one Windows 7 Pro machine had all the settings i could use in local group policy to change Windows Update settings and not the other one?</p>

<p>We know Group Policy editor is only available for Windows Pro, Ultimate, Enterprise editions but all the same policies can be adjusted through the registry on all Windows editions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are more adjustments available in GPE and since they are in the Computer Configuration and not the User Configuration those adjustments should apply to all users.&nbsp; In the User Configuration section there are only three settings available for adjustment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are the Windows Update settings you want to change that you think you need to use Group Policy instead of changing them from Control Panel?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.&nbsp; Back in the good old days of XP a common issue with GPE was not being ale to locate sections in the GPE and the problem was that some GPE templates were not installed as part of GPE so those templates had to be added to the snap-in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For that issue for Windows XP I would offer these instructions and there is your wuau template:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only applies to Windows XP:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In Group Policy Editor, right click Administrative Templates, Add/Remove Templates.<br />
<br />
Usually, you would see these templates:<br />
<br />
conf<br />
inetres<br />
system<br />
wmplayer<br />
<strong>wuau</strong><br />
<br />
If some are missing, add them as follows:<br />
<br />
Click Add and it will open a folder where you can Add the missing components to match the usually in there list (the 5 listed above),&nbsp; or add enough to match the list seen on some system that is working properly.<br />
<br />
Reboot to make sure the changes stick.<br />

                    I am using Windows Vista on an Everex NC1510 notebook.&nbsp; When I try to boot it up I get a black screen titled "Windows Resume Loader".&nbsp; When I highlight "Continue with system resume" and press the Enter key to choose this option, nothing happens.&nbsp; The computer
 continues to be stuck on this screen.&nbsp; I bought the computer new but it is out of warranty.&nbsp; I have misplaced the Windows restore disk (Actually I don't recall ever having one).&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you!

<p>Below is the info on Recovery Media, as you say you do not have a Vista Disk.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista Recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer to put it back
 to Factory Settings</span></span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span><span><br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

<p>Hey folks. How do you reply to posts? I have been clicking on "reply", but the word "reply" disappears and i can't reply<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-12.gif" />! There have been some great posts on this forum, but I have been
 un-able to reply to them......</p>
<p>Any way. Don't even try to play COD4. Since they've been banning so many PUKES from WAW, they have all drifted to COD4, like rats jumping a sinking ship,&nbsp;and now it is so pathetic, it's almost laughable. I've tried to play tonight (10:45 PM, CST) on my son's
 account and now I am done!!!!! The only account out of 4 we have kept GOLD because of all the crap. It ends in August and M$ can kiss my white hairy posterior!!!! This is so ridiculous...</p>
<p>I've been talking to M$ support the last week and they are just a bunch of BS. This game will NEVER be fixed and it's time I realized it. Come on, people on roofs, people under maps.&nbsp; This was my last time. Let the cheaters, scumbags and PUKES have the entire
 God/Blessed Xbox Live........</p>

<p>Hey, I can reply. Here's the deal, as I have explained in many of my posts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have, in the past, paid for a service known as Xbox Live, (3 silvers, 1 Gold). I have played other games on-line, but never was satisfied, only with COD4. Besides me, there is an entire community that believes this WAS the best on-line game around. Now,
 COD4 is SOOOO messed up, why should I give M$ my money? I am so sick and tired. It is even worse then it was 2 days ago! All the thrash is finding it's way to COD4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks for suggesting I change games, but that ain't gonna happen. I just quit entirely. I will still play off-line, still buy USED games and wait &nbsp;(un)patiently for M$ to pull their head out of their butts. I buy used games, because I, like many others,
 can't see shelling out the outrageous prices for a game we expect to be able to play on-line and are unable to.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;No more blame on the developers. M$ can do more then is being done. If I can't play on a service that WE all pay for, then I am done. It's that simple........</p>

<p>[/quote]<span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)">Actually, all the blame on the devs. MS is doing all they possibly can by banning modders but they cannot rewrite the code for the games. Only the devs can do that. It is the developers job to make sure their own game
 is secure and if they fail to do that, it is no one else's fault but their own.</span></p>

 and PM XBLPET for you and tell them to focus entirely on Cod4. We'll see how that works out.<br />

<p>There's an old saying, "You can't argue with an idiot". Take your 5 cul power and PM all you want. I think you have lost focus on ALL the posts myself and other community members have made. WE all understand there are other games out there that need "patrolled".
 Since this is the COD4 forum, we are just stating our frustrations over the "broken" state of OUR favorite game. You should really scurry back to the other forums. I don't see where you are helping anyone here with your negative attitude.</p>
And since you are going to PM someone, I expect to see my posts deleted or me possibly being banned from the forums. So, to other posters, in case I am un-able to post, keep posting your frustrations over this game, since this is the ONLY place we are allowed
 to.........

<h2>            Mouse pointer stuck in full screen mode but works for rollovers and clicking buttons</h2>
                    <p>Using win7 x64, when I enter full screen mode of&nbsp;a game (wow)&nbsp;I lose the use of mouse pointer (its icon is stuck, but I can gess it works from rollovers and clicking any button).</p>
<p>Also, if I use another game with win7 x64 (flight simulator) everything works. So, without blaming win7 per se, I suspect a problem of compatibility between the client of the game, and also the video card driver.</p>
<p>Since everything is updated, my only hope is that you can suggest something, mouse settings, tweaks, whatever that could help as workaround. Thanks a lot, ricardo</p>

<h2>            Sidewinder X6 keyboard flashes then stops working</h2>
                    
<p>I got a Sidewinder x6 keyboard a few weeks ago.&nbsp; I have pretty much since i got it had a recurring problem where all of the keys on the keyboard will flash a few times and then the keyboard will stop working altogether.&nbsp; I then have to unplug the keyboard
 from its USB slot and plug it back in again and it will work again.&nbsp; However this can repeat anything from immediately to a few hours later again.</p>
<p>I am using Vista 64 bit home premium OS and driver version 7.0.258.0</p>
<p>Is this a hardware problem with the keyboard or a software issue?&nbsp; I have tried different usb ports and have the same problem</p>

<p><span>Hi Patbadger,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We can’t say for sure if it’s a hardware issue or a software issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Try the product on a different computer</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To help you determine whether the problem is because of your computer or the device, try the keyboard on a different computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the device works on another computer, the device is working correctly. So the problem points to software issues.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Download and install the latest keyboard software</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Test by installing the latest driver for your keyboard to avoid any driver conflict. See if that resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To download the latest drivers for the keyboard that you are using, visit the following Microsoft hardware Web site:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/download/DownloadResult.aspx?category=MK&amp;type=Keyboard&amp;name=AGB-00001&amp;os=WVista_64&amp;lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/download/DownloadResult.aspx?category=MK&amp;type=Keyboard&amp;name=AGB-00001&amp;os=WVista_64&amp;lang=en</span></a></span></p>

<div>I'm in Australia and I have an Acer Aspire One Happy with Windows 7 starter (purchased 6 months ago), which refused to progress past the welcome screen after entering my password. I ended up pressing Alt+f10 at startup and going to restore factory settings
 and retain user data. I am now stuck in a loop where it has completed backup of files and update, and has 'Setup is starting services'. But a window keeps popping up saying "windows could not complete the installation. to install windows on the computer. restart
 the installation". Every time I restart it goes to this error. Even if I go to safe mode it goes to this. Help!&nbsp;</div>

            <p>How to reinstall Windows 7 Starter. </p>
<p>Tools you will need for this task:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="http://code.kliu.org/misc/winisoutils/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">eicfg_removal_utility.zip</a></strong> – is a simple tool that will remove the ei.cfg from any Windows ISO disc image, thereby converting the image into a “universal disc” that will prompt the user
 to select an edition during setup. It’s a free download <strong><a href="http://code.kliu.org/misc/winisoutils/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>
</li><li><strong>Genuine Retail Windows 7 32 bit Installation DVD – </strong>this will be used to reinstall Windows 7 Starter 32 bit, any retail edition of Windows 7 32 bit will do, this includes Home Premium, Professional or Ultimate, doesn’t matter if its upgrade
 or full version. You cannot use a 64 bit DVD because there is no 64 bit version of Windows 7 Starter. You will need to create an image of the disc, please refer to our Notebooks.com tutorial about how to create a digital backup of your software
<strong>here</strong> </li></ul>
<p>After you have created the image of the Windows 7 32 bit DVD, we will edit the image and remove the ei.cfg file so we can reveal all editions of Windows 7 during the installation and select Windows 7 Starter. Lets take a look at doing it step by step.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/image.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2fimage_thumb.png%3fw%3d560%26amp%3bh%3d240" /></a></p>
<p>After downloading the eicfg removal utility, you need to extract it, since its in a .zip file. Just right click it and click Extract All.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/image1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2fimage_thumb1.png%3fw%3d564%26amp%3bh%3d78" /></a></p>
<p>Double click the <strong>eicfg_remover.exe </strong>file to launch it.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/reinstall-starter-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2freinstall-starter-1_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d546%26amp%3bh%3d390" /></a></p>
<p>Browse to where the Windows 7 Image (.ISO file) is stored, select it and click
<strong>Open. </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/reinstall-starter-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2freinstall-starter-2_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d308%26amp%3bh%3d258" /></a></p>
<p>That’s it! the ei.cfg file is now removed. The next step now is to reinstall Windows 7 Starter. Because most Netbooks do not include a DVD drive, you will have to use a tool such as the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool (<a href="http://store.microsoft.com/Help/ISO-Tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.microsoft.com/Help/ISO-Tool</a>)
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/reinstall-starter-3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2freinstall-starter-3_thumb.png%3fw%3d522%26amp%3bh%3d276" /></a></p>
<p>This simple tool will help you convert the same image file you just created to a USB thumb drive. For installation purposes, you should get a thumb drive that’s at least 4 GBs in size to store the installation files. Browse to where the Windows
 7 Image is stored, open it. </p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/reinstall-starter-3b.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2freinstall-starter-3b_thumb.png%3fw%3d500%26amp%3bh%3d266" /></a></p>
<p>Select the USB device where you want to have the backup stored to for installation.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/reinstall-starter-3c.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2freinstall-starter-3c_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d500%26amp%3bh%3d250" /></a></p>
<p>Once the USB device has been identified, click the <strong>Begin copying
</strong>button.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/reinstall-starter-3d.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2freinstall-starter-3d_thumb.png%3fw%3d487%26amp%3bh%3d263" /></a></p>
<p>And that’s it, the next step now is to boot your Netbook from the thumb drive, make sure the thumb drive you will be installing Windows 7 from is plugged into the USB port. This might vary by manufacturer, but the usual one to try is F12, start
 your Netbook and press F12 repeatedly until a screen is displayed giving you the option to boot from a USB Memory device, select that and press
<strong>Enter </strong>on your keyboard. The screen should look something like the following:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/reinstall-starter-4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2freinstall-starter-4_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d525%26amp%3bh%3d386" /></a></p>
<p><em>BIOS boot screen</em></p>
<p>Check out our Notebooks.com article: <a href="http://notebooks.com/2011/05/05/how-to-load-bios-and-change-boot-configuration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>How To Load BIOS and Change Boot Configuration</strong></a></p>
<p>Windows 7 will boot as it normally does into the setup environment, the only difference this time is, you will be given a choice to select the edition of Windows 7 you want to reinstall.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/reinstall-starter-5.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f05%2freinstall-starter-5_thumb.png%3fw%3d566%26amp%3bh%3d426" /></a></p>
<p>Select Windows 7 Starter and proceed with the installation as normal. I suggest that you create a backup once the installation is complete.
</p>
<p><strong>One thing to note, you will need a 32 bit Windows 7 installation media to do this, any edition of Windows 7 such as Home Premium, Professional or Ultimate will do. If you can find a disc, you can download a copy from the following link
 and use that to create the all in one disc:</strong></p>

<h2>            Internet sharing doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    Hi guys;<br />
I was able to share my internet via hotspot normally before, then out of no where it stopped working! To be precise, I'm still able to create and join a hotspot normally. However, once I try to change the internet sharing settings of the&nbsp;of the active network
 and choose the created hotspot, the window freezes! <br />
I tried to maneuver this by using a virtual router (Zapya), but I still face the same problem; it creates a hotspot, then when I choose to share the internet it tells me it is trying to connect and that's it!<br />
<br />
I wonder if this is caused by a windows update! If so, then how can I fix it?<br />
<br />
Also, my Avast antivirus shows me that my device is not configured correctly (Salma-PC.mshome.net). Does this have anything to do with this problem? If so, how can I get it fixed?
<br />
<br />
Please help!

            Thank you very much for your reply. <br />
Unfortunately non of these solutions worked. <br />
The troubleshooter shows two errors: <br />
1) <strong>DHCP is not enabled</strong> <strong>for "Local Area Connection*13"</strong>; which is the name of the created hotspot, and
<br />
2) <strong>"Local Area Connection*13" doesn't have a valid IP configuration</strong>.
<br />
Both issues were not fixed. Any other suggestions?<br />

This is the method I usually follow to share the internet, and it was perfectly working before the last windows update.
<br />
I have tried it again, and again the window shown in the post in <strong>Step 9</strong> froze the sooner I clicked OK (even after I deleted the adapters and restarted the device as you have suggested yesterday!). Actually this was the reason why I tried to
 use an app to open a virtual hotspot in the first place (didn't work either!).<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? :(

            One last thing, when the window freezes it shows me an error message saying that
<strong>C</strong><strong>OM Surrogate has Stopped Working</strong>. During my search in the web I found this problem is related to the
<strong>dllhost.exe </strong>process, but I don't know what to do with this piece of information, or whether it is useful or not. I just felt it is worth the mention.

            Still not working I'm afraid. <br />
Actually I installed this antivirus only after I couldn't share the internet neither via the hotspot created using CMD Prompt nor via Zapya.
<br />
On contrary, Avast was able to detect the error saying the <strong>Device is not configured correctly (Salma-PC.mshome.net)</strong>. But I'm afraid I'm not able to solve this error.
<br />
I really appreciate your dedication. Thank you so much for helping me out.<br />

<h2>            Downgrading from Windows 10 Pro to Windows 10 Home without clean install</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started with windows 10 home, got it free from when they first released it so I don't remember having a activation code with it (my laptop came with windows 8.1 originally). I recently mistakenly purchased windows 10 pro because I thought it would allow
 me to encrypt my laptop, but it turns out my laptop is too old (the TPM modules are version 1.0 whereas I need version 1.2 for BitLocker and I cant change them out since they are on the motherboard). So, I got a refund for my online purchase of windows 10
 pro (Don't want to waste $99 for nothing lol). I got the refund successfully, but now my computer shows that I have an inactive version of windows 10 pro, and wants me to activate it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me return my computer to windows 10 home without having to do a clean install and losing all my files? '</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            Hello DREWSKI01999<br /><br />I am an Independent Advisor here to help<br /><br />When you first activated Windows 10 Home your PC would have been assigned a digital license key. This will automatically activate Windows 10 Home on the same PC when it connects to the Internet.<br /><br />As for downgrading without a clean install, I don't believe that there is a way to do this.

            You shouldn't need to do anything with it per se<br />
<br />
To my knowledge there is no way to downgrade from Windows 10 Pro to Windows 10 home without doing a clean install.<br />
<br />
Once you perform a clean install of Windows 10 Home, windows should automatically activate as long as you have an Internet connection because Microsoft servers have stored information pertaining to the motherboard on your computer. This allows the Microsoft
 servers to recognize that your computer has a digital license key and automatically activate windows for you. If for some reason it asks you to enter a product key enter the key that you have

<p>Bear in mind that you can save your files, but saving *programs* is useless. With very rare exceptions they won't work if you try to reinstall them after the clean installation of Windows. Programs have to also be reinstalled from their original media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other point: you say "I guess Ill just save my files on a flashdrive."&nbsp;&nbsp; That suggest that you don't do regular backups of your data. If you don't, you've been playing with fire.&nbsp;<span><span>Almost everyone should be backing up to external media
 regularly. It is always possible that a hard drive crash, user error, nearby lightning strike, virus attack, even theft of the computer, can cause the loss of everything on your drive. As has often been said, it's not a matter of whether you will have such
 a problem, but when.</span></span> </p>

<h3> shemsargent  say:</h3>
<h2>            You can&#39;t install Windows 10 because your processor doesn&#39;t support NX</h2>
                    I have a Dell Optiplex 380 with Windows 7 Ultimate installed. Windows 10 setup returns the message "You can't install Windows 10 because your processor doesn't support NX".<br />
<br />
SysInternals CoreInfo output follows and shows that NX is supported by this processor. I updated the system to the most recent BIOS. I checked to make sure NX is enabled in BIOS (it is called XD on this system). Does anyone have any ideas on what might be wrong
 here?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<h2>            external hdd not showing in my computer and turned into a GPT protective partition</h2>
                    hi marilyn. i have a hdd that is working fine until it was hooked up on a mac os x laptop and wasnt able to access it. so i tried it on my hp windows vista home premium laptop and the autoplay didnt start. its not in 'my compter' but i can surely see it
 in device manager and safely remove device. i learned that i can try to rename the location or drive name, but i cannot. its not giving me the option to change it. what i noticed, is that it became a GPT protective partition from a normal FAT. i made a research
 and was able to read an article that windows vista can read, write GPT partition, but it is not in my case. is data recovery still possible? if yes, what can do to save the files from my hdd??

            Hello creand,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Thank you for using Microsoft Windows Vista Forums.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;What type of external HDD is this? (make/model)&nbsp; When you have the device connected to your computer using Vista Home Premium are you able to view this device in Explore?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Right-click Start and select Explore-&gt; Verify if device was assigned a drive (E)(F)(G).&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can view the device are you able to open files?&nbsp; Was this device working properly with Vista computer prior to connecting with Mac OS?&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Please let us know status.&nbsp; Thanks!

<h2>            Unable to install windows 10, error codes, 80240FFF, 8024000c, 80070005, tried everything posted, no help</h2>
                    I cannot install windows 10, I keep getting errors. I cannot even install it from a DVD or USB. This is for update only. I probably could install it if I clean installed it but then it would not activate. I did the regedit trick of installing "AllowOSUpgrade"
 dword. I reset all of the permissions. I clean booted the computer many times, ran Windows Update Diagnostic until I was blue in the face. Nothing helps.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. I understand the inconvenience you faced. I will certainly help you with this. Try performing below given methods and then try performing the upgrade and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><span>Disable Antivirus and security-related products, if you have any Antivirus installed for (Free) uninstall it, if not then disable the Antivirus, try again to update and check if issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software
 and\or troubleshoot any pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to malware attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now, I suggest you to reset Windows Update component manually. Kindly follow the below given steps.</span></p>

            Parth P Patel thank you for your reply. I tried everything you said except I could not rename catroot2 because the folder or a file in it is in use by another program. I clean booted the computer before I did this. I also reset the permissions, turned
 off the firewall. None of this works, I do not know how to stop whatever program is using catroot2 or turn it off so that I can rename it. Also I would like to say that MediaCreationTool will not run past just starting up and asking me if it can change my
 computer then nothing. either 32 or 64 bit. I am using a 64bit OS. Every time I run Windows Update Diagnostics, it claims to fix the same problems every time. I would think if it was fixed it would stay fixed. I am about to loose my mind on this update.

<h2>            Some of these characters can&#39;t appear in product key</h2>
                    <p>Heya All</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I bought a laptop a couple of years ago, and i just reinstalled windows, and now when i try to type in my old product key it says 'some of these characters can't appear in product key'. I'm not paying for another copy of windows I will change to mac instead.
 Either solve this, give me a copy of windows or I'm out forever. I will not go to microsoft store to re-install what I paid for already.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a peer-to-peer volunteer-based public international forum.&nbsp; Not only does your 'threat' show a lower maturity level than one would hope anyone who would come to such a place and ask strangers for assistance would have (decorum and respectfulness)
 - but no one here really cares if you utilize a MacOS-based, *nix-based, Chrome-based, Windows-based or whatever computer...&nbsp; *shrug*</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the message tells me is that you possibly read the key incorrectly while typing it in or typed it incorrectly.&nbsp; You may want someone else to read it to you.&nbsp; (Is it a Windows 10 Product key that you are entering when installing Windows 10 or...?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you posted HERE (Windows 10) and you did not explicitly state what operating system came with the laptop in question (although it could very well be Windows 10) - it is likely you don't NEED to enter a product key at all and could just use the DIGITAL
 LICENSE associated with your computer and it will activate easily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start by reading here:</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-re-install-windows-10-without-a-product-key/523e6231-88bf-4764-8235-412f2bfc257e">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-re-install-windows-10-without-a-product-key/523e6231-88bf-4764-8235-412f2bfc257e</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI - if you typed any of these characters:</p>
<p>
</p><p>015 AEIOU LNSZ</p>
<p>
</p><p>You read it wrong/typed it wrong.</p>

Microsoft annouced it was ending support</a> for its suite of lifestyle apps, Windows Essentials. The last version launched in 2012 with the release of Windows 8. Since then, the software has been in maintenance mode. Even though the software firm promised
 to remove the software by January 10, 2017, its still available for download. I just checked and the following link still works:

<h2>            Microsofts system</h2>
                    <p>I have been playing overwatch lately, and Recently I have gotten into a game with a female who did not like the character I chose to play. In response to that, she decided to have people report me every single day, and Now i have an "Avoid me" reputation for doing absolutely nothing but simply play a game. Now I cannot speak to anyone in gamechat, therefor defeating the purpose of even trying to play the game, because now i get placed with actual throwers,&nbsp;due to the fact that microsoft does not look into the person getting reported, and the person doing the reports, and pretty much just taking it with he said, she said, terms. How can I quickly get my rep back up before my SR starts to drop?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Nothing that output that really pinpoints the problem.<br />
<br />
Use ALL the&nbsp;methods below and in the next message. Update the BIOS, chipset drivers, and<br />
the major on-board and separate&nbsp;major device drivers and check the memory thoroughly.<br />
After&nbsp;ALL those if&nbsp;needed run DriverVerifier to see if it can indicate a CAUSE.&nbsp;<br />

Important Information If You Have Received a STOP Code </p>
<p><br />
If you have received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call
 the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support.
<br />
<br />
To find contact information for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p><br />
The following actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

            <p>Fact is that i searched for a solution before posting here and anyone who was talking about this, on windows 7 and 8, said that in the pen and touch settings menu there was an option to disable the right click function. So it was an issue of the OS and not
 of the tablet/pen/drivers.</p>
<p>I'll go ask wacom community anyway, thanks :)</p>

<p>The infamous press-and-hold right click that destroys any drawing experience with a Wacom tablet is back. But this time (after upgrading to windows 10) I cannot find the option to disable it. Can anyone help me?</p>
<p>Thank you :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ok heres what to do, first, check for updates on the tablet in the Wacom desktop center. then, go into control panel/hardware and sound and where you see pen and touch, click on "Turn flicks on and off", that will bring up a window where a Pen Options tab
 will be on top, click on that tab and you should be able to turn hold to right click off from there.</p>

            <p>This sounds similar to a problem I experience which is cured by going to <strong>
<em>Wacom Preferences / Pen</em></strong> / and click on <em><strong>Mapping</strong></em> under
<em><strong>Pen Mode</strong> </em>and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">un tick</span>
<em><strong>Use Windows Ink.</strong></em></p>
<p>Updates for Win 10 frequently re ticks this and also remove any non default settings of pad or pen.</p>
