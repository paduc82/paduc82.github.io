<h2>            Need help with &#34;D3D&#34; error message</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 10 Pro, all of a sudden I got an error message when trying to launch one of my programs that worked perfectly earlier in the day: "The D3D device has a non-zero reference count, meaning some objects were not released." And then a second message:
 "Failed creating Direct3D device objects." </p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing had changed in my computer setup (Dell desktop, current with all Windows updates, graphics drivers, antivirus updates, etc.), except that earlier in the day Outlook (Office 365) locked up a couple of times. The program that's giving me the error
 message is called SegPlay PC, a color-by-numbers program. I've tried everything I can think of, short of resetting the PC (I'm hoping not to lose all my apps, settings, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me?</p>

            <p>I made no changes to the PC prior to this issue; the only thing that happened is that Outlook locked up a couple of times earlier in the day, requiring me to close it and relaunch it. And yes, I have the most recent version of the program that's yielding
 the D3D error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the problematic program several times and nothing's worked. And now it's giving me an additional error message: "Could not find required media. Ensure that the DirectX SDK is correctly installed."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When that message first popped up, I went to the Microsoft website and found the DirectX SDK, which I then downloaded and installed. No difference.</p>

<p>I've done all of the above and nothing has worked. Furthermore, when I posted my original question last year, it was regarding my previous computer. Since then I've bought a new computer and installed the problematic program. It worked for a while, until
 one day all of a sudden I got that same error message ("The D3D device has a non-zero reference count..." etc.) and the program has not worked since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is a Dell XPS 8920, purchased in May 2017. A couple of days ago I spent about 90 minutes on the phone with a Dell technician who tried many different things to solve this problem, including a clean reinstall of my video driver. Nothing worked
 for him either, and he finally concluded the only thing I could do was wait for the program vendor to introduce a new version of the program.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked with the vendor, and they insist they've had no other similar complaints from people running Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help??</p>

<h2>            suspected virus in the temp folder</h2>
                    
<p>I could see some files sitting in there in the temp file, I suspect this may be virus, I am trying to delete the file &amp; folder, it says i don't have authority to do that. I am logged in as administrator. when I see the security it says it has special permission.
 I am not sure this used by windows or some virus. I am getting messages saying something is trying to access allow or cancel message often. can someone suggest me whether this is a problem or something related to system activity is running all the time? i
 cleaned up al temp files before wondering what is this. The folder name is says hsperfdata_HOME-PC$. My compute name is Home-PC, the file that is sitting inside is some numeric name and its an .exe file that is why I am worried. Thanks for any help suggestion.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update Continues to Fail with error code 0x800f081f</h2>
                    <p><span>Original title: </span>Windows Update Continues to Fail. </p>
<p><span>I continue to run into issues performing updates on a Windows 8.1 platform.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Update KB30375576 failed and I ran the troubleshooter, which found and fixed the following problems as reported once completed:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Some security settings are missing or have been changed ‚Äì Fixed.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Server registration is missing or corrupt ‚Äì Fixed.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Windows Updater error 0x800Fo1F (2015-05-02-T-06_40_39A) ‚Äì Fixed.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Problems installing recent updates ‚Äì Fixed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Afterwards I tried just installing only one update at a time and tried installing KB30375576 once again but this second run failed also with the following Failed Error Code: 80246010. Tried installing once again by just clicking on the ‚ÄúTry Again‚Äù
 option and this third time for this update was the charm and the installation was finally successful.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once this last update was successful, I selected another 1 update to download and install, which was KB3049508. The first time, the down loaded seem to be stuck at the progress of 5% for a 30+ minutes, then it failed and error code 80073712 was reported.
 Then I ran the troubleshooter and it fixed the following two problems reported:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Windows Update error 0x800F081F (2015-05-02-T-09_11_24A).</span></p>
<p><span>2. Problems installing recent updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Upon a retry of downloading and installing KB3049508 the status progression bar gets to about 90% complete before another error occurs, code: 80073712.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>At the command prompt As Administrator I typed the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Allowed this to run to a successful completion then type the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This failed with the error code: 0x800f081f</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The dism.log had the following file information that I showing here only up to when the lines printed turns into Chinese language for the rest of the file:</span></p>

To configure the CCTV cameras with the home network or the computer you will&nbsp;need to install and configure the software and drivers provided by the manufacturer of the CCTV cameras.

If you do not know how to configure and install the CCTV cameras in Windows 7,&nbsp;you may&nbsp;contact the manufacturer.<br />

<h2>            Pictures rotating automatically to landscape with no option to change orientation</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really getting fed up with windows 10. It always seems to think it knows what you want better than you do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently having issues with photos. Whenever I open a Picture in portrait orientation, the programme automatically turns it to landscape. If I try to change it back it either returns it to landscape or turns it upside-down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this issue or know how to resolve it?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, I¬¥m Douglas M. 
<br />
<br />I would like to help you, It seems like Canon Zoom browser program is not saving the rotated pictures.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />I would suggest you rotate the picture using windows photo viewer and then try to upload the pictures and check if that helps.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Refer the below link: Rotate a picture using Windows Photo Viewer:<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Rotate-a-picture-using-Windows-Photo-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Rot...</a>

    <title>All Windows Advance recovery tool fail to recover Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rory smash  say:</h3>
<h2>            All Windows Advance recovery tool fail to recover Windows 10</h2>
                    The only account on an upgraded Windows 8 Dell Laptop is the user account with Administrator rights. When attempting to log in it give the message An incorrect parameter and fails to log in. When I attempt to return to a save point, the restore to a saved
 point fails with 80070571. When I attempt to start in safe mode, the account says incorrect password, yet I correctly entered the same password to be able to restart the PC in advance tools.&nbsp; When I attempt to return to a pervious build, it fails also. I have
 no recovery disk. If I reset the PC it gets 53% in and fails to recover the PC. I am completely stuck. How can I fix Windows 10 so I can log in and get that data on the PC, because rebuilding the PC will loss all data? Any help is appreciated, as all built
 in methods fail and there is no other account on the upgraded Windows 8 laptop. And Windows 10 has been running fine all year until this past week,. Thanks!

            <p>I am unable to log into a local account. There is only the Microsoft user account. If I go into Safe Mode, even with the network (which doesn't seem to be working as the network shows as down), I get invalid password, even though that password works to access
 the user account for selecting to go into safe mode. The only account on the machine is the Microsoft user account. If I had another account, I'd try to access that and then go into administrator mode on the command line and see if the sfc /scannow fixes it.
 Or I would disable Symantec and run the restore to last saved point for the user account. As it is, I have no login at all and the advanced features all fail. I read that I might be able to access the machine hard drive if I start an install, cancel it and
 then set up to boot as a command line and then create a local account. Anyway, that is my next try tomorrow. Thanks!</p>

    <title>Strict NAT Type on NETGEAR Router - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael butler_997  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strict NAT Type on NETGEAR Router</h2>
                    
<p>My console shows I have a strict NAT type on the network connection page in between network and internet. The problem lies in my router which is a NETGEAR Router WNR1000v3. I have tried to port forward my xbox, set a default dmz server, open UPNP, open the
 NAT filtering option, but all have seemed to fail. I have fully reset my router as well, but have had no luck fixing this strict NAT. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!</p>

<p>This router is notorious for doing this. This has been answered already. View this: [View:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wt-kaIB0E6U] (external link-not Microsoft affiliated).</p>
<p>I know the video may be choppy, but it worked in my personal experience. I've got this documented somewhere in actual text format but i can't seem to find it. Try this and report back. If you need help, let me know. This is NOT an xbox issue from what you've
 described. I would, personally, stay away from this router as it has many issues.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>So the Zyxel is the issue (not the Netgear) you will need to bridge it and make further changes to the netgear to resolve this, follow these instructions here:-

</p><blockquote>Can I get Windows 10 for the Insider programme from a Vista PC now? If so how do I get the software and/or activation key
</blockquote>
<p>Vista cannot be upgraded to Windows 10 RTM as a free upgrade applies to Windows (7.1 and 8.1)</p>
<p>However as&nbsp;you are asking for the Insider preview then you can install a clean version of Windows 10. This will wipe out/erase all data on your hard drive so make sure you back everything up to a USB/DVD or standalone drive on USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download a copy of Windows 10 and <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Installing Windows 10 using the media creation tool">
<p>
</p><p>You will need you MSA (outlook.com, Hotmail.*, xbox.com, msn.com) login and password or create one before starting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically put the burnt ISO 10240 RTM DVD in drive and "Run as Administrator" DVD:\setup.exe, to install the 10240 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade will check you processor/BIOS/Ram/Drive for various things and hopefully say your system has passed. You may have to change your BIOS settings to pass this test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Leave the DVD in the drive and&nbsp;restart from&nbsp;ISO 10240 RTM DVD in drive by pressing space bar while booting. The upgrade starts:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>When asked to select partition. </p>
<p>Select&nbsp;Delete all partitions as Vista partition format is wrong for Windows 10.</p>
<p>Next create partition the full size of disk.</p>
<p>Format the&nbsp;partition and continue the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You all be asked for you&nbsp;product activation key, which you click SKIP until later&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You&nbsp;will need you Wi-Fi&nbsp;Wireless key to hand, to select&nbsp;the wireless router.</p>
<p>When the message check for updates occurs you can say "no - skip", because you will be using Technical Preview download later.</p>
<p>After the installation of Windows 10 has completed login with you MSA account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then go to <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_apps-insider_hub/what-happened-to-the-insider-hub-app/e2ddfd3c-e151-43cd-a71f-f088377048bc" title="What happened to the Insider Hub app?">
<p>Join and then Select FAST ring updates from the drop down box</p>
<p>Click the "Check for updates", then wait, sometimes up to 18 hours, but then build 10547 at least will download (2.6GB)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When received click "Restart now" and the new version will install in about 60 minutes including restarts. Forget about activation as Insider build 10547 is active until 16/July/2016.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just remember this is trial software and may not always work how you expect, then send some Windows Feedback!!.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In command prompt type "winver" to see expiry date</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't select Hyper-V as this has a problem and crashes the install of build 10547.</p>

<p>How many items are in your favourites folder that you really need to keep? Registry editing is not to be taken on for fun. It can have serious implications for the health of your computer. If you have 10 -20&nbsp;favourites to be recreated then recreate them.
 If you make a mistake creating a favourite it is easily rectified. The same cannot be said for registry editing. Sometimes you have to do it but you do not need to do it for a few favourites!</p>

            <em><strong>"&nbsp;I went into the folder, clicked on a link, and when the website opened I added it to the Favorites on my homepage.
</strong></em>
<p><em><strong>What do you think?"&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Walter, yes of course that will work also, that's the&nbsp;normal way of creating list of favorites, by adding it to your favorites while viewing the website you want to keep.</span></p>
<p><span>Which just means that you are recreating your old favorites again one by one and soon enough you'll have them all.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;I understand your hesitation of editing the registry since you've never done it before, some people are happy enough doing computing and never had to worry about the registry etc.</span></p>
<p><span>Editing the registry is really not that big a deal when you get used to it,&nbsp;I only&nbsp;had to back up a key I was editing only for the first few times and after that I didn't do any backup at all.</span></p>
<p><span>I&nbsp; would not have suggested&nbsp;you to edit a registry key/value that are crucial to the system and needed at bootup e.g.,
<strong>subsystems</strong> or <strong>winlogon</strong> keys. <br />
The values that I suggested you for editing are not crucial values under crucial keys, they are not needed at bootup. So if you happen to mess it up or change your mind all you have to do&nbsp;was to&nbsp;doubleclick on the backup saved on your desktop and all the changes
 that you made will revert back to default.<br />
<br />
You've chosen to recreate your favorites manually one by one and that is okay too. :)<br />
So cheers ...</span></p>
<p><span>Happy computing!</span></p>

                    <p>I am using Windows 8.1. In it, there is 100% disk usage whenever I run an antivirus scan, copy files from laptop to pen drive, or transfer files using homegroup. It completely slows down my laptop.</p>
<p>It does not happen in my other laptop having Windows 7. It never has 100% disk usage even during the scan.</p>

<p>Is the antivirus program responsible for all of the usage, or is it spread out among several programs causing the disk activity by competing against each other?&nbsp; Since the hard drive has a moving arm that literally has to move back and forth, more than one
 program using it, even a small amount, makes the computer performance slower, and you'll see this much worse if some of that disk activity is because of "paging", or putting things from memory to disk because there's not enough memory at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To see and answer both of these, just press Ctrl+Shift+Escape, and look on the Processes tab.&nbsp; Click the Disk heading and see which programs are using the disk.&nbsp; Here's mine right now.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran a virus scan and told PowerShell to move a bunch of files at the same time.&nbsp; Now in this case, my computer is still pretty snappy&nbsp;because I'm just typing in a browser, and that doesn't require using the disk.&nbsp; I'm not listening to music or have any
 actual files open, and it doesn't take much memory for me to type my reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my memory was up at 85%, my computer might begin to lag because then it has to start using the disk, but several programs are already using it, and the disk head can only move around so fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk "usage" is a funny thing.&nbsp; It can't be "full" like memory or CPU usage can be, but this value is estimated based on how much the disk is being used.&nbsp; How it's being used matters too.</p>

</p><p>I am using a Dell laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever there is a 100% disk usage, everything becomes slow but still responsive. When I use side scrolling or zooming using touch pad, it just hangs up for 3 or 4 seconds and then scrolls or zooms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But on my other HP laptop, even if there is 100% disk usage, there is no effect on its performance. Everything works well as if no scan is running.</p>

            <p>Hi Kapil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check the status since this could also be due to any third party software conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software
 conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: <em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If the behavior is same, disable the security software and check.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important: </strong><span><em>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</em></span></p>

</p><p>Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            <p>Being able to scroll doesn't require the disk unless you're very dangerously low on memory already.&nbsp; It's like a car, there's many parts that have to all work together to perform the best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, if it's stuttering and lagging when you scroll, and you're not very low on memory, then it's quite likely the CPU is the one causing the bottleneck (probably the deep-scanning of every file by the antivirus, rather than the actual disk activity itself).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For one example, you could right-click the process of the antivirus (on the details tab) and change the priority to low.&nbsp; Then no matter how aggressive the antivirus gets, it's still lower on priority than the stuff you're doing (scrolling, using the PC,
 whatever).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And again if your memory is &gt;80% used or so, that could also be a problem.&nbsp; Then Windows has to start taking things out of memory and putting them on the disk temporarily to make more memory available.&nbsp; The CPU has to do all that work, and the harddrive
 (which was already busy opening files for the antivirus to scan) now has to also go save the paging file (temporary memory file).&nbsp; And now every part of the machine is busy, only causing it to get even worse, so the problems compound until something finishes
 or the system locks up entirely.&nbsp; The OS tries to prevent this and usually does a good job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. If you want my personal and professional opinion -- what I tell paying clients, family, friends -- I would recommend removing McAffee and just use the built-in Windows Defender.&nbsp; It's free, never requires a subscription or renewals, gets fresh virus
 definitions multiple times per day, and is designed by definition to work better with Windows.&nbsp; It even has early-launch malware detection to prevent boot viruses.&nbsp; There's no reason to use a bloated, slower, and costlier program.&nbsp; Again that's my two cents,
 if you are satisfied and love your service, I won't tell you it's bad. Just not as highly tuned as the original factory parts :)</p>

            <p>If you have more than one antivirus product installed they can conflict (Defender will turn itself off if it sees another, but I don't know if McAffee and Avast do the same). &nbsp;Typically it just makes your system freeze and lock up, but they can actually
 conflict and destroy files, so just keep that in mind and make sure you remove all but 1 antivirus program (the one you want to use).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, on the access denied -- that is either because:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are not using Task Manager as an administrator. &nbsp;The easiest way to ensure you are is to search for Task Manager, right-click the search result and choose "Run as admin."<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>The antivirus program is running under another security context that prohibits user-level changes to the priority.</li></ol>

            I am assuming that you are asking how to update the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
driver </span>for your Network card...<br />
<br />
If your network card came with your computer, then go to your computer manufacturer's website, click on the "Support" link, and look for a a "Downloads" link after that.&nbsp; Enter your Model number or Serial number and you should get to a page where you can download
 the latest driver for your Network card.<br />
<br />
If your card was purchased and installed separately from your computer, the procedure is the same except that you go to the website for the manufacturer of the Network card.<br />
<br />
Once you download the driver file, transport it to your target machine, if necessary, and install per the instructions.<br />

            I honestly didn'nt think how I got here was as important as where I am now,lol. But I'm willing to try anything at this point, on December 16th 2011 is when my pc lost it's ability to connect to the internet, I know this because when I turned the darn thing on the next day I couldn't connect. With in a few days I'd done some research and found out that myself and thousands of other people got some kind of Trojan horse hider virus. I'm assuming the program a friend of ours ( who was staying with us at the time) downloaded/installed named Bitcomet is the culpret, as I found out its a program to illegaly download movies an such. I was not happy to say the least, and removed the program from my pc. I then did all I could with my antivirus program AVG and  Malwarebytes, and then at the advice of others with the same problem, disabled my AVG and installed Avast antivirus, ran all its scans and let it clean out my pc and then uninstalled it. I also installed a program called Trojan remover which is still

            Sorry this is in two posts, my tablet is being difficult...
<div>&nbsp;So microsoft tells me that since my TCP/IP protocol driver is now M.I.A. That I can get the manufacturer and model of my motherboard and go to the manufacturers site and download what I need for my network card to work properly again. Wrong again! My
 motherboard manufacturer is Kobian and my model is KVT600X-L and when I go to Kobian's site there is no link or option to download anything what-so-ever, so I realized they have a sister site called mercury, I went there, plugged in my model number and they
 had it but not the exact same one, the one they have is version 1.1 but mine is version 1.0, so I attepmted to download it anyway with no luck, the message says that download is not available on thier server! Why they even show it and make you wait 30 secs
 for the download to start only to be told they don't have it is beyond me. So once again I'm at a standstill. I'm pretty sure if I can update or maybe reinstall my network card I'll be able to move forward, I'm also assuming the two problems are connected,
 but I'm no IT pro and everything I've learned so far has been painfullly self-taught trial and error. I'm extremly proud of myself that I've gotten this far and would love to be in the near future doing a victory dance. I can give as much info as possible
 so if anyone can help I'll be eternaly greatful, and for those who have helped so far a huge THANK YOU, all of you are awesome : )</div>

            Try going to the Device Manager (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "devmgmt.msc") and find your ethernet adapter with the yellow mark on it, double-click on it, and go to the "Details" tab.&nbsp; Scroll down through the entries in the top window and see if you can gather enough
 information to identify the Manufacturer and/or model of your Ethernet card or chipset.&nbsp; One website I went to suggested that it might be a VIA.&nbsp; Then go to that manufacturer's website and see if you can find a driver there.&nbsp; If it is a VIA, try the link below:<br />

            Ok! headed to the link you suggested right after I finish this post : )
<div><br />
<div>As for my network card, I do have an onboard network card, and now that I physicaly look at my motherboard I see that my manufacturer is mercury and my model number is KVT600X-L &nbsp;version 1.1</div>
<div>This is not what the speccy program told me, however it makes no difference because as I stated in my other thread I have been to the Mercury site and the download for this makes me wait 40 seconds and then I hit the download button and it says: The file
 you have chosen to download is currently not available on the &nbsp;server. The download I am trying to get is called LAN driver VIA 823X I'm assuming thats the one I want since it's the only one with the words LAN and driver in it.&nbsp;</div>
<div>So now once again I'm stuck and not sure where to go from here.</div>

            sorry to disappear, I'm having a family emergancy and won't be coming back to my pc problem till it's settled.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I will say I did download from cnet, but it only installed a network adapter, the install directions for the drivers say I need a disk for my A drive. I have no disks of any kind what-so-ever. so I'm still stuck.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;But again I'll be back on in a week or so after I'v dealt with a serious family issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;thank you.</div>

            Hi DebbieWilliams8 ... sounds like your device uses bitlocker and has gone into recovery mode.
<br />Do you use a Microsoft account on that PC?
<br />if so from another device go to a browser and go to <a href="https://accounts.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://accounts.microsoft.com</a> and login there with your Microsoft account.
<br />Then click Devices.
<br />Find your device and click it.
<br />Then you should see an option for bitlocker recovery key.
<br />Should be a 48 digit key that you can enter on your PC.       
        </p>

    <title>How do I remove File Type Heading in Windows Explorer&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skyler kirk  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I remove File Type Heading in Windows Explorer&#63;</h2>
                    How do I get the "Type" heading of the way without having to move it out of site each time I access a folder?&nbsp; I can see the file type simply by looking at the file extension and/or icon, so to have a column dedicated to telling us the file type is not
 meaningful, and to place it automatically between two useful columns is just plain stupid - and the user is given to means of permanently getting the "Type" column out of the way of the useful information.&nbsp; DUMB!
<br />
<br />
I already know the answer to this question is, "It can't be done," so how do I contact Microsoft, who can do something about it, instead of being pushed out into a forum of people who all have the same question and no answer.&nbsp; - Skyler<br />

            Skyler and others are right. We users (me) need to be able change the default windows explorer display so that file Type is NOT SHOWN. This would have the effect of increasing my available screen space by 5-10%. How do we configure so that file type is
 not a default column in windows explorer?<br />
