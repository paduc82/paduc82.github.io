<h2>            Windows 10 Freezes randomly But the Mouse Still Moves</h2>
                    <p>I am seeing a lot of lock ups with Windows 10. The lock up would occur randomly but the mouse will still moves. I can't press ctrl+alt+del to bring up task manager, and when clicking on apps, ie; Outlook, chrome, File Explorer, everything just freezes. I
 can't do anything but to press the power button until my laptop completely shuts off, then turn it back on. I have seen this happen with more than a handful of laptops in my company, all with Windows 10 with SSD drives. I have researched and made changes to
 the power settings. I set the system to never sleep, also turned off Link state power management from PCI Express in the power settings but the problem will still occur. I've updated the laptop with the latest drivers, and also windows update is up to date
 as well. I have ran SFC /SCANNOW and it found some problems and it repaired it, but the problem is still occurring. I've even reimaged the laptop back to factory and the problem is still happening.&nbsp; Windows Version is 1709 (build 16299.248))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I mentioned earlier before, this is happening on more than a handful of systems, all running Windows 10 with SSD drives and all of the laptops including mine all have up to date drivers on the SATA AHCI controllers. Please Help!</p>

            Hi Elina
<br />
<br />Are you trying to install Windows from inside the Windows that is already installed?
<br />
<br />You need to boot your PC from the installation media, then when asked for a Product key, you ca click the 'Skip this Step' link at the bottom of that Windows
<br />
<br />To boot your PC form the installation media, you need to change the boot order in BIOS, so the installation media is top of the boot order list . ..

    <title>How can I make Windows Briefcase work right&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rassilon6  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I make Windows Briefcase work right&#63;</h2>
                    I am accustomed to using the Briefcase function in Windows XP to keep files synced at home and at work. (I have a laptop at both locations, and I like having a copy of my work files on both hard drives.) I use a USB drive to house the Briefcase, and sync
 it with both laptops.<br />
<br />
I recently got a new home computer, but it's running Windows 7. I tried rebuilding the Briefcase from scratch, but the help file on Windows 7 tells me that "When you use Briefcase with removable media, you never sync files in the Briefcase with the second computer.
 You simply gain the ability to work on these files using the second computer and then sync those changes with the first computer."<br />
<br />
But in the past, I've always had the files on the second computer (at work in this case) as well, with no problem (well, few problems). I tried forcing it . . . copying the Briefcase to my work computer. But when I tried to sync it again at home, Briefcase
 thought it was time to delete everything from my hard drive!<br />
<br />
Is there a way to continue using Briefcase and make it work with both computers (one with XP, one with Win 7)? If not, is there another program that will allow me to keep my work and home laptops synced? (I don't want to copy the entire directory I use every
 time; there are thousands of files, but I may only make changes to a handful at a time.) Any alternative solutions?

            You might also want to consider alternatives (Briefcase was born in Windows 95, so it may not be the best choice for today's world). &nbsp;Microsoft's "Windows Live Sync" (<a href="http://sync.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://sync.live.com</a>) software is awesome and keeps
 both computers synchronized (I even use it to keep my Favorites bookmarks sync'ed across 4 computers). &nbsp;And if you need a file that isn't in the other computer's synchronized folder, you can browse the hard drive drive of your remote computer straight from
 the sync website.
<div><br />
<div>If you don't mind playing around with beta software, Microsoft's Mesh (<a href="http://mesh.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mesh.com</a>) is even more awesome, but works nearly the same (it has the added benefit of being able to get to your documents from the website even
 if the computers are turned off).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Of course, these solutions are really only better if both computers have internet connections.</div>

<p>Hi Rassilon6,</p>
<p>I would recommend that you follow the steps below to sync the files using Briefcase:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Copy the Briefcase to any type of removable media.<br />
2.&nbsp;Remove the media from the first computer and insert it into the second computer.<br />
3.&nbsp;Make any changes you want to the files in the Briefcase on the removable media. Do not copy the Briefcase from the removable media onto the second computer.<br />
4.&nbsp;To sync your changes with the first computer, remove the media from the second computer and insert it into the first computer.<br />
5.&nbsp;From the first computer, open the removable media folder, right-click the Briefcase, and then click Update All to sync any changes you have made.</p>

<br />To be sure, the font doesn't look correct on the address bar(white), right?
<br />If so, It looks like Smooth Edges of Screen fonts are disabled.

            Hi Deja-RaeCampbell
<br />
<br />If you mean you changed the Windows 10 default UI font with a Registry Edit, the best option is to reverse that to the default Segoe UI font with a registry edit . .. 
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose New - Text Document
<br />
<br />Paste the text below into that new txt file
<br />
<br />Then choose File - Save As
<br />
<br />On the Save As Dialog, change the file type to Any File *.*
<br />
<br />Save that file with an appropriate name and manually add the .reg file extension
<br />
<br />Then close that file and double click it, confirm the Merge to your Registry
<br />
<br />Restart your PC
<br />
<br />
<br />Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
<br />

    <title>Windows Ink edit to photo&#39;s error in saving - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lindencoleman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Ink edit to photo&#39;s error in saving</h2>
                    After inking on photos I go to save and the photo editor crashes and I lose all the edits. I can see the files but am no longer able to open them and if I try opening with another application they are blank. The problem seems to occur more often when a
 large number of edits are made. Is there anyway to recover the edited files and can Microsoft look at fixing this issue as I see others have had the same problems.

<h2>            How to Pin a Frequently Visited URL to the Taskbar in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 7 it was simple to pin a frequently-visited website to the taskbar (the bar on the bottom) by simply dragging from the&nbsp;icon next to the URL&nbsp;on the top of the&nbsp;IE11&nbsp;window, down to the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This feature is something I use all the time, <em>far</em> more than the Start Menu or shortcuts on the desktop. They're normally covered up with various windows, whereas the taskbar is always visible.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I really want to like Win10. I'm sure it's great.&nbsp;I've installed it 3 times on this computer - and each time I've gone back to Win7 because I really have to get things done, rather than mess around with my computer.</p>

    <title>Gamertag-Wechsel fehlgeschlagen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Gamertag-Wechsel fehlgeschlagen</h2>
                    
<p>Hey Leute!</p>

<p>Ich habe mir gestern erst einen Windows Live Account für DIRT 3 erstellt und habe die Möglichkeit wahrgenommen, den Gamertag ein mal kostenlos zu ändern.</p>

<p>Ich tippte also ein "Megagoth1702", klickte auf "Gamertag übernehmen" und ... nichts passierte. Unten in der Leiste stand "warten auf xbox.live blabla". Also drückte ich nochmal auf "Gamertag übernehmen"... Und landede auf der gleichen Seite, nur dass das
 Eingabefeld leer war. Ich tippte also nochmal meinen gewünschen Gamertag ein und plötzlich wird mir gesagt, der wäre schon vergeben.</p>

<p>Hah, sicher ist er das. An MICH! Aber irgendwie tauche ich immer noch als TulpenVerehrer auf. Was kann ich tun? Geld für GeierSoft Points ausgeben steht GANZ unten auf meiner Liste... Gibt es eine offizielle Support Mailadresse? Die habe ich noch nicht gefunden,
 aber große Firmen verstecken die auch ganz gerne...</p>

<p>Danke im Voraus!</p>

<p>Einen schönen Tag noch!</p>

<p>Nunja kannst es ja mal beim Support probieren.Vielleicht sehen die ja einen Zusammenhang in der Datenbank zwischen deinem Xbox Live Account und dem neuen Nickname. Dann machen die das bestimmt. Wenn nicht, weißt Du es für´s nächste mal besser. Warten wäre

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>Windows 7 ReadyBoost will support 8 drives and a total of 256 Gigs. For each device - The
<br />
device must have an access time of 1 ms or less. The device must be capable of 2.5 MB/s
<br />
read speeds for 4 KB random reads spread uniformly across the entire device, and 1.75 MB/s
<br />
write speeds for 512 KB random writes spread uniformly across the device. On a FAT32 device&nbsp;<br />
the cache is limited to 4GB and on a NTFS device the cache is limited to 32GB (these are on

            I recommend trying to perform a clean boot in Windows. For clarification, a "clean boot" is unrelated to a complete reinstall of Windows, and a clean boot should not uninstall or delete any of your applications or personal files. Follow the instructions on this page: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />The article section "How to perform a clean boot" explains how to disable all background processes using the System Configuration application and disable all startup applications in Task Manager. After starting your computer with a clean boot, please try to run Windows Update again. If the KB4103727 update then works as expected, you can follow the article section "Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting." 
<br />
<br />Let me know if you have any questions or if that does not help, there are more steps you can try.

            Hello, 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />Regarding your issue, I would first suggest is to
<br />Try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            Hi Harnnarong, 1709 is no longer the latest version of Windows 10, 1803 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Disable any 3rd party Antivirus you may be running
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

    <title>Windows Hello Disappeared from Settings - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Hello Disappeared from Settings</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently upgraded my Windows 7 HP Laptop to Windows 10.</p>
<p>I have an inbuilt Biometric Fingerprint scanner in my laptop, which I use to login to Windows.</p>
<p>After upgrading to Win10 I setup Windows Hello which was visible in the settings at that point. (Although my fingerprint data was already in the system since I was using it in Win7)</p>
<p>I then added my Microsoft account and added a PIN as required.</p>
<p>So each time I boot, I used to get 3 options to login- Fingerprint, PIN, Microsoft Password</p>
<p>
</p><p>But from past 2-3 days only two options are being listed, the PIN and Microsoft options. I checked Settings only to find that there is no Windows Hello option anymore &nbsp;in account settings. So I am unable to use my fingerprint reader. Please help me to fix
 it.</p>

<p>After much frustration and MANY MANY non-answers found on this website, I found the best solution for me:</p>
<p>Uninstall the driver AND delete it in the process (for me it was right-click the BT device in Devices and Printers, Properties, Advanced, Change settings, Uninstall, check the "delete also" box).</p>
<p>It will rediscover and reinstall fine next time you put the adapter in. And after I did that, everything worked.</p>
<p>Previously I'd just tried uninstalling the driver. It wasn't enough.</p>

<p>Well I have resolved the issue I purchased the GoPro apparatus from the windows store in fact two I can view the files both Video and pictures and select what I want to down load it's displayed as a single image for each file. I also can view live images
 from the goPro only when not recording and completely control the GoPro and all it's setting via a wireless link. So have solved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have purchased Linx 8 tablet which is currently on sale for under £90-00 full windows 8.1 preloaded with Office full version licence for one year it quad core processor 1.83 GHz&nbsp;only 1Gb ram&nbsp;, Micro SD card slot micro HDMI micro usb and front and rear
 cameras cannot see how they can do it for the price, I can control the GoPro with this tablet but cannot get the video and picture&nbsp;preview to work with the other two windows apparatuses' so my question is the some software missing (update required?) that is
 stopping the wireless transfer of the video to the tablet&nbsp;? anybody have any ideas please.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Windows 7 has numerous optimization tools built-in that work continuously.&nbsp; Many people get too involved with this kind of activity and get themselves and their computers in trouble. Very few of the commonly seen tools on the web actually do any real good.&nbsp;
 Many, if not most can make things worse.&nbsp; Some are even guilty of making a mess of things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest single thing you can do to keep your system running well is to use a quality antivirus product -- some are way better than others, and use a scanner once in a while to clean out what is missed.&nbsp; The second biggest thing you can do is to avoid
 installing programs that are known resource hogs that slow your computer down with out much benefit.&nbsp; Here is list of a few:</p>
&nbsp;<span> </span>
<ul>
<li><span>Garmin Express</span></li><li><span>Roxio anything</span></li><li><span>Skype</span></li><li><span>uTorrent</span></li><li><span>Frostwire</span></li><li><span>Trusteer</span></li><li><span>Dropbox</span></li><li><span>Onenote</span></li><li><span>Evernote</span></li><li><span>All Apple products</span></li><li><span>Quickbooks</span></li><li><span>Spotify</span></li><li><span>Pandora</span></li><li><span>AOL desktop</span></li><li><span>Some games, particularly online ones</span></li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Mostly, the performance of your computer is determined by the hardware inside.&nbsp; If you do not have at least 4G of memory, increasing it can help a lot.&nbsp; If you have to replace a hard drive, replace it with a 7200 rpm rotating one
 and you will see a noticeable improvement.&nbsp; Other than that, there is little you can do about the hardware.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
Which Antivirus to buy?
<div>
<p>I am speaking from a great deal of experience.&nbsp; I support 150 client computers.&nbsp; I have been doing this for 14 years.&nbsp; My clients NEVER have infections.&nbsp; I want to emphasize that the
<em><strong>only products I will use or recommend are strictly an ANTIVIRUS product</strong></em>.&nbsp; Any product that is called complete protection, Internet security or deems itself to be a comprehensive security product is prohibited on my client computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I install only one product in my client’s computers.&nbsp; My support comes as a condition that they use that and only that product.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Do not&nbsp;use any product that claims to make your computer run better</strong>.&nbsp; Virtually all of them are either bogus, themselves an infection, or put your computer at risk.
<strong>Remove everything that claims to be there to prevent infections</strong> or claims to make your computer run better, with the singular exception of just one antivirus product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a controversial topic, but your choice of AV software may be something you want to take a 2nd look at.&nbsp; I suggest you visit this web site to get a sense of which AV software does the best job, depending on what kind of user you are:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.av-comparatives.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.av-comparatives.org/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a non-profit that has been around for a long time and I trust their results.&nbsp;&nbsp;Download and read the 2015 summary report.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Bitdefender is at or near the top.&nbsp; Microsoft’s is at or near the bottom.&nbsp; These are not closely scored, but wide differences.&nbsp; Note also that Norton (Symantec) declines to even participate.</strong></p>
<p>When you interpret these results, keep in mind the difference between a product that detects 95% and another 99% of infections, is actually 5 times more likely to allow an infection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up until September 2014, the only AV software I would allow my clients to use was Norton Antivirus.&nbsp; Please note well that that is not the same as any other Norton product such as 360 or Internet Security.&nbsp; September 2014,&nbsp;Symantec (owner of Norton) decided
 they would no longer sell an Antivirus-only product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a lot of research, I decided on <em><strong>Bitdefender Antivirus 2015+.&nbsp;</strong>
</em>I have installed it&nbsp;120 of&nbsp;those PCs and there has not been a single infection, and this has been over a course of about 17 months now.&nbsp; It is a better product than Norton.&nbsp; It is not expensive. It uses very little of the computer’s resources.&nbsp; One of
 the things I like most about it, is it silence and unobtrusiveness.&nbsp; Especially if you silence its “Wallet” function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My clients know well that if they install any “Internet Security” (IS) product, I will not work on their computers until it is removed.&nbsp; I learned the hard way that the other components in these IS products (other than the AV itself) cause more problems
 than any benefit they bring and mostly work by shutting down the Windows component that does a very good job of that particular task anyway.&nbsp; The problem was that when I started to work on a computer with an IS on it, I could spend hours trying to diagnose
 the problem, only to discover that by removing the IS product, the problems became much clearer and easier to solve.&nbsp; The IS product&nbsp;will actually hide the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, this is a controversial topic and you will find a lot of very strong different opinions.&nbsp; I just know that mine is based on a pretty large sample over a long period, and these are typical home Windows computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note well.&nbsp; You should <strong><em>never have more than one protection software installed</em></strong>.&nbsp; Always ensure that you completely remove any and all protection software packages before installing a new one.&nbsp; That includes software that may have
 come pre-installed on your computer when new</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot fully remove most any AV software by simply using the standard Windows 7 uninstall tool.&nbsp; Most of the majors also publish a “removal tool” that gets the rest of it.&nbsp; If you do not completely remove it, it will cause very hard to understand and
 diagnose problems.</p>

<p>I have been unable to log in to GFWL in any of my games for a while now.</p>
<p>Initially the connection fails. If I try to re-connect I get an error code:&nbsp;0x8000705b4</p>
<p>I have been unable to find anything about this exact error code, the closest (Although&nbsp;0x800705b4 is an XBox error code so google thinks they're related :-)</p>
<p>Anyways, I have opened the necessary ports on my Windows Firewall and have also enabled UPnP on my router and tried configuring NAT.</p>
<p>Nothing seems to work.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any clue what this error is and how to fix it?</p>

GFWL forums</a> that you can post in and hopefully get an answer for. The support for them is M-F, so you would have to wait until then for an answer, but they are the best ones to help you out! The error codes are similar, but have different fixes.</p>

    <title>Error 1723 Windows Installer DLL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardthorson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 1723 Windows Installer DLL</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
<br />
Error 1723 is preventing the installation of my ATI HD5800 graphics drivers.&nbsp; In fact, no new programs are installing.&nbsp; Currently installed programs are fine and continue to update fine.&nbsp; I know this is/was a java issue, but I have removed all old java (both
 manually and with java soft) and installed the latest java.&nbsp; I have been through all the forums and no solutions have been successful.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have tried turning windows installer on, starting it, restarting it, etc...&nbsp; I have ran sfc multiple times.&nbsp; It says there are corrupted files, but cannot fix them.&nbsp; I have tried to download the Microsoft fix-it center, but it downloads and then will not
 install.&nbsp; My Installation Disk is unable to correct the file.&nbsp; System Restore does not correct the issue.&nbsp; I saw in other forums that the Windows Installer Cleanup Utility worked, but as this no longer exists it is of little use.&nbsp; Since there is no way to
 get windows installer 5 online and since I cannot find any dll replacements, I hope you have more ideas.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit with the SP1 already installed.&nbsp; Although my machine is currently stable, I would like to be able to install new programs in the future.<br />

            <p>Thanks you for timely rely,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have already tried to run the Fixit tool as I stated above.&nbsp; After downloading and selecting run (or save and then run), the Fixit tool comes up with a loading box for about 2 seconds and then shuts off as it will not install.&nbsp; I believe this is the windows
 installer problem as well.&nbsp; As it cannot install, I am unable to use this program.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any other ideas I would be grateful.&nbsp; I am hoping to not have to reformat and reinstall everything, as I just finished a complete reinstall over the past couple of weeks, which ended with this error.&nbsp; I believe the corruption occurred during
 one of the many updates I had to put back on.</p>

            Thanks again for the timely reply,
<div><br />
<div>I created a new administrator user and again tried to download the drivers and the windows Fixit tool, but it responds in the same way as my original user. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sorry, no luck,</div>

<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>Use these methods to identify any Microsoft Installer issues that may be causing problems when you install, uninstall,
 or update programs. Start with method 1, follow the steps in that method, and then go to the next method if your issue is not resolved.<br />
<br />
</font></font></span></p>
<p><b><span><font color="#000000"><font>Method 1: Determine whether the Windows Installer engine is functioning.</font></font></span></b></p>
<p><b><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></b></p>
<ol>
<li><span><font><font color="#000000">Click
<b>Start</b><span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span>, type <b>cmd</b> in the
<b>Search</b> box or click <b>Run</b> then type <b>cmd</b> in the dialog (Windows XP or Windows Server 2003), and then press
<b>Enter</b> to open a <b>Command Prompt</b> window.</font></font></span><font color="#000000">
</font></li><li><span><font><font color="#000000">At the command prompt, type
<b>MSIExec</b>, and then press <b>Enter</b>.</font></font></span><font color="#000000">
</font></li><li><span><font color="#000000"><font>If the MSI engine is working, there should be no error messages. If you receive an error message, note the error.
 If you are proficient in how to use search engines, you can use the error message to help locate additional content to troubleshoot the issue.</font></font></span><font color="#000000">
</font></li><li><span><font color="#000000"><font>Try to install or to uninstall again.</font></font></span><font color="#000000">
</font></li></ol>
<p><span><br />
<font color="#000000"><font>If the problem persists, go to method 2.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 2: Unregister and re-register the Windows Installer to do that follow the steps provided below.</b></font></font><span><br />
<font color="#000000"><font><br />
1. Click Start, click Run, type <b>MSIEXEC /UNREGISTER</b>, and then click OK. Even if you<br />
do this correctly, it may look like nothing occurs. <br />
2. Click Start, click Run, type <b>MSIEXEC /REGSERVER</b>, and then click OK. Even if you
<br />
do this correctly, it may look like nothing occurs, or you may briefly see an hourglass.<br />
After you run this command, the operation is complete. <br />
3. Try your Windows Installer-based application again.</font></font></span></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>Hope it helps.</font></font></span></p>

            Ok,<br />
<br />
I do not see any error messages after method 1.&nbsp; That is Good?&nbsp; I also did method 2, but I still have the same problem when trying to install the Microsoft Fixit or my ATI graphics Divers.&nbsp; When running the troubleshoot compatibility option on the Microsoft
 fixit tool, I got the following error message that I cannot answer either.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
An unexpected error has occurred.&nbsp; The troubleshooting wizard can't continue.<br />
<br />
Package ID:&nbsp;&nbsp; PCWDiagnostic<br />
Path:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Windows\diagnostics\system\PCW<br />
error code:&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x800736B1<br />
Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Engine<br />
User:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MyUser-PC\My User<br />
Context:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restricted<br />
<br />
I do not know if this may be another problem or be related to the install problem.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I do have my Windows 7 Ultimate DVD.&nbsp; But I have already tried using it to repair my machine.&nbsp; It doesn't repair the problem.&nbsp; I also tried the Upgrade option on the DVD, but it won't because my current version is newer.<br />
<br />
I have now checked the event viewer.&nbsp; In the event viewer, I have the following error:<br />
<br />
MMC could not create the snap-in.<br />
<br />
MMC could not create the snap-in.&nbsp; The snap-in might not have been installed correctly.<br />
<br />
Name: Event Viewer<br />
CLSID: FX;{b05566ad-fe9c-4363-be05-7a4cbb7cb510}<br />
<br />
After looking at any forums, most of which are years old, I am unsure of what to try to fix this issue.&nbsp; One site suggested going to PATH environment, but when I went there the only thing in the snap-in section was the console root.&nbsp; Most of the rest of the
 fixes that were suggested were for Visita and not Windows 7.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Again, any help is appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you for continuing to work with me on this problem,<br />
Richard<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The Windows Installer 4.5 does not have a Windows 7 version.&nbsp; The clean Boot still has problems with installing the ATI drivers.&nbsp; Microsoft Safety Scanner did not work either.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I think I will just have to reinstall everything and hope it doesn't get corrupted in the updates.&nbsp; Thank you for your ideas on how to possibly fix the problem.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Richard.<br />

            There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:
