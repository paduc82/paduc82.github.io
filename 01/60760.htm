<h2>            Xbox one can&#39;t sign in when hard wired to router with ethernet cable&#63;</h2>
                    I recently purchased a new router and now I can't login into xbox live when I am hard wired into the router. I actually have to unplug the wire, connect to my wi-fi, then sign into xbox live, then plug the wire back in to get started. I have tried resetting
 the MAC address and saving it on my router. I have also done port forwarding for all the required ports but still everytime I start up the xbox while it is hooked up via the ethernet cable it never signs into xbox live. Any suggestions? My router is a netgear&nbsp;
 modem/router combo AC1600 Thanks!

<p>Hello There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issues with connecting. You can clear the alt mac address then try and connect. To clear the alt mac address go to settings&gt;network&gt;network settings&gt;adv. settings&gt;alt mac address clear and restart. Sometimes when getting new router the Xbox
 still tries to connect to old router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p>So I have this same issue as well. I purchased the ORBI System a couple weeks ago, but have had no issues with connections until tonight. The console, One X, has been running Wired this whole time, but with painfully slow speeds. Wired gets me 90mbps were
 my phone which is propped up against the console gets 325mbps... So I thought I would try the WiFi, and here I am with the same issue that has been plaguing the Xbox since at least December. I have power cycled everything, and it still does not list any Wireless
 Routers. I tried hitting 'Disconnect Wireless' in the Network Settings, which did nothing. I tried to clear the Alt Mac Address, and it pops up with a Restart Required, but I click on the Restart button and the console does nothing.</p>
<p>At first I tried my Routers name and I got the "Your Security Protocol Won't Work" error message. Then I put in a random name and got the same message. So the Fault here lies in the console, not every single router in existence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated other than telling me basic troubleshooting steps as in "recycle power" as this has been done multiple times already....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>I think it will be better if you create a new post of your own rather than asking your question on an old post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, when you say your console is wired, is it a direct ethernet connection to your modem/router or is it through a switch, a power-line adapter etc?</p>

<p>Im also experiencing the same issue. Ive been using my Motorola MG7315 Gateway for the past 2 years - hardwired into my Xbox One - with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently moved, but kept Comcast as my ISP. At my new place I still had the same X1 ethernet connected with no problems. I got an X1X for Christmas and have had connectivity issues since Day 1. And unfortunately, this ONLY happens with an ethernet cable
 - wireless works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I’ve done all the basic troubleshooting (unplugging, power cycling, port forwarding, clearing MAC address, etc.)</p>
<p>2. More times than not, these things will normally fix the issue (but who honestly wants to waste 5-10 min everytime dealing with that crap?)</p>
<p>3. I did the “What’s my IP” option, and found that the IPv4 and IPv6 are showing up differently than what my gateway settings are telling me (which, from what I’ve read, is indicative of a private IP, making the NAT status an issue).</p>
<p>4. Additionally, I had a problem connecting my TV to my internet via ethernet as well (coincidence? I don’t know).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, I’m still unsure as to what the </p>
<p>true problem is. I feel like it may be a Comcast issue and I may need to (unfortunately) troubleshoot through them. But I find it strange that this only happened when I got my X1X. Or is my gateway even 100% compatible with my X1X?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else had this same exact issue? I don’t think I’m the only one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So I got mine to work last night. I ended up unplugging the ethernet cable from the console, then holding the console power button down until it turned itself off. Gave it a few seconds then turned it back on. And for whatever reason, it was able to finally
 find Wifi routers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course this was AFTER I factory reset the router and the console twice...</p>

<p>I remember doing the exact same thing a month ago, only for it to go back to the original problems after about a week.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span><span>The System Update Readiness Tool creates a log file that captures any issues that the tool found or fixed. The log file is located at the following location:
<br />
•%SYSTEMROOT%\Logs\CBS\CheckSUR.log <br />
•%SYSTEMROOT%\Logs\CBS\CheckSUR.persist.log<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The system root is normally

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may need to change your settings in Windows to be able to see the file. To show hidden files type Folder Options in the search box above the Start button and select
 View, Advanced Settings and verify that the box before "Show hidden files and folders" is checked and "Hide protected operating system files" is unchecked. You may need to scroll down to see the second item. You should also make certain that the box before
 "Hide extensions for known file types" is not checked.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do not use Search to find the files. Open Windows Explorer (keyboard shortcut Win+E), locate and expand the file path (item

<h2>            Surface Pro and Wireless Display Adapter</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>I have a problem with the Wireless Display Adapter and some Surface Pro devices (2 Surface Pro 4 and 1 Surface Pro 3).</p>
<p>All devices can connect to the Wireless Display Adapter (v2) but, after few minutes, they were disconnected from the Adapter (users need to re-connect to the adapter)</p>
<p>The adapter has the latest Bios version</p>
<p>All the Surface are updatet with the last update for Windows 10.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help,</p>
<p>Roberto</p>

<p>That may be the problem.&nbsp; I am seeing something similar with the Wireless Display Adapter app.&nbsp; Absurdly the app is on the MWDA screen but telling me "Connection failed."&nbsp; Fortunately the screen stays up (obviously--otherwise the app
 would be switched back to another screen.)&nbsp; Who knows, maybe having the app periodically doing this on the monitor is enough to keep it up?&nbsp; Another thing the app is good for is checking the firmware level.&nbsp; There is a link to a troubleshooter page but I'm
 dubious about the quality of its help.&nbsp; I think we need some advice on what diagnostic traces would be available.</p>
<p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Oh.&nbsp; Your Surface models supposedly have the option of changing the radio frequency.&nbsp; Have you tried that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise notice that the troubleshooter apparently has no concept of the hardware working but the software having defects?&nbsp; Unbelievable.&nbsp; I'll see if I can figure out what diagnostics there may be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I am still trying to understand how the more visible pieces fit together.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp; currently&nbsp; netsh wlan sh ne mo=BSSID&nbsp; doesn't show&nbsp; DIRECT-&nbsp; anything but&nbsp; PowerShell&nbsp; Get-NetConnectionProfile&nbsp; shows it is being used.&nbsp; And Network and Sharing
 Center shows it.&nbsp; Is that because I marked it Private?&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; If the MWDA was not connected I think I would see DIRECT- there. &nbsp; YMMV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be interested in sharing general results with you.&nbsp; This may help us both understand how it is supposed to work and then perhaps help discover useful workarounds when it doesn't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            One or more network protocols are missing from this computer error</h2>
                    <p>heres what worked for me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>setup new local account administrator, THIS WORKED, after hours of trying i just said **** and setup new local admin account and BAM it working</p>
<p>
</p><p>other things i tried: That may or may not work</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) sfc /scannow. This showed&nbsp; errors <br />
<br />
2) netsh advfirewall reset netsh int ip reset*** netsh int ipv6 reset netsh int ipv4 reset netsh winsock reset *** This command did not work originally until I went to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControl and changed Control/NSI folder 26 permission to
 everyone (This box was unchecked again after reboot)<br />
<br />
3) ipconfig /flushdns ipconfig /registerdns ipconfig /release ipconfig /renew <br />
<br />
4) Disabling and Renabling the Network Adapter within device manager. <br />
<br />
5) Uninstalling the driver <br />
<br />
6) Installing the latest drivers both from the MOTHERBOARD website and googling my network adapter.
<br />
<br />
7) I saw the fix where someone deletes the Windows 10 WIN and WIN2, and replaces with a clean Windows 7/8 version in this registry: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Winsock HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Winsock2

One or more network protocols are missing from this computer error
<p>your updates/something else you are doing are messing with winsock/winsock2 and locking account out of share/networking get diagnostic error when try to connect with share ....one or more network protocols are missing</p>
<p>
</p><p>you have a major problem with networking more than likely it is a security program blocking account&nbsp; maybe in GPEDIT that needs to be config</p>
<p>
</p><p>some how getting corrupt user, but not showing as corrupt, some security measure is locking your winsock</p>
<p>
</p><p>there is no missing network protocol, uninstalled and installed over and over&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>but the funny thing is it doesn't happen on all my win10 machines just everyother one ..so go figure</p>

            it can, today it went to 18% (i checked the battery after i turn the surface on again). So still after i charged it, the battery still 18% not 0%, so technically the battery still there yet it just shut down on its own.

<p>. Open your browser</p>
<p>. Paste the path to the report in the address bar</p>

<p>I won't be able to view the battery report using the posted link. What I would zero in on would be the spec'ed full charge capacity vs what the system is reporting as the full charge capacity...and...the reported amount of power left at 20%</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just curious, who is the manufacturer of the battery? It will be either one of the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SMP</p>
<p>LG</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface 3 has an SMP battery. The designed capacity is 28,443 mWh and, as of now, the Full Charge Capacity is listed as 27 447 mWh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tend to think that the battery in your Surface 3 has weakened, but I can't be sure. Consider taking the unit to a Microsoft Store (if any are in your area), or reach out to Microsoft Support to see what they say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing you can do here and now would be to have your Surface 3 go into Power Save mode at, say, 25% remaining charge. It won't solve this particular problem, but, it will give you a warning when the battery is getting ready to need a recharge.&nbsp;🔌 🔋&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have been also seeing the same issue, especially after upgrading my Surface to Windows 10 from Windows 8 (was an old holdout).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes it&nbsp;<em>does</em> go down to 5% and hibernates automatically, as it should. But most of the time it will just cut out at well above that (as you have mentioned).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tend to think that it is a calibration issue. If I let the Surface die, charge to 100%, then uninstall the battery driver and let it reinstall itself, then
<em>use it straight</em>, it will almost certainly get to the proper 5% level before hibernating.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If, however, I spend many days going into sleep/hibernate, using it a little, then charging it back up, then using it a little, etc., it will cut out prematurely. I feel like the gas gauge/battery discharge monitor is not accounting for some drain in the
 Windows 10 wake cycle, which adds up over time, resulting in an "optimistic" (i.e. too high) estimate of the remaining percent battery. With that said, I have no idea how to fix this. I have the latest driver package from Microsoft's website as well as Windows
 Updates.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I realize the inconvenience you are experiencing with&nbsp;Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue might occur if</span>&nbsp;the videos in M4V file format is protected by DRM copy protection.
<span>The M4V file format<br />
is a video container format developed by Apple and is very similar to the MP4 Format.
</span></p>
<p>M4V format are not able to be freely transferred or played in non-Apple devices due to the DRM.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that we will be able to play the M4V file format only if&nbsp;it is not having DRM protection which prevents the file from getting accessed from other devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I suggest you to follow the steps below to<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;check if you are able to play through Windows Media Player and also try to convert the file in MP4 file format. Check if
 it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>

<h2>            I just blew up 3 consecutive tanks</h2>
                    
<p>On Arica Harbor.</p>
<p>I was playing Rush and was defending the first set of crates when 3 Abraham's rolled up and started firing. Due to my superior gunning, I was able to destroy all 3 of them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we had "bush wookies" up on the hill overlooking the attackers spawn and talking about whether "Blue Tiger" or "Fall Camo" looks best on what sniper rifle while applying the latest nail polish to hit JC Penny's women section.</p>
<p>One of them got a 'Marksman Headshot" and figured he could take the rest of the game off, which was evident because he did nothing else the rest of the game.</p>

<h2>            Cannot Save to External Hard Drive</h2>
                    I just upgraded to Windows 7 from Vista.&nbsp; I am the administrator and the only user account (with the exception of some unknown ASP.NET account that I have no idea what it is but that's another issue).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I can open documents from my external hard drive in Word and Excel, but when I try to save a document onto my external hard drive I get a message which says "You don't have permission to save in this location.&nbsp; Contact&nbsp;the administrator to obtain permission."<br />
<br />
I cannot figure out what to do.

            1.) Ensure the document is not set with a Read Only attribute. To verify, right click property of the file name.<br />
2.) Verify the folder in the external hard drive have the appropriate Security Rights. To verify, right click property of the folder and select the security tab on the property dialog box.<br />
3.) Ensure you have Administrator or Username with full control rights checked in the security tab on the property dialog box.<br />

            Please confirm exactly what Edition of Windows do you have? 
<br />
<br />I am guessing Pro or Enterprise.  That would mean you most likely have a license type that must be validated every 6 months by contacting an "activation server" run by the company. Since the company no longer exists, the server is no longer there. 
<br />
<br />PLEASE PROVIDE FULL Windows and/or Office Edition, Version AND Build Numbers
<br />..........******************************************************
<br />.
<br />Although MS does not tell you, when you are asking for help, we really do need to know specific the Windows (or Office) Edition, Version AND Build numbers you are running. 
<br />.
<br />Contrary to MS's wishful thinking, we are all NOT running the "most recent" version (actually Version AND BUILD!) .  Individual recurring, (obviously unfixed) Windows update errors cause people to be running older versions and builds. We commonly see people running versions of Windows that have fallen out of support because they are 18 months old due to unfixed update errors during that span of time. 
<br />.
<br />The simplest way is to RUN the WinVer command  (option 4 or 5 in the following tip)
<br /><a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/how-determine-what-version-windows-7-you-have" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/how-determine-w...</a> 
<br />.
<br />Or you can run the following script to copy and paste the full information:
<br />.
<br />Report Windows Edition, Version and Build number
<br />This “copy and Paste” process will get the full Window Build and Version number information we need:
<br />.
<br />.  *  In start menu, search for POWERSHELL
<br />.  *  Click on it to open a PowerShell window
<br />.  *  Copy the following lines, between the lines of ***, not including them
<br />.
<br />********************
<br />.
<br />$name=(Get-WmiObject Win32_OperatingSystem).caption
<br />$bit=(Get-WmiObject Win32_OperatingSystem).OSArchitecture
<br />
<br />$vert = " Version:"
<br />$ver=(Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion").ReleaseId
<br />
<br />$buildt = " Build:"
<br />$build= (Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion").BuildLabEx -match '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' |  % { $matches.Values }
<br />
<br />$installd = Get-ComputerInfo -Property WindowsInstallDateFromRegistry
<br />
<br />Write-Host $name, $bit, $vert, $ver, $buildt, $build, $installd
<br />
<br /> ********************
<br />Note: the install Date will take a minute to capture the required info
<br />
<br />.  *  Paste them in the PowerShell Window
<br />.  *  Then hit enter.  
<br />.  *  It will return something like this:
<br />
<br />Microsoft Windows 10 Home 64-bit  Version: 1709  Build: 16299.431 @{WindowsInstallDateFromRegistry=18-01-01 2:29:11 AM}
<br />
<br />.  *  Copy that and paste it into your reply

    <title>Windows 10, new computer, Service Host&#58; Local System uses all - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrickbaumann22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10, new computer, Service Host&#58; Local System uses all household bandwidth for minutes at a time</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just purchased a new computer.&nbsp; It sits on a 1.5 MBPS DSL line, unfortunately.&nbsp; Every so often, the Service Host: Local System uses the entire bandwidth of the household for minutes at a time (10-45 minutes). &nbsp;As BulldogXX pointed out, Service Host is
 a shell. &nbsp;When I expand it, the resource monitor does not indicate what sub-process is using the bandwidth. &nbsp;Is there a way to determine the offending sub-process? Is there a way to throttle the bandwidth Service Host uses to enable the network to be used
 for other things?&nbsp; Or is there a way to suspect Service Host until a more convenient time?&nbsp; OR is there a way to schedule it to run at a more convenient time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions are appreciated,</p>
<p>&nbsp; Patrick</p>

            <p>Service Host doesn't use any bandwidth. As the name implies, it's merely a host for other services. Similarly, if your house guest takes long showers, you as the host are not to blame for the shortage of hot water.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to determine what services are being hosted and which one of <em>those</em> services is hogging bandwidth. Let's hope it isn't malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, to be honest, 1.5 MB/sec of bandwidth is going to make Windows (or MacOS) a frustrating experience. Were I in the same position I would prefer a tablet with Android or iOS. Those operating systems, and the apps they run, are optimized for low bandwidth
 applications.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response. &nbsp;Well too late to buy a new computer now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically, Service Host: Local System (or a proxy) is using 100% of bandwidth. &nbsp;When I expand Service Host: Local System to it's entities, Windows in its wisdom doesn't delineate what resources the sub-processes are using. ... &nbsp;So, therefore I asked the
 question, hoping someone who's Windows 10 savvy might actually answer the questions posed.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My machine has 17 sub processes running for Service Host: Local System...</p>
<p>One of which happens to be Windows Update...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess would be that it is Windows Update that is the primary culprit for your internet usage.. There isn't really much of anything else that would use that much with the possible exception of Windows Defender...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also a possibility that there are some preinstalled OEM processes that are doing update downloads that may also be functioning under the Service Host: Local System...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try going to... &nbsp;Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Administrative Tools\Services and setting Windows Update to DISABLED and reboot...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender will still update, and possibly some preinstalled stuff, but it could answer the question...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually resort to this myself because I am constantly getting interrupted by Windows Update downloading... I set Windows Update to MANUAL when I have time to mess with the Windows Updates...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the option to Check For Updates and Notify has been removed, there are not to many other options...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be that if you just let the computer do it's thing, it may complete the updating and resolve the problem on it's own..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even new computers are usually way behind with the recent Windows Updates and such...</p>

            I figure it's windows update, it makes the most sense. &nbsp;I'll dig deeper. &nbsp;I wanted to see if there were ways to make windows play more nicely in the environment it finds itself in. &nbsp;It stops in about 45 minutes, but that's not gonna play when I need to
 be online working. &nbsp;I figure turning off windows update is a last resort. ...

<h2>            Toshiba C55. Gray screen unable to get into safe mode and no command prompt after start up</h2>
                    I try f2, f8, f12. No command prompt. &nbsp;Had same issue 6 months ago and printed off solution to fix and it worked perfectly but, cannot find it. Believe I had to get into safe mode different way than F8. Then was how to get command prompt. &nbsp;Once I was able
 to get command prompt and get into Start I could fix it. It worked but cannot find what I printed. &nbsp;I kept getting people telling me I needed new hard drive but this fixed it with no issues until 6 months later. &nbsp;Any ideas? &nbsp;

<p>Hello Steve,<br />
<br />
There are two other ways on how you can access command prompt. If pressing the function buttons wouldn't work, we recommend you try these two options below to access the command prompt:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Update &amp; security</strong>.</li><li>On the left panel, click <strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Advanced startup</strong>, click on <strong>Restart now</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Restart your computer.</li><li>When you see the Windows logo appear, press and hold the power button on your computer to turn it off again.</li><li>Repeat these steps for three consecutive times.</li><li>On the fourth try, you should see the <strong>Windows Recovery Environment</strong> where command prompt is available.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you will need further assistance.</p>
        </p>

<p>Thank you and appreciate the help. I had same exact issue happen last winter and found article on here and printed it off that fixed issue. &nbsp;I can't find article or my print off. &nbsp;It got me in to get command prompt using different way than F12 etc on start
 up. &nbsp;Took some time to start from that to finish but it worked. &nbsp;It got me into blue screen to run opt options to repair to defrag or go back to certain point on hard drive and worked perfectly. &nbsp;When everyone was telling me my hard drive was toast and needed
 new etc, that post was nah, just do this to get command prompt, get into safe mode, do this etc and it worked! &nbsp;Took over 4 hours but was easy just time consuming instead of all the other advice. &nbsp;It was way to get windows 10 to stop looping I believe. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows 10 Home N</strong> is a version of <strong>Windows 10 </strong>
that comes without media-related technologies <strong>(Windows Media Player</strong>) and certain preinstalled media apps
<span><strong>(Music, Video, Voice Recorder, and Skype)</strong>. Basically, an operating system with no media capabilities.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have more questions, feel free to ask.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Regards.</span></p>

<h2>            DirectX won&#39;t install - Internal Error</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After hours spent reading topics on the subject, I come to you with my problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently had to reinstall Windows 7 on my laptop and since then I can't get DirectX to install. I downloaded the most recent end-user redistributable I could find (June 2010 from
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>, Microsoft Download center) but to no avail. The installation fails after some time due to an "internal error" and I should check the DirectX and DXError logs. I have uploaded these
 two files here :</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://we.tl/UsvPFmW4iD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://we.tl/UsvPFmW4iD</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Dxdiag says DirectX Version : DirectX 11</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the registry keys with regedit and they seem fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried sfc /scannow, came up with no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean-boot, didn't change a thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically I'm all out of ideas. I'd rather like to avoid having to reinstall windows&nbsp;<em>again</em> especially as it's brand new and I don't understand what I did wrong. Thanks for your help !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
