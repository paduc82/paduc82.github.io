<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You might encounter this errors due to&nbsp;device drivers conflicting with the operating system installed on the PC. For us to isolate and identify the possible causes of this issue,

<p>Hi</p>
<p>-Nothing appears except "making sure it's you" then when I enter my PIN the message disappears and when I press add again the same message appears, again and again, nothing happens.</p>
<p>-I tried switching to&nbsp;a local account.</p>
<p>system check&nbsp;</p>
<p>-I made a test account the PIN worked on it without problems its only on my account</p>
<p>-when I booted into the safe mode the sign-in options didn't&nbsp;load</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us. <span>As an initial recommendation, </span>we suggest opening the Group Policy Editor in Windows to check for the PIN settings in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>To do so, s<span>tart&nbsp;</span><span><span><strong>"RUN"</strong></span></span><span><span>in Windows with keys&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><strong>[Win-Logo]+[R]</strong></span></span><span><span>and type in&nbsp;</span></span><em>gpedit.msc&nbsp;</em>and press Enter.</li><li>Navigate to the path: Computer configuration / Administrative Templates / System / Logon</li><li>Identify the entry&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Turn on PIN</strong>&nbsp;and &nbsp;double click it. Verify that the settings is set to 'Enable'.</li></ol>
<p>Note: The above recommendation applies to Windows 10 PRO and above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if the above does not apply, refer to the below method and check if it helps.</p>
<div><span><span><span><span><strong>Method 1</strong></span></span></span></span></div>
<div><span><span><span><span>This issue may happen due to system file corruption. I suggest you to run System file checker. System File checker (SFC) scan is done to check if there are any corrupted system files that could be causing this issue. Kindly follow
 the below given steps:</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></div>
<ol>
<li><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span> </span></span></span><span><span>Press<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><strong>Windows key + X</strong></span></span><span><span>, select<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><strong>Command prompt (Admin)</strong></span></span><span><span>to

<p>You say "the setting are all correct," but almost certainly they are<br />
not. Very likely you are either set for the wrong time zone or are not<br />
set for daylight savings time.</p>

            I know this is old but just in case someone else has the same issue this may help them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe the issue has to do with the way Linux keeps time versus Windows.&nbsp; Linux allows you to keep your Bios time set to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) or Universal
 Time (UT).&nbsp; Linux will then adjust it's clock upon log in accordingly based on what time zone you set it for when you installed.&nbsp; So for instance&nbsp; I live in Central Time in the United States&nbsp; so that is GMT - 6.&nbsp; So if my Bios says it is 7:00pm ,&nbsp; then Linux
 will adjust the time to be 1:00pm in my local time. &nbsp; The problem is Windows can not do this neat trick, it relies on you to have the same time in your Bios as you do in Windows.&nbsp; If the Bios time is set to 7:00pm then Windows will be 7:00pm.&nbsp; Windows is incapable
 of adjusting for GMT.&nbsp; People that dual boot Linux and Windows will sometimes have this issue.&nbsp; The only thing I know to do is to disable the feature in Linux.&nbsp; See this link for more information:&nbsp; http://www.linuxsa.org.au/tips/time.html<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.&nbsp; I would love to see this feature in Windows 8?&nbsp; :-)<br />

<p>You probably have the time zone set improperly in Windows or have the DST setting wrong.</p>

<h2>            After latest Win 10 Update, MS Apps are not working and cannot access Apps Store</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest WIN 10 update download and installed automatically on or around December 13, 2015. Ever since the update was installed, all of the Microsoft Apps are not working, and we can't even access the Microsoft Apps store. The Apps are on the computer,
 but won't open, same with the store, sort of like grayed out</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>

            <p>OK, after the Nov/Dec updates, both our desktop PC's, with Windows 10 had Edge, Internet Explorer 11 and Internet Options STOP working.&nbsp; I have tried multi recommended solutions but none have worked, then we just got the Dec 12/13, 2015 upgrade.&nbsp; It did
 not fix any of the above, and now we also have the same problem which many others and PA City Guy have listed!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We on both computers, still have above problems, and now many windows app's do not work at all, the Calculator which we both use daily is faded out, when clicked on it says; "This app can't open, check the windows store for more info about calculator. Go
 to store"&nbsp; The go to store is also as cusor moves over it a link, but it does not work!&nbsp; Because IE and Edge do not already work, we have to use Google Chrome, go to Windows Store site, and try to download the NEW calculator, but it will not allow it to download,
 load, put in cart, or anything...the link is dead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstall the app's/programs, I have tried to reinstall the programs, I have tried to download them from Microsoft sites (all that I can find) to include the store, but it will not allow us too!&nbsp; What is going on here people?&nbsp; First IE, Edge
 and Internet Options, now any and all links to Microsoft to include the store do not work, and now app's are not working, the Windows Calculator and some others.&nbsp; I look all over for a update, fix, repair, tried all recommended from here for the first part
 of the dead MS app's/programs, now I am back here looking for why the other MS app's are now not working.&nbsp; I have been looking, stopped at many of this posting matching PA City Guy, had to add my two cents worth, and am now going to keep looking for a solution
 ... at this point I am not really feeling that I am going to find anything.&nbsp; BUT IF THERE IS ANYONE OUT THERE THAT DOES HAVE THE ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEM PLEASE PLEASE&nbsp; HELP ALL TELL US HOW TO REPAIR, FIX, MAKE IT WORK, ETC</p>

<p>I also am having an open apps problem. Their "solutions" are deliciously reminiscent. I love Step 3. It reminds me of</p>

    <title>Windows 7 program files &#40;x86&#41; customization &#38; localization - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> manuel-at-the-web  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 program files &#40;x86&#41; customization &#38; localization got disabled&#33;</h2>
                    Hi:<br />
<br />
I have just realized that my Program Files (x86) folder lost its localized name (Spanish: Archivos de Programa (x86) )<br />
In the folder there is a Desktop.ini file which does contain the customization info:<br />
<br />
[.ShellClassInfo]<br />
LocalizedResourceName=@%SystemRoot%\system32\shell32.dll,-21817<br />
<br />
However the name is still in English (as if Desktop.ini was not present).<br />
<br />
Also, if I right-click on the folder, the customize tab is not present. This tab is available for all the other c:\ folders.<br />
<br />
How can I fix this?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span>From the description we assume that you have issues with Program Files folder name. Let us start with couple of questions.</span></p>

<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>How long this been an issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any change son your computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you added or removed any program or files prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform System Restore to the previous point when it was working fine.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to ‚Äú<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/products/features/system-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System

            I confirm: c:\Program Files (x86) localized name is not available anymore. <br />
"Archivos de Programa (x86)" does not show on Explorer, just real name.<br />
Also, customize tab has disappeared.<br />
Desktop.ini is still there.<br />
<br />
c:\Program Files and c:\Users do show their localized name ("Archivos de Programa", "Usuarios")<br />
Also their properties dialog has available "customize" tab.<br />
Same for c:\ProgramData (which does not have a customized name)<br />
<br />
<br />
1-I realized of this issue yesterday, but maybe it has been there for longer time<br />
2-I have just installed windows 7 updates, as it is requested by WindowsUpdate Serivce<br />
3-Las software change was about 3 weeks ago (Installed ArcSoft Total Media), but I could not confirm if issue appeared after that change.<br />
<br />
-SystemRestore: Is this a Must? Last time I did, it deleted some files of my desktop!<br />
<br />
Thanks so much in advance.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Store Issue, trying to download a game onto laptop but the download doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    I'm trying to install a game I bought on xbox store which is compatable with PC (ark survival evolved) so I've tried to download it on microsoft store and the download just keeps going after it's reached the say 80GB that is needed for installation, so
 it got to 80GB and it just keeps downloading so I've tried stopping it and restarting the download several times but it just starts from the point I left it,&nbsp; I restarted the download then it says 84GB (I say 84GB because I let it run a bit after the amount
 needed thinking it might just need updates on top of that and it got to 84GB before I stopped it) out of 126 GB needed to download and install which again I waited til then and a bit more then it still keeps going, its up to over 200GB after all my attempts,
 it isn't taking up space I think even thought it says it has downloaded over 200GB. I'm getting frustrated because it won't download/install at all it's just an endless download if it is even downloading that is, I can't find

<p>Hello Aldo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with the download. Unfortunately at this time there is a Service alert for purchase and content usage. You&nbsp; can view the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Service alert</a> and try when it is over. Even though says for codes and that it can affect all aspects of content. Also if the game is Forza Horizon 4 mine did that also I think it did the update right after so added together. The issue been reported on the
 Forza Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>

Vozmozhnoli to get support of Russian in this game? Hotyaa subtitlings.<br />2) Also, it would be desirable to get support of Russian (hotyaba subtitlings) in the game Mass Effect (the first part). Whether it is possible?</p>

                    Had skype for some time now and no real problems, it seems now that I cannot open images that I have sent or received. Contacts I have sent images to can open as always, this is a recent thing and frustrating that I cannot solve it, hope you can help.

            Hi, thanks for the reply, I can save them individually as you said and then when I open them from the hard drive folder it is in Windows Photo Viewer. The problem was that up to a few days ago I could left click on the thumbnail and it would open from
 the Skype page, I could then decide which ones I would want to save or delete. Wouldn't be so bad if I could 'save all' from Skype conversation but it won't let me do that, I have to do them one at a time. Puzzled as to what has happened to change something
 that has worked perfectly well for the last 5 years, thanks again and if you can think of anything else I would appreciate it.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem all of a sudden from one day to another and had no idea what had happened. For me it turned out I had for some unknown reason lost my settings for the default photo viewer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply selecting a new one and restarting skype fixed it for me, so I hope this helps for the rest of you as well.</p>

 windows (such as windows 7, 8, xp, vista) with windows 10, what are the essential software require? I have also problem in start up of windows so what should be done in order to make booting of windows faster?&nbsp;I had upgraded windows 8.1 to windows10 pro and

<p>The vast majority of games that ran on XP and newer versions of Windows also run on Win10.</p>
<p>They load as quickly and run as well as they did on the older Windows, but not better.
</p>
<p>Very few of them require using Compatibility setting for an older version of Windows. I have less than a dozen old
</p>
<p>games of around 200 that require a Compatibility setting for an older Windows.</p>
<p>- Many older games do require using <em>Compatibility &gt; Override High DPI Scaling behavior .
</em>This is often set automatically</p>
<p>by Windows, but Windows also often fails to do so.</p>
<p>This is not so much a Windows issue as it is an issue with using high resolution monitors.(Compatibility is found by R/clicking on the games executable ( .exe ). Then click on
<em>Properties &gt; Compatibility.)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>However there are two issues to deal with regarding older games that are peculiar to Win10...</p>
<p>- You must enable <em>Direct Play</em>. Go to ...</p>
<p><em>Programs and Features &gt; Turn Windows Features On or Off</em></p>
<p>Enable <em>Legacy Components </em>and<em> Direct Play</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>- </em>DRM Blocking. MS built a security 'feature' into Win10 that prevents many disk based games from launching.</p>
<p>This 'feture' blocks the driver - secdrv.sys - used by SafeDisk copy protection<em>,
</em>which prevents the disk check from happening.</p>
<p>The only way to circumvent DRM Blocking is to use a noCD Fix/hack.</p>
<p>I have more details in my post at&nbsp; <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/login-as-administrator-warning/56cf28ad-c7e5-432f-89ab-d22e08a06544">
--this thread --</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>- There is one other issue that also applied to previous versions of Windows. Dated hardware. eg- XP was limited to DX9,</p>
<p>Vista to DX9,10 and Win7 DX9,10,11. </p>
<p>Graphics cards are still limited to the level of DX they were built to use. Some older laptops still have graphics that</p>
<p>cannot use DX11/12</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those who are using an old machine, particularly a laptop, and the mfg of that machine does not provide dedicated Win10</p>
<p>drivers for the graphics processor, you are likely to have problems running games on Win10.
</p>
<p>- As a gamer, I would not even try to run a machine older than 2012 on Win10 . I would be sticking with Win7/8/8.1.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forums. We appreciate your interest on Windows 10.<br />
I understand the issue that you are facing. We are glad to help you.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please share this:<br />
1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you get any error message when you open the .JPG files using Windows Photo Viewer?<br />
2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does this happen with all the .JPG files and with all the other picture file formats?<br />
3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This needs more diagnosing to identify what exactly is causing this issue. This could happen if some corrupted system files of Windows Photo Viewer are corrupted.
 Let‚Äôs check that first before we proceed further. To do this let‚Äôs run an SFC Scan on the computer and check if that helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Run an SFC Scan</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />
a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, then tap Search.<br />
b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter ‚ÄúCommand Prompt‚Äù in the search box, tap or click Apps. <br />
c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press and hold on the ‚ÄúCommand Prompt‚Äù icon from the search result, and click/tap on the option ‚ÄúRun as administrator‚Äù on the application bar at the bottom.<br />
d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the command prompt window, type the following command, and then press ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the on-screen instructions and complete the scan.<br />
f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After the restart, check if you are able to open the .JPG file on the computer using Windows Photo Viewer.<br />
Important: It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.<br />
You may also run the Windows Update and check if this is caused by any missing updates for Windows Picture Viewer.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> Check for the latest Windows Updates.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type Windows update and hit enter.<br />
b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Windows Update.<br />
d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Check for updates now.<br />
e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When updates are available, you will see a message that tells you how many updates are available. You may install all the pending updates and restart the computer after that.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope it helps. Do contact us for further queries. We will be happy to assist.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you.</span></span></p>

            <p>Ok, sounds like the association is screwy.&nbsp; I would expect that in regedit under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.deskthemepack the default value there would be "desktopthemepackfile".&nbsp; Under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\desktopthemepackfile\shell\open\command I would expect the
 default value there to be REG_EXPAND_SZ value:</p>
<p>&nbsp;%SystemRoot%\system32\rundll32.exe %SystemRoot%\system32\themecpl.dll,OpenThemeAction %1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this not the case for you?&nbsp; Sounds like it isn't somehow for you.&nbsp; What is the default value under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.deskthemepack ?</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've used both of your methods the you recommended, there were no issues with running sfc, and the computer is up to date with the latest windows updates.&nbsp; Still not able to open the .deskthemepack files, but I am able to open other jpeg files on the
 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've had Windows 10 on the computer since the day it was released, and allowing the updates to happen automatically.&nbsp; No additions or removal of software since then.</p>

            One thing to add - I'm able to download and open other themes (Community Showcase Natural Landscapes - it used "Personalization CPL" to open the downloaded file) with no problem, but I am still not able to the panoramic themes (I do have a dual monitor
 system).

            <p>What happens when you select "Personalization CPL"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the full path to one of these themes to your system?&nbsp; You should be able to manually enter:</p>
<p>
</p><p>===</p>
<p>%SystemRoot%\system32\rundll32.exe %SystemRoot%\system32\themecpl.dll,OpenThemeAction "c:\fullpath\to\that\themefile.desktopthemepack"</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>at a WIN+R Run prompt to install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should generally be completely unnecessary, but somehow something decided to change what should be a unchanged association to the Photo Viewer. O_o</p>

            You might be able to use some form of changing the Open With default to that, but considering I don't know how you managed to get you into this state, I don't know how to narrate getting you out of it via text over the internet.&nbsp; Sorry: I can get you limping
 along here, but Windows Photo Viewer should never have taken that association in the first place. O_o

<p>
</p><p>It keeps telling me I have Nero - Burning CD software installed .. I don't .. I never installed it when I upgraded to Win10. There is no trace in the registry and the only folder with Nero in the name was pretty much empty apart from one .dll file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas how to rid myself of Nero so the install completes?</p>

I resolved this error by checking, defragging and optimising the drive, setting DEP to all programs, disconnecting all external drives etc and then installing from a USB stick. No Nero error.

    <title>Vista Complete PC Restore Error 0x80042407 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eric heavner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista Complete PC Restore Error 0x80042407</h2>
                    Ok, I have the need to move my install off of an unstable hardware raid 5 set which consists of three 500gb drives of the same type, model and size.&nbsp; This raid set is equivalent to a 1 terabyte drive of 931GB after it is formatted.<br />
<br />
I have performed a complete pc backup of this volume onto a 500GB external USB drive of a different type and model.<br />
<br />
I have a brand new, 1 terabyte drive of different model which I am trying to restore to.&nbsp; After numerous failed tries, I decided to run diskpart and create a partition, mark it active, quick format it as ntfs and label it 'system driv' but still no love.&nbsp; Regardless
 of what I do, I continue to get the following error:<br />
<br />
"The Windows Complete PC Restore Operation Failed"<br />
"Error Details:&nbsp; The disk that is set as active in bios is too small to recover the original system disk.&nbsp; Replace the disk with a larger one and retry the restore operation.&nbsp; (0x80042407)"&nbsp; There are now only three disks in this system - the backup USB disk,
 the C drive where I'm trying to restore to and the D drive DVD.<br />
<br />
Both the raid set and the new disk are formatted to the same size - 931GB.&nbsp;&nbsp;The backup data size is appx 400GB on the 500GB USB drive.&nbsp; Why will this not restore?&nbsp; Is this as simple as possibly having the restore drive being 3k smaller than the backed up drive?&nbsp;
 If that's the case, what if I have a server with a raid set and have to do a disaster recovery to a single drive of same size and it won't work.&nbsp; That basically renders Microsoft's new backup solution worthless.&nbsp; Do I now have to go out and buy a friggin 1.5
 Terabyte drive just to get this to work?&nbsp; Sheeeeesh.&nbsp; Every image backup software in the world has been able to restore to a smaller drive for over a decade.&nbsp; What's wrong with the new backup?

    <title>Tablet battery only charging when base is NOT connected to power - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Tablet battery only charging when base is NOT connected to power supply</h2>
                    <p>Dear community</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new Surface Book (i7, 512GB, with the Nvidia GPU in the base) and encountering the following strange behavior: when the tablet is connected to the base, the base battery is charging fine but not the tablet battery. When I disconnect the power supply
 from the base, the tablet battery switches in to the status "charging" and it definitely charges. As soon as I reconnect the power supply to the base, the charging of the tablet battery stops again. When I detach the tablet and connect it directly to the power
 supply, the tablet battery is also not charging. As my English is not such good, I took some photos to illustrate the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tablet on the base, base connected to the power supply, white LED is visible: base battery is charging but not the tablet battery:</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I detach the power supply from the base the tablet battery switches to "charging" and starts to charge:</p>

<p>
</p><p>What I have done so far: complete re-installation of Windows 10, installed all Windows updates, no additional software or peripheral devices installed / connected, uninstalled the battery drivers, cleaned all connection plugs, run the MS Software Repair
 Tool. Everything without success. So the situation is still: the tablet battery is only charging (from the base battery), when the base is not connected to the power supply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe someone has the same issue or an idea what else I could try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help!</p>

            Hi,
<br />Appears to be caused by memory corruption.
<br />
<br />As no drivers were named, 
<br />Let us try finding any misbehaving driver
<br />Enable Driver Verifier: 
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />(Must create a Restore point before)
<br />
<br />Upload the newer dumps when you get Driver_Verifier_detected_voilation. 
<br />
<br />Please note that the system might crash before you reach the desktop-if it does please let us know so that we can guide you to disable Verifier.

<div>The Logitech Gaming Virtual Bus Enumerator driver is 8.85.75.0 6/13/16. It wasn't picking up any updates though window update and wasn't allowing me to uninstall from the device manager, (grayed out).&nbsp; I went ahead and reinstalled the newest verison of
 the Logitech Gaming software to see if that had any effect,</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>Ref the IntelRST software I'm not sure where that is even from. I don't have any Optane hardware in the PC and never have. and I used the intel driver and support program and noting shows not updated.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>System writing 50kB to pagefile once per second despite no hard faults - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larry peterman  say:</h3>
<h2>            System writing 50kB to pagefile once per second despite no hard faults for any PID</h2>
                    In Vista on my laptop, PID 4 (NT Kernel &amp; System) is writing to pagefile.sys at a fairly steady rate of just over 50kB/s, with spikes every few seconds to 70-80kB/s, for no discernable reason. The read rate is zero. Under memory usage statistics, perfmon
 (Reliability and Performance Monitor) reports zero hard faults per second, and for every PID, zero hard faults per minute. Nothing else is reading or writing any files; PID 4 for pagefile.sys is the only entry in the "Disk" category. The writes make the hard
 disk seek, in a quick two-seek pattern once per second, sounding like a heartbeat.<br />
Perfmon reports no activity under "Network". There are no network connections to the system, and there's no keyboard or mouse activity.<br />
This problem happens apparently at random, sometimes for several minutes, sometimes for more than an hour, then stops, and the reported disk write rate drops to zero. Overall the problem occurs for the majority of the time that the system is running.<br />
The above description is of the system in its most settled state, while I'm trying to diagnose the problem and rule out various possible causes. The problem continues regardless of whether I'm actually using the system and causing various PIDs to hard fault
 and generate pagefile activity. There doesn't seem to be any correlation between the problem and time of day, whether I'm using the system or it's idle, how recently I resumed the laptop from sleep, whether the network is connected or not, whether various
 PIDs are hard faulting or not, or whether various other PIDs are accessing the disk or not.<br />
Has anybody else seen this problem? What causes it? What can I do to figure out what's causing it, and stop it? I have no idea how to investigate further, since it's the kernel itself.

<p><span>Hi Larry,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>How much RAM (Random-Access Memory)<strong> </strong>
</span><span>does your computer have?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:<span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span>Put the computer
 in clean boot and test<br />
<br />
</span><span>Follow&nbsp;<strong>Step 1&nbsp;</strong>in the link below,</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.</span></p>
<p><span>After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software
 you can consider uninstalling it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> - Remember to put the computer
 back to normal startup <strong>follow step 7</strong> in the link.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span>Please provide the details of your Physical Memory
 (MB) and System Commit (MB)&nbsp; from the Task manager. To get this information do the following</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Press CTRL+Shift+Esc to pull up Task Manager and Go to the<strong> Performance</strong> tab</span></p>

            Hi Ajay,<br />
Thanks for responding.<br />
For your Method 2: I have 2GB of memory, 1.45GB of which is used. Physical memory: total 2045, cached 715, free 2.<br />
Kernel memory: total 282, paged 250, nonpaged 32.<br />
System: handles 19193, threads 691, processes 64, uptime 473:42:10, page file 3002M / 4342M.<br />
The processor is a Core 2 Duo. I have Vista SP2 installed.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, for your Method 1, rebooting isn't a viable option. I have numerous documents open which I'm reading and working on, and setting my workspace back up after a reboot is a big hassle. I also have several command prompts open with session and command
 histories which I don't want to lose, two web browsers running each with a couple hundred MB of memory-cached pages which I don't want to wait forever to reload after rebooting, etc.<br />
<br />
Ordinarily my laptop stays running (but suspended every night) for 2-3 months until I get a BSOD or until Windows starts giving strange error messages when I try to start any programs, indicating some sort of resource exhaustion. After that I reboot, install
 the latest Windows updates which requires another reboot, then spend a few hours setting my workspace back up, and work until the next crash. The last time was two weeks ago.<br />
<br />
I understand the recommendation to go through a process of elimination, though that would take quite a while for me since I have a lot of programs and services which might be causing the problem. However, perfmon should show me all of the possible causes; what
 I'm concerned about is that perfmon is showing no possible causes at all, just that the kernel is writing to the pagefile apparently without cause.<br />
I guess I should back up then and ask a more basic question: what are the reasons, other than page faults (which I've already ruled out as the cause, as I explained in my original message), for which the kernel will write to the pagefile? The answer to that
 question will help diagnose the problem.<br />

            Process Explorer gives a lot more information in general but nothing in this case to tell me why PID 4 is writing to the pagefile.<br />
I didn't get any response about what are the reasons other than page faults for it to happen. I really think that would help to solve the mystery. Ajay?

<p>The Windows Memory Manager will proactively page out infrequently used pages. This avoids waiting for a page out when a page fault occurs. The paged out&nbsp;pages will remain in physical memory and can be reclaimed if needed before it is reallocated. The Memory
 Manager will do this when the system is idle.</p>

            Thanks, I'll watch those next time I have two hours to spare. If the memory manager does the proactive pageout for each page as soon as it passes the infrequency-of-use threshold, then that's likely what's causing my problem. It would be very nice if I
 could tell the memory manager to not do any proactive pageout until a few thousand pages pass the threshold, then batch write them all at once. That would stop this hideous heartbeat which I have to listen to while I'm working. Since I can't do that, I've
 started running a background program to read files at random in order to keep the disk thrashing, just to mask the sound of the heartbeat. It's almost driven me to the point of tearing up the planks.

                    Yesterday when I was on my laptop, something looked a little different. Things aren't as clear as they used to be and they almost appear fuzzy or a little stretched now... anyone have any ideas on how to fix this?
