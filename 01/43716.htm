<h2>            Windows account- email no longer in use</h2>
                    <p>Dear all, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the problem. Previously I was using my university email address for my windows/microsoft account - onedrive, windows 10, skype, etc. But now, since I have already graduated, the email address was taken back, and no longer valid. So, when I tried
 to add a new email address to my windows account, a security code was sent to my old email address!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wondering if it is still possible to continue using this account, or I have to create a new one. I can still get all the files on onedrive though, so no big deal.

            <p>Hi Philipm</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. But the situation here is still a bit different tho. My windows account is still active, and I have access to it. But the email address associated with it, which is university email address. is no longer existing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to add another email for my windows account, however, I need the security code sent to the original university email address, which no longer exist. I wish there could be other types of security checking, say, security questions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I should be fine. Nothing important on the original account. I can always register a new one.

<h2>            Is there any way to contact FACEBOOK Customer Care&#47; Tech Support&#63; i have had my FB ID stolen and i cannot contact a living soul&#33;</h2>
                    <b>Is there any way to contact FACEBOOK Customer Care/ Tech Support? </b>i have had my
<b>FB ID stolen</b> and i cannot contact a living soul! I am actually getting quite tired of FACEBOOK and ZUCKERBERG, he boasts getting his 1 billionth member, meanwhile his members are having problems with scams, hackers, even FACEBOOK is now BANNING people
 for adding family and friends! this has to be a scam of some kind seriously! Im sick of it, it has turned off my whole like for social networking. If it wasnt for the fact that I have nearly my whole family in Europe and all over the world all in the one place,
 I would definitely be deleting my account. The problem with that is, if you delete your FACEBOOK PROFILE, you dont actually delete them. FB keeps them as they are the property of Facebook the minute you put the post up! This information is in the terms and
 conditions of joining Facebook but not on the sign up page! whats wrong with this picture. THEY HAVE NO TECH SUPPORT, NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT, THERE IS NO PHONE NUMBER YOU CAN CALL TO REPORT YOUR ID BEING STOLEN AND NOW I HAVE TO DO ALL THE RUNNING AROUND TRYING
 TO FIND A CYBER CRIME UNIT THAT IS GOING TO HELP ME! the other thing, How do i know if Mytechgurus.com is a legitimate company. As i have been hacked and my ID stolen (oddly enough all this happened just as i was banned from Facebook for adding a friend i
 have not seen in 36 years. They deleted my friendship with her and banned me for 7 days!) from Facebook. MyTechGurus.com have charged me $700.00 for 2 pc's for 24/7 serivce for 2 years. Granted they have always been there in the last 6 weeks to help with all
 the problems the hacker had created. They have phoned me while i have had a tech online in remote access to help with verbal information as it was such a huge problem. but i am questioning it now because a governing body here in Australia called SCAM WATCH
 that is supposed to tell you who is a scam and who is not was only good enough to tell me that they are there only to report a scam they cannot physically tell you if any of them actually are a scam or not! I have been left to literally chase my own tail!
 THERE IS NO-ONE TO HELP ME AT ALL!

<h2>            Assistance with the analysis of Dump file</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
I am having blue screen issues. My laptop would crash and comes up with blue screen randomly sometime within few min of booting and other times few hrs. I have performed detailed hard-drive check, memory check as well as re-installed whole windows by formatting
 the hard drive. Still no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have also done now is saved *.dmp file. I am trying to analyse the same but not really sure whats the issue. Can some one help and suggest the possible issue. I am putting cut and paste of 'debug' file below. I believe I performed correct debugging
 with my novice experience. If some one wants I can send *.dmp file also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in Advance.</p>

SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED_M (1000007e)<br />
This is a very common bugcheck. &nbsp;Usually the exception address pinpoints<br />
the driver/function that caused the problem. &nbsp;Always note this address<br />
as well as the link date of the driver/image that contains this address.<br />
Some common problems are exception code 0x80000003. &nbsp;This means a hard<br />
coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but this system was booted<br />
/NODEBUG. &nbsp;This is not supposed to happen as developers should never have<br />
hardcoded breakpoints in retail code, but ...<br />
If this happens, make sure a debugger gets connected, and the<br />
system is booted /DEBUG. &nbsp;This will let us see why this breakpoint is<br />
happening.<br />
Arguments:<br />
Arg1: ffffffffc0000005, The exception code that was not handled<br />

            <p>Hi Vijya Kumari / Gary / others,</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE</p>
<p>
</p><p>I gave up on looking at the issue by myself. I ended up taking computer to the tech shop where the person changed the hard drive. Its been few days now and it seems to be working fine so the problem was hard drive in this case !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whoever else reading the message... FYI, I performed through hard drive check 3 times (it took 2 - 3 hrs each time) and my hard drive passed the check every time. I asked the tech shop person and he mentioned that it is sometimes possible that hard drive
 would pass the check but is faulty. This is a small advice for others who are trouble shooting the devices in my case since hard drive passed the test I ruled out hard drive problem and ended up paying 100$ on 40$ hard drive :(.<br />
</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>Amit</p>
<p />

            Hi Jivko 
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with remote desktop.
<br />
<br />Let's start by launching this manually.  At the launch type Remote Desktop Connection.  You should see it pop up on your screen.  If it finds it you can right click on it and select, either Pin to Start or Pin to taskbar.
<br />
<br />Let me know if this works.  If it doesnt it probably needs to get reinstalled.  Let me know if it doesnt so we can reinstall.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask me any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

    <title>Installing Windows on GPT disk without UEFI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> _luke_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing Windows on GPT disk without UEFI</h2>
                    Is it possible? <br />
I've tried using DUET and hybrid-MBR, but none of them seemed to work(nothing changed). Ready to try anything experimental, beta, or not-designed-to-do-that-but-still-works software. I tried windows 7 and 8 64-bit, all display the same error(GPT table detected,
 it cannot be installed here or smth like that). I even dug up some old Windows XP, but it doesn't even recognize partitions(that could be 32-bit version though, I'm not sure).<br />
<br />
And reformatting whole hard drive isn't an option, would rather stick with Linux.<br />
<br />
All the best,<br />
Luke<br />

The GUID Partition Table (GPT) was introduced as part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) initiative. So to use GPT partitioning style the motherboard should support UEFI mechanism. As your motherboard does not support UEFI, it is not possible
 to use GPT partitioning style on the hard disk. </span></font></font></font></p>

<h2>            Surface RT shuts down without warning</h2>
                    <p>I'm not sure if this started happening with the 8.1 Preview or not, but lately when the battery dips below 10%, my Surface RT will suddenly shut down without warning.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any one else experience this? Is this normal behavior, or an issue with 8.1?</p>

            <p>I know it is late and all, but I just marked your response as helpful. I didn't do what you suggested though, I just waited for the full release of Win8.1 to come out and updated to that. This problem hasn't cropped up since, so I'll just chalk it up to
 an issue with incomplete software.</p>

            HI Megann. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There's no Setting to choose a folder by default like in the scanner software.  If you install the full printer/scanner software you'll have more options..
<br />
<br />From the Fax and Scan interface click on the toolbar "Save As" and choose where you want to place the scan each time.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>System Restore is not a "harsh option."&nbsp; It will simply restore the registry to what it was before you made the change.&nbsp; It's the simplest and best option, especially when your initial messing around with the registry didn't turn out as you thought it might.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Sculpt wireless mouse suddenly stopped working</h2>
                    I have been using the Sculpt keyboard and mouse combo for a while. Last night when I left the office, I removed the USB receiver from my laptop as usual and left it with the mouse. This morning, when I went to plug it back in, the keyboard was working
 but the mouse was no longer able to move the cursor. I've replaced the batteries twice just in case, each time the blue light at the bottom would come on and the mouse itself would look as though it was working, but the cursor on the screen wouldn't move (I
 can use the laptop's trackpad just fine. In the device manager, the computer recognizes an HID-compliant mouse and says "This device is working properly." I plugged the receiver into other microsoft computers in the office and have the same issue. Again, the
 wireless keyboard using the same receiver is still working fine. What can I do?

            Hi KatharinePan ... first of all any reason why you remove the USB receiver from your laptop?  Is it because you are moving your laptop?
<br />
<br />Right click start and go to device manager.
<br />Go to Mouse
<br />Right click mouse and click uninstall device.
<br />Reboot

            Yes, I usually have to pack it up at the end of the day, either to take it away or secure it, and I don't want to break the receiver as it sticks out a little far. Also I should probably specify that the model I have is the Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Keyboard
 and mouse (this one:&nbsp;https://express.google.com/u/0/product/6404319939087043668_6202916127893882763_125181302?utm_source=google_shopping&amp;utm_medium=tu_cu&amp;utm_content=eid-lsjeuxoeqt&amp;gtim=CJO6mI-s7--NGRDx27zQ7Jvfk-QBGPC_zRwiA1VTRCigw__hBTD2utg7&amp;utm_campaign=125181302&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6qfA5eXe3wIVg7lkCh3XlAwAEAQYASABEgKqZfD_BwE).

            Figured that's why you were unplugging it
<br />Did you try uninstalling the device and rebooting to see if plug and play picks up it properly?

            I didn't think of that, but I just tried it and it still only picks up the keyboard. Also, I plugged the receiver into a desktop and a different make of laptop and neither picked up the mouse.

<p>Upgrade paths:<br />
When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. In your case, you can upgrade to Windows 7 depending on edition and architecture of Windows Vista
 you have installed. If you are running a 32 bit version of Vista and want to upgrade to a 64 bit version (edition of Windows 7), you will have to a do clean install, this applies vice-versa.<br />
<br />
If you are running consumer editions of Windows Vista such as Home Basic or Premium, you can only upgrade to either Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate. Also, you cannot do downgrades, which means, if you are running Windows Vista Ultimate now, you cannot downgrade
 to Windows 7 Home Premium. You must do logical upgrades:<br />
<br />
Windows Vista Home Basic &gt; Windows 7 Home Basic, Premium or Ultimate<br />
Windows Vista Home Premium &gt; Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate<br />
Windows Vista Business &gt; Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise or Ultimate<br />
Windows Vista Enterprise &gt; Windows 7 Enterprise<br />
Windows Vista Ultimate &gt; Windows 7 Ultimate.</p>
<p>32 vs 64 bit<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions<br />
<br />
Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit<br />
<br />
Windows 7 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 7 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than 32
 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 7 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 7.</p>

<br />
You need to have the specific disc depending on the architecture (32 or 64 bit) you want to install.<br />

<p>No its not the processor, more like motherboard properly recognizing the added memory (SPD values, Voltage and timing issues). May work just fine but you need to be sure.</p>

                    <p>Hey y'all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I had a severe problem on booting of my computer and after several minutes it got to function properly. Now, while the date appears normal as it should (<em>13.02.18.</em>), the time appears somewhat unusual (example: 10:39am appears as
<em>N\4PV</em>. Here is even proof below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a4cbbdaf-6d8f-4ab9-9c3c-d6f5392d2d54?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a4cbbdaf-6d8f-4ab9-9c3c-d6f5392d2d54?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>How do I fix this issue? When I open the calendar the long time appears properly, and even the short time appears normally when I insert a timestamp on Notepad (F5).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

            No you cannot. It has been discontinued for several years now. Quicken 2016 is a good replacement program. It should be able to import your Money files.

            Thanks for your response. Are you positive. I ask because I recently updated my windows 7 ( which allows me to use the 2000 money program ) to windows 10 and I was able to use the money program. I am in the process of purchasing a new computer with windows
 10 and I just want to make sure I can use my 2000 program. Called microsoft but they can not answer the question.

            Good question and I understand why you are confused. The answer is I want to make sure I can use it on a different computer and when I ask the computer manufacturer ( Dell ) and Microsoft, believe it or not, they really can't say for sure it will work.
 They say, try it and if it doesn't work, return the computer. Can you believe that?

            I can believe it because it was a good answer.&nbsp; There are reports here of people not being able to use versions of Money considerably newer than yours.&nbsp; It can never be predicted with 100% assurance that any old software will work in new Windows versions,
 and there's a chance that yours won't work on a different computer.&nbsp; <br />

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows

<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1: Perform an online virus scan</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>Sometimes malware, spyware, adware, Trojan or viruses commonly hide behind the mask of Winlogon.exe consuming all the system resources. So, I would
 suggest you to perform a complete virus scan on your computer. Visit the link below for the same.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2: Perform a clean boot</span></span></em></strong></p>

<h2>            How can I open compressed files &#40;zip&#41;&#63; I cannot get the Compressed Folder Tools command</h2>
                    I have followed the instructions on how to open zipped files. Nothing works. I open File Explorer but there is no menu that takes me to the<strong> Compressed Tools</strong> command and hence I cannot click
<strong>Extract all. </strong>I have clicked on the <strong>Home</strong> tab and on
<strong>Properties,</strong>&nbsp; but the <strong>General </strong>tab does not give me the option
<strong>Opens with, File Explorer. </strong>

            <p>Do this and ignore all the other responses:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to your control panel. Click on Programs (not uninstall a program, but the actual Programs link). Under "default programs" you'll see a link that says, "Make a file type always open in a specific program."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Form there, look for the file extension .zip and click it to highlight it and then click on&nbsp;File Explorer (I think that's it, now that I fixed mine I can't find .zip in the list anymore but you'll know which program to choose when you see it by the folder
 icon).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that you're golden!</p>
