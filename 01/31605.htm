<p>Seriously a terrible ending and i hope they make ff13-3. As the end has potentially ruined both ff games.</p>

<p>I agree. Final Fantasy XIII had a proper uplifting ending. XIII-2 has a depressing ending where Serah dies. And the Lightning DLC Serah dies again in Valhalla. Ironically you can still play as Serah even after playing the DLC and the main story. I still
 love both games but i like XIII better. </p>

<p>Umm SE announced that at the end of August, they have a big announcement on what will happen with the story of FFXIII. They said there will be no more DLC for 13-2, so everyone thinks 13-3 will be announced. You want a source, just go yo any video game site,
 .ie Kotaku.com lol</p>

            <p>Are you sure that WLMail is changing the file name? </p>
<p>As far as I can tell, WLMail will only change the filename in this way if there are two periods before the file extension. This can happen if you allow the application that is producing the PDF to create the file name. For example, a Word document entitled
<em>Annual Report. </em>could well become a file named <em>Annual Report..pdf </em>
or <em>Annual_Report..pdf </em>when saved as PDF. </p>
<p>There is a default&nbsp;option in Windows (XP and later) that <em>Hides extensions for known file types</em>. With this option selected, it's not easy to detect faults like the one you're seeing. Those example PDFs would appear in Windows Explorer simply as
<em>Annual Report.</em> and <em>Annual_Report.</em></p>
<p>While it is legal in some circumstances to use a period ('.') in a file name, many systems will choke on such a file name because the period is used to separate the file name part from the extension. If there is more than one period, a program may not be
 able to work out where the file name stops and the extension begins. That is why WLMail changes one of them to an underscore character.</p>
<p>To avoid the problem, ensure that the <em>Hide extensions... </em>option is not selected at Control Panel &gt; Folder Options &gt; View, and don't use periods in file names.</p>
<p>For the recipient to be able to use the file you sent, he only has to remove the underscore character from the file extension. In many mail programs - including WLMail -&nbsp;you can right-click on an attachment and select
<em>Save as</em>. This gives you the opportunity to change the file name.</p>

I don't think you are getting the point exactly. Having to go through all the steps and time consumption to and to save it into the extension (.pdf) is ridiculous. My android doesn't have to save it to open it nor does my GMAIL account. It is a microsoft &nbsp;and
 Windows Live Mail issue. Computers are there to speed things up, not slow them down.

            It's a Windows thing - some versions of Windows don't like files whose names end with two periods and an extension. Other operating systems - like Android - clearly don't care. I just tried opening a PDF file with Adobe Reader X. If the file name ends
 in ..pdf, it won't open. If&nbsp;I&nbsp;remove one of the periods,&nbsp;it will.<br />
<br />
You didn't mention that you were trying to <em>open</em> the&nbsp;attachment directly from a mail message. I haven't done that with any attachment for more years than I care to remember; it's one of the commonest and surest ways of catching a virus.
<br />
<br />
The fault, if any, lies with who- or whatever named the file in the first place.<br />

            First and foremost, I am not computer illiterate. The person I am receiving the file from sends it out as .PDF, not ._PDF. There is NOT a double (..PDF) file extension. Again it is a Windows Live Mail thing that somehow is converting the file extension.
 BTW, I have never had a virus on any of my computers because I NEVER open anything I don't expect or know exactly who is sending me something. I scan anything coming in I might find questionable.

            <p>Sorry if you think I underestimated you. There are a lot of people out there who routinely open attachments without knowing what to expect.<br />
<br />
You can see what filename the sender gave the file by examining the message source. It will be shown (probably twice, as both
<em>name=</em> and <em>filename=</em>) in the header for the part that contains the attachment. In my experience, this filename will not change unless it contravenes some rule. To see the source, select the message and press Ctrl-F3. I'd be interested to hear
 if it's different from what you see in the WLMail message header bar.</p>

I just made some tests here before coming to say this...<br />
For instance, I sent a mail with some file <b>ABC...xls</b>, from WLM, and the receiver gets the message with the attachment like
<b>ABC._xls</b> !! That is, if the receiver uses WLM either. If the receiver uses Microsoft Outlook, or Mozilla Thunderbird, the file shows as normal (<b>ABC...xls</b>)<br />
More, if I look at the message source, in WLM, at the sender, as well as the receiver, the file is shown with the correct name (the name presented in the source of the mail), despite in the interface is with the underscore (so the user cannot open it directly
 from WLM...)<br />
<br />
The problem arises for XLS files, as well as DOC file, or PDF files, or JPG files (that's what I've tested here, and I think it's enough testing to say the problem shows for all kind of files with the same issue in their name (those multiple dots before extension)).<br />
<br />
I would be grateful if there is some sort of workaround INSIDE WLM software, or even in the registry, to tweak this problem...<br />

<br />
That may be a <em>legal </em>file name, but it's by no means <em>normal&nbsp;</em>in Windows. It cannot be used, for example,&nbsp;in some widespread applications like SharePoint.

While&nbsp;this bug may be an inconvenience, it's no show-stopper. I know of no way to change the behaviour.<br />

            I just recently (today) have experienced this same issue.&nbsp; I have been saving my Excel files as .xls and for the people who don't have Excel they've been saved as .pdf.&nbsp; I email the .pdf files as attachments through my Yahoo mail account with no previous
 trouble.&nbsp; Today, a customer of mine informed me that she couldn't open a .pdf file I sent to her.&nbsp; She returned the file to me as an attachment and it returned as _pdf.&nbsp; Now, she has a Cox.net cable email account and, therefore, is probably using Microsoft
 Live Mail or Outlook as her email program.&nbsp; I followed the double period (..) thread above because my files are addresses with abbreviations for Dr., St., Ave., etc.&nbsp; So, the file could end as Dr..pdf.&nbsp; When I removed 1 period from the file name and saved
 it as a .pdf, I could send it through my Yahoo account and receive it in my secondary Cox.net cable account.&nbsp; Like my customer, I use Microsoft Live Mail to open Cox.net emails.&nbsp; Prior to today, no one has ever had any problems that have been reported to me.<br />

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Have you install any third party Antivirus software in your computer?</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Please follow the Method given below to check if its helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1</strong>: Perform clean boot and try to start Simatic program.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2</strong>: I would recommend you to Disable Antivirus and try to start Simatic program.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Important Note</strong>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other
 software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 3</strong>: Turn Windows Firewall on or off and try to start Simatic program.</span></span></p>

    <title>Mail app crashing when opening any message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mohammed hamdy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail app crashing when opening any message</h2>
                    <p>Mail was working fine until yesterday. I have 2 GMail accounts registered in there. The app opens fine and it shows new messages as well. If I click on a new message to open it, it appears to be loading the message content for a little while then the app
 window closes completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I enabled the&nbsp;<strong><span>verbose diagnostic logging</span></strong> from the&nbsp;<strong>Help
</strong>menu option but I'm not sure how to actually see those logs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also reset the <strong>Mail</strong> app from the <strong>Apps &amp; Features</strong> control panel. One thing to note is that resetting/reinstalling Mail resets all settings except for my accounts which survived the reset somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I diagnose this?</p>

            Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Setup your account in Mail and check if the problem happens there too.

<p>Hello, &nbsp;We just purchase our XBOX 360 on Monday and decided tonight to sign up for XBOX Live. &nbsp;I did so on the parent account because I didn't want my credit card on his gamertag. &nbsp; He says that he can't use XBOX Live. &nbsp;Is there a way to make this a family
 or console access? &nbsp;I don't want to have to pay for this twice. &nbsp;thanks.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Microsoft has discontinued the family gold plan There is no way to make your new console a family console. You would need to either purchase an Xbox Live subscription for your son or allow him to play on your account which already has a gold
 membership. Just an FYI the family console is something that you can do on the Xbox One which releases on November 22</p>

<p>Thank you to all that asnwere my question &nbsp; I logged into the parent account and it was showing that the gaming online was allowed for my son's gamertag. &nbsp;I did go to customer settings and enabled everything that I could. &nbsp;At sign out it said that it may
 take 4 hours to be effective. &nbsp;We're hoping that he can play this evening. &nbsp;It only seems logical that the subscription would be PER CONSOLE and not PER GAMERTAG because if I had 3 children the cost would be $180.00. &nbsp;That would totaly unacceptable for my
 budget and price gouging IMHO. &nbsp; So here's hoping we can get online this evening. &nbsp; Thanks again.</p>

    <title>Unable to recover Image Backup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> piperson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to recover Image Backup</h2>
                    <p>My PC is an Asus I5 laptop originally delivered with a Win 7 Pro 64Bit OS. It had been configured to dual boot with a old version of Ubuntu Linux OS.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, I did the upgrade to Windows 10 and also began doing regular backups to a large network connected hard drive.&nbsp; In fact, I have a current backup and WindowsImageBackup dated less than a week ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the problem.... The Windows side worked well, but the Linux would not connect to the network&nbsp; with Wifi. So I decided that it was time to upgrade the Linux. I loaded the latest version 17.4 (was 12.2), and in the process, inadvertently wiped the previous
 OS's and partitions!&nbsp;&nbsp; Oops!&nbsp; Oh well, I can recover from my backup image files.&nbsp; Right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I attempted to use a System Recovery disk created on another Win10 64Bit PC, which of course failed to boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I downloaded the Windows 10 Installation files and rebuilt the laptop without any particular difficultly.&nbsp; Now, I want to reload my old partitions and system from the backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Numerous attempts to get Windows to recognize the network stored backup image files have failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas out there which will help my load the previous image?</p>
<p>

            What you report does not surprise me. Unfortunately the native Windows image creation facility is both rather basic and somewhat unreliable. This is why I have been using Acronis TrueImage for many years. If you prefer a free product then

<h2>            Online Help - Touch Pad and Right Click</h2>
                    <p>I've just been looking at the Online Help for Windows 8.1, and I was wondering where the feature "Right Click" is described.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would think that there would be a paragraph about it somewhere in the Help, using keypad mouse etc, but no, all you get is something that tells you what you can do with a Right Click if you could find out how to generate one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a Packard Bell Easynote (ENTG71BM to be precise) with WIndows 8.1 pre-installed. The touch pad is not divided in two so there is no "Right" to click. There are no Left nor Right buttons below the keypad either. I tried clicking in the right hand
 part of the touch pad but this did not generate a "Right Click". &nbsp;The expected context menus were not displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Microsoft how do you plan to share this great secret with the public at large? Obviously not in your Help files.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Dirty Drive&#59; chkdsk won&#39;t check&#59; chkntfs is no help</h2>
                    Hi, I have an issue with my drive c: which holds my OS.&nbsp; It began running chkdsk on startup, but chkdsk would hang.&nbsp; Eventually my command prompt instructed me to mark C: as dirty.&nbsp; After that chkdsk stopped running on startup, everything appeared normal.&nbsp;
 Until I tried to backup my computer and found that I couldn't due to the dirty drive.&nbsp; I have tried to scan C: and repair it using various combinations of chkdsk and chkntfs, however since my OS is on that drive, I have to reboot to "lock the drive" to scan
 with the /f&nbsp;or /r and other paramaters set.&nbsp; When I reboot, chkdsk does not appear to run.&nbsp; It says it is going to run unless I press a key, and then counts down, but then doesn't run.&nbsp; fsutil dirty query each time reports C: is still dirty.&nbsp; Due to this I
 cannot back up my computer&nbsp;using&nbsp;windows.&nbsp; Is there a Registry problem? Physical damage? The computer that I have this on is only 3 months old, the problem is about 6 weeks old.&nbsp; Thanks for any help in advance.<br />

            At the Command Prompt, type "chkdsk /f" and hit Enter. If it says the volume is in use, it will give an option to select y/n to run the check on restart. Type "y", hit Enter. This is supposed to run chkdsk for each subsesequent startup until disabled by
 cancelling the scan within the alotted time. However, on my 2K, for some reason this is a run once, and then the registry resets to normal startup.<br />

            If you are getting that message, you are running WordPad, not Word. WordPad is a component of Windows and everyone running Windows has it; Word is a component of Microsoft Office, and you have it only if you bought it. My guess is that you didn't buy it.

 Apps" and "Recycle Bin".&nbsp; How can I return my apps and whole systems appearance to the point before I refreshed it.
</p>
<p>It appears that the problem with the web site is now sorted and it appears to have been an error at their end.</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice and hope you can help me. If I have any further issues with the systems I now know how to get help from a professional.</p>

            <p>Hi, My PC is less than 12mths old and came from Dell with Windows 10.</p>
<p>The web site issue was (I have now found out) a problem at their end as I received an e-mail which started "Opps, we are so sorry..."</p>
<p>I refreshed my PC on 3rd July and now the screen that appears after initial password screen has lost all the icons leaving only "Removed Apps" and "Recycle Bin".</p>
<p>When I click on the windows symbol - bottom left hand corner- the screen I kept my most popular web sites, i.e. Banking, Gas/Elec, Amazon, regular business web sites.</p>
<p>This screen has been much reduced and doesn't behave like I remember, when I tried to look at some documents I had made, I could not find them at first. After entering Word into the Cortina help, I was directed to Word Pad and after I managed to open some
 work the message came up "WordPad does not support all of the features of this document's format. Some contents might be missing or displayed improperly".</p>
<p>I tried to start a new document but was unable to move the bars at the top of the screen to allow the page to spread sideways (not sure what they called soz- not very techno) anyway I could not move them and from what I did before the refresh the other options
 on the tool bar would not appear. That was when I started to ask the windows web site for help, I just want to return my PC and systems to a point before 3rd July with the removed apps returned and word back to normal.</p>
<p>I am diabetic&nbsp;on insulin (&nbsp;7 injections and 10 tablets A DAY)&nbsp;and use my PC to record collect and send my Blood Glucose readings (7 a day) to my Diabetic nurse with the help of the "FreeStyle Diabetic data&nbsp;web site and keep a record of them in my documents
 folder( which I can not find) so I need to reverse this mistake I made in order to perhaps find my missing info. So that is why I asked the windows community for help and if in future I need support this is where I will come.</p>
<p>Hope you can help, Many thanks,</p>
<p>Mrs Bello</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sorry but I'm not techno savvy and it has been a bit difficult&nbsp;for me to get use to windows 10.</p>
<p>I'm&nbsp;sure I went into settings and tried to find the Control Panel which I used in my previous PC with windows vista to take the system back to a point before an error occurred.&nbsp; I couldn't a find familiar path so some how I found a page in the new windows
 10 style font that talked about correcting a system error and I think it gave 3 options telling you&nbsp;what it does and what will happen. I know now I should have used the windows community to help.</p>
<p>I really hope I can return the system back to how it was on 1st July, as it shows on the page "removed apps" at the bottom&nbsp;that the date was "3rd July at 22.38"&nbsp;&nbsp;( the apps removed&nbsp;have obviously left the system in a mess).</p>
<p>I hope you can help and advise me (please in very lay-mans (woman's terms). Many thanks, Mrs Bello&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Destravado eu tenho minhas vantagens de ter varios jogos e fazer final neles.</p>

<p>Amigão, realmente os jogos no Brasil não tem os melhores preços, porém é muito fácil encontrar bons jogos em lojas online tradicionais como CASAS BAHIA, AMERICANAS, PONTO FRIO por valores bem acessíveis, eu mesmo comprei ASSASSIN'S CREED BROTHERHOOD por
 R$ 62,00 em uma promoção, há também a possibilidade de se comprar jogos usados em boas condições via MERCADO LIVRE, uma opção que uso bastante é o site TROCAJOGO já fiz diversas trocas de games que já terminei ou mesmo não curti, tenho um console travado e
 outro destravado, comprei o destravado primeiro e quando coloquei ele na LIVE percebi como é legal, após um ano com ele me rendi e comprei um travado, tenho aproximadamente 10 games originais, todos comprados com muito suor, porém esses poucos jogos originais
 tem uma vida útil muito maior quando você joga na LIVE, já no console destravado tenho aproximadamente 200 jogos, quando eu e meu filho vamos jogos acabamos sempre jogando os jogos originais. Meus 2 consoles estão na LIVE sei que mais cedo ou mais tarde a
 MICROSOFT vai banir meu destravado, ele está com a IEXTREME LT+ 2.0 e games como BATTLEFIELD 3 não roda na LIVE, apenas OFF LINE, acabei comprando o original, por enquanto a MICROSOFT não está BANINDO, deve ser algum tipo de SEGUNDA CHANCE para os donos de
 CONSOLES DESTRAVADOS, até quando essa bondade toda vai durar eu não sei, porém só sei que está complicado ficar pagando R$ 80,00 para atualizar o destravamento, e olha que eu atualizei o meu para o 2.0 em outubro e já saiu o 3.0 e se for por na caneta R$ 80,00
 já da para comprar no MERCADO LIVRE um FORZA 4 que é super lançamento, amigão agora a escolha é sua, coloca tudo na balança e faça o melhor negócio!

<p>Não são caros se você comprar no lugar certo, não comprar lançamento e ter a paciência de esperar chegar...Por exemplo comprei meu alpha protocol por R$53,00 incluso o frete NOVO,LACRADO,C/ NOTA FISCAL...jogão que quando saiu estava R$200,00...Hoje em dia
 com R$100,00 (4000 microsoft points) você compra <strong>pelo menos</strong> 2 bons jogos pela Live US..Agora você vai lá e destrava (paga uns R$100,00) que na verdade tem&nbsp; que destravar a cada 2 meses (é o tempo que sai uma nova atualização) paga R$10,00
 por um DVD mal feito que estraga o canhão do dvd coisa que em 1,5 anos em média faz com que seu console vá para o saco fazendo com que você compre OUTRO xbox porque você PERDEU a garantia porque você destravou! Então a longo prazo temos os dois tipos de perfis
 vamos analisar supondo a utilização das vantagens em ambos os casos em um período de 2 anos:</p>
<p><span>1° O cara que comprou o console <strong>DESTRAVADO</strong>:</span></p>
<p>A. Xbox com Hd de bom tamanho= <strong>R$1100,00</strong> (sem garantia extendida pra que? vai destravar mesmo!)</p>
<p>B. Em 24 meses ele teve que desbloquear seu console 12 vezes (pois é uma atualização para acabar com o desbloqueio a cada bimestre)= R$100,00 x 12=
<strong>R$1200,00</strong></p>
<p>C.200 jogos piratas a R$10,00 cada (onde você ganha muito gamerscore que serve para absolutamente
<p>D. Em média o canhão vai pra saco em 1,5 anos levando em consideração o uso de mídias de PÉSSIMA&nbsp; qualidade (pois são piratations) fazendo com que você compre OUTRO Xbox (igual o do coitado do amigo do meu primo...¬¬) porque você PERDEU a garantia pois destravou
 o console= <strong>R$799,00</strong> (comprou um arcade pois Hd o cara já tem)</p>
<p><strong><span>TOTAL= <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">R$5099,00</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>2° O cara que comprou <strong>ORIGINAL</strong></span></p>
<p>A. Xbox com HD de bom tamanho= <strong>R$1300,00</strong> (COM garantia extendida de 3 ANOS)</p>
<p>B. 2 anos de XBOX LIVE= 2xR$100,00=<strong>R$200,00</strong> para jogar online porque ficar sem jogar online é uma bosta champz!</p>
<p>C.Não tenho muita grana mas a cada 2 meses dá pra comprar um jogo de R$150,00 em média em 24 meses= 12x R150,00=<strong>R$1800,00</strong></p>
<p>D. Sem gastos com canhão....tenho garantia extendida modafuca :) = <strong>R$0,00</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>TOTAL= <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">R$3300,00</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Pela análise dos dados</span> podemos concluir que o
<span><strong>RICO</strong><strong> E BURRO</strong></span> aqui não é o cara que comprou ORIGINAL NÃO É MESMO?</p>

<p>Sem contar o fato de que com menos jogos você se torna muito mais seletivo e aproveita muito mais os detalhes de cada jogo, conheço gente que tem muitos jogos, mas não jogou quase nada deles, demorando mais pra comprar você pode experiênciar o jogo, pensar
 bem e pesquisar antes de comprar, se envolver com o jogo, tentar fechar as conquistas, aproveitar bastante, ai quando enjoar ou desgostar do game há a opção de trocá-lo.</p>

<p>Vende seu Xbox, compra um ps3 e seja feliz. Não me importo de pagar por algo de qualidade, e a live tem muito mais qualidade do que a sony network. Falar que não se arrependeu de ter um 64 ... eu tive e foi a pior coisa que fiz na vida.</p>
<p>Coisas sem sentido a parte, esta história de jogos caros é mito. Você compra jogos na live por 40, 60, 80 Reais. Os jogos arcade saem entre 15 e 30 reais cada. O que adianta ter um pirata com 150 jogos se vc nao joga 5?
</p>
<p>E quanto a live do Brasil, pode ainda não ser tão boa quanto a americana, mas a microsoft acredita no Brasil A nintendo e a Sony tem suporte nacional?</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Blank Screen after last System Update</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone.</p>

<p>Bought my Xbox and since then, I have had no problems with him. I love my console. But with last system update, that reintroduced the battery level indicator, my console is having a issue.</p>
<p>Every time I put it on standby and I turn it on, the console boots normally but when I start some app or game, the screen goes blank. Only the sound is present.<br />
I can turn it off with voice comands, but if I turn it on the console, it starts on blank screen.</p>
<p>I double check cables, configs e etc. I restart my TV, reset its settings, and the problem still there. I did the same with the console&nbsp;restarting its settings and all sttufs.</p>
<p>I changed the TV and the problem occurs still. I Changed the HDMI cables too, by the way.</p>
<p>The only way to make it work property is shutting down completely the console, apart it from the outlet. I know that this is wrong, becouse the console is in suspend mode and I can hear the sound of the internal HD make a noise.</p>
<p>My console is working only in full turn off mode, to prevent that, but the boot time of this mode is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;L&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W...</p>
<p>Is someone having this issue too? Can someone help me with that? Has the Xbox One some kind of "master reset" so I can try to fix this?</p>

<p>Thanks for the help and sorry for my english.</p>

<p>A broug</p>

<p>People were associating this problem with the Titanfall beta, but many have realized that the problem was with the new update. It happens with any app or game randomly.</p>
<p>On Titanfall beta foruns players are complaining about this issue, thinking that is a problema with the beta.</p>

<p>This is nothing to do with the Titanfall Beta, I was playing Ryse yesterday and went back to home screen via kinect voice and I was black screened - I was in a party and they started coming through my TV, turned off X1 and restarted and still black screen
 with all voice commands working. I thought it might be my HDMI cable as I was using one I already had so I changed it to the one supplied, but while doing this I unplugged my X1 form the power supply. Turned back on and all okay so far, haven't turned it back
 on since but this must be related to the last system update.</p>
<p>Other sites are saying do a hard reset by holding the X1 on/off button down for 5 seconds to sort the black screen issue, well I say to $MS get this issue sorted.</p>

<p>Soft reset fixes this for the most part guys. I'm sure you read the logistics, but in case. press and hold the X1 power button for 5-10 seconds until it powers down. Next, unplug the rear power plug from unit. wait 30 seconds, plug back in and press consoles
 power button. Wait for longer boot up and hopefully all will be back for ya. Note, this "fix" seems to be a the first defense for any issues you may have. From what I have seen thus far, 99% of the time this will take care of a plethora of issues. Hopefully
 MS gets a patch out that addresses this.</p>

<p>Reset worked 1st time. not second. Tried the whole low rez thing from the support page. Lost signal to tv as soon as I changed the setting back to 1080p. Now I am lucky If I can get the logo to appear. I now own a $600 black painted brick.

<p>In all honesty, its good they want to do that. For one they are not at this point 100% sure as to why, so instead of putting you thru the ringer of trial and error, they just want to replace it as that at this point is the most viable in terms of sanity.
 &nbsp;They did that for my Kinect a month or so ago. To me I didn't think it would make a difference and ultimately it didn't but that stepping stone assured MS its not a hardware issue, rather something else. And of course there was always that chance it would
 have. &nbsp;Either way, I appreciate they want to try and not have me beat a dead horse. For a company that is willing to just send you out a new unit is pretty good in my book.

<p>yes, but in the same sense if MS just looked into it and announced it was some sort of an issue I would know I would just need to wait. &nbsp;I just wanted them to look into it that is all since there are many reports.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Make sure that you’re using the latest version of Skype. You may uninstall the Skype app and reinstall with the latest version. Also, you may delete
 the shared.xml and config.xml file on the Skype folder, below are the steps on how to.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Quit Skype by selecting
<strong>Skype</strong> &gt; <strong>Quit Skype</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Open
<strong>~/Library/Application Support </strong>* you will see there the Skype folder.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. On the Skype folder, find and delete the
<strong>shared.xml </strong>file. If file extensions are not displayed on your computer, the file will just be called
<strong>shared</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Then open the
<strong>folder</strong> under your <strong>Skype name</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Find and delete the

<h2>            Warranty of xbox one controller</h2>
                    &nbsp;I bought an xbox one controller and came with a mechanical issue on the right bumper but. I can't give it back to the store because I lost the ticket so my question is: An xbox one controller has warranty on the Microsoft device service?, can I send it
 to microsoft so they can repair it?.

<p>If it is within the <strong>90 day&nbsp;</strong>purchasing<strong>&nbsp;</strong>period, you can register your controller with
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Device Services</a>. Make sure you are signed in to your Microsoft account to begin and select '<strong>Register a new device</strong>'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From here, you need to remove the battery compartment on the controller and look for a serial number. Once you have located the serial number, go ahead and enter it in followed by some additional information that pertains to your device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once finished, select '<strong>Create a Repair Code</strong>' and ensure that you have inputted your mailing address. After that, there will be some specific information on how to mail in your controller for either a repair or a complete replacement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            <div>Hi Lynn,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community and giving us an opportunity to assist you on this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
As per the issue description, it seems you want to delete the emails in bulk from the mail account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
I would like to ask some questions on this issue to help you in a better way:</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) Are you using Windows 8 Mail app on the computer?<br />
2) Have you synced the Yahoo mail account with Windows 8 Mail app?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you are using Mail app to view the emails on the computer and you have configured Yahoo mail account with Mail app, then, you can delete mails by selecting the mails and using the
<strong>Delete </strong>option.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would rather suggest you to follow the step below to find it much easier:</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Click any one of them messages you want to delete.<br />
b) Hold<strong> Ctrl </strong>key from the keyboard and click all the messages that you want to delete.<br />
c) The list of messages should be all shaded. Click on <strong>Delete</strong> option on the top right corner of Mail app.<br />
d) Check if you have deleted the required messages simultaneously.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope it helps.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Please feel free to post back if you have any other Windows related issue.</div>

                    <p>Did the dev team FIRE all of their UI/UX experts and hire Homer Simpson?</p>
<p>
</p><p>They added unwanted features like random contact suggestions that get in the way of ACTUAL contacts. Can't turn it off.<br />

<p>They broke existing functionality for no reason whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As 1 tiny example (of many, many others):</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">The dialpad sucks now.<br />
Way, way too many clicks to show it, and then to re-show it during calls. (WHY?)<br />
Can't cut and paste into the dial pad once a call is underway.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">How did THAT bug get paste QA? Or do they just think nobody ever needs to enter conference codes anymore..?</p>

<p>
</p><p>We highly appreciate your thoughts and opinion regarding the new Skype, rest assured that this will be forwarded to our higher team as feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To address the suggested contacts, it is correct that there's no option to disable it. This new feature does make it slightly easier to add the right people on Skype, and it doesn’t really step on your privacy. Skype App is evolving into a social network
 by introducing mutual contacts suggestion. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And as for the previous version of Skype, it is still available for download. Follow the steps below to install the classic Skype:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Log on to <a href="http://www.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">www.skype.com</span></a></li><li>Click on <strong>Downloads.</strong></li><li>Click on the dropdown from the blue button.</li><li>Click on <strong>Get classic Skype.</strong></li></ol>

Use Discord or Google Hangouts seems like better options.

<h2>            Audio problem cant change default</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi, I have had a problem in Windows 10 audio that has come up after my computer crashed for no reason.&nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>After<span>&nbsp;</span>I<span>&nbsp;</span>was forced to restart my computer, the audio through my headset became really bad<span>&nbsp;</span>quality, with my<span>&nbsp;</span>average&nbsp;volume<span>&nbsp;normally
</span>being<span>&nbsp;</span>at around 40% went down to 2%. I<span>&nbsp;</span>decided<span>&nbsp;</span>to take out my (usb) headset and change<span>&nbsp;</span>ports,&nbsp;</span>after this<span>&nbsp;</span>I<span>&nbsp;</span>could not change back to make it my<span>&nbsp;</span>default<span>&nbsp;</span>listening<span>&nbsp;</span>device,
 another thing I noticed is that the indicator of volume to the left of the audio device was missing. All my other audio options showed that<span>&nbsp;</span>I<span>&nbsp;</span>could change to them but never<span>&nbsp;</span>succeeded when<span>&nbsp;</span>I<span>&nbsp;</span>pressed
 "set<span>&nbsp;</span>default"&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>So<span>&nbsp;</span>I<span>&nbsp;</span>decided to uninstall and download my audio<span>&nbsp;</span>drivers</span>.<span>&nbsp;</span>upon&nbsp;doing this all my options expect one is now getting the same problem as my headset where I can't even now press on "set default"
 but has "ready" underneath.</p>
<p><span>I have done a simple troubleshoot that brings up the errors</span></p>
<p><span>Audio service not responding and Audio device is disabled</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>All of my audio options were working fine before the crash.</span></p>
<p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After multiple attempts by doing different items (reinstalling numerous programs and drivers) and even going and buying a new audio&nbsp;card, I concluded that the problem was windows 10 itself. This problem occurred&nbsp;when my computer crashed for
 an unknown reason and must have<span>&nbsp;</span>trigged&nbsp;</span>something inside windows 10 that lead to all my audio options&nbsp;failing. This glitch happend over a period of three days that<span>&nbsp;</span>lead&nbsp;to my audio options&nbsp;not responding to my commands and
 saying that<span>&nbsp;</span>I<span>&nbsp;</span>had audio drivers connected but were unable to produce sound. I was forced to used third party programs to force which audio driver I wanted as default and even then windows 10 was saying that there were still no audio
 drivers connected that can produce sound.<br />
</p>
<p><span>At the end of the day the way I solved this problem was to wipe my computer (but kept my files).</span></p>
<p><span>just putting this out there just&nbsp;in case someone gets the same problem.</span></p>
