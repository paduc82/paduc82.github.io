<h2>            DisplayPort MST doesn&#39;t work under Windows 10 and makes the system go nuts</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Windows 10 Version 1709 OS Build 16299.248.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel graphics driver&nbsp;23.20.16.4905.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">http://a.co/gixcFVZ USB C to DisplayPort MST hub. I tried with a USB C to DisplayPort adapter plus a DisplayPort to dual DisplayPort MST hub with not much success either.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)"><br />
So called PackedPixel monitors. These are portable monitors using the eDP panel used in the iPads and are using a DisplayPort connection.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">When I plug in the monitor into the hub, Windows recognizes it but there's nothing&nbsp; on the display. The
</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">2048 x 1536 resolution is recognized but if you try to switch from Portrait to Landscape you get an error about settings could not be saved. The mouse cursor flickers like mad. Starting anything takes
 longer. Task Manager shows low CPU utilization but&nbsp; the system behaves as if it were 100%, for example Task Manager presents the spinning circle before displaying tasks. I would guess some I/O activity is happening in a&nbsp; loop perhaps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I dumped the relevant registry entry here:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>https://pastebin.com/pUHac0d6 I decoded the EDID, it looks correct , modeline and all. It definitely sees the monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">The monitors by themselves work properly when plugged into the DisplayPort exposed by the Pro dock or the USB C to DisplayPort adapter. It's definitely MST which makes the system go bonkers.</span></p>
<p>The "manufacturer" (based on their kickstarter comments, I suspect it's one guy) basically corroborates: the MST hubs that worked with Windows 7 with this monitor do not work with Windows 10 and "they" basically gave up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is pretty near impossible to find any information on this. Most discussions here amount to: have you installed the latest drivers? (In my case: yes). Have you checked your cables? (in my case: yes, they work as single ones, it's the MST hub)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am a reasonably computer proficient user with about 25 years of PC experience although Windows 10 is very new to me (although you will notice ordinarily the properties key is not accessible to regedit, I was able to bypass this restriction with psexec). I
 am ready to help any way I can to figure this out. I know command line, I can still read C and x86 assembly and if push comes to shove, I probably can write both too, although I haven't tried in a long, long time. If necessary I can visit the Microsoft office
 in Vancouver with kit and kaboodle -- and if&nbsp;<em>really </em>necessary I can take the bus across the border to Redmond, too (it's 4.5 hours one way...). Let's solve this.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>Multi-Stream Transport (MST)</strong> is totally dependent on the<strong> Graphics Card
</strong>and <strong>graphics driver</strong>, and not on the operating system. There are
<strong>Graphics Cards (GPU) </strong>and display adapters which does not support this because usually, multi-monitor connections are done using two or more cables connected to video out ports as it is more efficient. A good example is the
<strong>Nvidia GeForce GTX 780</strong>. It has <strong>1.2 display ports</strong>, but the display drivers that its using does not support it. May we know the Graphics Card that is currently used by your PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you could try looking for MST compatibility of your display driver on <a href="https://ark.intel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Intel</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.amd.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>AMD</strong></a>, or <strong><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/content/global/global.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nvidia's</a></strong> support site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be looking forward for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>We are not really sure about if <strong>Intel® HD Graphics 620 </strong>supports multi-stream transport. The best we can recommend for now is referring to

<p>Hey there, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/b1d63076-46ea-409b-afc9-5226e04fe3ed" title="tristensimions">
<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/73a7ad39-7559-4820-87e6-44c259acfa5a" title="Kristine Arp">
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is in regards with Xbox Live - which I suspect it is, as that is an Xbox gamertag, then the Answer Desk Agents wont be able to assist you further.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to make an appeal on the Xbox Enforcement Team Website here: <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://enforcement.xbox.com</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you may not be eligible as it depends on how long the suspension is for. In cases like this, the best thing to do would be to report the player using the reporting feature on their profile, and the report option on the messages. This then gets sent
 up to the Enforcement team for them to review. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, block the player. People like that, are not someone who you want on your friends list.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With what has happened, the player who has been abusive, has reported that one individual message. Resulting in a suspension. Or it could have been from something else. We, here, cant see the Abuse reports on Xbox Profiles, so I wouldn't know exactly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have seen this type of behaviour before on Xbox. Someone insults someone else, and tries to make them rage or defend themselves. They then report them to Xbox and get them suspended from communications or another enforcement action. So it is always
 best to <strong>Report and Block</strong> and don't rise to it. This way <strong>
You win</strong> and <strong>they loose</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps, </p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            Hi All,<br />
<br />
I found this in another forum.&nbsp; I suggest you try the following.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Control Panel/ Hardware and Sound/ Power Options/ Change Plan Settings/ Change Advanced power settings.&nbsp; Look for hardware sleep settings like Wireless, PCI Express&nbsp;and Hard Drive&nbsp;plus things you don't have in your system under "Change settings
 that are currently Unavailable" and turn them off.&nbsp; Those are the usual items that do not like to return from sleep.</blockquote>
<br />
Thank goes to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>rkrisher<br />

    <title>Renaming the root folder for the principal user under Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> colin358  say:</h3>
<h2>            Renaming the root folder for the principal user under Windows 7</h2>
                    Within the Windows 7 OS, I wish to rename the root folder of the principal user (with Administrator rights). On right clicking on the folder name in Windows Explorer, the option to rename the folder is not available. Clicking on the properties option for
 the folder and having the properties box for the folder displayed, the folder name is greyed out. Please advise how I can rename this folder. I am comfortable enough going into the Registry if that is required. Thanks for your help.

            Hi Cameron O,<br />
Thanks for speedy reply. I tried what you suggested: Running Windows Explorer as Administrator gave me the option of renaming the root folder of principal user. However on attempting to execute the rename ie. pressing "enter" after changing the name, the following
 error was returned:<br />
<br />
<br />
An unexpected error is keeping you from renaming the folder. If you continue to receive this error, you can use the error code to search for help with this problem.<br />
<br />
Error 0x80070057: The parameter is incorrect.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have tried several times, each time the same error is returned. I have also had a quick look on the web for info on the error code and 'am still none the wiser.<br />
Can you help any further?&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

            It seems like that is a VERY generic error code. I've got to ask...why are you trying to rename the folder for a user?<br />

            I wish to rename my user folders to reduce/remove confusion between the naming of a user and the folders where their corresponding files and settings are held. Currently, I have my principal user (with Administrator rights) named 'Colin_Admin' and the
 root folder is named 'Colin'. My secondary user (with Standard rights) named 'Colin' and the root folder is named 'Colin_2'. I would like to sync the folder names with their corresponding user names.<br />
<br />
I agree the code may be generic. Any further ideas on how I can resolve the problem I am experiencing?<br />

<h2>            Cannot change lock screen Image in Windows 8</h2>
                    I cannot change the lock screen in Windows 8. I do not have the Pro version so I cannot use&nbsp; the gpedit.msc command. I have the registry key but it will not allow me to delete or modify the (Defualt) value to other users. I have run the scan and there
 are no issues. Oddly if I restart the computer the image I want appears but if I power it off and then on the defualt image remains. Any suggestions

<p>&nbsp;Seems the default space needle&nbsp;cheap looking&nbsp;lock screen appears when all users are listed at the login... which happens when&nbsp;a user&nbsp;logs off, even if you change the group policy to a universal default lock screen.</p>

            <p>I am having the same issue with a newly built PC. Defaults the lock screen after a shutdown but automatically users profile lock screen after restarts. I thought maybe it wasn't registering the user settings until the next screen where you choose user, however
 the Windows 8 laptop we have doesn't have this issue. </p>
<p>Running windows 8 PRO and tried the gpedit.msc fix but the problem persists.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Reset &#40;clean OS install &#43; disk clean&#41; - &#34;There was a problem resetting your PC. No changes were made&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have an ACER Aspire that was purchased with Windows 7 pre-installed, and I have subsequently upgraded it tow Win 8.1 and then Win 10 (currently Windows 10 Creators edition i.e. the latest updates fully installed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to scrub personal data from the PC and delete all files as I am about to sell the PC, so I went to do a full reset and delete everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This proceeded well until an hour or so of preparing for reset, when the process aborted and I got the above message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since run SFC and DISM with NO problems or errors identified.&nbsp;&nbsp; No error codes were displayed at anytime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on other articles, it would appear I will have to do a manual install of windows 10 using the Media Creation Tool.&nbsp; But since since no errors were found with the disk or the install, is there anything else I could do that avoids having to go through
 this manual install process, that still results in a clean OS install and clean disk drive?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Jacob,<br />
<br />
<br />
The booting issue you're experiencing might be due to a variety of reasons. One if which is due to corrupted boot files. While the issue you're experiencing when signing in, it might be due to stuck keys from the keyboard which makes your PC type on its own.<br />
<br />
That being said, let's run the <strong>Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter</strong> to find and repair problems with your devices and hardware:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the <strong>Start</strong> icon, then select <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Choose the<strong> Large icons</strong> option from the<strong> View by</strong> drop down list found on the upper-right part of the Control Panel window.<br />
</li><li>Locate then select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>View all</strong> from the left pane.<br />
</li><li>Locate and click <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong> to run the troubleshooter then follow the next steps.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You can also perform a <strong>Startup Repair</strong> to further troubleshoot your PC. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press and hold the <strong>Shift </strong>key from the keyboard, then click<strong> Power
</strong>-&gt; <strong>Restart</strong> from the sign-in screen.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Troubleshoot </strong>from the <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen.<br />
</li><li>Choose <strong>Advanced options</strong> from the <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> screen.<br />
</li><li>Choose <strong>Startup Repair</strong>.</li></ol>
<p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>You may also choose Refresh you PC from the Troubleshoot screen.</em><br />
<br />
Please make sure that there are no stuck keys on your keyboard that may cause it to type on its own.<br />
<br />
Let us know the result.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

            We appreciate you providing us those information, Jacob.<br />
<br />
Since the issue remains even after reinstalling Windows 10, it would be best that you contact your laptop manufacturer for better assistance as a faulty hardware might be the reason why you're experiencing the problem.<br />
<br />
We're just a post away should you have further queries.<br />
<br />
<br />
Best.

    <title>Transfer files via Bluetooth without confirmation from a user - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kontrav  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfer files via Bluetooth without confirmation from a user</h2>
                    <p>I would like <strong>Windows 10</strong> to accept multiple files sent from my android device via bluetooth without confirming each and every single file. My devices are paired, all
<em>bluetooth, server,</em> and <em>security</em> services are up and running in the
<em>services.msc</em> window, drivers are up to date and I can send file one by one without any issue but I don't know where to configure it to automatically transfer all the sent files. In
<strong>Windows 7</strong> there was an option window where you could set sharing and security. In
<strong>Windows 10</strong> it seems to be missing altogether or at least it's so hidden that I couldn't find it. On some forums I read that I can restore the
<em>sharing</em> tab by editing registry key however I don't know if it would do any good to me because I don't seem to have the window where the
<em>sharing</em> tab supposed to be. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I start messing around with registries I just wanted to ask if there was a simpler way of enabling to accept multiple files from a device over bluetooth without confirmation.</p>

            Hi alexzaslavskis, no it is not illegal, it is also not correct . . .
<br />
<br />Those product keys are volume licence keys, hey will work for a short period and will then stop working and you will then need to purchase again . . .
<br />
<br />In a company environment those product keys would be re-armed on a regular basis, that will not happen on your PC and you will be just wasting your money !!

            Sorry, no one would be able to tell if it is legit or a scam site unless one purchases from it.
<br />Even if it is legit, they would probably be selling MAK keys that are used in corporate environment. (One key, multiple activations)As soon as MS detects you are using in Home, they block it.

            Better to stay away from shady sites. These sites generally sell volume keys or stolen or trial keys. Which will expire after some time landing you in trouble.
<br />
<br />Buy it only if you have some solid reference from somebody who has already bought it otherwise Skip this.

            Go into Safe Mode and use the System File Configuration utility to set the machine to Base Video (VGA). To get into Safe Mode, repeatedly tap the F8 key as the computer is starting up. Then do Start&gt;Run&gt;msconfig [OK].<span> The System
 Configuration Utility appears. Click the BOOT.INI tab. Under Boot Options, check "/BASEVIDEO." and click OK. Reboot the computer into Regular Mode. Now set the resolution to the correct one for your monitor. Don't forget to go back to the System File Configuration
 utility and uncheck "/BASEVIDEO".</span> <span>Apply and OK out. You don't need to restart immediately, but the next time you do you'll get a dialog saying you've used the Utility. Just tick the box that says in effect, "don't bother

</p><p>Despite all the bad reviews on this issue I figured those consumers were just not tech savvy enough to easily remove the drivers and re-install things and bought this over the Macbook Pro just due to the fact that there was a 1060 graphics card embedded
 within a LAPTOP (awesome right? maybe I was wrong....)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Device manager will no longer recognize the 1060 properly even after a clean uninstall/install of NVidia drivers. I have uninstalled all drivers, went offline so the auto-install for the 1060 doesn't automatically kick off; also
 disable windows device update under properties in device manager. Then re-installed offline drivers, specifically 397.55 which addresses the following:</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px"><span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">- After driver installation, Device Manager may report Code 43 error on a few GTX 1060 cards models.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">- Netflix playback may occasionally stutter.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">- Added support for Microsoft Surface Book notebooks.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)">- Windows 10: Driver may get removed after PC has been left idle for an extended period of time.</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Still get the error no matter what I do. I have tried installing multiple versions (including the latest Nvidia drivers currently at 416.34 and still no success) The last thing I have yet to try is a complete system reformat to
 factory settings, which is annoying but might be the only solution in this case. Please let me know if you know of some other method to get this issue fixed. I have had this laptop no more than 14 days and the graphics card is basically unusable at this point.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you letting us know about your concern. </p>
<br />
<p>Running the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit may help resolve the issue. This will automatically install any missing driver and firmware updates for your device<span>.
</span><span><span>Click&nbsp;<span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here&nbsp;</a></strong></span>to learn how to run the toolkit.</span></span>
<span><span>After running the toolkit, <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4036280/surface-force-a-shut-down-and-restart-your-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">force shutdown and restart your device</a></strong> to ensure all updates
 are applied. You may need to do this more than once.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If running the toolkit didn't work, reset your Surface to factory settings using the recovery image. Click

<p><span><span>Thanks for the reply and trying to help me out, I do appreciate the quick response.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Ok, I tried your toolkit and nothing worked (even after the hard reset) so I went with the last resort -&gt; recovery but "kept my files" as a part of the process
 to not lose any saved work. When it was all done went straight to device manager and still got the Code43 WTH!!!!!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>At this point with nothing to lose I did a reset and erase EVERYTHING option. This took a lot longer as it reinstalls everything but guess what, when everything
 came up Code43 error was still there????? Starting to look like a hardware issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here is where I gave up and went to register my device and started preparing my 2 week old SURFACE BOOK 2 for a Microsoft Store visit to replace/renew my hardware.
 While looking for my serial number, the Microsoft site had me "Detach" my surface book 2 screen to get the serial number. After registering my laptop and getting ready for my TEDIOUS trip to Microsoft store, their internal servers detected I was going to make
 full use of my warranty rights and remotely re-activated my graphics card. The code 43 error went away on my "Device Manager" and message returned to "This device is working properly". Unbelievable but this is truly how it all went down. :) So to all that
 is reading this, if you are having this code43 issue, register your device and Microsoft will automatically re-activate your graphics card.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>All joking aside, I think detaching the screen and reattaching might of had something to do with it. Maybe it was improperly seated? Maybe it need to be reset?
 But that was definitely one thing that has not been mentioned in all the forums where people experience this same problem. THE SOLUTION: Whatever you decide to try whether it be re-installing drivers, recovery option, or full disk erase, add in this very important
 step: try reseating/reattaching your screen multiple times. Hope this helps someone in their time of need and save you a trip to the Microsoft store! Good luck, and stay thirsty my friends.</span></span></p>

</p><p>GeForce Experience will not fix or update drivers. Even after you disable automatic driver updates and re-install the NVidia driver. I didn't buy this laptop specifically for games but what bothers me is if I did want to play games, I need to constantly
 detach and re-attach the monitor to get it to "recognize" the darn graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope Microsoft pushes out a fix for this driver issue soon, I see a lot of similar posts all over the internet but no real solution yet.</p>

<p>Update. 10/19/2018</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have tried everything and failed like me. Then go to the Microsoft store, this is a known issue. The computer cannot be repaired as it is defected hardware/firmware. The tech took one look at it and gave me a new SURFACE BOOK 2! Damn go microsoft!
 I mean I know you know you messed up, but a seem-less 30 minute transaction with a new surface book 2 in working/fixed condition totally makes up for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on my new and improved surface book 2, lets see how long this one lasts. Hopefully we are all good from here on out! Thanks a million Microsoft! Keep this up and Apple won't have nothing on you guys!</p>

</p>
<p><span>d. Press the <b><i>SELECT </i></b>key until an asterisk is displayed as shown
<b><i>Parallel High Speed = No*</i></b></span> </p>
<p><span>e. Press the <b><i>ITEM </i></b>key until you see <b><i>Advanced Functions = On</i>
</b>in the printer display</span> </p>
<p><span>f. Press the <b><i>VALUE</i> </b>key until the value changes to <b><i>Advanced Functions = Off</i></b><i>.</i></span>
</p>
<p><span>g. Press the <b><i>SELECT </i></b>key and until an asterisk is displayed as shown
<b><i>Advanced Functions = Off*</i></b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try to print your document again. If it doesn’t fix the problem continue to the next step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2: Remove printer drivers from device manager.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Click on start button and type <b>device manager</b> in the search box and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Locate the <b>printer</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. <b>Right click</b> and uninstall it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b><span> Also remove all the software’s related to printer from “<b>programs and features</b>”.</span></p>

<p>If the issue is actually a password issue, only you can change it or reset your account following the procedures available (<a href="https://go.skype.com/reset.password.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reset your password now</a><span style="color: rgba(43, 43, 48, 1)"><span>)</span></span>.
 One possibility of the correct password not being accepted, is the presence&nbsp; of the caps lock key before or after password creation. This would have reversed the case of the password you entered. If you are convinced the issue is not a password issue, try
 the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Try <a href="https://web.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype for Web
</a>in a Chrome web browser on your Mac. Does it work there? If it does, then your password should be valid. If it does no accept it, you will need to change your password. There is a always a possibility someone else gained access to your account, and changed
 it. This would make changing your password imperative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If your password is valid in <a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype for Web</a>, there may be an issue with the version of Skype you are using. If the version is too old or you are using an unsupported version, you will not be able to sign into the Skype network, even with the correct password.</p>

    <title>Explorer.exe Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christian__r  say:</h3>
<h2>            Explorer.exe Error</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using Windows 10 for a few days and an error message pops up every so often when I'm shutting down. It only appears for an instant so I have to scramble to photograph it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says:</p>
<p>"Explorer.exe - Application Error</p>
<p>The instruction at 0x00007FFC98EE6E39 referenced memory at 000007FFC754A4B28. The memory could not be read. Click on OK to terminate the program". Kindly see image below.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>What are the steps I should take to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all the help.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the game code you've redeemed was for an Xbox One version of Minecraft, you may download it on your Xbox One console. Otherwise, it may only be downloaded on a Windows 10 PC. To verify the game version that was linked to your account, we suggest that
 you get in touch with the Xbox support team. You may contact them via chat support or request a call at your preferred date and time. Click this
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us#3:1:3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>If you have other concerns, don't hesitate to get back to us anytime. </p>

    <title>Don&#39;t want to fight Tyrant&#63; Just don&#39;t fight him 4head - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> local giantess  say:</h3>
<h2>            Don&#39;t want to fight Tyrant&#63; Just don&#39;t fight him 4head Resident Evil 2 &#40;remake&#41;</h2>
                    <p><strong>*SPOILERS AHEAD*</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>I started playing the Resident Evil 2 remake tonight and started off as Claire. I got as far as opening the secret passage way. I never fought Tyrant. Capcom made a few tweaks but this game stays pretty close to the original. While on the third floor I heard
 a helicopter and I knew that I was about to fight Tyrant. I triggered the helicopter to crash by walking down the hallway but I avoided that whole area and never encountered him. As soon as I went down the secret passageway I fought birkin and met Sherry.
 I haven't beaten the game and I'm assuming I will eventually encounter him later, but anyone else skip tyrant? This probably won't affect my game.&nbsp;</p>

            I just beat this game 5 times in a row, You haven't skipped him you will still meet up. keep in mind to that anyone you "skip or avoid" stays in the game the entire time until you defeat them. My first time playing I avoided a lot of scary creatures and
 soon realized that was a mistake. You need to kill everyone you can. Otherwise they just multiply and make things exceptionally difficult moving forward.&nbsp;

            As far as i can tell you cant really skip hom but you can stall by avoiding him as much as possible. The only places he wont follow you is into safe zones i.e where the type writtter is.
