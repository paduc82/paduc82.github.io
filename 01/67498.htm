<h2>            Audio interface &#40;Focusrite Saffire PRO 24&#41; stops working after update kb3140768</h2>
                    <p>Hi.<br />
My Focusrite Saffire PRO 24 stops working after Windows 10 installs update kb3140768. I get no audio input or output, although the driver does detect that the device is connected and turned on. When I uninstall the update, the device works fine. Unfortunately,
 I don't know how to stop Windows from reinstalling the update on the next reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device is a Firewire audio interface: https://us.focusrite.com/firewire-audio-interfaces/saffire-pro-24</p>
<p>I have the latest manufacturer-provided drivers installed (v3.7).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help you can provide.</p>
<p>-Eddie</p>

            <p>Hi Eddie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you are facing in Windows. We will help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To temporarily prevent the driver or update from being reinstalled until a new driver or updated fix is available, a troubleshooter is available that provides a user interface for hiding and showing Windows Updates and drivers for Windows 10. You can obtain
 and run the "<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Show or hide updates</span></a></strong>" troubleshooter by downloading it from the Microsoft Download Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There could be drivers for the Windows which may conflict your PC from functioning better. So the tool can be used. Windows update updates the system files more importantly in the priority and then updates the drivers. So if you are finding any driver updates
 in the tool then those might be the upcoming updates which you can hide or show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In rare cases, a specific driver or update might temporarily cause issues with your device, and in this case you will need a way to prevent the problematic driver or update from reinstalling automatically the next time Windows Updates are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Keep us posted if you are facing any issues in Windows.</p>

            <p>Eddie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a similar problem with a Focusrite 24, I uninstalled the update but mine doesn't work.&nbsp; All the lights go on and I can even hear inputs but it puts out no audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I ask what Firewire Card are you using?&nbsp; I have a feeling mine is incompatible with windows 10 or my mobo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>It's the Saffire Pro 24. I disabled the update in question as described above, and that helps a little but not completely. Now I can make it work, but only after a fresh reboot. If I come back later on, there is no audio input until I reboot the computer
 again. I'm not sure how long the wait has to be. </p>

            <p>Wow, Eddie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply! I'm sorry that that wasn't a permanent fix.&nbsp; But what I didn't make clear is that I wondered what fire-wire card "in" the computer is being used.&nbsp; I'm using a SIIG with Ti Drivers and it works fine on 8.1, but darn it if it won't
 work on 10.&nbsp; Knowing what fire-wire card in your computer will help me with some decisions.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

    <title>Cannot scroll through or select after Windows 8.1 update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot scroll through or select after Windows 8.1 update</h2>
                    <div>ASUS Q200E</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I noticed that my screensaver wasn't coming on after my updated to 8.1. &nbsp;I went into Personalize and found that the screensaver was set to never come on. &nbsp;When clicking on the drop down menu to select which screensaver I'd like, regardless of what I click on,
 the remaining options are scrolled through and then it stops at (None). &nbsp;I tried clicking on "On resume, display logon screen" to see if I could modify the minutes and get it to work. &nbsp;If I try typing in the minutes box or using the scroll arrows, it starts
 scrolling up one digit at a time until I uncheck the box.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did some searching and found a site which addressed a screensaver issue that suggested modifying the power saving settings. &nbsp;When going into the 'change plan settings' screen, I tried modifying the number of minutes in the settings. &nbsp;Regardless of what
 I select in any of the four drop down menus, it scrolls through all of the options and then stops at 1 minutes. &nbsp;If I attempt to adjust the brightness, it automatically slides down to the dimmest setting. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After doing more google searching and not finding a solution, I elected to move on with my life and look into it more later. &nbsp;I began working on an excel spreadsheet which I then needed to save. &nbsp;I clicked "save as" and attempted to scroll down the directory
 on the left and have run into the same problem there. &nbsp;Every attempt to scroll brings me right up to the top. &nbsp;I've attempted to use the scroll wheel on a usb mouse, clicking on the arrows with a usb mouse, using the laptop mouse, and even using my arrow keys.
 &nbsp;All attempts and methods produce the same results. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have updated the drivers on all devices, run Windows update, rebooted my machine several times, and I continue to have the same results. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had the same problem when using the drop down menus trying to add this very question. &nbsp;I cannot use the mouse to view the drop down options available; however, fortunately, using the arrow keys did allow me to view the drop down options one at a time
 or I wouldn't even be able to post this question. &nbsp;</div>

            As I continued trying to work, I found that this problem extends into my applications, as well. &nbsp;While working in Excel, I was attempting to create a list by highlighting the list I wanted to create and then clicking in the Name Box to type in the name
 of my list. &nbsp;While I had no problems creating my first list, when I went on to create list number two, I typed in "=" and it attempted to scroll through the existing options, which included the name of my first list, and would not let me continue typing. &nbsp;When
 I tried to backspace, I could not backspace the content displayed. &nbsp;I am stuck with it displaying what it wants to: the item at the top of the list. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Please tell me this update has not rendered my laptop useless. &nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 is stuck in Automatic Repair loop</h2>
                    Neither going back to the previous version, nor resetting worked. I also tried using&nbsp;<strong>chkdsk</strong> but it "Failed to transfer logged messages to the event log". Using
<strong>sfc</strong> did not work either ("Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation") and for&nbsp;<strong>FixBoot "</strong>access is denied". By the way, I am also on the latest Insider Preview build (Skip ahead).&nbsp;

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Automatic Repair loop is a feature designed to help you fix some PC issues in Windows. It might fail to work sometimes and stuck in a startup repair loop in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two most common cases of the Windows Automatic Repair loop issue are: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Windows Automatic Repair stuck on a black screen with "Preparing Automatic Repair" error message.</p>
<p>2. Windows Automatic Repair failed and said, "Automatic repair couldn't repair your PC".</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you try the solutions provided by community experts on this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-desktop/windows-10-automatic-repair-loop/0f790cc2-b67d-4a7e-a81b-e30ef47827a2">
link</a> and let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will wait for your response.</p>

<h2>            Error code &#34;0x86000c09&#34; in Windows 10 Mail app</h2>
                    <p>I have the W 10 Email app and an MS account. It worked ok for me until a few days ago. Since then, July 19, it stopped to synch.</p>
<p>I get the error that it cannot connect with eas.outlook.com. There is also an error code with a message: 0x86000c09.</p>
<p>In Windows Live Mail 2012 it downloads all emails just right. All settings seem to be ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot find an answer to the issue. (On my Android tablet it downloads the email also ok), so I assume the, it cannot be the settings.</p>
<p>Also, on the website for outlook.com all emails are perfectly present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The unfortunate thing ist, that I now on a network that is very slow, 200Kbs, Could it be that this is the reason? I am very frustrated, but when the slow network is the answer, then it is ok, until I get to a faster network with speeds above 1Mbs.</p>

            <p>I found a solution on the net:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Go to the website of the outlook.com emails.</p>
<p>2) click on the icon for the settings menu.</p>
<p>3) Open "General" and click on "Mobile devices".</p>
<p>4) in the list find "Windows Mail".</p>
<p>5) Click on the bar to remove Windows Mail.</p>
<p>6) open the mail app, and it will again sync again, and it will reestablish Windows Mail.</p>

            <p>Thanks for this! It worked for me with a few extra steps. Perhaps slight variation in version or something but after clicking on setting gear icon I selected "Options" at the bottom of that drop-down...then a long organized list appeared on the left of my
 window with General and then Mobile Devices..with the list as you said. &nbsp; Strange thing is my WIndowsMail "device" showed last sync about 6 hours after my WindowsMail actually did sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not very computer savvy and only have a Laptop for email...so I was thinking Mobile Device meant a phone or tablet or something!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>I found a solution on the net:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Go to the website of the outlook.com emails.</p>
<p>2) click on the icon for the settings menu.</p>
<p>3) Open "General" and click on "Mobile devices".</p>
<p>4) in the list find "Windows Mail".</p>
<p>5) Click on the bar to remove Windows Mail.</p>
<p>6) open the mail app, and it will again sync again, and it will reestablish Windows Mail.</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;Thank you for providing the solution! Hope MS reads it and adds it to their cookie cutter replies so they can finally answer this question that, according to google search, has been around for a year on answers.microsoft.com.</p>

<p><span><span>I would suggest you to boot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>

It has &nbsp;something to do with &nbsp;ACL and work groups and my user ID may be been corrupt. &nbsp;In my work group, it was sub named under my first name. &nbsp;I couldn't figure out what happened. All spps, Programs are
 here but every bit of data is gone. My pictures, documents downloads everything. &nbsp;I went to the root of the C: Dr. and I found files in with a ETL format which I do not know how to extract. I know these files &nbsp;has to do with my data because it is &nbsp;date stamp
 to when it crashed. Can somebody please help me? I thought it was One Drive but it's not. &nbsp;Mayeux ID was in a trade it with one drive which I hate. It was done during installation and just live with it. (Good luck getting help with people from there).</p>
<p>Anyway, has this happened to anyone and can someone tell me what I can do to extract my data back. It's time critical. Thank you! -Von</p>

 me. Has to do with ACL, workgroups and a corrupt Uid. &nbsp;All I was doing was deleting printer drivers and my admin ID had no access and therefore used another uid to change &nbsp;access level for &nbsp;file ownership of all files. thank you and sorry for being so convoluted.-

<p>Hi Von,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue you are experiencing may be due to a corrupted user profile. When this happens, the system creates a temporary user account where you can login. Since this is a temporary account, this user account will not show you your files. However, you can
 still access your files by opening the <strong>File Explorer</strong> and going to
<strong>C:\Users.&nbsp;</strong>This will show you all the user accounts on your computer. You may browse the folders one by one to check for the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, we'd like to know if you're getting any error message when you log in to your device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response. </p>

<h2>            Windows Update prompt for restart</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have an issue when we push windows update from our WSUS, users will continually postpone the restart and essentially never restart their PC. Is it possible to limit the number of times they can click postpone restart to 3 times?</p>

            <p>Then there is not much you can do, they can postpone the reboot for as long as they want.&nbsp; Schedule the updates to be at a time or day when the users are not using the computers, otherwise you could set a scheduled task under the system account to shutdown
 and reboot the computer at a specific time or on an event based trigger.&nbsp; Also note that you can use a scheduled task to wake up/power up the computer at a desired time, this may resolve the issue of having to ask the users to leave their pc's turned on at
 night.</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>An error when opening an app might have been caused by a corrupted user account. For us to isolate the issue, we would like to ask the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Does the error appears when opening other application or program?</li><li>What is the exact error message that you are getting?</li><li>What is the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/help/13443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">build number and version of your Windows</a></strong>?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create a new user account</a></strong>. Name it as
<strong>Test</strong> and install the app that's having the error. Once done, open the application and check if you are getting the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will wait for your response.</p>

<h2>            Skype Emoticons Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Hi All, <br />
<br />
I am using Skype for Desktop version 7.39.0.102 and I notice that sometimes my emoticons are not animated... other times they seem to work.<br />
<br />
Is this some sort of connection issue?<br />
<br />
BTW&nbsp; I am using Windows 7 Home Premium Service Pack 1 64 bit.<br />

            Don't know if it's the same issue, but sometimes the emoticons show as black/white and suuuper small, instead of the animated ones. It's really weird!

            I'm not sure about Macs, but with PC's you need the 64-Bit Edition of Windows to see more than about 3.2GB as useable by Windows. The difference between 1.99 and 3.2GB might be down to Boot Camp, but I'm far from sure on that.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

    <title>How can I get AOE3 to work on Windows 7 HP 64-Bit&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chicken0895  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I get AOE3 to work on Windows 7 HP 64-Bit&#63;</h2>
                    I have Windows 7, Home Premium 64-bit. AEO3 worked perfectly well until I uninstalled it for god knows how long. I recently decided to reinstall it, however the game no longer works. As somewhat of a TECH guru, I know my computer goes above and beyond
 the reuirements, and my grahpics drivers are fully updated. I even tried updated AOE3 to v1.14 and still nothing. The exe starts in task manager, but is not using any cpu. That is all that happens. The spash screen doesn't pop up and neither does the AOE3
 window.<br />
<br />
<br />
According to the compatability checker, AOE3 is not compatible with 64-bit os's. This seems too stupid to be true, as AOE is one of Microsof's most successful series, and more and more people are upgrading to 64-bit.. Considering 64-bit has existed since XP
 (not that anyone ever used XP 64-bit), it seems Microsoft has had plenty of time to make a fix.
<br />
<br />
<br />
So is there anyway to make AOE3 work? AOE2 works fine right now, so I'd expect 3 (as a more modern game) to work even better. Yes, I've tried running as an admin and computability mod and it didn't work, so please don't tell me to do that.<br />
<br />
Oh and please don't ask me for the product ID because I can't get into the game to retrieve that info.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Since the game you are trying to install is not compatible with Windows 7 and you have already tried to install the game in compatibility mode, we can try to install the game in
 XP mode.</p>
<p>However, you will have to upgrade to Windows 7 Professional, Ultimate or Enterprize to be able to install XP mode on your computer.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx</a></p>

            Well AOE2 isn't "compatible" with windows 7 either, but it works perfectly fine. There's gotta be some way to make it work, without me having to spend more money to get
your</span> operating system.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, you've had almost four years to release a patch for the game to make it compatible. Why didn't you? You guys definitely seemed obsessed enough about getting people to upgrade from xp.<br />

            <p>You might probably want to play the game for which you paid for. Certain applications and games work only with certain Operating Systems and depends on the architecture of the Operating systems. You might think that microsoft releasing a patch would make
 this game availiable to you. Afterall its easy to think. I think you should just consider playing this game on Windows XP. What you pay is what you get.

            You sound just like Microsoft, telling me to either pay more money or screw off, without even trying to think of a solution that would work without me having to spend money. A majority of the world
<br />
<br />
In case anyone who is reading this wants a working answer (instead of one from Microsoft that sounds like it's being read off a script), turns out the game
 game works.<br />
<br />
<br />
Before you jump to conclusions and ban or even arrest me for piracy, my game was legitimately purchased (by me) and thus a no-cd crack is perfectly legal.<br />

            Thanks for bringing the shutdown thing to my attention, that sucks but there's nothing I can do about it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I sure feel like I was told to cough up dough or screw off. Even the Gold version would essentially mean buying the same game I already have again (even if it is a good deal), especially since I don't particularly care fore the expansions. And the patch
 doesn't work, believe me I tried everything before I found that the no-cd patch works.<br />
<br />
Oh and btw, I did try running AOE3 on a virtual machine (pretty much the same as xp mode, but it works on hp), and it lagged horribly because the cpu was being maxed out on the vm. Although that's more my problem, since it is my computer.<br />

            <p>The patch may have worked had you not run the 'no CD' crack.</p>
<p>Re XP mode, it is not suitable for gaming anyway as the video driver is quite basic. It's primary purpose is more for business applications which do not require high grade graphics.</p>
<p>Keep the link to the AOE community. I don't know if it is as busy as it once was, but the people there no as much as one can about AOE..

            The patch won't even install if you have the no cd crack. I hadn't yet put the crack in when I installed the patch and tried to start it (without the crack).<br />
<br />
I will keep the link in case I have issues in the future. Silly me for thinking Microsoft had an answer that isn't on whatever script they use.<br />

            Hi jprzybilla,
<br />
<br />Adjusting the keyboard backlight is usually done with an "F" key, or a combination of "Fn" + a function key. 
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of your laptop/keyboard?

<h2>            Suspension de Compte pour avoir demand&#38;&#35;233&#59; un &#38;&#35;233&#59;change de cartes pr&#38;&#35;233&#59;pay&#38;&#35;233&#59;es achet&#38;&#35;233&#59;es aux USA</h2>
                    
<p>Puisque le service client√®le Xbox m'encourage √† utiliser les forums pour avoir (enfin) des r√©ponses concr√®tes √† mes questions, je m'ex√©cute avec grand plaisir afin que tout le monde ait connaissance de ce probl√®me ! Mon num√©ro de dossier est enregistr√© sous
 le #1201750988.</p>
<p>Lors de mon dernier voyage aux USA, j'ai profit√© d'une promotion d'un magasin Best Buy de San Francisco pour acheter 2 cartes pr√©pay√©es (1 pour 4000 MS Points et 1 pour un abonnement Xbox Live de 12 mois). Lorsque j'ai souhait√© utiliser ceux-ci sur mon compte
 Xbox Live europ√©en dont le gamertag est Dr3amdim, les codes √©taient bien valides, reconnus par la console mais impossible de les activer sur mon profil !</p>
<p>J'ai donc gentiment t√©l√©phon√© au service client fran√ßais de Xbox Live (notamment Mickael, Benjamin et les autres) afin de demander ce qu'il √©tait possible de faire dans mon cas. Ces derniers m'ont propos√© une proc√©dure d'√©change de codes. Pour cela je devais
 transmettre une copie des codes ainsi qu'une preuve d'achat.</p>
<p>J'ai donc suivi √† la lettre et envoy√© ce que l'on me demandait mi avril dernier. N'ayant pas eu de r√©ponse une semaine plus ****, j'ai recontact√© l'assistance qui avait oubli√© d'envoyer les justificatifs aux USA √† un service sp√©cifique. Jusqu'ici tout va
 bien ... mais ca va se g√¢ter par la suite.</p>
<p>Qqs jours plus ****, je re√ßois une r√©ponse par mail d'un certain Curtis aux USA qui me dit dans un premier temps qu'il a besoin de la facture d'achat de mes codes pr√©pay√©s afin de pouvoir les remplacer et non de la facture d'achat de la console qu'on lui
 a fait parvenir. Ne comprenant pas tr√®s bien le contenu de son mail (car la facture exp√©di√©e s'√©l√®ve √† 96,43 USD) je r√©ponds √† son mail en renvoyant l'ensemble des pi√®ces justificatives √† savoir une photo des 2 cartes pr√©pay√©es o√π apparaissent les codes et
 cette preuve d'achat.</p>
<p>J'en profite pour repasser un petit coup de fil √† l'assistance fran√ßaise Xbox qui se charge de mettre un petit message √† ce sujet en interne.</p>
<p>Qqs jours plus ****, nouveau message de Curtis qui me redit que la facture n'est pas la bonne et qui me demande d√©sormais une photo de l'arri√®re des cartes pr√©pay√©es. Nouvelle r√©ponse et nouvel envoi avec l'ensemble des pi√®ces demand√©es par mail.</p>
<p>Le lendemain √† mon r√©veil sans aucune explication, je trouve un mail qui m'informe que mon compte a √©t√© suspendu de mani√®re permanente (Vol sur le March√©) et depuis plus aucune explication.</p>
<p>Lorsque j'appelle l'assistance Xbox, on me demande d'utiliser les forums (bizarrement mes messages ne sont jamais valid√©s par les mod√©rateurs ... ?) et je n'obtiens aucune explication ni aucune solution.</p>
<p>En r√©sum√© :</p>
<p>Premi√®rement, j‚Äôaimerais comprendre pourquoi sans aucune explication mon compte a √©t√© suspendu sachant que j'ai r√©pondu de mani√®re honn√™te √† toutes&nbsp;les demandes d'envoi de justificatifs que vous me demandiez.</p>
<p>Deuxi√®mement, √™tre suspect√© de fraude alors que les codes en questions sont valides et achet√©s l√©galement ... est pour moi qqch d'in√©dit et de difficilement compr√©hensible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enfin si cela √©tait compliqu√© pour une soci√©t√© comme la v√¥tre de faire confiance √† ses utilisateurs et de remplacer 2 codes achet√©s honn√™tement, il suffisait de me dire par mail que cela n‚Äô√©tait pas possible et que vous ne pouviez pas les remplacer au lieu
 de suspendre mon compte sans explication</p>
<p>Je me retrouve donc aujourd'*** avec 2 codes valides achet√©s l√©galement que je ne peux pas utiliser, un compte banni et avec une √©norme d√©ception vis-√†-vis de vos<br />
pratiques et de votre marque.</p>
<p>J'ai de nouveau appel√© l'assistance ce matin. Un responsable doit me recontacter dans la journ√©e. Je n'y crois gu√®re mais on verra bien !&nbsp;</p>
<p>Merci donc de prendre le temps de me r√©pondre. Puisque je dois utiliser les forums uniquement selon vos dires...</p>
<p>J'ai √©galement tweet√© le Major Nelson ce matin pour lui demander des conseils ... On verra bien s'il prend le temps de me r√©pondre.</p>
<p>N√©anmoins, je trouve ces pratiques particuli√®rement condamnables et il me semblait TRES important que vous soyez avertis de cette situation.</p>
<p>J'attends donc des explications pr√©cises, cela prendra le temps n√©cessaire mais sur le fond comme sur la forme, je n'abandonnerai pas.</p>
<p>Bien cordialement,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Salut,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Il y a d√©j√† une anomalie qui me frappe dans ce que tu √©cris concernant&nbsp;les codes achet√©s aux USA, le code d'abonnement Gold doit fonctionner car ces derniers ne sont pas g√©ographiquement verrouill√©s, par contre le code des MSP ne peut pas fonctionner car
 ces derniers sont zon√©s et tu aurais d√ª avoir un message d'erreur indiquant que ce code n'est pas compatible avec la r√©gion du profil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bref, tu n'auras aucune r√©ponse officielle ici car aucun collaborateur de Microsoft n'oeuvre sur les forums locaux, donc il va te falloir poster sur les forums officiels US o√π un agent officiel Microsoft pourra te r√©pondre :</p>

<p>Salut Boombaa,</p>
<p>Merci pour ta r√©ponse ! Mon but ici est surtout d'informer !</p>
<p>M√™me la carte GOLD n'√©tait pas prise en compte d'o√π la demande de l'assistance de transformer ces codes US en codes EU utilisables par mon compte d√©sormais banni.</p>
<p>J'ai d√©j√† post√© plusieurs fois sur les forums US √† partir de ce compte (car le compte impact√© Dr3amdim √©tant suspendu, il n'y a pas moyen de poster sur les forums) en demandant des explications et je n'ai jamais pas encore eu de r√©ponses √† ce jour ... Mon
 post n'apparait m√™me pas dans les encours ...</p>
<p>Tout cela est tr√®s bizarre ! Je dois √™tre appel√© dans la journ√©e par un responsable de Microsoft ... On verra bien !</p>

    <title>Can you Power On via a wireless USB keyboard&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gunjindude  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can you Power On via a wireless USB keyboard&#63;</h2>
                    I have just moved from a MS PS-2 connector -based keyboard to a MS Sculpt Comfort wireless USB keyboard. Since my PC is a tower with lockable front access door and is located below/behind my desk i had relied on starting my PC via CTRL ESC on the keyboard
 rather than having to contort myself to get to the power button.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Doing this via the new keyboard looks to be impossible.&nbsp; I have tried all of my motherboard's Power On By settings with no joy. I know I can simply hibernate/sleep it but I would prefer to keep it turned off fully at night etc.
<br />
<br />
Any solutions?

<p>I am trying to find a way to start my computer (NB not wake it as indicated in the OP) via my MS Sculpt Comfort Keyboard which is a wireless, USB keyboard thus obviating the need to use the power button on my case.<br />

<p>Most modern motherboard Bios have a range of "Power On By" functions including by PS2 keyboard. One of the classic keyboard Power On combinations is CTRL + ESC - which i used on my last keyboard an MS PS2 keyboard, to turn my computer on without having to
 use the case power button.<br />
