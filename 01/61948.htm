<p>You will have to do an install of word for Windows 10. Or jump your grandson and have him get it back for you.</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;Word is online as part of your Microsoft account too.&nbsp; Maybe not quite as elegant as the paid for version&nbsp;but functional enough for my usages.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plus there is Wordpad in the start menu's 'Windows Accessories' folder.</p>

<h2>            UK Xbox one S in North America</h2>
                    <p>I am looking at upgrading to the Xbox one S but I will be moving to the USA for a year. My original Xbox one is from the USA and I&nbsp;have had no problems using this in the UK due to getting a UK adapter, however it looks like the one S plugs directly into the socket so will a UK xbox one S be able to work in the USA?</p>

</p><p>It is&nbsp;actually possible to use your Visa card in Skype. However, to further check, kindly provide us the screenshot of the error message you're getting whenever you try to purchase a subscription or credit in Skype using your card and your exact location.</p>
<p>

    <title>Issue when closing the laptop&#39;s lid&#58; screen will go black - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josebertomeu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue when closing the laptop&#39;s lid&#58; screen will go black after open lid again</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I've been having this issue for a while. I'll try to explain exactly the details of this situation since I have read about other similar problems but never the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have configured in all the power plans that I normally use for my laptop for when I close the lid to do nothing (so this is not a sleep-wake laptop problem). And it always worked fine till I upgraded to W10. The problem is now every time I close my laptop's
 lid, the screen goes off (if I close it slowly I can see how it goes off when it is like 4 to 5 fingers from being completely closed), until here all normal, I guess laptops have a sensor to turn the screen off and that doesn't bother me, the problem is when
 I open the lid again I can see how the screen starts (I can see the back-light turn on) but is stays completely black and I nothing I do (normal things i mean) change this, it just stays black but with the back-light on (when lid is close, back-light also
 goes off). So, it is not that the computer is frozen because I have set up the power bottom to shut down computer, and if I just press it once the laptop will shut down normally and next time I start it screen is back to normal. I found another way to "wake"
 the screen without having to restart the laptop: after opening lid I press Windows-Key + P to open the project settings and I press up or down and ENTER and it comes back (of course I have to do this blindly since screen is black and is not normal or nice).
 After finding out this way of "solving" the issue without having to shut down my laptop it makes me think is some kind of issue with how windows acts by default when I close the lid and the projection options/settings. Any ideas why this is happening and how
 can I solve it? I would like to stop having to do all this W+P thing every time I decide to close my lid and open it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help in advance!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 asks for a PIN when connecting Powerbeats 3</h2>
                    I just got the wireless Powerbeats 3 headphones today.&nbsp; They worked immediately for my phone.&nbsp; However, my laptop, which runs Windows 10, weirdly asks for a PIN when trying to connect.&nbsp; The box has no PIN, and I've already tried "0000," "1111," and "00000."
 Chat support on the beatsbydre site couldn't help me.&nbsp; How do I get this thing to connect?

</p><p>When people chat directly to me they do in English, so I would like to set the translation only for the group really. If I set the translation for each individual, will that mess up our direct conversations?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible also to translate my messages, from English to the guys language, only in this group</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

 message in another language than the language of your Skype, you can right click on this message and select "See translation". This will work both in 1-to-1 chats and in Group conversations.</span></span></p>

<p>Wouldn't mind if it is update, but I'd rather a message appear telling us it's an update. It is strange though that we can access Xbox Live perfectly fine it would appear on the dashboard, but as soon as we try to actually play a game then we're swiftly
 disconnected. Oh, and definitely down in the UK. Looks like Xbox Live has just went down across the whole world. 2012 has started early! Panic stations! Arghhh!</p>

            Hello again, <br />
<br />
I found two articles in the KB that might assist. I don't know if you are willing to try any more troubleshooting, but look over these articles. The first article does not have the same error message, but it would be worth it to give it a try.<br />
<br />
KB 923100 - When you try to install an update for the .NET Framework 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 3.0, or 3.5, you may receive
<span>Windows Update</span> error code "0x643" or Windows Installer error code "1603"<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923100</a><br />
<br />
822798 -&nbsp;You cannot install some updates or programs<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/822798<br />
<br />
If those two articles do not help then my last suggestion would be to try an In-Place Upgrade.&nbsp;You will need the installation DVD.<br />
Follow the instructions below and then see if it makes your updates install properly.<br />
<br />
<p>Note: After performing In-Place Upgrade, your personal data and installed programs will not be removed but we may need to run Windows Update to install all the available updates for your system to update
 these system files to the current version. This troubleshooting process is time consuming.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your DVD installation disk is prior to Sp1, and you have SP1 installed on your computer, you will need to uninstall SP1 to complete the in-place upgrade and then reinstall the necessary windows updates
 .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you would like to perform the In-place Upgrade, let’s refer to the following steps.</p>
<p>1. Start the computer by using the current Operating System.
</p>
<p>2. Insert the Windows Vista DVD in the computer's DVD drive.
</p>
<p>3. Use one of the following procedures, as appropriate:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• If Windows automatically detects the DVD, the Install now screen appears. Click Install now.
</p>
<p>• If Windows does not automatically detect the DVD, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Click Start, click Run, type Drive:\setup.exe, and then click OK.</p>
<p>Note Drive is the drive letter of the computer's DVD drive.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b. Click Install now. 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. When you reach the "Which type of installation do you want?" screen, click Upgrade to upgrade the current operating system to Windows Vista.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please run Windows Update again as you will need to download and install the most current updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not have the Windows Vista Installation DVD, I suggest contacting your PC manufacturer to order a&nbsp;SP1 installation&nbsp;disk.<br />
</p>
<br />
I know you are frustrated in this taking so long, but we have given most of the options that are available to us.<br />

<h3> effielman  say:</h3>
<h2>            What&#39;s the purpose of Microsoft Windows Service Pack 1&#63; Because, what ever it is, I feel like it slows the boot time, majorly.</h2>
                    I have an MSI Motherboard, newer than my other one I had, which was a K9A2CF, AM2 motherboard. Everything was perfect, the log in's took only 2 seconds, it was fast. But I decided, if I upgraded, it would be even better. My AM2 motherboard specifications
 were an MSI 2.10ghz dual core processor, 8gb of ram, 64bit, Windows 7 OS K9A2CF motherboard. What I have now is an MSI 3.10ghz Quad Core, "Micro" 760GM-E51 motherboard, with 16gb of ram, 64-bit OS Windows 7. And I can't believe it; the log in takes about 10
 seconds to go through, instead of 2 or 3, this doesn't make any sense, it's just illogical. Can anyone give me a basic principle of this concept? If so, I would highly appreciate it, thanks.&nbsp;

<p>Limit how many programs run at startup</p>
<p>Many programs are designed to start automatically when Windows starts. Software manufacturers often set their programs to open in the background, where you can't see them running, so they'll open right away when you click their icons. That's helpful for
 programs you use a lot, but for programs you rarely or never use, this wastes precious memory and
<u>slows down the time it takes Windows to finish starting up<br />

                    <p>There was no problem two days ago,but yesterday something i dont know happened to my mouse and the buttons started to not work correctly.There's no physical problem.Something went wrong with the software i think.I don't know what happened but it is really
 annoying.Here are some of my problems&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In google chrome;<br />
left or right click on any bookmark ---&gt; opens that bookmark in a new tab<br />
click to any tab ---&gt; closes the tab<br />
middle button doesn't work at all<br />
<br />
sometimes i cant click on anything.so i press ctrl+alt+del and open task manager and i can click after this.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
i tried my other mouse and it works nice.so nothing is wrong with my pc.i tried v7ma in other pc .and same issues again.please help me</p>
<p>
</p><p>nearly the same problem with this guy</p>
<p>
"Middle mouse button problem, no scroll, no click to open new tab
</p><div><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hi guys,</span>

<div>My mouse stopped working correctly on Windows 8 all of a sudden. Its middle button is acting as a volume scroll instead of a page scroll... Also it won't open a new tab when clicking on a link with the middle button.&nbsp;</div>

<div>An other problem is that sometimes all the clicking functionality goes; it only allows movement, and clicking does not work... Then i open task manager by Ctrl + Alt + del and it works again...&nbsp;</div>

<div>Apart from this sometimes it works on certain things like the task bar while not working on any other windows...</div>

<div>Do you know what might be causeing all these glitches? And how they can be fixed? I believe that its a windows 8 problem, and it strated happening after the last wndows update... &nbsp;"</div>

</div>
<p>can you help me please :(</p>
                </div>

            <p>Your original description makes it sound like the ctrl key was stuck on your keyboard.&nbsp; That's the way to open into new tabs in chrome (ctrl while you click).&nbsp; Or a stuck middle-click on the mouse can do the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given your troubleshooting, it sounds like that's definitely the case.</p>

            Hi RaduPetrescuC 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. Try these and check after each step.
<br />
<br />1. Repair / Reset Photos App
<br />Windows Key+i&gt; Apps &gt; Locate Photos by Scrolling Down &gt; Click Advanced Options &gt; Click Repair
<br />If Repair doesn't work, click Reset
<br />
<br />2. If Reset doesn't work, then you should uninstall using Powershell and reinstall the Photos App
<br />Windows+X &gt; Click Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below command and paste in Powershell and Enter
<br />
<br />get-appxpackage Microsoft.Windows.Photos | remove-appxpackage
<br />
<br />Now, you need to reinstall it
<br />Use below Powershell command to install
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.Windows.Photos | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}
<br />
<br />(If you encounter problem installing it, you can always install it from Microsoft 
<br />Store - <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJBH4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a> )
<br />
<br />3. Re-register All Store apps
<br />Windows+X &gt; Click Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below line and paste in Powershell &gt; Enter &gt; Restart your computer
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            I tried all that you posted. Nothing worked. Seems to be a problem with all windows 10 apps that have the option to print. Seems to be some kind of visual/graphics bug.&nbsp;

<h2>            I receive a low disk space and a memory message every few days.</h2>
                    I have the HP Stream Notebook PC 11. The Processor is Intel(R) Celeron(R) CPU N2840 @ 2.16GHz, Installed RAM is 2.00 GB (1.89GB usable), and System Type is 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor. The Disk Space is 4.04GB available of 21.3GB. I purchased
 the computer December 2015, and it is used for school work mainly. However, I do listen to music online using Pandora.com, I also use this computer for checking my social media (i.e., Facebook, Gmail, etc.,) and no files have been downloaded to the computer.
 I receive&nbsp;a low disk space and a memory message every few days. Are these issues fixable and if so how do I proceed to fix this because it is driving me bats!! &nbsp;

            <p><span>Solution 1: Use disk cleanup to clean up system files. </span>
</p>
<ul>
<ol>
<li><span>Search for&nbsp;<strong>Disk cleanup</strong>&nbsp;from the taskbar and select it from the list of results.</span></li><li><span>Under&nbsp;<strong>Files to delete,</strong>&nbsp;select the file types to get rid of. To get a description of the file type, select it.</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>OK.</strong></span></li></ol>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt"><span>If you need to free up more space, you can also delete system files:</span></p>
<ul>
<ol>
<li><span>In Disk cleanup, select&nbsp;<strong>Clean up system files.</strong></span></li><li><span>Select the file types to get rid of. To get a description of the file type, select it.</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>OK.</strong></span></li></ol>
</ul>
<p><span>Solution 2: In Drive C there are many unfamiliar or unknown programs or files (PC garbage) which directly result to the fact that some application programs never execute. The problem is that you can hardly know which programs or files
 should be deleted. If possible, you can choose to re-install the system and create a larger volume Drive C when you do the partition allocation process. For example, you can allocate 200GB to Drive C, which makes it not easy to be filled up by data. But there
 are some limitations of this method, you need to re-install the system, waste a lot of time and the data in the hard drive will be deleted.</span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Solution 3: The second method is that you can use a Garbage Remover to scan useless files from Drive C and delete all of them for the purpose of releasing more free space to Drive C. For instance, hiberfil.sys, pagefile.sys, temporary
 files of application programs (in Windows\temp menu) and temporary files created by Browser like IE, Firefox, etc. This method has one limitation that you can't resolve the problem thoroughly
</span><span>because,</span><span> after some time of operation, your PC will create more garbage which makes the Drive C showing red bar again.</span></p>

<h2>            Ping google.com - General Failure</h2>
                    <p>I had a technician from Lenovo trying to fix what I thought was a wifi issue. He told me that it was a software issue after pinging websites and finding 'General Failure' message. He was unable to help me further. I also then tried to 'ping google.com' and
 it always came back with General Failure, but yahoo.com, bbc.co.uk, ... or other sites did not have this problem.

            <p>Hi Herman</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you allow me: having a "General Failure" pinging Google.com or any other address isn't that important - it's abnormal though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to assist you further I guess one needs to understand where you're coming from - what is the problem you're actually facing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned "you thought" you had a WiFi issue. Reading you I'm under the impression it's not the case/not the case anymore - I might be wrong though - true or false?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All this to say one need a little bit of more background and precisions with regard to any problem - other than a General Failure while pinging google.com - you're facing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you provide as much information as possible with regard to your configuration, when the problem started, what error message you're getting - if any... please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Lz.</p>

            <p>Thank you for getting back to me, Lz!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I recently bought a Lenovo Ideapad U430 touch. I thought my internet was slow loading pages and downloading software compared to an older computer I owned. Looking at info online I found a lot of complaints about the wifi card Intel N7260 that is in the
 U430 touch. I then went and installed the newest wifi driver from the Intel website, but I also contacted Lenovo support, because I thought that if it was a Lenovo problem they could let me know if a fix has been found. In any case, the Lenovo technician remotely
 took control of my computer, changed a few wireless settings which could potentially help my wifi connection and then he also 'pinged' some sites. He then said that it does not seem to be a hardware problem, but potentially a software problem and if I needed
 help with software I would have to pay for software support. I was not planning to pay for any support, so I tried the 'ping' myself and realized that for all the other sites I try it works, but not for google.com. Although I do not have a problem going to
 the website itself, but it does seem that it is slow sometimes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I really just wanted to make sure that nothing was wrong because I couldn't ping the google.com website. I did realize today that if I disabled my Symantec Endpoint Protection antivirus software that I was able to ping google.com. Does it then mean that
 the antivirus software somehow blocks the site? And would that potentially slow down my internet &nbsp;(I use Google Chrome by the way).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, my internet speed seems ok, but I just wanted to know why I couldn't ping this specific website, and if there is some underlying problem that could potentially slow down my internet.</p>

            <p>Hi Herman</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like you found the "bottleneck" - well done!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't speak on behalf of Symantec but generally any security solution has a cost in term of system resources. That being said I don't see why - in principal - such solution would slow down the speed of an Internet connection - if a bottleneck exists&nbsp;it's
 highly probable&nbsp;it resides on the software side assuming there isn't any problem with the line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you should contact Symantec to understand why - with their solution enabled - you can ping any site but google.com. I have the feeling this is abnormal...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, don't forget that a driver is a piece of software as well. If you suspect your Wireless NIC driver to somehow slow down your connection you will have to take objective measurements using that NIC and its current driver and compare them to other measurements
 - <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">under the same conditions</span> - taken with another NIC (there a good USB ones for about $20)&nbsp;plugged in the same PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Lz.</p>

<p><span>-On playing which game do you receive this error message?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the game was working before but not now, I believe the issue is with compatibility between game and Windows 8.1. I would suggest you to reinstall the game in Windows 7 compatibility
 mode and check if it helps.</span></p>

            <p><span>Thank you for the response. I would suggest you to try these steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This error may occur when the Microsoft .NET Framework installation on the computer is damaged or is missing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would suggest that you manually download and install Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Update Redistributable Package and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 Update 4

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists you can place the computer in a Clean Boot and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Clean boot will help us identify if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.

    <title>Windows 10 Slideshow Options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mathiashake  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Slideshow Options</h2>
                    <p><strong>My Problem</strong></p>
<p>One of the best features i have enjoyed with windows is the ability to have a slideshow presentation of the photo's that i have taken or collected over the years.&nbsp; The problem i have is that since moving to Windows 10 i no longer have the ability, or have
 not be easily able to find the options, to 1) Have the Photo's be presented in a random manner, other wise known as the "Shuffle" option.&nbsp; 2) I am not longer able to, or easily find the settings, in which to slow down or speed up the Slideshow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel these are very basic features for this point in computer programming so i would be surprised if they are not included.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What i have tried</strong></p>
<p>Action:&nbsp; I have tried right clicking while the slideshow is going.&nbsp; Result: Exit from Slideshow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Action:&nbsp; Right clicking the slideshow icon.&nbsp; Result: Nothing</p>
<p>
</p><p>Action:&nbsp; Looking for Slideshow options.&nbsp; Result:&nbsp; Video's of Windows 7 and 8, which to not provide an answer for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Closing</strong></p>
<p>Am i doing something wrong?&nbsp; Where are these simple functions<strong>?</strong></p>

            <p>You appear to be referring to the very old Photos screen saver: you can go to Settings :: Personalization :: Lock Screen :: Screen saver settings (or search for "Change Screen Saver").&nbsp; When you're there, you can modify the Settings for that screensaver.</p>

            I think what zachd is referring to is the option to randomize (shuffle) the order of pictures for the desktop background. Under previous Windows versions, the control panel applet (.Cpl) allowed you to shuffle pictures for the desktop. However desktop
 background customization is not part of the Personalization applet in Windows 10. Zachd's method of running the applet&nbsp;independent of opening Control Panel worked at least for me. The Personalization section of the Settings app allows you to change&nbsp;all the
 slideshow settings except for the shuffle function in this build (10240). However previous builds allowed you to shuffle the pictures.

            <p>I m facing the same problems.... </p>
<p>
</p><p>last weekend i wanted to show some holiday pictures to my family and i was not able to show the pictures in fullscreen...
</p>
<p>i only&nbsp; found this absurde slide show option, however it is not possible to go back to the last picture or forward WITHOUT leaving the slideshow....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore it is not even possible to adjust the speed of the slideshow or to disable the automatic switching....</p>
<p>
</p><p>i thougth showing pictures should be the main purpose of a pictures app...</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: (i am talking about the default win 10 pictures app...)</p>

            The slideshow settings are apparently fixed in build 10532. You can shuffle and select pictures to be displayed in Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Background.

            10532 is a beta (prerelease) build in the Windows Insider Program.&nbsp; It's not meant for normal usage, but is a chance to test/play with&nbsp;in-progress versions of Windows.&nbsp; The current Windows Insider builds will presumably come to normal users once they're
 ready.

            <p>Yeah, the is the HUGE problem with Windows 10.&nbsp; Microsoft expects the customers to wait, wait, and wait some more.&nbsp; Bought a windows smart phone with the promise that Windows 10 will be available for it...still waiting.&nbsp; Waiting for the photo tools to actually
 process photos, etc.</p>
