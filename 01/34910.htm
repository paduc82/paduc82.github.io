<h2>            Where do microsoft store downloads end up&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to do some spring cleaning on my computer and i'm moving around some files to free up more space on my C drive. I'm trying to locate the program files for a few games I have downloaded through the microsoft store, but I can't seem to find them
 anywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried going through users, and program files and have come up with nothing both times. There isn't anything on the app page that lets me change the download locations, or at least, nothing i could find.</p>

            Hi Miles.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />These are stored in hidden databases, but accessible in Microsoft Store app, from the Settings (three dots at top right) under My LIbrary, Downloads and Purchased.  
<br />
<br />The only other way to access them to uninstall is via Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi MilesD13 
<br />
<br />All Apps and games downloaded form the Microsoft Store are located in the C:\Program Files\WindowsApps folder
<br />
<br />On the View ribbon in File Explorer, temporarily turn on 'Hidden Items' to be able to see that folder
<br />
<br />Please Note, before you do anything to that folder, that is one of the most protected folders in Windows and changing permissions on that folder to gain access to it, can cause all Windows Apps to stop working . . .

            Hi,<br />
<br />
- What happens when you try to access Control Panel?<br />
- Why would you want to restore to factory image/settings?<br />
<br />
I'd suggest you contact Gateway support for best assistance regarding the issue.<br />

            When I turn the computer on, I get an Isass error message I can x it out but am left with a black screen. I've had viruses take our my other computer (Dell with Windows Vista) and had to restore factory image but I can do that during the booting process.
 I can't seem to figure out how to do that same thing to Windows xp. I have googled the heck out of this question and every answer I find says to use control panel or F8 but that menu has no option to fix the computer.

            <p>Hello Rachel_461,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Gateway manufactured the computer, they also created the restore process for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They will be your best resource for getting the machine restored to factory specifications.</p>

<p>After trying out the trial version of Killer Instinct from the Microsoft store for Windows 10 I decided to buy the 49euro Ultimate pack. However after paying I received an error and now the new content doesn't show up. Only the trial functionality is accessible.</p>
<p>In my Windows account it is shown as a completed transaction whatever and the error code I receive is something about Microsoft Zune?!?!? 0x80190190</p>
<p>Please help me to get the content for which I paid.</p>

<p>I've also ran into this issue. I'm not sure if I should create my own thread, but I'll add everything I saw/did.</p>
<p>Happened when purchasing the KI Supreme Edition via the in-game store in the free version of KI. Got to the end of the purchasing process, ran into that exact error code, got charged (shows on bank, xbox orders page, and email):</p>
<p><em>Try that again</em></p>
<p><em>Something happened on our end. Waiting a bit might help. The error code is 0x8190190, in case you need it.</em></p>
<p><em>[CV:qCqbD4Y4nUGDtKCK9.7]</em></p>
<p>Now, I will see this same error/message every time I try to select the Supreme Edition at the in-game shop. If I select anything else, I can verify my email and start to go through the purchase process (didn't buy anything else though).</p>
<p>So far I've tried the following things to resolve it, with no progress:</p>
<p>- Restarted the PC</p>
<p>- Restarted the game, xbox app, and windows store.</p>
<p>- Ran the windows store troubleshooter to clear the cash/repair anything (this fixed another issue I ran into earlier).</p>
<p>- Logged into Windows 10 with both a Microsoft account and a local account (doing this also fixed ANOTHER earlier issue with my login list/ability to log in).</p>
<p>- Uninstalled/Reinstalled KI as well as the XBox app.</p>

<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>So I got home from work today and it looks like I received all the DLC from the Supreme Edition, minus the 18,000 KI gold. Just for reference, this is about 48 hours after I made the purchase in the shop. I didn't do anything when I got home, I just turned
 my computer on, fired the game up, and everything was (mostly) there.</p>
<p>I'm still getting the error when I try to select that particular bundle from the shop, but it's not a major issue anymore now that I received the majority of the content. I'll contact phone/chat support in the next day or two to see if I can get that last
 bit rectified. Thanks, and hopefully RinZero can also get their issue sorted!</p>

            I would recommend signing out of your profile and then back in, this should hopefully resolve the sync issue with the purchase.&nbsp; If that doesn't take care of it you will also want to uninstall and reinstall the game as this (should) download the full game
 you paid for.

<h3> kitchbaby  say:</h3>
<h2>            Publisher 98 and Windows 10</h2>
                    Hello. This is my first post in the forum. I have used Publisher 98 for many years on my PC with no problems. 2 weeks ago I downloaded Windows 10. Today I used Publisher for the first time using W.10. and tried to insert a jpeg photo onto my work but it
 wouldn't let me. Said there may be a missing component. I installed disc as requested but nothing helped/changed. &nbsp;I did a test with a gif pic and that worked ok. So now wondering why gif's work and not j.peg's? Can anybody offer any help? Many thanks.

<p>That might just be how Windows works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a standard user account and logged in and launched services.msc, navigated to Windows Module Installer, right click, All Tasks and everything was greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then ran services.msc as Administrator and see the same thing.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So I conclude that a standard user doesn't have permission to manipulate Services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is easy to find a list of things a standard user can do, but I did not find a specific list of what a standard user can't do and did not look very hard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There might be some way to add Service manipulation to a standard user account or some other way to get it to work but I am not going to try to figure it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is one complicated looking set of instructions that might work:</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No this doesnt help. This is something that i already know. This is the operations via keyboard which i have already resorted to. The solution i am seeking is for the mouse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We should be able to select, if not be able to modify, the types of snap we would like to do. Currently we have to either follow all the snap actions or not any from mouse. I just would like to disable the auto-maximize which is not possible at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Snap feature is pretty good but just the auto-maximize feature is very annoying. Sometimes its helpful but mostly it is not. We already have the double click to maximize.</p>

<p>kinda makes me want to pop this game back in my ps3, but i don't want to deal with any of those retarded boss fights with the summons. i wonder if it's at all possible to copy a save file from a friend's system and profile onto mine so i could avoid all
 that bullshit. i believe he was at the same place i was before he got bored of it and my old ps3 died, so i'm not cheating or trying to get fast trophies or whatever. that is of course if he hasn't deleted the save.</p>

<h3> sastimac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t install USR5637</h2>
                    
<p>When I attach my USR5637 USRobotics USB modem it appears as an "Agere software modem" on COM4 and doesn't acknowledge the dial tone. I removed / deleted the modem in the device manager and loaded the latest USR5637 drivers. US5637 shows up as not installed.
 However, it is attached to the USB port. It even passes the Win7 modem test. USR says they won't talk with me because it's not under warranty. It may still be, I bought it used a couple of months ago and there's a 2 year warranty.</p>

<p>Many manufacturers&nbsp; apply the warnty only to the original purchser. I.e., you buy a used one, it loses its warranty.</p>

    <title>Embed Fonts in PDF - Problem with paper size - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ebook_formatter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Embed Fonts in PDF - Problem with paper size</h2>
                    <p>I format books for print, and my client needed the fonts embedded when I save the Word (Windows 10) file as a PDF. &nbsp;I was able to do this by using this suggestion from someone here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Your best option is to use one of the free PDF virtual printers available on the web. Free PDF Printer is a great free option and includes the option to embed fonts in your documents. Since you are producing PDF's for print, you would be better to use
 this printer than the Print to PDF option as there are huge issues with fonts in the Microsoft PDF production . . .Simply select print and then choose the virtual printer to create your pdf, the software has 2 options, Embed all fonts or subset fonts.&nbsp;</em><br />
</p>
<p>NEW PROBLEM: &nbsp;The fonts are embedded now, but my client discovered that the PDF I sent to her is the wrong page size. &nbsp;The Word 2007 file was 6x9 for a print book, but after I embedded the fonts per instructions above, the page size became 8.5 x 11. &nbsp;What
 can I do to fix this so the PDF file is still 6x9?<br />

    <title>Twitter App stop working on Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Twitter App stop working on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Twitter App stop working</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read other issues with twitter app and the struggles to resolve. So I ask before I try the obvious
</p>
<p>uninstall/install to try and correct. </p>
<p>#1 I have a HP probook laptop and upgraded from 7pro to 10 &gt; I did have to reset windows 10
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and very possible the app was installed before the reset. (I do use twitter through the browser
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; often)</p>
<p>#2 the Windows store works fine best I can tell and shows twitter installed </p>
<p>#3 Twitter app shows my name and avatar picture but follows and followers are 0 &gt; also displays
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all my lists I have created within app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;home timeline displays "please tap to retry" "we're sorry, there is a problem completing the request.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;please check your network connectivity &nbsp;and try again...other command attempts will display "cannot retrieve
</p>
<p>&nbsp;activity at this time" or "aren't loading right now".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not use&nbsp;but a couple of apps and do not want to compound a potential issue.&nbsp;Uninstall and install seems
</p>
<p>to be the obvious first step (?) is uninstall only possible through tile on start menu ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get my twitter app to start working again ? &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;(my 2nd attempt at this question &gt; was misunderstood for skype the first time)</p>

            <p>Thank you, this was very helpful &gt; troubleshooter resulted in no problems detected.
</p>
<p>uninstall &gt; reboot computer &gt; then reinstall was successful. All is good with Twitter
</p>
<p>app. (not sure reboot was necessary, just a habit)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the trouble may have been because I had to reset windows 10 after upgrade
</p>
<p>and app was affected (?) just an assumption. </p>

            I am getting this very same issue. I can't use Twitter because of the above error. However uninstall and reinstall is not helping. Rebooting did nothing. I'm even having trouble with Facebook and Messenger telling Me network error, however my network is
 fine I am able to load up everything else just fine. Just those windows 10 apps.&nbsp;

<h2>            Black Bar on Right Side of my Screen&#33; Someone help me</h2>
                    I have an HP Pavillion dv5-1234ca Laptop (2009) that has Windows 7 installed on it. Everything was perfect until a couple of weeks ago when I plugged an HDMI cable into it for the first time. Since then, I have a 3 inch black bar on the right side of my
 screen. I have tried so many things already, and no one seems to have the answer for me, so I am hoping posting this will help! How can I get my normal monitor back?

<p>Since the issue occurs before Windows loads you need to contact HP Support for the hardware.</p>
