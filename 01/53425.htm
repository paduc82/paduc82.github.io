<h2>            Mixed Reality PC checker App.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Seriously thinking of getting one of the new mixed reality headsets so thought id try the PC checker.&nbsp; I have a new system running on a&nbsp;Asus Prime B350M-A (Socket AM4) Micro ATX Motherboard with a Ryzen 5 1600 and a GTX 1080.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Everything is showing fine (apart from waiting for the Fall creators update obviously) apart from I have a yellow warning triangle for the USB 3.0??? Is this normal?&nbsp; Seems strange as I know the machine has got several USB 3.0, even two 3.1? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Just don't want to spend money on Headset if this is an issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Cheers.</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The yellow warning triangle on your USB 3.0 could mean that the device driver installed needs to be updated. However, for us to verify that, we suggest checking the device status of that particular USB 3.0. To check, just right-click it the USB 3.0 and click
<strong>Properties</strong>. Under the <em>General </em>tab, check the <strong>Device status</strong> and see if the error is related to the device driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem with the USB 3.0 has something to do with the device driver, then please follow the steps in&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Update drivers
 in Windows 10</strong></a> to proceed with the update. If not, then please take a screenshot of the device status page for us to further look into the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>
</p>

<p>Wait for the Falls Creators Update... Then Check again...</p>
<p>I have a HP Mixed Reality Headset and it works on all other PCs I have, even the old once, except for the Surface Book.</p>
<p>There might be still driver issues right now... But it is still very stable.</p>
<p>Little yellow triangles is actually not an issue at all... The old PCs I have have those little triagles too, but it still works...</p>

<p>Many thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I'll have a look at my computer tomorrow.&nbsp; But would be surprised if drivers for my USB 3.0 are out of date as machine is less than a month old and company that built it made sure everything was running the latest drivers before
 shipping to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If drivers are OK I'll wait to the fall creative update and run app again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are no games yet... But HoloTour was amazing... I can't wait for more.</p>
<p>I use it actually mostly for watching movies (Huge screens :) ) now and I really like the fact, that you can walk around without further setup.</p>
<p>There are some issues though... Don't turn the lights out .... If its dark the tracking does not work very well. But Infrared lights should work if you need the room dark... Havent tried it though.</p>
<p>The resolution is actually great enough to work with on your desktop, but typing is a pain in the ass, because you cant see the keys of your keyboard. I cant type blind that well. I have now a webcam pointed on the keyboard so that I can see them in the
 VR world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My recomendation would be to wait for the SamsungHeadset... It has more resolution.</p>

<p>Thanks for the information.&nbsp; 😊</p>
<p>Was watching a demo of that holotour,&nbsp; does look very impressive.&nbsp; The cinema room did look very good also,&nbsp; I'm looking forward to watching a film like that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think I'll take your advice on the Samsung unit,&nbsp; after watching a few videos it looks like the best one to go for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a question that might seem silly.&nbsp; I take it you plug the hdmi from the headset straight into your graphics card.&nbsp; As my gtx 1080 only has one hdmi port, what do I use to my monitor? The DVi out of my graphics card or the hdmi from the motherboard?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>

<p>Can you use your Graphics card and your onboard graphic at the same time? Because my on-board graphic is deactivated if a Graphics card is installed.</p>
<p>You definetely requires a Monitor... Without a monitor the whole setup does not work. The Headset uses the monitor also to orientate in the room as an anker point. If you lose tracking for example you just look at your monitor and the tracking will work
 fine again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normal setting would be... Headset in the HDMI of the graphics card and the monitor in the DVI of the graphics card... You can use the DisplayPort also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the controllers... I am using Logitech wireless controllers with a XBOX360 emulations... I dont have those fancy Mixed Reality once... But I recomend having it... Controlling the whole thing with XBOX controllers is ok, but clunky... And tiresome for
 your neck, since you have to do the moving of stuff by "stare".</p>

<p>Thanks for the info. Now I know to get a DVi to hdmi cable for my monitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah I'll definitely be getting the controllers with the headset.&nbsp; They seem to be getting very good reviews and enhance the whole experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Hi Vanessa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I'm now on the Falls Creators update, and everything in the PC checker App shows green apart from the USB 3.0.&nbsp; I still have a yellow triangle for that.&nbsp; The Microsoft Mixed Reality App help page tells me to uninstall any driver for any extensible Host
 Controller that doesn't have Microsoft at the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have six 3.0 ports and two 3.1 ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; In Device Manager I have the following,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p><p><span><span><span>AMD USB 3.0
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">eXtensible Host Controller – 1.0 (Microsoft)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>AMD USB 3.1 eXtensible Host Controller – 1.10 (Microsoft)</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>And
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>ASMedia USB 3.1 eXtensible Host Controller (ASM1143)
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I’m assuming that the last one is causing the warning.&nbsp; I’ve checked the manual for my ASUS Prime B350M-A Motherboard and I believe the ASMedia Controller is for the two 3.1 on the back of my machine
 only.&nbsp; I've contacted ASUS support and they&nbsp; said it is for those two ports, and if I uninstall&nbsp; the driver those two ports will stop working???&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;Ive gone on the ASUS website and downloaded their latest drivers but still the same.&nbsp; Updating the Driver in Win 10 shows no newer drivers available.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; So my questions are -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If I leave my machine as is, and I plug the Headset into one of my 3.0 ports, will the ASMedia that's controlling the 3.1 ports cause a conflict?&nbsp; Or will it work fine as the other ports are Controlled by Microsoft drivers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If I uninstall the ASMedia driver like the help page suggests will my to 3.1 ports stop working? I really don't want to lose two ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I know Alexei replied that yellow triangle probably wouldn't matter and the Headset should work fine, but Id like to check about this first before ordering a Headset.&nbsp; I like the look of the Lenovo or ASUS headset.&nbsp; Would love the Samsung but America only
 apparently :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Thanks for your time,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Chris</p>

            To check if there is a driver conflict caused by the Fall Creators update, you can try to

<h2>            Recover Old Gamertag</h2>
                    <p>Okay&nbsp;so, here is my problem.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>(The Gamertag was created on an xbox 360)</p><p><br /></p>
<p>I have an old gamertag which was linked to a very old email account, which unfortunately no longer exist. So it is&nbsp;impossible to access or recover.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>I knew everything about the no-longer existing account username password and gamertag associated with it. I've tried to recover it but when entered the address i get the message "This account doesn't exist". (or something like that) soooo....&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /></p><p>So my thinking was I would re-create the email account that was deleted and be able to access the old gamertag. This didn't work. When i did this it just made a new Live ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><br /></u></p><p><u>Now i'm thinking if the gamertag isn't registered to the once deleted account what is it registered to? and if possible how can i get it back?</u></p>
<p><br /></p><p>I really want to play with the gamertag again with all its saved data and information unlocked achievements and friends.</p>
<p><br /></p><p>I no longer have the original xbox 360 that it was created on. Though i do have a 360 and an xbox one.</p>
<p><br /></p><p>Any help or information is appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /></p><p>Thanks</p>

<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a><span>.&nbsp; Be sure to check the
 box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use Windows Update for the
 updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></span></p>
<span><span><span><span><span><span>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps made on a different computer or perhaps in safe mode with networking if that is working).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp;
 It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;application startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp;
 Here's how to use Event Viewer: </span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></a><span>. &nbsp;Look in the System and
 the Application sections.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem
 (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a><span>&nbsp;and</span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></a><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp;</span></span><span>Use
 removal tools when appropriate<a href="http://www.raymond.cc/blog/archives/2009/05/05/comprehensive-list-of-uninstallers-or-removal-tools-for-antivirus-software/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.raymond.cc/blog/archives/2009/05/05/comprehensive-list-of-uninstallers-or-removal-tools-for-antivirus-software/</a>.&nbsp;</span><span>Once
 you've uninstalled your current AV program, download, install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless
 you decide to switch which I did when I first tried it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></a><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></a><span>
 and Avast at:</span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></a><span>. &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm</a><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work,</span><span><span>try a clean boot&nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp;
 To do this you have to also be able to boot normally.<span>&nbsp; </span>Here's the procedure:
</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span><span>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Please
 reply before doing the next step as it is a radical option and I’d like to make sure we’ve ruled out all other options before taking that step.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work (or you don’t have the disk), then I'm afraid the only option is a clean install.&nbsp; You can use Knoppix</span><span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></a><span>&nbsp;along with a blank CD.&nbsp; This should give you enough
 access to the system (if you can't get in any other way) to backup your important data.&nbsp; Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or the Recovery Disk or the Recovery Partition (whatever process is dictated
 by your computer manufacturer – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps to get recovery disks).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted
 as necessary by the procedures of your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly
 150 updates pending,...</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>
</span></span></span></span></span></span>

<h3> kolio55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem opening Excel </h2>
                    I have a problem when I open Microsoft Excel or an excel file I get a screen with the following message:<br />
Preparing to install Microsoft Office XP Professional with FrontPage<br />
Please wait while Wndows configures Microsoft Office XP Professional with FrontPage<br />
Gathering required information..<br />
<br />
Then a second screen with the following message appears:<br />
Microsoft Office XP Professional with FrontPage<br />
The feature you are trying to use is on a CD-ROM or other removable Disk that is not available.<br />
Insert 'Microsoft Office XP Professional with FrontPage'disk and click OK.<br />
<br />
When I cancel this message, a third screen with the following message appears:<br />
Microsoft Office XP Professional with FrontPage<br />
Error 1706. The setup cannot find the required files. Check your connection to the network, or CD-ROM Drive.<br />
For other potential solutions to this problem, see C:\ProgramFiles\Microsoft Office\Office10\10033\SETUP.HLP.<br />
<br />
I do not have a CD since my PC came pre-installed with Windows XP.<br />

<p>I have found myself with a quite silly problem that has brought my attention to what I think is a relevant underlying problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to play this game that for some reason does not work when run as an administrator, gives me an error, doesn't start.</p>
<p>Now, it is an old game, and when I run it normally, it does work, but I am having a lot of issues with missing textures in the 3D environment, to a point it is mostly black.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Naturally, in these cases, one might benefit from using compatibility mode. The problem is, it activates admin priveleges and the game doesn't load because of that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want the compatibility without giving admin permission to the .exe to change files at will on my computer. For one reason or another, I think it is a perfectly reasonable thing to want/need in several cases, not just mine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although there is a separate button for admin rights, somehow it always activates. Does not make a lot of sense, would like to have an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is, how do I go about doing this?</p>
<p>I hope bringing this to attention might have someone at MS fix this or give me a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p />

                    <p>Hello, Skype doesn't work on my MAC, Imac, phone or Ipad... it won't load past this screen. I have deleted the programme and reinstalled. I am unsure why this is the case. Could it be something to do with my account with yourselves that you could repair?</p>

See the Lifewire article <em><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-fix-d3d11-dll-not-found-or-missing-errors-2623232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Fix D3d11.dll Not Found or Missing Errors</a></em>.&nbsp; Do you have a d3d11.dll file (DirectX Direct3D
 11 Runtime library) located in the <strong>C:\Windows\System32</strong> folder, and does the error message disappear if you try to
<strong>re-install the program</strong> as suggested in that Lifewire article?&nbsp; From my 32-bit Vista SP2 computer:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d60857a2-f1db-4093-949a-cf88b2fd3c22?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d60857a2-f1db-4093-949a-cf88b2fd3c22?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><br />
If re-installing the program doesn't help, please let us know the make/model of your computer, your antivirus program and default browser.&nbsp; If you have a discrete
<strong>graphics (video) card</strong> (e.g., NVIDIA, AMD, etc.) let us know the make/model and current driver version.&nbsp; Post back if you need help finding the driver version for a graphics card in the Windows Device Manager.<br />
<br />
This could be unrelated to your d3d11.dll error, but please note that there is a known issue with Vista SP2 computers where Windows Update can get stuck on "<em>Checking for updates...</em>" and cause unexpected problems - see the VistaForums FAQ
<em><a href="https://www.vistax64.com/threads/how-to-fix-vista-sp2-checking-for-updates-hangs-and-slow-windows-updates.305124/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>How to Fix Vista SP2 "Checking for Updates..." Hangs and Slow Windows Updates</strong></a></em>.&nbsp;
 Run a manual Windows Update (Control Panel | System and Maintenance | Windows Update | Check for Updates) - if the initial "<em>Checking for updates...</em>" phase appears to hang for 20 to 30 minutes without running to completion then that indicates that
 you are likely affected by the slow Windows Updates described in that FAQ, and we might need to fix that problem first.<br />

<h2>            How do I change my font and font color on my desktop in windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    How do I change my font and font color on my desktop in windows 8? Please don't tell me how to do it for other versions of windows. Please don't tell me something about fonts that is not relevant to my question. I specifically want to change the "COLOR"
 and the "TYPE" or "STYLE" of font on my desktop icons on Windows 8. It was quite simple to do on all other versions of Windows but I am running into a brick wall as to how to get this accomplished with Windows 8. Thank You for any help.

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;built-in option&nbsp;to change the Desktop Fonts and Colors was removed in Windows, starting with Windows Vista.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason is that any font color would become invisible, depending on the Desktop Wallpaper that was being used. An example would be a picture or multi-color wallpaper. If the font is a dark color and the text was positioned over a dark part of the wallpaper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows uses a White font with a Drop Shadow effect. This&nbsp;keeps the font visible, regardless of the background color of the wallpaper. In extreme cases where the desktop is a brilliant white, or other very light color, the fonts will turn Black.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Regards</p>

            In my case, I choose a solid light gray desktop background and&nbsp;grey&nbsp;icon font is invisible. It's not smart and counterproductive&nbsp;to restrict user to make adjustments...

            A black desktop makes the standard (only) shadow font tolerable.&nbsp; But one icon has just black and becomes invisible unless hovered over.<br />

            Yeah, I tried the black background and it looks ugly, just like the old MS DOS... Don't like it. Still do not understand why MS handcuffs us in customization of desktop? Why we cannot and should not change the font style?

            well mvp I need the font color to be black, why remove this from the program, as my background/wallpaper is white and no it did not turn black for windows 10 which makes it almost impossible to read go figure, it has a small dark out line with the center
 white in the fonts not a big help, why fix what is not broken

    <title>Windows Media player sync does not play on Samsung, Android Note 2. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carletos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media player sync does not play on Samsung, Android Note 2. &#34;Message can&#39;t play this format&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have a music files from Windows 7.&nbsp; When I use Windows&nbsp; 8 Media Player Sync feature to transfer to the Samsung Note 2 Phone, Android sys., the phone will not play&nbsp; the songs.&nbsp; Message "Does not recognize this format"&nbsp; I called Samsung, 1 hour, 1 reboot,
 deleted the sync list,&nbsp;reloaded a new list of&nbsp;music and same message. </p>
<p>&nbsp; Which format is windows 8 using to store music??&nbsp; I thought, it was WMA, which Samsung claims works on this phone?&nbsp; How can I change the whole Library to some other format that this Phone will recognize?? Is this an error with Samsung, or Windows 8, or
 an expensive mistake on my part as I missed the fine print??&nbsp; I need help with facts, so I can return to Samsung, I may have a missed programed phone??</p>
<p>Trying to use the Windows 8 &nbsp;self-help features has been a waste of a lot of time, as format issues are not addressed, auto sync, or phone setup automatically apparently did not work, as waiting tor the set up, does not show a progress page, so one can make
 changes or retry?&nbsp; Nor, is there a indication of progress on the Win Media Player that the device is set up.&nbsp; It is listed however, as a phone and a Card (that is in the Phone).&nbsp; Further, I noticed that you have many small companies using these failings as
 a business model on the internet, I suppose you are trying to help them,&nbsp; but their upgrades, downloads etc. are waiting for Windows to issue the fix.&nbsp; They are just a diversion in me trying to resolve a simple issue, and asking for information they don't
 deserve.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From your issue description, I understand that the Windows Media Player does not play on Samsung note 2.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does those files play on Windows Media Player 12 on Windows 8?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>By default, the Player uses the Windows Media Audio format, which optimizes the balance between file size and sound quality and is supported by certain compatible devices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It’s not recommended to change the file format of the files.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I suggest you to right click on the file and find out the format of the files. Please reply
</span></p>
<p><span>with format of the file for further help.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;For help with playing a file on Samsung phone you&nbsp;need to contact Samsung because we do not know the settings on the Samsung phone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope it helps. For any further Windows related assistance, feel free to contact us and we will be glad
 to help.</span></p>

<h2>            How do you remove Credit Cards on Xbox LIVE&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>I bought 1 Month of Xbox LIVE Gold Membership and it has now ran out. In the last Month, I lost my credit card (the credit card that's being used by Xbox LIVE) So I rang up and payed for a new credit card (new numbers and everything) And now my account
 has been suspended due to a problem with my payment option. It won't even let me remove the lost credit card and add the new one because it's suspended. Can someone please help? Thanks.</span></p>

<p>You would have to add a new card to pay off the balance you owe which will unsuspend your account. Then turn off auto-renewal and once your account reverts to silver you can remove the credit card.</p>
<p>Call support and talk to billing and they will help you sort it out.</p>

            <p>OK. First of all&nbsp;: Thanks, Anish A Kumar,&nbsp;for the very comprehensive reply.</p>
<p>Good news: <strong>Problem solved !</strong></p>
<p>I performed some tests, as you suggested, using both my original mouse, and an old, used&nbsp;mouse that I borrowed from a neighbour. The problem kept repeating itself.</p>
<p>I noticed that the mouse freezes only when I move it, which gave me the idea that the problem is with the mouse.</p>
<p>I purchassed a basic low cost mouse, plugged it into the computer, and the problem dissappeared.</p>
<p>I should have think of it sooner, but better later than never.</p>
<p>Once again thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>I'm not sure what you want. You seem to know what's causing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>RelicCoH2.exe (1/4) and atikmdag.sys (4/4).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your only options are to update or rollback or not use atikmdag.sys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find the file, right click then <em>Properties</em> - <em>Details</em> tab. If it shows a driver you'll need to update the driver identified. Most drivers are in c:\windows\system32\drivers.
</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Search the Drive for a File.</strong></div>
<div>
<div>Click <em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click <em>Command Prompt</em> and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;replacing <em><strong>drivername.sys </strong>
</em>with the name of the file being searched (or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>dir c:\<strong>drivername.sys</strong> /a /s</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Update Drivers</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each approach has pros and cons. Try each.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>In <i>Control Panel</i> (and select <i>Classic view</i> in the left hand pane) choose
<em>Device Manager</em>, go to your video card under <em>Display Adaptors</em> and right click -
<em>Properties</em> - <em>Drivers</em> tab - choose <em>Update Driver</em> (and optionally
<em>Rollback</em> if no updated driver). </li><li>Use Windows Update choosing the option to also check for driver updates </li><li>If it came with a PC go to the PC Manufacturers web site else to whoever made the component's web site
</li><li>Often hardware is based on a specific chip and the chip manufacturer's web site may have
<em>Reference drivers. </em>You can get the manufacturer from the entry in Device Manager at the first point.<br />

            It doesn't matter if you've updated all your drivers. It only mattersthat you use a non faulty version of atikmdag.sys. What is this file.

            I have removed atikmdag.sys and atikmpag.sys which are ATI graphics drivers and replaced them with newly installed driver files from the latest driver update. Now when I play the screen goes black and freezes then displays this message&nbsp;<span>"Display&nbsp;</span><em>driver

            <p>Try an earlier driver. There is the rollback option although that is probably to the version you just deleted. Try uninstalling the driver and installing the ones that came on the driver disk with your computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's no magic solution. You either find a driver that works, get a new video card, or stop playing the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does your game have video options that you can experiment with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As each of those 4 crashes were at a different memory address perhaps it's the card as if it was just drivers others would have the same problem.</p>

<h2>            Cancel Gold Subscription off Old Account&#63;</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently made this new account, and bought gold for it. On my old account, I was unaware that gold automatically renewed, and now I think I am paying for 2 gold accounts. The older account that has gold is an "underage account", so it automatically made
 a "parent" account, which does not have gold. I can't figure out how to login on this site with the "underage" account so I can cancel gold off of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone please tell me how I can cancel the gold subscription from the old account? Any help is appreciated!</p>

<p>Hiya, in order to login to XBOX.com you need to have the e-mail attached to the account. There's unfortunately no way to look up an e-mail associated with a gamertag, so I suggest looking around different e-mails you've made. Once you've located the correct
 e-mail account contact phone support for your region to cancel the account. Information on canceling an XBOX Live account are located
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/subscription-management/cancel-xbox-live-gold-subscription" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for answering, but this didn't answer my question. I already know the email associated with the account, I just am unable to login to the one one that has gold, I'm only able to login to the "parent" account. I've already found the page you've linked
 me, but it doesn't help because I can't get into the right account. Also, please explain the phone support thing, why do you need that to delete an account?</p>

<p>Call phone support. &nbsp;If you can verify the info for the just the old account (don't have to verify the adult account) you can request they either cancel it or turn off the auto renew. &nbsp;There are some other suggestions I could post as well, but try that first
 and let us know if you were successful.</p>

<p>And that was exactly what I answered for you, I understand that you know the parents e-mail attached to the account, but the "child" account also had it's own e-mail. There's no way to look that up, which is what I was getting at. If you don't know the e-mail
 of that account then there's no way to get into that. You could try contact phone support and see if they are able to look into what accounts are attached to the parental account but that's a long shot. You can't fully ever "delete" an XBOX Live account, you
 can only "cancel" it. XBOX Live accounts are stored on the XBOX Live servers for upwards of 7 years, and can be deleted for inactivity at random times. They do sweeps from time to time that deletes "free" tags that aren't being used. The account cannot be
 canceled via e-mail or chat, as the website states in order to immediately cancel an account you need to contact phone support.</p>

<p>@Hassassinade, many thanks that was my mistake. I misunderstood what you were saying, and did not know that the child account has an email associated with it. I logged in with the only email I thought was possible, and sure enough that was the correct one.
 Thank you sir, I have just cancelled automatic renewal.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 &#34;No Networking Hardware Detected&#34;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>After the Windows 10 upgrade from 8.1 pro, I have no network connection. The machine is an old HP Media Center PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking Connect to a Network give the error: No Networking Hardware Detected</p>
<p>
</p><p>The on-board Intel PRO/100 VE Network Adapter does NOT appear in Device Manager, and there are also no "unknown" devices appearing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP offers no driver updates after XP. However, Windows 8.1 connected to it with no trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if I had a driver to install, there is no networking hardware detected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am confounded.&nbsp;Can anyone please suggest a solution?</p>

            <p>Thank you Isha, for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, the methods listed did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1:</p>
<p>The Troubleshooter only reported that I had no installed driver. I already knew that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2:</p>
<p>Both the links led to empty pages. No content under Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3:</p>
<p>After downloading the only driver installer from HP (9 years old), I found no compatibility tab in the properties window.</p>

<h2>            Is there any way to uncap framerate on backwards compatible games on xbox one&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I know that Bioshock's framerate can be uncapped for great performance, but what about the other games? I want to be able to run them at 60 FPS </p>

            <p>Hi,</p><p><br /></p><p>Unless a game has such option, no, this isn't possible.&nbsp; The games have recompiled to act the same as they do on the 360. Many games have better performance, but what you are asking is not possible.</p>
