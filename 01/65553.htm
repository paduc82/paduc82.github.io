<h2>            Has Xbox Live always been this bad&#63; Xbox one as a retro console&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I'm amazed at just how awful my brand new Xbox one is. I've owned it for a total of 3 days, and its been unplayable almost the entire time!!!! Not because of the console itself, not because I forgot to pay my internet bill, not because my tv is broken,
 but because microsoft had the great idea to make the xbox one ONLY work while connected to their servers. Are you kidding me?!?!?! My ps4 has never not allowed me to play the games i paid for, my switch is the same way, i can always play my games even when
 their network is down. When i try to fix the error on my xbox it even tell me there is no issue with the online service, just try again. "wana fill out a survey for help with your sign in problems. well guess what you gotta sign in to fill it out". I go online
 and everyone is having issues and I'll i see microsoft doing is saying "We are here and we are listening". Yeah..... sure you are. Maybe you should be some where else trying to fix a fundamental problem with the way you set up your xbox OS and your servers,
 the connection between the two is too deep. I bought this console 3 days ago..... unplayable for 2 days. This is the last microsoft console i will buy, and it should be the last console ya'll make.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also one question thats been bothering me. I collect games, I have a lot of retro games from Atari 800xl, NES, Dreamcast, and etc etc. But what happens in 10 years for the xbox one. When the new generation comes out, and ya'll close the servers, do all Xbox
 one just stop working? Will we never be able to play the xbox one as a retro console?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see it as my gaming duty to tell as many people as I can about your faulty products so that better companies that care about their gamers and not just their wallets will get "your" business. Thanks Microsoft for allowing me to buy a 400$ paperweight.&nbsp;</p>

            yes it has been a rough couple of days, but you can still use your console offline. Make sure your console is set as the home console (can only be done online), once you have done that, just put the console in offline mode (done in network settings), then
 you can play your games offline.

            These issues are extremely rare. I also own other consoles as well as a gaming PC, and all of them have issues from time to time.

            Thanks, now i can actually play my games! I'll give the xbox another chance, im just frustrated i spent so much money and it seems i picked the worst time to buy and xbox. But if you have to connect to online to make it your home console does that mean
 that xbox one will never be playable as a retro console when 10+ years have passed?

<p>Xbox with the generic, we are here for you and doing everything in our power excuse...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't even talk to a person anymore through chat, you can either wait 35 minutes to hope for a call back, or keep your fingers crossed that Microsoft can actually figure out what they are doing for long enough to get a game or two in. I say it's probably
 more likely for the first one, because I have been an xbox customer for close to 15 years, and you do nothing for loyal customers, and just give the same tired excuse to everyone. Do the millions of dollars you collect each month through membership fees, not
 provide enough for an adequate support team, or should I just keep my fingers crossed going forward when I sign on that it actually works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, Playstation, just make a better controller and you will probably have 50% of the xbox community switch.. would even buy a new console and rebuy games, to not have to deal with this on a almost daily basis.</p>

<p>Sorry if it been reported before, but I noticed something that I think is either a bug or a step backwards in the Windows 7 defrag command line program. Below is the output of the 'defrag' command run under XP / Vista and then under Windows 7 for the same

The thing that is different is that Windows 7 no longer tells you how much of the your MFT on a drive is in use. It always says that it is at 100%. Where as XP and Vista tell me only 37% is in use. So the MFT is not close to extending itself and therefore is
 not likely to become fragmented. Checked on the one other Windows 7 PC I have in the house and the behaviour is the same<br />
</p>
<p>Now for whatever reason I like to know this information. So I don't know if it is a bug or if there is a redesign reason for the stat now being useless. Anyway just wanted to report it, if it is a bug and get a reason for why the change happened, if not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response, but I don't see anywhere in the article, why any of the changes would mean that the "MTF Usage"&nbsp; stat, would now always be shown at 100%. If it is not a bug I don't know why the MFT Usage stat has been left as part of the defrag
 reporting, as it is now a bit useless....</p>

 is a known bug with Windows 7. I suggest that you post your feedback following the below link:</span></span></p>

            Done, Bit difficult to report there though since it only allows you to write a couple of lines. Difficult to report without also including the defrag program outputs.<br />

<p>I have an HP laptop Notebook signature edition 65 bit operating system,x64-based processor windows 10 home version 1511 OS Build 10586.318 intel core i7-6700HQ CPU 2.60 GHZ 8GB ram</p>
<p>
</p><p>the problem in the device manager is a failed unknown USB Device (Device Descriptor Request Failed} I may have to uninstall about 20-50x and scan for hardware then HD True Vision will come up under the imaging device when this happens this is the web cam
 driver and I cannot roll it back because I do not have the option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>the driver may work for that time but goes back to the failed request USB I do not know where it is located to change where the driver is because when it does show under imaging device it says it still has further installation

<p>Hi how do I know who the manufacturer is of the universal serial bus controllers or do you mean the driver for the imaging device?</p>
<p>this problem is driving me crazy. I will be able to get the imaging device "HP Truevision HD" to show up and use it for the camera once then it will go back to the error code. The fixes have not lasted as permanent. Do you have any suggestions? I found out
 after the 30 day return policy from Amazon and they will take it back&nbsp;less $125. restocking fee. I can not loose that for something that does not work properly. Frustrated!!! I appreciate your help I uninstalled the usb root and the unknown failure then&nbsp;I
 scanned for hardware changes and the camera showed up. But I have not used it yet. any suggestions would be appreciated. thank you

<h2>            Xbox 360 Cutting Off </h2>
                    
<p>My Xbox 360 (I think it's a Slim but I'm not sure) keeps cutting off after a certain amount of time and it always does it after the same amount of time. I've tried everything I found on the internet and forums but nothing seems to work. The only way it doesn't
 cut off after about 2-3 minutes is if I&nbsp;unplug everything and let it cool down for a few hours and even then I only get about 7-10 minutes to play. This is a very annoying problem as you can imagine and I need help.</p>

<p>Hey there Elite,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear you're having an issue with your console's power.<br />
<br />
<strong>Here's a couple steps you can try:</strong><br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Try plugging your console’s power supply into a different electrical outlet. Do not use a surge protector.<br />
&nbsp; </li><li>If the power supply light is solid red or flashing orange, unplug the power supply and let it cool for 30 minutes. Then, plug the power supply back into the outlet.<br />
&nbsp; </li></ol>
<p><strong>If your power supply light is still flashing orange, solid red, or unlit</strong>, your power supply needs to be replaced. You can&nbsp;<a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/en-us/pages/consolemanager.aspx?useraction=requestarepair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Order a replacement
 Xbox 360 power supply</a>&nbsp;from our Xbox Online Service Center. Console registration is required to replace the power supply under warranty (the power supply warranty is the same as your console warranty).</p>
<p><b>If your power supply light is solid green or solid orange light:</b><span>&nbsp;Your power supply is working. If your console won’t turn on, try our&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/console-power/no-power-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox No Power Solution</a><span>.<br />

<br />
Let us know how that goes and we'll work from there.</p>

<p>I tried plugging the power supply into a different outlet and that did not work so I unplugged the power supply and let it cool for several days while I has on vacation. When I plugged it back in and tried to play, it stayed on for a little longer than before
 but still cut off eventually. </p>

</p><p>If Cortana is not hearing you then your microphone is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try checking your Windows microphone privacy settings if your microphone is enabled for all apps.</p>

<h2>            Screen Sharing and Recording</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am struggling to figure out how to screen share and record the other person simultaneously. Basically, I want to screen share a powerpoint, so the person I'm calling can watch the powerpoint, but I want to record just them watching it and all of their
 reactions - right now, when I screen share and then record I can only see the powerpoint and a small image of them in the bottom right hand corner. Instead, I want the full screen of the recording to be them. Do you know I might go about doing this? Any help
 you can offer would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!<br />

            Hi, I'm Roberta, a Microsoft Community Expert and I'm here to help and assist you!
<br />
<br />I'm sorry but unfortunately, it's not possible to change this. The recorded call will always show the shared document in the large screen, and people in small pictures in the lower right corner of the screen.
<br />
<br />Anyway, you can submit your feedback directly to our specific team Feedback:&nbsp;<a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-welcome-to-skype-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-welco...</a>

<p>Hi Roberta!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your help. Do you think this workaround could work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- put the powerpoint on an extra monitor</p>
<p>- use skype on the actual laptop (*so it looks like a normal skype call where you can see the other person and vice versa, and the screenshared powerpoint is on that other monitor)</p>
<p>- use quicktime to record the person on the laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you so much!<br />

<h2>            error 0x80070013</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>I have been unable to BACKUP win 10 since moving to versin 1809 from 1803 and now my system is over 10 days old the revert to previous version is no longer an option.. In 1803 it at least said where the issues were ie in c\win\users\documents etc so you
 could see where the issue lies. On checking with Microsoft all they advised was that File History and system restore do the same job.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions please</p>

            While Windows inbuilt backup is good and but with each update of Windows 10, this is creating more problem. This is not very reliable and sometimes, people do report problems. There are quite a lot of free utilities (+paid ones also) which are used by folks worldwide. Most of them prefer Free edition of Macrium Reflect which you can download and install from

</p><p>Hi, thanks for the reply. Unfortunately, the suggested fix doesn't work for me - having just ran another backup (win 7 from backup area) of win 10 . God knows why it refers to win 7 but it fails each time and i changed the backup folders and just did c drive
 for o/s and still fails. Got a backup program macrium now but not sure how that works just yet - early days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should sort this issue out and give people a way of backing up easily in case of system failure.

<br />That's odd. Here is a related discussion.

            Windows backup &amp; maybe in the future file history are being deprecated &amp; will eventually be removed, what you’re experiencing may be related to that.

<br />
<br />Microsoft recommend using third party software:
<br />“System Image Backup (SIB) Solution
<br />We recommend that users use full-disk backup solutions from other vendors.”

<br />
<br />I recommend moving to third party imaging software now before it is removed permanently  if you prefer backing up your PC rather than using File history.
<br />Many users recommend Macrium Reflect free:

I occasionally use an old <strong>Playbook </strong>for backup, but today I find my laptop refuses to connect due to</p>
<p>a security issue that Windows flags up (Playbook using a dated security protocol or something long those lines) :(&nbsp;.

<p>Hey there Variable! As mentioned above, this free month is only available when you sign up, so if you have completed that process, you would not be able to get the free month. Also, there are only three free months per console, so once those are gone, it
 stops offering them. Did other people already create accounts on the console, or was it purchased second hand? I hope this helps, thanks!

    <title>I am trying to run an a2dp stereo sound device &#40;LinTech Bluelino - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rollo martins  say:</h3>
<h2>            I am trying to run an a2dp stereo sound device &#40;LinTech Bluelino 1.04&#41; on Windows 7 Home Premium 64 Bit. The device driver does install, but the device does not show up  in the &#34;Sounds&#34; section of the control panel.</h2>
                    The device driver (actually two devices, a remote control device and the sound device itself) installs without errors. But the device does not show up in the device manager (before installing, unknown devices were listed there, but they disappeared after
 the installation). I wonder if it should already show up there.<br />
<br />
I am now using&nbsp; (32bit) Vista drivers - I directed the installation to the old Vista partition where it found the driver, after a first installation attempt had failed with a message that the correct driver was not found.
<br />
<br />
The device also does not show up in the "Sounds" section of the control panel as it did in Vista, so I cannot select it as a standard device for sound output.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your answers.<br />
<br />

The device worked flawlessly with Vista (newest SP applied).

            Thank you for your suggestions. I found a way to solve the problem in the meantime. HP just published a new device driver, which installed well and now adds bluetooth audio as an audio device. (I use an Elitebook 6930p laptop computer.)<br />

Software Support for HP Integrated Module with Bluetooth Wireless Technology f- or Microsoft Windows 7</a>
<br />
<br />
Important notes:<br />
<br />
- The update function of Win7 did NOT find this driver. I had to download and install it manually from the HP website.<br />
- The driver only installs if the old drivers are in place (just switch wireless/BT off and on again using the blue wireless touch switch on top of the keyboard of the HP laptop, and it will re-install automatically, if you have uninstalled before). Otherwise
 you will get the message that the Bluetooth device was not found. (Same for the Beta drivers fromthe Broadcom website, which allegedly _should_ do the job as well. They did not find the device here - maybe this happened because I had uninstalled the old drivers
 before. But I suggest to use the HP drivers anyway now as they have been publised.)<br />
- When installing an a2dp device and asked for a driver, redirecting the install procedure to old Vista drivers will not help. They will install, but they will not add a bluetooth audio device to the system, so a2dp stays unusable.<br />
<br />
Kind regards and thank you for your help again.<br />
