            First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore or brightness functions missing. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<h2>            My Compaq CQ62 laptop&#39;s screen keeps on turning white and freezing there. What can I do against it&#63;</h2>
                    However, I know that somehow the background processes are working. For example, when this happened when I was watching a video, even when the screen is white, I can still here the audio of the video. Also, this keeps on happening again and again, even
 when I am starting up my laptop. I've done registry cleaning and antivirus scanning, all of them proved unhelpful. I am thinking of reformatting my laptop, but I hope there are solutions for this one before I do that. Thanks for the great, great help if you
 can answer this. T.T

            I haven't done yet your suggestions because I am busy at the moment, but I'll answer the three questions:
<div><br />
<div>1. The only thing I remembered doing was to download a new windows theme from the Microsoft website. I think that has no virus or anything. Besides I have tried antivirus programs and it turned out nil. Basically that's the only thing I did. I did not
 do any change to my laptop or delete anything.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. A BIG YES. Sometimes it just stays there, sometimes it takes about a minute to become black again ("Starting Windows")and start up or show the blue windows "Welcome" screen.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. How often? Sometimes it happens randomly while I am doing something here. But I think, but I am not sure if it is a coincidence, when I restore improperly closed pages on Google Chrome(because you know, when the screen turns white, I can't do anything
 but &nbsp;to just turn off the laptop by pressing the on/off button, resulting in sudden restarts or shut downs), or when I watch a youtube video. And it almost certainly happens after the computer wakes up from sleep mode. Just wait a few seconds after that and
 BAM! it is now white.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope those above answers give more detail to my problem, but I have yet to try your methods. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, because this problem has been bugging me a lot now. :)</div>
<div><br />
<div>P.S. A friend suggested the problem might just be "on the display" only because I can still hear things from the laptop(like in the original question) so it might not be a software problem at all. So I think I'll try number 3 first. :)</div>

<h2>            Windows 8 logon loop, Recovery disk not working.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a Toshiba Satellite C855D-S5357 Laptop running windows 8. When you first turn on the system it try's logging into the the first user automatically saying "Please Wait...". After a while it will time out and go back to the windows 8 logon splash page.
 If you click on it to bring up the user logon page it just goes back into the "Please wait" screen and repeats. There are not options to press the power in the charms menu to enter safe mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is where things get interesting. The only way i have found to attempt to recovery the OS is to boot from a recovery disk. I used downloaded and created a CD using Microsoft's ISO download page. Unfortunately the bios will not boot to the CD drive in
 UEFI mode. &nbsp;I have Secure Boot Disabled and when I switch the boot mode to "CSM"(I assume Toshiba's version of legacy) I can boot into the CD Drive However the hard drive becomes unavailable and the Recovery options state that the drive is locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have repeated these steps using Rufus to create a bootable USB drive with the same ISO and GPT Partition Scheme for UEFI settings set but with the same results as the CD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please does anyone know a way where I can Refresh or recover this operating system?<br />
</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t turn on wifi on my new windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded my windows 7 (which was in perfect working order) to windows 10, except minor problems, I have a big problem in turning my wifi adapter on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The switch is grayed out in settings, I mention that I have tried all "fixes" that I found on the internet with with command prompt dni_dne and many others, reseting bios settings to default.</p>
<p>&nbsp;And nothing works. At network diagnostics it sais wifi adapter is not turned on. I have a lenovo notebook b590 which don't have an external switch for wifi, and the hot key fn+F5 which should be on/off wifi now is airplain on/off switcher.</p>

            <p>Hello! My name is Edvarts. I use&nbsp;DELL INSPIRON N5110 had an issue with&nbsp;WIFI, and I could not turn it on! I did everything with drivers, as well as installed unnecessary ones and older versions that worked on Windows 8.1 and 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some time ago my computer was&nbsp;beeped rapidly (BIOS signaling about keyboard issue), I&nbsp;did not pay attention, I was&nbsp;using&nbsp;USB keyboard anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I did not pay attention for the "beeping"&nbsp;a long time. What happened was: I used my pc all the time with external keyboard and when I&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">installed</span> (not updated) windows 10 my keyboard finished its humble life
 circle with not responding at the "type in your password" window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started to search for answers and found a lot of advices for: settings, drivers, system and even protocols for WIFI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is that that "Fn+F2(WIFI key)" is like an actual switch that turns on that small WIFI card in DELL INSPIRON N5110, I bought a new keyboard and Vualá, turned on WIFI everything back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this is useful for someone, my apologies for the long post.</p>

    <title>Microphone Not Picking Up Audio or ANY noise - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microphone Not Picking Up Audio or ANY noise</h2>
                    <p>So I recently got a nextech microphone and it's not working on my computer, now let me elaborate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plug the mic into the microphone jack on the side of my computer and it does appear on my computer, yet for some reason it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already right clicked on recording devices in my audio and I have set this microphone to default, yet whenever I speak it does not pick up my voice, it also does not pick up any other sounds. The built in microphone shows green volume bars rising
 and falling beside it when I speak or make noises, but my microphone does not and I have no idea what I could possibly do to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already tried to troubleshoot and I've done everything it's said, but for some reason my microphone still isn't working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it possibly be a piece of software I am missing or something like that? Please someone help I want to start using my mic!!</p>

            <p>Ok thank you for the feedback, my problem wasn't with any of these, but after a bit more playing around with my mic I did figure out the problem. It was not configured properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the help anyways/</p>

<p>I have attempted to backup my files using an external hard drive (which I have done before with Windows 7 64bit) but recently I keep getting the same error code. I re-formatted the external hard drive, run the diagnostics on it, restarted the computer, etc.
 and nothing seems to work. I have also tried both options posted in another forum with the same error and they too have been unsuccessful (external is already NTFS and now that it has been re-formatted is completely empty). Does Windows have anymore suggests?
 I am hoping to not have to resort to drag/dropping my files every time I want to back my computer up.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>Read this article as I believe the amount of free space in the 100MB partition is too small. The article is for another error code but the technique to increase the size of the 100MB partition is the same.</p>

<h2>            Repeated crashes bugcheck 0x00000001</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get repeated crashes since the last windows update last week. &nbsp;The first were playing games, the computer would freeze, including sound stuttering. &nbsp;The only way was a hard shutdown. After shutdown, the computer power would constantly, no post screen etc.
 &nbsp;I removed power, waited 5 minutes, it continued a little bit then would boot. &nbsp;POST showed that overclocking failed. &nbsp;I booted normally and it worked for a few days. &nbsp;Then today it crashed again. &nbsp;Same symptoms, same boot cycle. &nbsp;This time I set BIOS to default,
 removing my overclock. &nbsp;Shortly after booting, Windows restarted, and came back from a bugcheck. The minidump file is below. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I left the computer alone, walked away for an hour, came back to it at the login screen. &nbsp;Checking logs was identical. &nbsp;Looking at the 0x0000001 error, it seemed to be memory, but I am not convinced after looking at the dump. Can anyone decipher this for
 me and let me know? &nbsp;It looks like a driver issue based on the end of the file...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

</span></p><div><span><strong>How To Find Drivers:</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong>Do not use device manager it may tell you the device is up to date but will not tell you if it is corrupt&nbsp;</strong></span></div>
<div><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><strong>Search</strong> Google for the name of the driver, or go to the computer makers site.</div>
<div><span><br />
<strong>Compare</strong> the Google results with what's installed on your system to figure out which device/program it belongs to<br />
<strong>Visit</strong> the web site of the manufacturer of the hardware/program to get the latest drivers (DON'T use Windows Update or the Update driver function of Device Manager).<br />
If there are difficulties in locating them, post back with questions and someone will try and help you locate the appropriate program<br />
<br />
The most common drivers are listed on these pages:&nbsp;<br />

            <strong>ok your right..</strong> SORRY David----but anyway it was tryed...everything on ths machine says i have it , but i do not. I did not use the feature that much as stated and at this point for the sake of an&nbsp;argument. I with draw my question. i hope
 this sounds right because ive already been told by a star person that i cant type at all and also was ,clueless, unsofistacated, and uneducated as well.&nbsp; try and look at it this way&nbsp; I'm 72 yr old, totaly disabled and type with only one finger. but i did graduate
 from high school. and have had a computer since , well i cant remember ,early ninetys. Now im im saying all this because ive had a bad experience on here. i will not respond back to this post. I dont care what so ever any more if i have WMC or not nor half
 the other unuseable things on windows7. Id bet a brand new 20$ bill that i could get thru to the President of these here United States of America easer than to a paycheck colecting employee of the Mighty Microsoft who gets that paycheck from the "Monies i
 and others have spent" . Absolutey no support , that is from paid person anyway. I could go own forever but my one finger is tired. If your asking yourself why all this. Well you unpayed persons are always jumping in a sandbox that is not yours. I see not
 nare a reason for your defences reply. and thats what i get with every single dadgum question ive ever posted on here. You need to be helping someone that needs help. Myself no longer do. Happy holidays

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade changed my tablet&#39;s Device Category to Notebook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael crews  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade changed my tablet&#39;s Device Category to Notebook PC</h2>
                    <p>I have a Fujitsu Stylistic Q584 tablet. &nbsp;This is a Baytrail device with an Atom SoC. &nbsp;When I bought it Windows 8.0 was loaded, and I upgraded it to Windows 8.1 right after. &nbsp;Kept Fujitsu's drivers up to date until last week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I upgraded to Windows 10, I followed Fujitsu's upgrade pre-install guide, which called for uninstalling a couple of the Fujitsu drivers for Windows 8. After the Windows 10 upgrade I installed the updated drivers from Fujitsu. I have since installed
 the Windows 10 anniversary update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is that my tablet is seen by Windows 10 as a Notebook PC. &nbsp;Under Devices &amp; Printers, selecting my tablet and checking the properties shows it as a Notebook PC, and the Hardware tab lists the sort of devices a notebook would have, such as a Lid sensor.
 But my tablet has no lid! &nbsp;In Device Manager, the Computer entry shows "ACPI x64-based PC." When I sign in it goes to Desktop mode when "Use appropriate mode for my hardware" is set under Settings -&gt; Tablet Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, if I set Tablet Mode there, it goes into Tablet Mode. But why is it changed to a Notebook PC, and how do I change it back?</p>

            Hello Michael,
<p>
</p><p>We would like to ask you if&nbsp;you sees Notebook in the Desktop view only? </p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description it seems that you are seeing Notebook when&nbsp;you are changing to Desktop view whereas in tablet view, everything is fine. Hence we suggest&nbsp;you to try installing all the pending Windows Update when in Desktop view.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also we suggest you to update&nbsp;the&nbsp;drivers from the Device Manager and then check for the issue. To do this, please follow the below step.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press Windows key + X key and select the Device Manager. </p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Select all the drivers one after another then right click the driver and select "Update driver software".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If possible we would ask you to provide a Screenshot of the issue. To attach the screenshot in your post, please follow the below link.

<p><span><strong>I am trying to install an old DOS version of Q&amp;A4 into my new laptop with Windows 7. &nbsp;Here is the error displayed: "The version of this file is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. &nbsp;Check your computer's

 then into Windows 7. &nbsp;Any advice?</strong></span></p>

<p>My advice would be to upgrade to Windows 7 Professional, download the free Windows Virtual PC with Windows XP Mode and run it through that. You can even virtualize the DOS instance of Q&amp;A and run it side by side with your Windows 7 desktop apps.</p>

            <p>You will need to purchase a retail upgrade&nbsp;license for Windows 7 Ultimate. This will either mean you will have to purchase from a local computere store or if you have relatives or friends in Europe, let them purchase a copy for you there and send it to you.
</p>
<p>If you can purchase products online, you could probably try purchasing the license yourself:</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Enterprise to Windows 10</h2>
                    So, I recently got a new hard drive and it already has Windows 7 enterprise installed on it and I was wondering if I could still do a free upgrade from Windows 7 enterprise to Windows 10 home. Or, I could downgrade to Window 7 home and then upgrade to
 Windows 10. Or, do I have to purchase the whole operating system full price?

            <p>Crit12,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 Enterprise is only supplied through corporate subscriptions and&nbsp;these users&nbsp;would rely on the corporate IT department to manage Windows 10 upgrades.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have obtained a counterfeit copy of Windows 7 Enterprise then you will only qualify for the upgrade if you first purchase a proper licence.&nbsp; You might find it cheapest to buy a licence for Windows 7 Home premium, Pro or Ultimate from Amazon etc &amp;
 then upgrade to Windows 10 from that but do be careful as there are a lot of dishonest people out there peddling counterfeit licences.</p>

    <title>Windows 10&#58; Settings not saved - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> delgaclu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Settings not saved</h2>
                    <p>I want the image in the screen to change every 10 minutes or 30, random mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I choose it, I choose the folder I want the pictures from, but any **** single time I restar the computer, the configuration is lost and I have a one single picture and have to enter settings again and set up the folder with random pictures again. What the
 ****?</p>
<p>Also the color I chose, it changes, W 10 sucks :-( what am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>ETA: adding screenshot, I don't understand, doesn't matter what I do any time I get back to desktop there is a picture I chose when I used the computer for the first time, as you can see the configuration is set to show a different picture every 10 minutes,
 whatever it's running on battery or connected. The configurtion just won't stick :-(</p>
<p>There is no "save changes" button .</p>
<p>The option "available when running on battery I turn on as "yes" but anytime I get back to configuration it's in the "no" position. The same with random choosing images from folder, when I open configuration it says "image" again, I'm very sad.&nbsp;</p>

            This is not the least bit helpful. Is the computer OS Windows X (Roman numeral for 10 as this program seems to have regressed.) designed to do what I want it to do or is it not?! If my car acted like this I could not get anywhere I wanted to go. I set
 power settings, default programs, or just about any other thing the OS leads me to believe I am in charge of and when I reboot magically the computer has decided what it wants is better. The settings box has no "Save" option, I just X out of it. IS there some
 way to save what you have set that I am missing?

            <p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several reasons which can cause this error in your computer. One of these is a corrupted or missing system file. You may run the

    <title>Android devices freeze on Windows 10 File Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sebasti&#225;n sol&#237;s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Android devices freeze on Windows 10 File Explorer</h2>
                    <p>I have two Android devices:</p>
<p>*Sony Xperia (4.3)</p>
<p>*Asus Nexus 7 (5.1.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which I usually connect to two different PCs:</p>
<p>*HP 5220 (Upgraded from Windows 7 Home Basic)</p>
<p>*Asus X550Z (Upgraded from Windows 8.1 SL)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is, I do this rarely: about one time per month, so I can't know if this happened recently. When I did yesterday, I noticed that the folders inside the device were taking too long to load, if they did at all. If you click on a file, File Explorer
 just freezes and dies. It can also happen that no folders appear inside the device, or that its folders appear empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I'm writing this, I opened the Music folder on my Android device; it found 91 files and the green bar continues going, after more than ten minutes. It has now found 2 more files. This can give you an idea of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, sometimes it won't let you copy files from the phone to the PC or vice versa, nor create new folders in the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened with both devices, on both PCs.</p>
<p>Right now I have access to the Asus PC and have run the Troubleshooter for Hardware; folders with few files load normally, but the larger ones are giving trouble enough.</p>
<p>Neither device has a SD card, and the Xperia SP is rooted with USB debugging activated. Both devices and
 both PCs work fine on their own; files are not damaged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just so you know, I'm not letting Windows install new updates, following an issue with a January update (after installing, it wouldn't let me rename any folders).</p>
<p>How can I know if this is a device or a PC-related issue? Has anyone encountered this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Fifteen minutes: the Music bar finally stopped loading: 105 files found. Now, File Explorer is saying my Pictures folders are empty)</p>

            <p>Hello Sebastian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>You mean to say, you stopped installing all Windows Updates?</li><li>Did you tried connecting the device to other computer running legacy Windows version?</li><li>Are you using correct or Manufacturer supplied USB cable for connecting Phone to PC?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>To confirm the root cause of the issue, try connecting the devices to other computers which are running legacy Windows version. I mean, the computers running with either Windows 8.1 or Windows 7 or Windows XP. This will give us the clue on the root cause
 of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes the problem might also occur with the USB cable, which you're trying to connect the Mobile Phone to your PC. Suggest you to check this issue by changing the USB cable or by&nbsp;using new USB cable wire to see if the same issue appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, i<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">n Windows 10, your device is always kept up to date with the latest features and fixes. Updates and drivers are installed automatically, with no need to select which updates
 are needed or not needed. In rare cases, a specific driver or update might temporarily cause issues with your device.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In view of the same, not every Update will cause issue with your device. Try installing pending Windows Updates and see if they cures the issue. If you're concerned about this, you
 can create a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/create-a-system-restore-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Manual Restore Point</a>, before you initiate Windows Updates. If anything goes wrong, then you restore your PC earlier using that Restore Point.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted the outcome to guide you further.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>I stopped updating by indicating a metered connection, following an annoying folder issue. I did try installing update KB3135173 two weeks after the issue I had with update KB3124262, but since it did not solve my problem, I used System Recovery to clean
 the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, having tried connecting my phone to an updated Windows 10 PC and two Windows 7 PCs, I can say this is not the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today (having made no changes to the phone), files loaded quicker, but issues are still there (unable to copy, unable to rename).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now I removed the device drivers and reconnected it for a fresh start; files load quicker, but I am still unable to create new folders in the device, with a message saying:&nbsp;<br />
"The new folder could not be created in this location. The device has either stopped working or has been disconnected".</p>
<p>Then, connecting the phone on a different PC, I can see the folders were actually created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to rename any folder, on the other hand, makes File Explorer crash, on all cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I connected also a new Samsung Galaxy with its own cable to the PC: a folder was created, but File Explorer still finds it difficult to rename folders. Used the same cable on the Xperia and it worked... once. Then it happened all over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this is now clearly an Android device/configuration-related problem, I'm going to look for help on an Android forum. I will post any solutions I find in case someone else is expierencing the same.</p>

<p>Unfortunately MS support is terrible and they give cut and paste answers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I can say is, i've been using androids for at least 4 years now on 3 separate devices, all of which have had the same issues you describe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Android has never been fully compatible with win7, win8/8.1 or win10. Scouring the internet gives no answers, it will never be resolved. Sorry to break your heart, it kills me too.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 freezes for 2 minutes after startup</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 freezes not directly at startup, but after it. I start my computer up, I log in with password, and then I get on the desktop. I can open anything, but after 1 minute my computer instantly freezes. I can still move my mouse around, but can't
 select anything. This problem occured today, but I didn't really install anything vital yesterday, except for a folder for a game inside my localappdata. I doubt that's the thing that is freezing my pc. So yeah, after 1 min of being logged in my screen freezes,
 and I can only move mouse and nothing else. This freeze lasts for about 1-2 minutes, and then I can completely use the computer again. So I can still use my computer, it's just annoying that I have to wait for my computer to unfreeze. What can I do to help
 this problem? I'd like to try some things before eventually returning this pc to the company that built it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for anyone who answers.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got the issue fixed. I don't know how this caused my computer to freeze. So I deleted the file in quarantine and put it back in my documents. I restarted my computer and the freezing was gone... I don't know if the computer fixed itself or it was Kaspersky
 freezing my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>I'm sorry to hear it, Im reporting U, but you cannot exit from "cheaters pool" because in Grand Theft Auto Online you can't get a modded RP (Reputation) from somebody, so I can guess that you was using mods to get RP and GTA$, but as Rockstar says that will
 be Title Update that will erase all modded money and RP, MAYBE players that was using mods will not be punished. But feel free to complete request at Rockstar Support page to erase all your modded GTA$ and RP:

<h2>            A Twist on Build 7601 genuine, My W7 cpu is 6 years old&#33; Not a new install&#47;activate&#47;upgrade. All orig. No probs for Six Years. Windows Activation SAYS I MUST ACTIVATE TODAY</h2>
                    <p>There is ZERO question that I have a Genuine Windows version, I've used it without fail since 2010, SEVEN Years. &nbsp;One thing that may help you resolve this for me - I have been unable to get Windows Updates since February. It just sits there for HOURS and
 never does a dang thing. Beyond frustrating. My report is below. I have a HP G62-225DX notebook, Windows 7 Home premium, 64 bit, Service Pack 1. &nbsp;And have had no other problems in functioning over these many years. BIG thanks for looking into this...</p>

<p>That ll looks pretty good to me so why not talk to a Microsoft activation specialist:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start button/orb and in the box enter:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>slui&nbsp; 4</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Choose your nearest country, call the toll-free number to speak to a human being:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a06af82b-185f-4162-9460-05d35acdbf5c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a06af82b-185f-4162-9460-05d35acdbf5c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't press any keys on your phone, don't respond to any voice prompts, just wait, wait, wait and you will be connected to a human being.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Explain your situation and they should help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
If they don't help or can't help just hang up and call back again and the chances are good that you will talk to a different person and eventually you should find some nice person that will help you.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth driver for Toshiba Satellite C640 laptop &#40;Windows 8&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I upgraded from Windows 7(32 bit)&nbsp;to windows 8(64 bit)&nbsp;a few months ago. I'm using a Toshiba Satellite C640 laptop. When I was using Windows 7, Bluetooth and all the other drivers worked fine. But after I had upgraded, the Bluetooth stopped working. Upon
 consulting device manager, I found that there was no driver installed for Bluetooth. I searched for windows 8 drivers but the Toshiba site only had windows 7 ones. I installed a windows 7 64 bit driver&nbsp;(<strong>Bluetooth stack</strong>?)&nbsp;but it still isn't
 working. This is what my device manager&nbsp;shows:</p>
<p>Bluetooth</p>
<p>&gt;Bluetooth RFCOMM</p>
<p>Device status:</p>
<p>"Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged. (Code 19)"</p>
<p>Driver date:29-11-2010</p>
<p>Driver version:8.0.1129.0</p>
<p>Latest information under the events:</p>
<p>"Driver Management concluded the process to install driver tosrfcom.inf_amd64_a7e96825b593b472\tosrfcom.inf for Device Instance ID ROOT\BLUETOOTH\0000 with the following status: 0x0."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;Bluetooth RFCOMM (Same as above, appears to be a duplicate entry)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Location was not known in both of the above devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;Bluetooth USB Controller-10 from TOSHIBA</p>
<p>Location:Port_#0006.Hub_#0004</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Device status:</p>
<p>"Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged. (Code 19)"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Latest events info:</p>
<p>"Driver Management has concluded the process to add Service tosrfusb for Device Instance ID USB\VID_0930&amp;PID_0215\6&amp;29A9305&amp;0&amp;6 with the following status: 0"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What am I missing? I do not know what driver Toshiba uses, and the website does not have a windows 8 driver (I think). Please help, this is a major inconvenience for me.</p>

    <title>USB Port Issues and Restarting Windows when it is Shut-down - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB Port Issues and Restarting Windows when it is Shut-down</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry if this post is a duplicate. I have gone through lot of similar posts, but none helped. Hence I'm forced to start a new thread here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is running on Windows 7 Home Premium. It is all good until I saw an error for the first time in my life :
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Error: Power Surge On Hub Port: A USB device has exceeded the power limits of its hub port"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't click on the notification button because the USB mouse has stopped working. In-fact it is the only USB device plugged into the back of the CPU. Further I restarted the machine. I had to re-connect the mouse to the front USB port after finding
 all the rear USB ports are literally dead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was quite weird, however I decided to shutdown after my work has finished. And to my surprise, Windows restarted when expected to shut-down. Now I know something is happening and the aforementioned USB issue is connected with this, since I haven't made
 any application updates or such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked Event Viewer, and found the Error stuff like : </p>
<p>
</p><p>The following boot-start or system-start driver(s) failed to load: <br />
UsbCharger</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, I came to know that Windows is restarting because its crashing (when it doesn't look like). Now I'm no-where to fix this. Please let me know where to look for the errors and how to resolve this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Vipin</p>

            <p>The message tells me that the USB ports which are on the main board have been electrically blown.&nbsp; I doubt there is any way of fixing them other than main board replacement.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I strongly recommend you talk to your computer supplier.&nbsp; Then get yourself a surge suppressor bar.&nbsp; Warning, many say they are surge suppressors but are very poor.&nbsp; You do not have to spend a lot of money, just be judicious. APC makes good ones.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the quick response. That makes sense as none of the USB ports in the Motherboard is working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have figured why Windows is getting started after shutting it down - Its the Network adapter which is waking up the computer. Quite weird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will talk to the vendor asap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

            <p>I've talked to the Vendor and he implied formatting and a fresh install of the OS might work. I've spent hours on the updates and current setup of Windows, so I don't want to do it unless it's really necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think this will work ? Please suggest.</p>

            I doubt it very much if a re-install will change anything.&nbsp; That's lazy on the Vendor's part.&nbsp; You could lie and tell him you did and it not change anything&gt;?

            It's a long shot, but try unplugging the power cord to your computer for a few minutes and then plugging back in.&nbsp; I have seen that fix USB power surge issues a few times.

            That's a great idea GTS-NJ.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only pull the power plug.&nbsp; Also press the ON switch in for 10 seconds to drain power from the main board, after you pull the power plug.

<h2>            BUG - Wrong DST period for Iran &#40;Tehran&#41; time zone</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm surprised that there is a not-yet-solved-old bug in Microsoft Windows which causes the OS to think that the Daylight Saving Time over Iran (UTC+3:30 - Tehran) starts on 16th of March and ends on 16th of September, while that's a wrong belief!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually every year, the DST period on Iran starts on&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><strong>22 March</strong>, 00:00 Local Standard Time, and ends on&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)"><strong>22
 September</strong>, 00:00 Local Daylight Time.</span></p>
