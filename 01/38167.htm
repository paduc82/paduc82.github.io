<h2>            How do I repair my wireless connection in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    On XP I know if I had problems with a router or internet connection, I could simply right-click the networking icon in the system tray and do a repair connection. One click would get me back online (if there was no other problems). Is there something like
 that with Windows 7? My internet service seems to be going off and on, and I find myself getting booted offline and wanting to do this.&nbsp;

<h2>            Daily Challenge Points Lost</h2>
                    
<p>I played 11 days worth of challenges, exited the app, and when I opened it again, I had lost all my progress. &nbsp;Has anyone else seen this?</p>
<p>I was playing the challenges across midnight, so that when I started it was the 29th and when I closed the app it was the 30th. &nbsp;Not sure if that is significant.</p>
<p>I have lost about 7000 points and now have no chance of getting the gold medal for the month of October. &nbsp;Not really a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but still frustrating.</p>

<p>I've had this happen too, but in addition to this I've got another issue along the same lines but slightly different.</p>
<p>My coins seem to be roaming, but the won challenges is completely broken. I completed all the challenges on one day, and in the calendar view, it show the little badge, but when you open the day, all of the games are marked as not won, and you can play the
 games again as if they hadn't been completed.</p>
<p>Another day I only did two of the challenges, it says 2/5, but shows the complete badge as well. I've uninstalled the app and reinstalled it to no avail. This also happens on another computer, so it seems as though my cloud data is corrupt somehow.</p>
<p>Another bug occurs when the current day changes. If I open the Solitaire collection say today, do the challenges, then suspend the app, if I then open it again tomorrow, it doesn't automatically update the state information to detect that the day has changed,
 and therefore, update all the daily challenge information. I have to either terminate the app to force it to load again, which fixes it, or go via the calendar, pick today, which eventually causes it to update the current day's challenges.</p>

<p>I'm seeing the same thing, the coins earned during a previous session are lost. The calender is showing that no challenges have been complete (0/5) but when the day is clicked on the completed badges are showing.</p>

<p>I just had this happen again to me yesterday. I loaded it up from a suspended state, tried to load the current day's challenges while it was in a 2/3 snapped state. I noticed that Solitaire had no description for the daily challenge but tried to play it
 anyway. The app crashed and when I ran it again, my points had been reset back to zero.</p>
<p>The daily challenges are just about a waste of time for me now. Every time it crashes it corrupts my points, making me do most of them again. I hope a fix is coming soon.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, yes :(</p>
<p>Well, I have 100 points because I did one of today's challenges. I shall post a series of screenies showing its current state this afternoon (AEDT). I went back to yesterday's challenges, they've all got badges, but the calendar shows none completed (In
 fact, the calendar shows only the game I did today as being completed, which is wrong), and when I attempt to replay one of the won games, it tells me that I've already got the points and bonus points for that day.</p>

<p>I'm also seeing strange behavior. &nbsp;Played one challenge and was awarded all medals even though my point total didn't go up more than the standard for one win. &nbsp;I also see the weirdness with badges showing up for days with outstanding challenges and if I
 play one of unbeaten challenges it will say "5/4" challenges won until I exit and come back. &nbsp;Just some seriously corrupt data in there.</p>

<p>Correct you are. In all the years I have been using CNET I have never known it to take me to an MS site. Nevertheless, use the link below. Softonic is perfectly safe to download from.</p>

<h3> viperlotus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Belkin Nostromo n52 Speedpad Loadout Manager and Profile Editor both close shortly after opening.</h2>
                    So, I've downloaded the n52 software and drivers and installed them in compatibility mode for Windows XP (SP2) and as an administrator, and I've ran both the loadout manager and profile editor under the same settings.&nbsp; When I open the two programs, there
 are no issues at first, and I'm able to use them the way they were intended.&nbsp; However, after having them open for a few minutes, I get these errors:<br />
<br />
For the Loadout Manager - "<span style="font-weight: bold">Activator Application for Nostromo has stopped working</span>" followed by "<span style="font-weight: bold">a problem caused the program to stop working correctly.&nbsp; Windows will close the program and
 notify you if a solution is available.</span>"<br />
<br />
For the Profile Editor - "<span style="font-weight: bold">Editor 30 App for Nostromo has stopped working</span>" followed by "<span style="font-weight: bold">a problem caused the program to stop working correctly.&nbsp; Windows will close the program and notify you
 if a solution is available.</span>"<br />
<br />
After that, both of the programs close.&nbsp; I've done extensive searching on the internet, but I couldn't find anyone who had the same problem I've been having.&nbsp; What can I do to correct these errors so that both programs continue to run as long as I need them?<br />

            Hi umerbukhari,
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />
<br />Scroll down to the Sound and Video Controllers section
<br />
<br />Is there an exclamation mark beside your sound device in that section?
<br />
<br />If so you need to go to the Dell website, then download and install the appropriate Audio device drivers
<br />
<br />If not:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot - Playing Audio
<br />
<br />Run that troubleshooter to see if it resolves this issue . .       
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level
<br />
<br />Other options:
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing. 
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />

<br />
<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - 1703, 1607, 1511, 1507 (build 10240)
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro
<br />
<br />If its Windows 10 1803:
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<p>If it works as did OE, you can set up&nbsp;message rule that if the email is from a certain address then you can set it to highlight it with color and then set the color.&nbsp; I don't know if that is one of the things retained in WLM or if they removed it, as I don't
 use it.</p>

<h2>            Can I use Windows Live Mail for business&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I've just bought a new computer and found I could save a lot of money by buying the Office suite without Outlook. However, since I'm so used to using Outlook for my work, I was wondering if I would notice a huge difference if I just used the free Windows
 Live Mail client. Obviously, I need to be able to send/receive e-mails. I want to keep my work signature. I also like to set reminders. As for Out of Office replies, I can set these in the Webmail function of my web host. Would Windows Live Mail allow me to
 do these?<br />

            <p>The backup strategy in Windows Live Mail is designed for accounts setup using http or imap access.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ever have a problem, all emails on the servers have to downloaded again.&nbsp; A true backup would restore the accounts and email to the program and not
 have to download all emails again.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7,
<br />
or Windows 8

<br />
Other programs to help :<br />
<br />
Autoruns - Free - See what programs are configured to startup automatically<br />
when your system boots and you login. Autoruns also shows you the full list <br />
of Registry and file locations where applications can configure auto-start settings.<br />

Look for something that refers to a temp folder or files.<br />

Possibly it is something (such as a program) you have removed from your computer.<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
wow64 has to do with running 32 bit programs on 64 bit Windows.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
For uninstalled programs&nbsp; - Open section Windows Logs sub-section Application - sort by
<br />
Source column (click it) - look for Msinstaller by scrolling that column - "most all" will have<br />
Event ID 1034 though there might be others.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Source&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Event ID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Msinstaller&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1034&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Open Event Viewer<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/open-event-viewer#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/open-event-viewer#1TC=windows-7</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Or use this which is easier :</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>MyEventViewer - Free -&nbsp;a simple alternative to the standard event viewer of Windows.<br />
</strong>TIP - Options - Advanced Filter allows you to see a time frame instead of the whole file.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/my_event_viewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/my_event_viewer.html</span></a><br />
<br />
Again click the Source Column - scroll the the Msinstaller section - look mostly for Event ID 1034.<br />

            Its all very complicated for me, i did find 2 1034 events but they were for programs i still have on my laptop, although there is a **** of a lot of Error  Warning ones could they be the reason?  



i wish i had someone who could remotely access my system i'm terrified of doing something to damage my system

            Hi,<br />
<br />
In Autoruns it is most likely in the top section on the Logon Tab -&nbsp;also check the Explorer<br />
tab -&nbsp;though it can be in others. <br />
<br />
In Event Viewer there can be other events than 1034 though all should be under the Msinstaller
<br />
column.<br />

</p><p>I'm presuming its something to do with the browser settings but as I don't know how to adjust the settings, I've decided to stick with IE to save all the hassle and frustration.</p>

<p>Hi Maza,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>An incorrect configuration of Firewall is one of the possible reasons why you're unable to access the internet. To troubleshoot your concern, kindly follow these steps:</p>
<p><span>Turn Windows Firewall on or off</span> </p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open Windows Firewall by clicking the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;button&nbsp;</span><span><span><span><span><span>and then clicking<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Control Panel</strong>. In the search box, type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>firewall</strong>, and then click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows
 Firewall</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span> </span>
</span></span></span></li><li><span>In the left pane, click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Turn Windows Firewall on or off</strong>.
</span><span><span><span><span><span>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Turn on Windows Firewall</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>under each network location that you want to help protect, and then click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>OK</strong>.</span></li><li><span>If you want the firewall to prevent all programs from communicating, including programs that you have previously allowed to communicate through the firewall, select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Block all incoming connections</strong>, including those
 in the list of allowed programs check box.</span></li></ol>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<br />
<div>
<div>
<div style="margin-left: -24px">
<p>Note: You should not turn off Windows Firewall unless you have another firewall enabled. Turning off Windows Firewall might make your computer (and your network, if you have one) more vulnerable to damage from worms or hackers.<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Windows Firewall by clicking the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>button<span>&nbsp;</span>, and then clicking<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Control Panel</strong>.

If the crash still happens after reinstalling, can you try loading the game on a different Xbox Live account&nbsp;to see if the issue happens then?</p><p><br /></p><p>Keep us posted so we can work on more troubleshooting if you need it. :)

    <title>Win 7 Update KB2687499 and Error 80070663 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sidcam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7 Update KB2687499 and Error 80070663</h2>
                    <p>My&nbsp;HP Pavilion dv7&nbsp;runs Windows 7 and Office Small Business 2007.&nbsp; Since Update KB2687499 was released it has failed to install repeatedly.&nbsp; Other updates since have installed without a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went through the list of Windows Update help options such as disabled Windows Firewall, Disabled my Anti-Virus (Norton Internet Security) and ran several FixIt options that pertained to that error code.&nbsp; Nothing worked.&nbsp; I have also tried to install the
 KB with the Office 2007 CD installed which didn't change anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that I searched this forum and have tried everything I can find in other posts related to this KB or Error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This includes directly downloading the file (msxml52007-kb2687499-fullfile-x86-glb.exe) but it gets an error message that says, "An Error Occured while Running Detection."&nbsp; I have also tried to run the file as an Administrator, while in a Clean Boot and
 even in Safe Mode (with networking)- but it always produces the same error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have ran Office Diagnostics twice- once without and once with the Office 2007 CD installed.&nbsp; It didn't find a problem either time, nor have other system scans for viruses, errors, checkdisk problems, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the advice from a post on this forum I have used msconfig.exe to perform a clean boot and it still failed to install- both from Windows Update as well as from running the file directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last thing I tried was to delete Office and reinstall it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Office failed to delete.&nbsp; When I rebooted all the software was still&nbsp;on the machine&nbsp;(and launched) however Windows Update wanted to reload KB963671, SP3 and 7 other updates.&nbsp; After a reboot Windows
 Updates came back to KB2687499 which continues to fail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other things to note:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Control Panel-&gt;Programs and Features, when I right click on Microsoft Office Small Business 2007 and select "Change" a window opens that says, "Please wait while setup prepares the necessary files," but within a few seconds the window disappears.&nbsp; After
 that nothing happens.&nbsp; It does not open setup or allow me to do anything at all.&nbsp; It does this in a clean boot as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I install my Office 2007 CD the Setup fails to launch (even in a clean boot).&nbsp; The CD does not appear to be damaged or dirty.&nbsp; I can right click on it and browse the files without a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's my next option... other than to just hide the update?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Sid</p>

            I too am stuck with this recurring update. I am running windows 7 64 bit with office 2007. The PC is new (replaces old vista machine) and also crashes to a blue screen every second day. I was wondering if the crashing had anything to do with windows update
 continually trying to install KB2687499.
<div><br />
<div>None of the fixes work, and I have uninstalled and re-installed office 2007 with no effect.</div>

<p>I can only speak for myself, but I've had no problems with Blue Screen issues since this started and this PC is in use for 8-10 hours per day.&nbsp; Unfortunately it sounds like you have multiple things going on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I support 5- Windows 7 machines in my small business and my only blue screen experience with it (so far) was a bad sector on the boot disk (i.e. hardware failure).&nbsp; Hope that helps.&nbsp; Sorry it's not more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have the exact same problem with my Dell Precision M6500.&nbsp; Windows 7 64 bit.&nbsp; Office 2007.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Windows update for KB2687499 fails with Error code 80070663.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you try to download msxml52007-kb2687499-fullfile-x86-glb.exe and run it, "an error occurred while running detection"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone finds a fix for this, I'm open to ideas.&nbsp; I've tried modifiying some of the "missing" items in the registry, and that has not made a difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've forced Office to re-register the software with Microsoft, and that has not helped either.</p>

I had the same problem on two computers.&nbsp; I downloaded and ran this and it fixed them both.

            I tried the system update readiness tool too, but still have the problem. I had several updates to install this week and they have all worked OK except for the original problem one and now KB2596620 has added itself to KB2687499 in a permanent loop., constantly
 trying and failing to install. Interestingly they are both updates for Microsoft Office. I have tried uninstalling Office and re-installing it but to no avail.

<h2>            False &#34;This NEC Electronics USB hub can perform faster&#34; messages</h2>
                    <p>I have an external USB 3.0 hub connected to a USB 3.0 port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time when I reboot, or log off and back on, or plug in that hub, I get the message "This NEC Electronics USB hub can perform faster when it is connected to a Super-Speed USB 3.0 port".</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that message is *not* given for USB 3.0 devices I plug into that hub, and those devices *do* work at USB 3.0 speed.</p>
<p>I just verified that by running a harddisk benchmark program on an external USB3 harddisk connected through it, it measured 105.4 MB/s: clearly above USB2 speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All USB adapter and hub drivers are up to date, checked through 'update driver' context menu in device manager&nbsp;for each device in turn and letting it search on the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It hasn't always done this. &nbsp;My computer is normally always on, except for a reboot after the monthly batch of updates.</p>
<p>It started giving this message after rebooting from that the last time, but of course I don't know if an update is responsible or if it's something else that just sat waiting for the next reboot to kick in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think uninstalling and reinstalling drivers will help in this case, because the same driver (nusb3hub.sys) is also used for the USB root hub in the USB3 adapter, for which no such message is being given.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>BTW, when plugged in, the device appears in device manager as *two* "NEC Electronics USB Hub" devices, according to their properties both controlled by nusb3hub.sys version 1.0.18.0. &nbsp;Right above them is a "NEC Electronics USB 3.0 Root Hub" which is part
 of my USB3.0 adapter, using the same driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never had any such problems with other devices on the same adapter before I started using this hub.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have an idea how to get rid of this message?</p>
<p />

<p>Yes. Safe mode was unsuccessful in restarting the computer. I received the same error code.</p>

<p><span><span><span>Hello Jdelvin,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using the Microsoft Vista Answers Forum!</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Depending on the version of Windows Vista you have, there are two approaches you can take to backing up files:
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/backup.aspx#automatic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Automatic Backup</span></span></a><span>,
 which backs up just your files and data; or </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/backup.aspx#complete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Complete PC Backup</span></span></a><span>,
 which backs up everything on your PC, including the operating system and applications.</span></p>
<p><span>The first time when you use the first option (create backup) features on your system, a full backup—which is a complete backup of all the files from the
<strong>selected categories</strong>—is performed right away. Thereafter,
<strong>only incremental backups</strong> are performed</span></p>
<p><span>Same process, when you use the Backup Computer option which create a Windows Complete PC Backup and Restore image of your entire computer which can be used
 to recover from a hardware failure. Subsequent backups after this option are differential backup. However, the exception to these rules is that if you specify another location for your subsequent backups, Windows will assumed you have not done any backup prior
 this time, it will offer<span>&nbsp; </span>another complete backup even though it has been done before.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information on this features, see the link below</span></p>

<p><span>I have a new HP Pavilion Desktop with AMD Phenom II X4 Quad-Core Processor with the Vista OS that is replacing a HP Pavilion

<p><span>I have a copy of all my XP files on an external hard drive.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have connected this external hard drive to my new computer.</span></p>

</span>I select <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Files / Import / Messages / Outlook Express 6 format.</span></span></p>
<p><span>This takes me to the window that offers only the

</span>I then “Browsed” to the Outlook Express folder on my external hard drive and “selected” that folder.<span>&nbsp;

    <title>nVidia GeForce GTX black screen after login on Windows 7 64bit - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            nVidia GeForce GTX black screen after login on Windows 7 64bit</h2>
                    
<p>I think there has been a recent update for Windows 64bit that makes us get a black screen after windows login (right before desktop loads), when we have a newer version of the nVidia geForce graphics cards. I have a geforce 280 GTX and everytime I load windows
 up with the driver enabled (with the most recent update of Windows) my computer crashes with a black screen on login. I can start my computer fine on safe mode or with the driver disabled. (However&nbsp;occasionally&nbsp;I can login and it will work fine)</p>
<p>I have deleted and reinstalled the driver many times, without any success. I also tried system restores and system repair with no avail. I finally reformatted my computer and my computer was able to logon. I reinstalled all the updates and drivers, but when
 i restarted my computer the black screen reappeared. I phoned EVGA (the manufacturer for my gpu) and they told me there has been recently many calls regarding this black screen issue and they told me to reinstall and disable windows updates (the cause of the
 problem). I did that and my computer works fine again. I reinstalled the latest version of the nVidia driver and I haven't had a problem yet. Please Microsoft look into this so I can keep my computer up to date again.</p>

<p>Since the days of winxp the general advice is to NOT use winupdate for drivers, the problems that can be caused have been detailed many times.</p>
<p>Driver updates, <strong>if required,</strong> should be obtained from that hardware maker or PC maker in the case of large brand name, eg Dell / HP or Laptop.</p>
<p>If it aint broke dont fix it. Driver updates are only required 1) If they cure a known problem or 2) If they give greater functionality.</p>

<p>I have had the same problem.&nbsp; I reinstalled windows and turned off the automatic windows updates, and the pc is working fine.&nbsp; I have been working with Microsoft support and it seems like two of the updates aren't working properly with the home premium 64
 bit with nvidia.&nbsp; I have a call back tonight to try and see if we can disable the particular updates that are causing the problems.&nbsp; Hopefully the problem can be solved.</p>

            It should be noted that most driver updates in Windows Update are not included in the Automatic Updates.&nbsp; Automatic updates are usually security updates that are required for Windwos.<br />

            To Smlunatick: I should have specified which updates I was speaking about, I am referring to recent automatic security updates.&nbsp; I have been working with MS support and they determined that two of the security updates aren't working properly.&nbsp; Now, tonight
 i have another session and we are going to block the updates that are causing the problems on my computer.

            I am experiencing the same problem, but instead of a black screen I am getting pink snow. Initially it started when I was trying to run FFXIV, then it moved to every time I attempted to log in to Windows. I reformatted and reinstalled windows, and experienced
 the same issue. I can boot in safe mode and have since disabled the driver to allow windows to function, but naturally I cannot actually run any games on the system as it currently stands. If I understand correctly another reformat and disabling all of windows
 update features plus a fresh driver install (Even the latest version) should hopefully correct it? I am hoping there is more information on this, as well as why exactly it seemed to crop up at random. Very hopeful it isn't a hardware issue but from the sound
 of things it is just an Nvidia + MS issue. Here is hoping for a quick and permanent solution, I really don't want to have to get a new graphics card.

            I decided to do a clean install of windows 7, with the option to pick and choose my windows updates, and reinstall all of the drivers, bios updates, etc...&nbsp;Everything is working fine, as long as, I do not install certain updates: KB981957, KB 2345886,
 KB2160329, KB979559, and KB971033.&nbsp; For whatever reason, anytime i try to install these my computer never gets past the windows load screen.

<p>Andre - thanks.&nbsp; I've tried everything you've suggested and I think the MS technician did so too, without success.&nbsp; My build was upgraded over the weekend to 1803 but because I did an early reset to a clean version I can't roll back so I'm stuffed,&nbsp; I think.&nbsp;
 Earphones work so I'll have to make do with these until another upgrade or someone can tell me how to roll back a couple of Win 10 upgrades</p>

<h2>            Windows is not downloading updates from another PC even though Windows Update Delivery Optimization is turned on</h2>
                    I have recently updated my desktop PC from Win 7 to Win 10.I am having windows 10 laptop which has all latest updates.Now I connected my PC and laptop in a single network .i.e desktop with lan wire and laptop with wifi and also tried connecting my laptop
 and destop directly with a lan wire.My network is a metered connection.I have turned on Delevery optimisation in both of the PCs.But,my desktop is not getting anyupdates from my laptop instead all the updates are again getting downloaded from Microsoft.Can
 anyone guide me regarding downloading the updates from another PC inspite of turning on the Delivery Optimisation?

<p>I am having the same problem, and because of my data cost in a rural area, I take my laptop to another location to do my updates once a month. I bring my laptop home and connect my other 2 Windows 10 computers and do the updates on them. Even though Microsoft
 has made it almost impossible to properly monitor data usage, especially during updates, with the numbers available, including the data used on the internet from my ISP. I can tell that the "delivery optimization" is just not working. All updates are using
 my internet data, which is costly and amounts to a very large percentage of my total usage.</p>

<p>Kalpala, I just read the FAQs again, carefully. Does delivery optimization NOT work if I go to settings and click update. When I want to update I turn off metered connection on all computers, one of which has been updated recently,&nbsp;and start an update, is
 this the proper way to do this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform&nbsp;that to receive updates via Delivery Optimization, you have to check for updates similarly a how you check for updates through Windows Updates. The difference here is that it will not check for updates through the Windows Server but
 it will check for them&nbsp;from the local&nbsp;PC connections. In a scenario where the updates have been installed in any of the locally connected PC's it will download and install fetching information from them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;the PC that you are using to transferee updates is set as a Metered Connection, you will not be able to transfer or initiate the download of the files to other PC's. This is relevant only to PC's which are connected over the Internet.</p>

<p>When I am attempting this "delivery optimization" I have 3 Windows 10 computers all set the same, NOT metered connection and set to receive/send updates over the local network (which the 3 computers are a part of). I have read and tried all of the appropriate
 suggestions and have come to the end. It simply does not work as suggested or there is another setting (homegroup or sharing) that is, unknown to me,&nbsp;related somehow. I see that I am not the only one having this problem, and after spending a lot of time and
 energy to determine that this in fact is NOT working, Microsoft's insistence in going back to basic explanations is rather insulting. This started last year when&nbsp;I upgraded to windows 10, and has never worked, no matter how many times I adhere to the suggested
 settings and steps to make it happen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Vanessa sohtun</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you said that it will not actually download the updates from another computer,then what is the use of delivery optimization? It serves of no use to anyone around the globe.Not a single post anywhere I was able to see that one is getting benefited with
 delivery optimization since the option only exist to attract the users towards windows 10 like a big balloon filled with air! Having multiple Win 10 PCs at home,this windows 10 has increased my internet bill upto 3 times!</p>

<h2>            How to disable the capslock key on a Surface keyboard&#63;</h2>
                    I just got a Surface Go, and love it for the ultra-portability. Unfortunately they keyboard is slightly smaller than I'm used to and I keep accidentally hitting the caps lock key. How do I disable the caps lock key entirely on the Surface Go keyboard,
 without leaving S-mode to install custom keyboard software?

<p>Not disabling, but...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Settings, Ease of Access, Keyboard, and switch on "Use Toggle keys" (Play a sound whenever you press Caps Lock,).</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least this makes it immediately obvious when you have accidentally touched the Caps key.</p>
