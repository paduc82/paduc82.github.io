<h2>            Bluetooth notebook mouse 5000 and Windows 8 Pro</h2>
                    <p>My mouse will pair with my HP lap top but will immediately go offline.&nbsp; I have had it pair successfully a couple of times but it will still go offline&nbsp;after some time.&nbsp; Is there a way of turning it back online?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been trying to resolve this problem for hours, do I just admit defeat and get a different mouse?</p>

            I'm having the same problem with this mouse. Downloading drivers and software sounds like it would be a terrific fix....if there actually WERE drivers and software to download...which, there.is.not.
<br />
<br />
My computer recognizes the mouse...and apparently knows its full name. However, my computer obviously does not know it well enough to establish a peripheral relationship with it. Thus it sits, next to my laptop, sadly and perpetually "offline".<br />
<br />
According to the documentation that came with the mouse, after recognizing the new device, I was supposed to follow some "instructions". Unfortunately, my computer abruptly dismissed the mouse after initial recognition and I did not receive any additional installation
 "instructions".<br />
<br />
I've tried several times to "open the lines of communication" to no avail. I've even checked the download site several times between attempts to see if drivers/software had magically appeared.<br />
<br />
If anyone out there can help me figure this out, it would be greatly appreciated! I bought the bluetooth mouse because, quite frankly, I didn't want to violate my awesome new computer by sticking a dongle in it.

            First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>

<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />If you recently upgraded to Windows 10 1803:
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<h2>            Cannot find the &#34;rotate&#34; button in Adobe Reader Touch, Edge or any other viewer</h2>
                    <p>I cannot for the life of me figure out how to rotate downloaded PDF files in Adobe Reader Touch or Edge or any other viewer.&nbsp; The default setting opens the downloaded PDF in Edge (with the directory directed to my c drive -&gt; downloads).&nbsp; When I right click,
 the only option I see is "save".</p>
<p>In Adobe Reader Touch when I right click I see save.&nbsp; When I right click at the bottom of the document and the toolbar pops up I do not see a button for rotate, nor to I see a "more" button or a "..." button.</p>
<p>Please help as it is very frustrating to try to view documents scanned in as landscape that are downloaded as portrait documents.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!!</p>

            @fatou8, his problem was NOT with the display rotation but the incorrect orientation (portrait vs landscape) being used by the App. &nbsp;One possible fix is to "print" and save to pdf with a different printing orientation. &nbsp;On some systems, this may result
 in an 180 deg rotation instead of the original 0 deg. &nbsp;Use of print preview may help.

Did you ever solve this?  



To rant for a minute... WTF? I'm running Windows 10. I try to open a PDF. Windows 10 opens it in Internet Explorer. Huh? Ok. But there's no way to rotate the view.  


So then, apparently, Windows recommends I get Adobe Reader Touch. So clearly that's some BS Metro app they made for some dumbed down tablet-style UI because the iPad is eating their lunch. Fine. Whatever. I open the PDF in Adobe Reader Touch and... Same thing. No way to rotate the image on screen. Either it's not there or I can't figure out how to do it, either way, I can't use it.  



So here you have Microsoft taking something that worked reasonably well, reworking (****) the whole UI for the OS, and along the way screwing up how one particular function which worked for years- now unusable/unavailable.  



The OS itself is now full of apps BS apps and utilities. The control panel for networking? Now some simplistic app that doesn't have nearly the features. Sure, somewhere in my control panels is

            So here's how I solved the problem if it helps - just download the Adobe Acrobat Reader application directly from Adobe site for Windows 10. So much for UWP apps. Microsoft - this really was a frustrating experience. I consciously went to the windows store
 FIRST, looking for an app that could help me with this exact same issue. But looks like the store still has a LONG way to go...

            You'd have to just find a different application that does rotate: I had the same problem. I found, though, that the app Soda PDF 3D Reader does rotate PDFs. Which is super helpful. :) Hope this helps.

            Hi Trisha.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />We don't know what you've tried if you don't tell us.  
<br />
<br />Have you tried uninstalling the DVD drive Device Driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu?  Choose DVD drive, then Driver tab, then Uninstall.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />  If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />  If this is Fall Creators Update Version 1709, which you can check at Settings&gt;System&gt;About, you can also roll it back at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery, then hide it using the same tool above until it matures.  
<br />
<br />If it's too late to roll back but you're sure it was caused by Version 1709 because you remember this large upgrade install taking place before the problems began, then you can reinstall the last version with media available to download from here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />
<br />Then folllow these steps which compile the best possible install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, and has zero reported problems.:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />It's even possible that Clean installing with the latest media will resolve this:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Others have reported resolving problems caused by Fall Creators Update Version 1709 by running the Media over the present install as a Repair Install:  <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-repair-windows-10-using-in-place-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-repair-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks Greg,</p>
<p>&nbsp; One of the solutions you have asked me to try is doing a clean install, which I tried Sunday last, didnt work, I&nbsp; have tried the cmd prompt, deleting the Ide method, the Aptai method, any of the 6 options floating around on the&nbsp; internet&nbsp; I have tried,
 but with zilch happening. I need the CD-DVD driver as i need re-install my printer. which also stopped working, but managed to re-install the scan driver by using the windows 7 update,crazy I know.</p>
<p>Oh well back to the drawing board or back to windows 7.</p>
<p>Regards Trisha.</p>

            Trisha, did you try uninstalling the driver in Device Manager as I suggested?
<br />
<br />Here are steps that always work for the printer, don't require the CD drive:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall the printer software.    
<br />
<br /> 3) Next copy and paste in Start search box:  printui /s /t2     (Note that there is one space before each forward slash).
<br />
<br /> 4) Right click result to Run as Administrator.   
<br />
<br />5) Open the Print Server properties, Remove the printer’s drivers for this printer and for any other printers you don't use presently.  If you get a message about access denied or the printer being in use and you cannot find the driver or any installed program that would account for this, you may restart the computer in a diagnostic startup and then use the printui  command to remove the driver package(s): <a href="https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-diagnostic-startup-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-dia...</a>
<br />You must restart back to normal mode before you will be able to install the printer again.  
<br />
<br />6) Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the printer to delete the Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />7) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />8) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.       
        </p>

<br />Fix: DVD Drive Not Detected In Windows 8/10

<br />
<br />=====
<br />
<br />If needed let's test the CD/DVD drive to see if it works at all  :
<br />
<br />Try this to see if the drive is viable at all (you will need to make these on 
<br />another computer since your's will not start - XP, Vista, 7, 8/8.1, or 10
<br />or even running Linux does not matter). You could also try booting with another Windows disk - any OS version though do not use it to do ANY
<br />repairs unless it is absolutely the same version of Windows on your system - just boot to see if the drive works. You can even make a Windows 10 DVD boot disc by running the Windows Media Creation tool (on any computer) - Windows Media Creation Tool (make 32 or 64 both disk same as the OS version you are running.
<br /><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downloa...</a>  
<br />
<br />Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 so watch the screen as you boot - set the boot order to CD/DVD first. Remember to set it back when done.
<br />
<br />Or try booting to a Linux boot disk.
<br />
<br />If the drive will not boot to these then it has failed or there are other hardware issues affecting it. However even it does boot that does not mean there are not some possible hardware issues affect the drive's other functions.

<h2>            Surface Pen Ink &#34;Bleeding&#34; and Other Problems</h2>
                    Hi, so my pen has been "bleeding" ink for some time now, but its been happening very frequently now. It seems to happen randomly when I'm writing. When I lift my pen, the computer will continue to act as if I was still pressing down on the screen. It causes
 dots to forms, random straight lines, and&nbsp; very fine continuous marks. My battery in my pen is new, restarting the computer works for a few minutes before reoccuring, and it happens on different apps.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Another problem that has been happening is that sometimes the pen will randomly "disconnect" from my computer. It won't write, select, or anything on the screen. My finger works, but the pen acts as if it were dead. Usually, I can get it to work by messing
 with the battery (taking it out and putting it back in) for about 5-10 minutes.<br />
<br />
These problems are very inconvenient as a college student. I use my Surface Pro to take notes and do homework. These problems take up a lot of my time and have become extremely frustrating. Here are the specs on my computer. Any and all help is appreciated.
 Thank you.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note: My pen is third party, but it works fine on my friends computer, which is an Asus.&nbsp;<br />

</p><p>Is there a barrel button you could try to "wake it up"?&nbsp; In the case of an HP Active pen it seems you need to keep the barrel button always pressed or it may stop writing.&nbsp; It seems to be a measure meant to save the battery.&nbsp; (Otherwise, we have the hazardous
 procedure of having to tap on something with its tip to turn it back on.)&nbsp; Heh.&nbsp; The information I had understood may have been completely revised.&nbsp; In particular
<span>I have been unable to confirm this:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>My review of the HP Active Stylus (&nbsp;J4R51AA#ABL)!</p>
<p>The rocker button is a nuisance. Supposedly clicking on the top activates it for tapping and saves battery life. (Very unclear functionality.) The bottom button works as a right-click more conventionally.

<p>
</p><p>Exactly.&nbsp; It was an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">example</span>.&nbsp; And that particular pen disconnects "to save power" unhelpfully often.&nbsp; I think there is a switch inside its nib which requires a new tap to start it (where, without causing confusion?)
 or (as I mentioned) another On switch at the end of its rocker button which can be held down while writing to try to avoid that nuisance.&nbsp; Otherwise, since in this case the OP's "finger" writes (in an unspecified application) it sounds like a capacitive pen
 could be used which would not rely at all on batteries or technique to let it keep operating.&nbsp; We use one of those too.&nbsp; In fact we found one which provides a crossed-hairs<span> (AKA crosshair)</span> method of accuracy which in many applications
 works at least as well as the designed "electronic stylus" one without ever having to worry about how it is "powered".&nbsp; In that case the Pen would have no "hover" capability and so the (also mentioned) Pen Settings
<em>Show visual effects</em> option would have no relevance.</p>

<p>My friend used my pen for a day and also had the same problem with my pen disconnecting, but no streaks, dots, etc. I think this might be a result of my pen and not the computer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Damai,</p>
<p>What is your computer brand and model?</p>
<p>The first step I suggest is using System File Checker to make sure Windows isn't missing a file or using a corrupted file:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></p>
<p>Next, I suggest downloading the chipset drivers from your computer manufacturer and installing them.</p>

                    Re: The Big Sur puzzles labeled Northward and Southward coast views. On the West Coast, looking North, the ocean will be on the left (west) of the picture, and looking South the ocean will be on the right side. These pictures show the opposite. Must have
 been proofread by someone used to looking at Eastern coastal pictures.....

                    I upgraded my laptop to Vista Ultimate and now have an unknown device in device manager. A google search suggested I am missing a driver for "Amtel TPM" but my laptop does not have a crypto chip. Is this error something to do with ultimate supporting encrypted

<p><span><span>Hi phil_a,
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>BitLocker is Microsoft's response to a frequent customer request: address these very real threats of data theft or disclosure from lost, stolen or inappropriately decommissioned PC
 hardware with a tightly integrated solution in the Windows Operating System. </span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>BitLocker prevents a thief who boots another operating system or runs a software hacking tool from breaking Windows Vista file and system protections or performing offline viewing
 of the files stored on the protected drive.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>The feature ideally uses a Trusted Platform Module (TPM 1.2) to protect user data and to ensure that a PC running Windows Vista has not been tampered with while the system was offline.
 BitLocker provides both mobile and office enterprise information workers with enhanced data protection should their systems be lost or stolen and secure data deletion when it comes time to decommission those assets.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hence, if you are not using this feature you can ignore it or disable TPM.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Steps for Disabling the TPM:</span></strong><span>
</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Turn on or reboot your computer, during the startup screen, press
<strong><span>F2</span></strong> to go to the BIOS setup menu.
</span></span></li><li><span><span>On the BIOS menu, see, using the arrow keys go to
<strong><span>Security</span></strong> settings category, press the &lt;<strong><span>Enter</span></strong>&gt; key. Select
<strong><span>TPM Activation</span></strong> and on the right side of the menu select
<strong><span>Deactivate</span></strong>. Or select
<strong><span>TPM Security</span></strong>, and select
<strong><span>Off</span></strong>. </span>
</span></li><li><span><span>You have just disabled the TPM hardware on the BIOS, now you save the configuration, by press &lt;<strong><span>ESC</span></strong>&gt;
 key, choose to <strong><span>Save/Exit</span></strong>, see, then the computer will be restarted.
</span></span></li></ol>
<p><strong><em><span><span>NOTE: Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause
 serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><em><span>NOTE:</span></em></strong><em><span> You can
 also try to Install the driver from the manufacturer’s website.</span></em></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information was helpful.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let me know if this worked.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>All the best!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks and Regards,</span></span></p>

            Hello cw4usa,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try repairing boot records, using these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Start your Windows 10 machine, and quickly shut it down before it reaches or if it is at boot screen. Do this two times repeatedly.
<br />
<br />2. On the third time, Windows 10 will automatically display 'Your PC couldn't start properly' message. Now press Esc key for recovery options.
<br />
<br />3. Then under Choose an option screen, click Troubleshoot option and now click Advanced options option.
<br />
<br />4. Under Advanced options screen, click Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />5. Type following commands one-by-one and press Enter key after each:
<br />
<br />BOOTREC /SCANOS
<br />
<br />BOOTREC /FIXMBR
<br />
<br />BOOTREC /FIXBOOT
<br />
<br />BOOTREC /REBUILDBCD
<br />
<br />6. Close Command Prompt and see if you can boot now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            Sometimes Rebuilding BCD only works if you export it first.  Keep in mind it's not going to be on C drive so use Diskpart to determine or assign a drive letter to the System Reserved or EFI System partition to get to it.  Then export and rebuild.  
<br />
<br />If not then follow the steps I gave which include everything possible leading up to if necessary rescuiing your files and reinstalling Windows using my Clean Install tutorial, which has never had anyone come back with further issues who's followed it closely.

Double check that and the details of the case review you submitted for additional details.

    <title>Windows 7 - &#39;Failed to play Test Tone&#39; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zuisidle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 - &#39;Failed to play Test Tone&#39;</h2>
                    I’m running the 64-bit version of Windows 7 and on the 25th January my PC lost sound and on checking the ‘Test’ option on the playback device I got the ‘failed to play test tone’ error.&nbsp; Primarily I connect with optical SPDIF, but the same happens when
 connected using Jack or headphones.<br />
<br />
I’ve tried the following steps to fix the problem, all ultimately with no success.<br />
<br />
- Updated Xi-Fi drivers to newest Win-7 64-compliant drivers<br />
- Rolled back to shipped drivers<br />
- System Restore (failed to extract)<br />
- Ran audio troubleshooter<br />
- Changed the XI-Fi card to an Audigy 2 ZS card<br />
- Tried both the shipped and updated windows 7 compliant driver – no sound<br />
- Tried using the on Board card (ASUS M3N-HT) Sound Max card. <br />
- Shipped and updated windows 7 compliant driver; still no sound<br />
- Clean install of Windows<br />
- Success! For less than 2 days. Both Windows and Comodo Internet Security updated and required a&nbsp; reboot. Back to no sound again, with the ‘Failed to play test tone’ error.<br />
- Tried system restore – failed again.<br />
- Unistalled Comodo – no sound <br />
- Reinstalled Drivers for audio – no sound<br />
- Stopped/Started audio services – no sound<br />
- New motherboard (Gigabyte GA-MA790X) with a different chipset and Realtek on board sound, with another clean install of windows.<br />
- We have sound. Again for less than two days then another Windows update, reboot and no sound.<br />
- Use drivers from realtek site (more recent than those on Gigabyte site), still no sound.<br />
- Another failed attempt at a system restore (this must be an error in of itself!)<br />
- Disabled enhancements in the playback device/reboot. No sound<br />
- Stopped/Started audio services<br />
- System file checker ran with no errors (‘Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violation)<br />
<br />
The common denominator at this point appears to be a Windows update and it seems my only option is another clean install of Windows 7 turning off or limiting the updates. This is a less than ideal solution.<br />
<br />
In case it helps these are the kbs that were installed during the last session that had sound:<br />
KB915597 x 2 (defender definitions), KB974332, KB973525, KB978506, KB974571, KB978207, KB977074, KB890830, KB972270, KB975467, KB974431, KB976098, KB973923.<br />
<br />
To recap – 2 motherboards with different chipsets and different on board sound with multiple driver sets tested&nbsp; (shipped, website latest, sound device latest), 2 Sound Cards (Audigy 2 ZS and Xi-Fi&nbsp; Platinum, 2 different sets of drivers). All drives were windows
 7 compliant and 2 clean nstalls of Windows 7.<br />
<br />
I’m at a loss!

            Quick update - I found a restore point which took and there is sound again. I'll go through the updates tomorrow to see which one breaks it again!<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>This is really frustrating. Like many others, I have archives of video footage which I have saved in .mpg format. For years. I know MS knows why there is no video. It is because, as I understand, MS Media Player no longer supports the proper codec to play
 it. Yet we see all these other suggestions and head-scratching. Now, presumably we can go out into the vast wasteland of the internet and download some "free" codec from some unknown 3rd party, which no doubt with spyware the **** out of our system. I have
 just spent a considerable amount of money and time to rebuild a system from scratch with the express purpose of purging all that which I have accumulated over the last few years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is interesting that if you dig deep into the MS archive, you see that they offer a DVD pack to allow people who are upgrading their systems, the ability to play DVDs. But us sorry saps that chose, instead, to purchase the new, more expensive version of
 Windows 10 Professional, not only lose our Media Center, but now, are SOOL when we want to play DVDs or our archived video. This is completely unacceptable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop pandering to us and tell it like it is. It is not our systems that need repair. It is MS. Am I wrong?!</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to perform a system restore to the earlier point of this issue and check if the issue persists.
</span></p>
<p><span>When you perform a System Restore the time and date would be changed on your computer.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>System Restore:</span></strong><span> Though it is said that System Restore does not affect your personal information such as email, documents, photos, videos, etc., but there is highly possible that some of your personal files are deleted
 while system restoring. </span></p>
<p><span>During System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead
 to loss of important files as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I recommend you to refer to the Microsoft article to perform System Restore:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">Recovery options in Windows&nbsp;10</span></strong></a></p>

<h2>            Error when installing Netflix from Windows Store</h2>
                    I just bought a windows 8 lenovo laptop and am attempting to download the Netflix app from Windows Store. Below the install button it says, "You own this app and can install it on this PC", but when I attempt to install I receive error code 0x80073cf0
 and a message saying Your Purchase couldn't be completed. If I try to go to my active installs, Netflix is just sitting there with the same message. I have restarted the computer, reset the windows store, and added a payment method to my account just in case,
 nothing has helped. Please help, it's Sunday, I need to binge watch shows and order seamless:(

 from the store (Flixster, Fresh Paint for instance), but I can't install Netflix. I realize I can watch netflix via IE, but why can't I install this app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A call to Lenovo suggested I return the machine. I am slowly removing all the bloatware they add, but I don't see how only one app wouldn't work.</p>

            I never did hear back from Lenovo :(. Doing factory reset was off no help, same problem. I was able to get windows 8.1 media on a bootable USB key (if you do this ensure the USB key it is formatted FAT32 for UEFI systems to recognize it).&nbsp;There is good
 info here ==&gt;<span> </span>

 keys/activation, this part was very easy.&nbsp;I did clean install from the media on the USB key and&nbsp;when the machine was reinstalled, I was able to install netflix. Most drivers were automatically installed, I had to install a few manually. The Lenovo site is
 pretty good at telling you what to install to get your machine running with things like the touchpad. The best part, no superfish/bloatware/unsigned applications/trial software I never asked for. Good luck.

<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Your original symptom description sounded like an implementation issue but this example could make that less likely.&nbsp; Nevertheless I think it would still be a good idea to avoid using Windows Explorer and switch to the cmd window to try to reproduce your
 symptom there.&nbsp; Doing that should clarify the details of a particular example and give you better diagnostics as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, do whatever it is that you do to create the new folder but then in the Address bar enter:&nbsp; cmd.exe.
</p>
<p>There you would do a&nbsp; dir/ad&nbsp; to see your "folder"&nbsp; and&nbsp;a&nbsp; ren&nbsp; to rename it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that you would need to use&nbsp;quotes to enclose any name which contained space or special characters.&nbsp; So, while testing you could keep it simple by creating and renaming using
 only single-word names.&nbsp; Then you wouldn't need the quotes.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW I have just confirmed that I can rename a folder called&nbsp; New folder&nbsp; even while&nbsp; File Explorer has its parent directory open.&nbsp; A remaining test would be to see what happens if you had the New folder actually open somewhere when you were trying to rename
 it elsewhere.&nbsp; E.g. that condition might be sufficient to reproduce your symptom.&nbsp; TBD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I wouldn't do that until doing more diagnosis so you know for sure that reinstalling will solve your problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. we don't know anything about other programs that you have running but they could be what is causing this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few possible tacks that you could try:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>Use Resource Monitor to find out if any process has a Handle open with your&nbsp;problem folder name.&nbsp; E.g. Run... (press Win-R and enter:)&nbsp; resmon.exe&nbsp; Then use the Search Handles tool in the Associated Handles pane of the CPU tab.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Restart&nbsp; explorer.exe&nbsp; E.g. start Task Manager (press Ctrl+Shift+Esc) then right-click on Windows Explorer and choose Restart.&nbsp; (You need to be in the More details view to see Windows Explorer listed.)&nbsp; Doing that might shake things up with the Handles
 that explorer.exe has open.</li><li>Boot in safe mode and see if you can reproduce your symptom there.&nbsp; </li><li>You can use Resource Monitor in both cases to capture a list of the programs which are running.&nbsp; Sort by Image (to make comparison easier) then press Ctrl-a Ctrl-c and Paste into a New Notepad window.</li></ul>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Strange since the KB980408 is a Windows 7 Update not Windows 8.1 and it was actually connected<br />
with few instances of the issue. If your Windows 8.1 install had the same problem then there has<br />
to be a 3rd party program, drivers, or possible malware that caused the issue. Doubly so since a<br />
Refresh did not resolve, though a full Reset would likely have.<br />
<br />
Glad you found a solution.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

            <p>BUG: cannot have empty keys in: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\explorer\FolderDescriptions<br />
</p>
<p>Go into regedit and then into the directory:<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\explorer\FolderDescriptions<br />
<br />
Go through each subfolder named with a global unique identifier and ensure there are no empty ones. &nbsp;If so, delete the empty folder.<br />
</p>
<p>FYI, This is my attempt to describe it in as layman as possible. &nbsp;Troubleshooting this was much more complex. &nbsp;I found some obscure post on the internet where someone had a zipped export of FolderDescriptions. &nbsp;I tried that but it didn't work. &nbsp;Of course
 it didn't, merging in the correct ones from a while ago onto empty ones that were freshly created will not make the problem go away. &nbsp;So after much googling, fix-itting, etc, I exported then deleted the whole FolderDescriptions key, then imported in the internet
 dude's zip file. &nbsp;Problem went away. &nbsp;So &nbsp;with that I compared my export to the internet dudes version. &nbsp;After going through and doing a divide and conquer binary style troubleshoot, I was left with the list of empties as being the culprits. &nbsp;Next, I did a
 registry search and found the offending guids also present in Wow6432Node\...&lt;same directory structure&gt;...\FolderDescriptions but with named contents such as: Roaming Tiles, Microsoft\\Windows\\RoamingTiles, ThisPCDesktopFolder, HomeGroupCurrentUserFolder,
 Camera Roll, and Screenshots. &nbsp;This being a few days later, I decided to run the same Windows Update on my other computer. &nbsp;It didnt replicate the problem and when I went to the registry entries, I found content in my missing keys (00BCFC5A-ED94-4e48-96A1-3F6217F21990,
 754AC886-DF64-4CBA-86B5-F7FBF4FBCEF5, 9B74B6A3-0DFD-4f11-9E78-5F7800F2E772, AAA8D5A5-F1D6-4259-BAA8-78E7EF60835E, AB5FB87B-7CE2-4F83-915D-550846C9537B, b7bede81-df94-4682-a7d8-57a52620b86f), so I copied it over and imported it in and it still worked. &nbsp;Also,
 to quicken up troubleshooting, either use task manager to restart explorer.exe or even better have a taskkill command line setup for it. &nbsp;I am only asuming that root cause was that the update somehow got stuck and silently crashed internally while creating
 this key structure on my computer or maybe microsoft snuck a fix into the update.</p>

    <title>How do I disable automatic maintenance&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oakleaf ranger  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I disable automatic maintenance&#63;</h2>
                    I'm really getting sick of this automatic maintenance. i have it scheduled to start at 3:00 am; then it decides to start running if i don't click/type in any 5 minute period.<br />
<br />
if i watch a video or read something the automatic maintenance kicks in, slows down my computer, lowers the frame rate on what i'm watching, slows down the audio, and sometimes it will even freeze my computer. (when the computer is frozen i can't do anything,
 i can't open the action center to stop it, and i can't even get to the start menu; so, i end up turning off my computer manually)<br />
<br />
I'd really love an option to simply turn this annoying feature off.<br />

<p>It does NOT only run when computer is on idle!!!&nbsp; This is the problem with countless people on these sites saying that it has frozen their computer while working.&nbsp; I have just had this happen.&nbsp; I have changed my wifi from connect automatically because of
 these annoying updates that I discover only when trying to figure out why my previously working computer has quit functioning.&nbsp; So, today, I clicked to connect and started typing an email...about 5 minutes later, my computer froze, mouse quit working, etc.&nbsp;
 After an hour of not being able to use my computer, I turned it off using ctr alt del and found that the maintenance program had run (and finished) but still rendered my computer not usable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't want you to think that it only runs when PC idle as that is not the case.&nbsp; This is a problem that needs a fix....at a minimum it needs to be able to be set to prompt before running like windows update.&nbsp; I do also want to know what this program is doing!&nbsp;
 After all the recent revelations, I do not want auto programs running on my computer that I cannot control and that are hidden so that the only reason I discovered them was looking to find out why my computer had suddenly crashed.<br />

<br />
by the time i know that the maintenance is on, my computer is already frozen.<br />
<br />
i can say with 100% certainty that the maintenance is the problem.<br />
<br />
i run scans on my computer regularly, (i run windows defender, superantispyware, malware bytes, and occasionally i use eset's online scan) and my computer and scanners are up-to-date. so, i know there is no chance that this is a virus.<br />
<br />
my computer is perfectly fine (and i'm not saying that just because i run scans), then that kicks in and causes these problems.<br />
<br />
i don't know what you define as idle, but i am at and using my computer every time these problems occur.
<br />
<br />
... and even <b>IF</b> there was some kind of a small window of opportunity (and there isn't) that allows me to somehow access the action center in time to preempt it; what do you expect me to do? the maintenance doesn't give me any kind of warning, and the
 tray icon for it isn't exactly going to catch my attention.<br />
<br />
and why would the solution of me being able to disable and run the maintenance manually from now be an issue?<br />

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>I suggest you to place the computer in safe mode and check if it helps. Safe mode starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. If a problem

</blockquote>
<br />
step 3 is unavailable, there is no option to "stop maintenance" </blockquote>
<br />
<br />
90% of the time, if the automatic maintenance refuses stop after ending what it defines as inactivity (click/type something); then clicking stop maintenance does nothing.<br />
<br />
one of the main problems is, if by some chance it's just making things go slow for an extended period of time, i have no way of knowing that. automatic maintenance
<b>at</b> <b>least </b>needs a progress indicator of some kind.<br />

            I don't want maintenance to run at all. I have purchased superior software to do the maintenance myself. What if I am burning a blu-ray disk or working on a video project and maintenance starts? It must be disabled.

            <p>Agreed! Automatic maintenance runs almost nonstop on my laptop, even when I am actively using it. (It is running as I type this message.) My laptop slows down every time it starts, and even when I open up the Action Center and click on Stop Maintenance,
 maintenance DOES NOT STOP. It still says "Maintenance in progress" and my computer is still slow. I have to restart my machine to turn maintenance off, only to have it begin again a few minutes later (during machine use). Automatic maintenance also attempts
 to defragment my solid state drive on reboot, which I DON'T want it to do. I have tried disabling maintenance, but it reenables itself upon restart. I have tried resetting my machine to manufacturer defaults, reformatting, booting in safe mode, etc, and the
 machine always runs beautifully until automatic maintenance kicks on. I no longer care whether maintenance is "helping" my machine because the trade-off is losing good machine performance. Honestly, I would rather have to reformat my laptop every month than
 deal with automatic maintenance every hour of every day. For the love of all that is technologically holy, please let us turn off automatic maintenance until this problem is resolved.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t upgrade my Windows 10 &#40;build 10240&#41;  to Windows 10 &#40;Build 10586&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am continuously trying to upgrade the build of Windows 10 from 10240 to 10586 from Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is getting failed all the time. Now reading all solutions from Microsoft Community I have downloaded the iso file from
</p>
<p>Microsoft TechBench. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to update my windows but it says that I have to remove everything and make a clean install.</p>
<p>Please tell what should I do now.. ?? It's totally messy for Microsoft.. </p>
<p>You all can see that upgrading radio buttons are all deactivated. It's just problematic. Only the last one is there for go.</p>

            <p>Hi Ruth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all three ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Tried updating using Windows Update.. Continuously failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Downloaded the latest iso image from Techbench. Started upgrading but The upgrade radio buttons are not active. Only the clean install was active as per screen shot I gave.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Tried using Microsoft Media creation tool . Happend the same thing as the iso image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now trying your solution . Lets see if anything good happens or not ..</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi! Sayantan</p>
<p>I thought the latest release build is 1511. You could get that easily with the upgrade now button at:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Big download if you have meter connection. </p>
