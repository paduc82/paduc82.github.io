            <p>Follow the steps which are shared on below web link:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Windows-Update-error-80246008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Windows-Update-error-80246008</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a look-see in the Windows Update history and compare any failed (if you have any) updates with the successfull one's to see if you're missing any updates.<br />
<br />
Try cleaning out the Windows Updates Temporary directory: Windows/SoftwareDistribution.<br />
<br />
Best way to do that is in Safe Mode. Either F8 before Windows begins to bootup or RUN&gt;msconfig, Boot tab, down below check the SAFEBOOT or Safe boot check-box and then restart.<br />
<br />
In Safe mode, go to the Windows/SoftwareDistribution directory tree on the left pane. There are 4 folders containing stuff that could be emptied out:<br />
<br />
* DataStore folder: delete the DataStore.edb file.<br />
<br />
* Logs folder(in the DataStore folder) - delete all the files in there.<br />
<br />
* Download - delete everything in there...everything (you really don't need to be in Safe Mode to empty this folder out).<br />
<br />
*EventCache - everything in there can be deleted too.<br />
<br />
That's all the clean-up you need to do. Go back to RUN&gt;msconfig, Boot tab and uncheck the Safe Boot check-box, then restart.<br />
<br />
When you're back in Windows go ahead an manually run Windows Updates. Don't be alarmed about not having any Windows Update history anymore. Any successful Windows Updates will still be there and if you are missing any Windows Updates will detect them any get
 them ready for you to install.<br />
<br />
With the exception of the Download folder, don't bother trying to empty out the other folders while you're still in Regular Mode Windows. It won't work. Some will get deleted but the important one's will not because they're being used by the Windows Updates
 (not that critical) and/or Application Information (VERY CRITICAL - if you try to stop this service while in Regular Mode Windows it will totally mess up your OS) Services.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 power button missing from login screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> soren81  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 power button missing from login screen</h2>
                    Two weeks ago Windows decided not to load properly. I got to the desktop but the toolbar didn't load and everything stopped at that point, no inputs of any kind possible and a very annoying way to find out that F8 doean't work anymore! Anyway, thanks to
 a BT forum, I found out about holding shift on the power button and being able to do various resets/reinstall etc from there. So, skip to last night and the same thing has happened, except that now I don't have the power button on my login screen anymore!
 So now what? Other people have been told how to reset this from inside windows but I cant get in!

<h2>            DNS server isn&#39;t responding</h2>
                    <p>I recently moved and acquired new internet connection however the wifi on my laptop does not work.</p>
<p>-it is not a problem with the ISP as my phone uses wifi just fine</p>
<p>-I already tried ipconfig (however the registerdns function didnt go through as 'elevation is required')</p>
<p>-I already did safemode with networking- it is not a problem with the firewall/antivirus</p>
<p>-it is not browser related, I trie two different browsers and its the same result</p>
<p>-I manually inputted dns servers for IPv4 as well- does not work</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened my network connections and noticed that my LAN 2 in active and says 'cable unplugged' and I have a Wireless Area connection that works just fine.... I even individually diagnosed each one. The LAN 2 one say 'ethernet cable in unplugged' and the
 wireless connection one said no problems came up. I never had to use an ethernet cable to access the internet so I disabled LAB 2 but it still did not work and I still get DNS server isn't responding.</p>

<p>Hi Cesar Maders,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several possibilities that may be causing the issue when using your keyboard. May we know what's the make and model of your keyboard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, lets try to run the <strong>Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</strong> and see if the issue will persist. Follow these steps on how to run the troubleshooter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter by clicking the <strong>Start</strong>&nbsp; button, and then clicking
<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>In the search box, enter <strong>troubleshooter</strong>, then select <strong>
Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Under Hardware and Sound, select <strong>Configure a device</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>Update us on the result.</p>

<h2>            How to view web site folder structure in Windows Explorer</h2>
                    In <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows XP</span> Explorer it was possible to use the http protocol to view the folder/file structure of a web site on my internal&nbsp;network.&nbsp; I could then just drag and drop graphics files into the Images folder,
 for example, and have them available to use in the web site.<br />
<br />
I can still do that when saving a file from within Word 2007, for example.<br />
<br />
But in Windows 7 Explorer I can't do this any more as any reference to http:\\servername is interpreted as a web page request and changes to Internet Explorer.<br />
<br />
Is it still possible?

<p>It will be better if you send some screenshots. <br />
But what I have understood that you are trying to use https protocol in Windows Explorer and it opens IE. That is very common. You can try using \\ and the network location after that.<br />

    <title>I do NOT like Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trishafrench  say:</h3>
<h2>            I do NOT like Windows 10</h2>
                    Windows 10, as of right now is worse than windows 8. My DVD's will no longer play, I can not watch movies online, I also can not watch Netflix. Since the download, my computer is extremely slow. Windows Edge is a joke. It never loads, I can open up chrome
 and have my page loaded before Edge even opens the home page, which I have never seen. I would like to uninstall it from my computer could someone please tell me how.

            I had the same problem. &nbsp;Go to settings and &nbsp;follow the instructions for rolling back. &nbsp;You can also follow the instructions from you tube for rolling back to your previous version of windows but it has to be done within 4 weeks of the upgrade. &nbsp; I had
 the upgrade last night and I did not like it because of several reasons. &nbsp; The free games disappeared and my microsoft &nbsp;office 2007 was still installed but I was unable to access it. &nbsp; The windows 10 is worst than windows 8. &nbsp; I love windows 7

<h2>            Replacing Windows Preview Pane default Notepad to Notepad&#43;&#43;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I will try to explain what I would like to do based on the picture I attached above. As you can see from the picture, When I click once on the folder called testdocument.txt, the preview pane shows me the content of the file with NOTEPAD.EXE application.
 I want to change this so that the preview of the file can be shown with Notepad++ application instead of default Notepad. Is it possible? If possible, how?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to hearing from you..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,<br />

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 freezes completely (have to be hard rebooted) on certain website with HTML5 videos (not all, youtube for example fine)</p>
<p>For example when I open animated GIF section on https://web.whatsapp.com/, or on thegymgroup.com website (have a film embeded on main page)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I access thegymgroup.com the PC instantly freezes, same when I click GIF option on whattsapp web page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other websites with HTML5 works fine, but there are few I can't remember axcept stated above which also completely freeze the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Flash is disabled on my machine.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 language , using english and german, continues to fail installing german speech recognition, but keeps trying</h2>
                    <p>hello</p>
<p>I am wondering if anyone had this situation</p>
<p>using windows 10, latest build, etc</p>
<p>main language is US englisch, in addition I added the german language pack, works fine so far.</p>
<p>but windows fails and retries to install the german speech recognition, it repeats that many times every day</p>
<p>it's more a nuisance ‚Ä¶&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am ok without the german speech recognition, is there a way to stop this?</p>
<p>I have not found any detail settings that I could use, to turn this specific update off, in general I want the system to continue to update</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank yoo</p>

<p>Hi Matthias,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to get clarity on this issue and assist you with appropriate troubleshooting steps, please reply with the answers to the questions below.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Are you able to use the German language pack?</li><li>Do you get any error message when the Speech Recognition fails?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, try the below methods and check if this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Remove and Re-Add German Language Pack.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">First, try removing the German Language Pack completely from your computer, restart the computer once, and then add the language pack again and check if this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Metered Connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Check if you have enabled <strong>Metered Connection</strong> (because Windows 10 will not download language packs over a metered connection) by going to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Network and Internet</strong> &gt; Click on <strong>
Advanced options</strong> &gt; Then, under Metered connection, toggle <strong>Set as metered connection</strong> to
<strong>Off</strong>. Restart the computer once and check for the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong>: Windows Update Service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, this issue might also occur if <strong>Windows Update service</strong> is disabled or stopped, so follow the below steps to check if the Windows Update service is running fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Step 1</strong>: Press the <strong>Windows</strong> and the
<strong>R</strong> keys from your keyboard and type <strong>services.msc</strong> and hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 2</strong>: Now, locate <strong>Windows Update</strong> service &gt; <strong>
Right-click</strong> on Windows Update service &gt; Properties &gt; Set the <strong>Startup</strong> type to
<strong>Automatic</strong> &gt; <strong>Start</strong> the service &gt; <strong>Apply</strong> &gt;
<strong>OK</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 3</strong>: Restart the computer once and check for the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give it a shot and let us know of any changes.</p>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the below suggested methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p>To identify if the issue is caused by security software, I would suggest you to try disabling windows firewall and check if you are able to turn the setting on.</p>
<p>To turn it off, go to the search box and type <strong>windows </strong><strong>firewall</strong>. Then select
<strong>Windows Firewall &gt; Turn Windows Firewall on or off</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Disclaimer: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.&nbsp;
</span></strong></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 2</strong></span></p>
<p>Additionally, I would suggest you to deploy the Microsoft Accounts troubleshooter, to see if the issue is due to settings off-synced. It's an automated tool that can find and automatically fix some problems.<br />

<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>If the above recommendations does not help, check if the issue persists in a new user account.</p>

            <p>Thanks for getting back to me.&nbsp; I had already tried the Microsoft Accounts Troubleshooter without success.&nbsp; On your advice I turned the Firewall off.&nbsp; I also tried and disabled my AV.&nbsp; Both made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your final recommendation of creating a new user got me thinking.&nbsp; This is what I did;</p>
<ul>
<li>Settings - Accounts - Your email and accounts</li><li>In the right panel I went to Accounts used by other apps and clicked on <strong>
remove</strong> for the two accounts I have listed
<ul>
<li>my outlook account</li><li>my work/school account</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li>
<p>I restarted my Win 10 laptop then went back to the same Settings location and clicked on Add a Microsoft account and proceeded to add my two accounts again</p>
</li><li>
<p>I restarted again (not sure if I needed to do this)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Now in Settings - Accounts - Sync your settings - Right panel Sync settings is now available and can be turned on</p>
</li><li>
<p>Now in Edge - Settings - Sync your content - is now available and can be turned on</p>
</li></ul>

    <title>XB1 Controller driver for Windows 8 problem with Mad Catz Killer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            XB1 Controller driver for Windows 8 problem with Mad Catz Killer Instinct FightStick TE2 trigger buttons RT &#47; LT</h2>
                    
<p>Microsoft I love you guys but please fix or correct the XB1 controller driver (<em>xb1usb.11059.0.140526)</em> for windows 8 so that my 2
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Xbox One&nbsp;Mad Catz Killer Instinct FightStick TE2's</span> can work under windows 8.</p>
<p><strong>The problem is that the Trigger buttons RT and LT completely don't work and the bumper buttons RB and LB are reversed. The Joystick, A, B, X, and Y buttons work great.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm assuming this should be an easy fix, the game pad works great but getting the triggers fixed / added to the Killer Instinct FightSitcks would be great and another xbox one control device working perfectly under windows 8.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Link to the current drivers:&nbsp;<em>xb1usb.11059.0.140526</em></p>

<p><strong>Can a Microsoft official please respond on this issue.</strong>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Slow speeds on Xbox One compared to Laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Slow speeds on Xbox One compared to Laptop</h2>
                    
<p>Yes I have searched&nbsp;</p>
<p>and yes I know what a MBps vs a Mbps is...</p>

<p>Now that we have that out of the way:</p>
<p>I am on Time Warner CBB. My package is the 300Mbps/20Mbps - All my computers will get close to the rated speeds when doing various speedtests to Seattle, Dallas, California etc. My laptop via wireless gets over 90Mbps/20Mbps.</p>
<p>My xbox barely tests anywhere above 27-30Mbps. Games download( I watch the network monitor under settings) barely at 50Mbps. Lately my online gameplay has been excruciating to say the least, Destiny, Neverwinter, Halo, whatever.</p>
<p>ALL these tests have been run using my laptop and the SAME Ethernet cable. I just swap from Xbox to laptop, run tests, go back to Xbox, run tests.</p>
<p>So NO it is NOT the cable, length of cable, modem/router, ports, NAT, Firewall, Gremlins or Yard Gnomes...</p>
<p>Resets, Hard resets, power off for 20min NO Changes...</p>
<p>Quite frankly I am *** off at this investment...</p>
<p>While typing this out I ran a few more tests, best test was:</p>
<p>Download - 48.72 Mbps</p>
<p>Upload - 17.33 Mbps</p>
<p>Packet loss - 0%</p>
<p>MTU - 1480</p>
<p>Latency - 80ms</p>

<p>Have the same problem since a couple of days. In the morning everything was fine, in the evening problem was suddenly there.</p>
<p>My latency is around 165ms. When I do a speedtest through IE on the Xbox latency is around 15ms.</p>
<p>Tried everything, static IP, port forwarding...nothing works. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So if anyone has a fix...</p>

<p>i have the same issue of my DPS being low only on the xbox one. sometimes even to the point of it being 0.01 mb/s, but then i laugh when i see my upload speed is higher than that. i've heard lots of the same problems on these forums about low DPS speeds
 it has to be something in the xbox one networking that is *** everything, i've heard people say that instant on mode is broken but i've had the same problems even in energy saving. my most valuable fix has just been to reset the mac address, but even then
 sometimes is still doesn't get to the speeds that it should. leave it to MS to sell broken systems</p>

<p>As strange at this sounds, it could still possibly be the cable.</p>
<p>If your cable has degraded, it could result in a poor connection that give you different results with different devices. Have you tried a different cable?</p>

<p>I am having the exact same problem. My laptop, 2 iPads, and 2 cell phones are all running bandwidth speed tests at 18Mps (which is what I pay for). However, my Xbox One, speed tests consistently at 3Mbps. I used the Xbox network settings and an HTML5 speed
 test using the Internet Explorer browser and they both come up the same for the Xbox speed. This is all on the same wifi, on the same router, and in the same room. I have tried changing various settings and tips, from DNS/Mac clearing and changing the channels
 on my router.</p>
<p>What's interesting is that when I reset my router the Xbox Bandwidth Usage starts out tracking it at 17 to 18 and then slowly over roughly 30 seconds dwindles down to 3 where it stays.</p>
<p>Any ideas/suggestions?</p>

<p>Hey Buikwortel,</p>
<p>The ping difference between a PC vs Xbox will be that, on Xbox, the tests ping to servers in Seattle, whereas, on a PC speed-test, they will ping to the server nearest to you.</p>
<p>165ms ping on an Xbox One console is about right, I average around 120-165ms myself, and experience no issues in multiplayer games.</p>

<p>To help keep things streamlined, can each of you please run a speed-test on your PC from
<a href="http://www.speedtest.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.speedtest.net</a> and post it here, then also copy the 'Detailed Network Statistics' from your Xbox One to here, too.</p>

<p>Having the same issue as everyone else in this thread. My detailed network stats via the X1 settings menu have been solid from the beginning. Recently my upload speed has plummeted when doing the test. I should be getting approximately 120 Down/20 Up. I'm
 getting 100 Down/2 Up. The 2 upload is killing my ability to utilize multiplayer and use twitch to stream.</p>
<p>I can use three different ethernet cables and get the same results. Same time of day as the recent X1 speed test. I can use three different cables and get the same results. I can reset the modem/router, power cycle it, update the firmware, all the bells
 and whistles that go along with troubleshooting this, and I get the same results.</p>
<p>Here is my speed test from the PC.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/gRXcVxq.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/gRXcVxq.png</a></p>
<p>Here is my speed test from the X1 from February. I just happen to have a picture because I was sending it to a friend. You can see these numbers are almost identical to my PC numbers.</p>

<p>Hey Ch1ps N Queso,</p>
<p>Thanks for the speed tests there.</p>
<p>I see a 1% packet loss on the second Xbox speed test, this may well be the cause of the issues.</p>
<p>May I ask which router make/model you use and who your ISP is?</p>

    <title>Faulty Controller - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kalebwillems  say:</h3>
<h2>            Faulty Controller</h2>
                    <p>So Ive had my Xbox for Christmas, the controller has a few wear and tear marks of course, little scuffs from being dropped or knocked off the couch, but nothing major.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an aftermarket headset, and was using it fine for months, until recently it just gave out, at first I thought it was the headset, but have since come to realise it is the audio jack coming loose? Should EB Games replace my controller? I don't want
 to open it up incase it voids the warranty.</p>

            <p>Hi, Sorry to hear of the issue with the controller. EB games will not replace a controller as it is past the time were the retailer will replace it. The controller is also past it's 90 day warranty, so your only options are to purchase a new one, or send it to Microsoft for repair, which you will have to pay for due to controller going past it's warranty.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p><p><br /></p><p>It won't be covered by warranty.&nbsp; Retailers and Microsoft only give 90 day warranty on controllers.&nbsp; The reason being that unlike the console which typically stays in one place and isn't moved, controllers can - if a user doesn't take extra care - take a huge amount of punishment, like being dropped from great heights, throw up against a wall in rage (believe me, this happens a lot with some people), or just general heavy handedness.</p><p><br /></p><p>Therefore they are only covered for three months.&nbsp; How does the retailer or Microsoft for that matter know how good or&nbsp; bad you maintain your controllers?</p><p><br /></p><p>My advice is to buy a new one.&nbsp; And if your handy with fixing electronics, try a DIY repair yourself, there are loads of videos about this on YouTube.</p>

Hi<br />
<br />
When you say "live update" are you talking about Windows Update?<br />
<br />
If so, you might want to go to the ATI website and download the latest driver for that graphics card. Here are the download links for the latest, Windows 7, &nbsp;9.9 version 32-bit and 64-bit drivers for the Mobility Radeon 3000 series.<br />
<br />

<br />
Hope this helps<br />
<br />
<span>Thank You for using Windows 7
