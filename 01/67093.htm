<h2>            Right click in File-explorer Windows 10 collapses.</h2>
                    When I`m in file explorer and right click on any type of file, trying to hit "Properties", file explorer disappears and I`m back to the previous window I used before opening file explorer. Trying to hit the "Properties" button on top of the "Home" screen,
 works like a charm.<br />
Any idea what this might be?<br />
<br />
I have checked for updates, and run the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span><strong>sfc /scannow.&nbsp;</strong>The sfc scan found no issues.

<h3> albertbaldry919  say:</h3>
<h2>            IN house stealing</h2>
                    
<p>Hi I like having to yell at people because they try and steal from me. Hey I am extreme rich pensioner who doesn't care about the fact you try to steal money from my account for no reason at all. Then mind you have no way of reporting this infrigement so
 that I must have to give up and say oh well that is terrible. DUDES don't steal from poor people, are you crazy, I am the guy that will pay and play live for ever if you don't screw me around. Your kinect sux which you ain't going to fix for the 360 model.
 Your Xbox ONE is literally as waste of space and parts because you failed to understand the simple things. DUDE why would anyone want to buy a 12g or a 4g when they can get a 250g and play the good games. Do you people actually think about anything there</p>
<p>Below are two letters you sent me, you sent me a prepurchaed live account gold membership when I brought my New Xbox Kinect device that I need to have a card so I can calibrate it so that I can literly only use two feet of space in my room. Are you kidding
 me, I have to be back so far from the television that most houses don't even have that much room in the house to play this device but I found the oom in my bedroom to do so and I have to get rid of everything there is in there and buy a tv cabinet but hey,
 my choice to have something to play a game that it is need for.</p>
<p>So I have to buy an new Xbox 360, wait for the Xbox one to be fixed of all its flaws, I don't get to play my 360 games on the Xbox one. The same for playstation 4 So any games I am playing now are pointless, your not going to allow us to renew them for Xbox
 4 however you allow games like Defiant to exist that is long term game. Any Xbox 360 games brought out for Christmas are usless for those upgrading. So after I have to do all this amazing good stuff, you try and take a payment for something that doesn't exist,
 my account is up to date like you said to do, update early and save delays. my 3 month membership I got was used and we moved on the accepting letter is there.</p>
<p>The real kick in the pants is that you sent me another email, lucky I closed down all my paypal withdrawals because you tried to take my membership again. Telling me that the process failed the first time and to fix it. NOT MY FAULT YOUR AUTO RENEWAL IS
 BROKEN. Yes I am pissed off, if the process went through perfectly I wouldn't have known it was down and for no reason. You have literally annoyed me to the point where I can't trust you will me information or access to anything. So no more auto renewal, no
 access and sub subscriptios until you are able to use them properly. Poor people can't have you stealing their money for no reason and have no way to get it back.</p>

<h3> dnamojo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One and Xbox 360 Games issues</h2>
                    
<p>I was told with this forum to have someone to send me a Preview Member request.&nbsp; I wanted the Xbox One console but found out that my Xbox 360 games that I invested in, Money, time spent and the game I really like would not work on Xbox One.&nbsp; That's why did
 not jump on the Hype bandwagon for Xbox One.&nbsp;My Wife bought me a Xbox One Console (for Early Fathers Day Gift) I was told that there ware an Xbox 360 Emulator Program to have on the Xbox One Console so I can play my games.&nbsp; Found out that I still can not play
 my Xbox 360 Game yet on my new Xbox One System.&nbsp; Again could someone that is a Preview member send me an invite so I can be a Preview Member and I can test out the Xbox 360 Emulator?</p>

<p>Just need to wait a little longer. as i don't know when there doing it.</p>

<p>There is a small list of mostly crappy games you can currently play on the Xbox One if you are part of the preview program. It's not like you can take any old game you want and boot it up. Eventually the list will grow, but it's up to developers/publishers
 to decide if they want their game to be backwards compatible. And with the remaster bandwagon many developers are jumping on, I can see it not happening for many games.</p>

<p>Just to reiterate what the person above me said, you are currently not able to play just any Xbox360 game on Xbox One as a Preview Member. Here is the full list of the games that are working as of now:</p>
<p>A Kingdom for Keflings</p>
<p>A World of Keflings</p>
<p>Alien Hominid HD</p>
<p>Banjo-Kazooie</p>
<p>Banjo-Tooie</p>

<p>Hexic HD</p>
<p>Jetpac Refuelled</p>
<p>Kameo</p>
<p>Mass Effect</p>
<p>N+</p>
<p>Perfect Dark</p>
<p>Perfect Dark Zero</p>
<p>Super Meat Boy</p>
<p>Toy Soldiers</p>
<p>Toy Soldiers: Cold War</p>
<p>Viva Piñata</p>
<p>Viva Piñata: TIP</p>
<p>Zuma</p>
<p>More games will be added progressively and the backwards compatibility update will launch for every user sometime in the fall. More information can be found here:

    <title>Linksys AE1200 Network Adapter Not Windows 10 Compatible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave clearfield  say:</h3>
<h2>            Linksys AE1200 Network Adapter Not Windows 10 Compatible</h2>
                    <p>When Microsoft pops up a message saying your computer is Windows 10 Ready, they need to do a much better job of analyzing whether it really is Windows 10 Ready.&nbsp; It's not sufficient to look at processor speed, RAM, and compatible applications.&nbsp; They also
 need to consider how you currently access the internet, and whether you'll still be able to do that after you upgrade.&nbsp; Even though my PC accesses my home Wi-Fi through a Linksys AE1200 Network Adapter, Microsoft said I was ready to upgrade.&nbsp; Not quite!&nbsp; Upgrading
 to Windows 10 left me with no network access - since I found out later there was no Windows 10 driver for my Linksys adapter.&nbsp; And when you call the Microsoft Call Center you're put through a long process of scripted questions - with reps that sound like they
 speak English as a second language.&nbsp; None of this is quality.&nbsp; Not the initial notification that I was Windows 10 Ready, nor the lack of proper analysis before saying I was Windows 10 ready, and certainly not the Call Center - with a call that went on for
 over 2 hours and resolved nothing.&nbsp; I have now reverted to Windows 7 and will probably never go near Windows 10 again.&nbsp; (My next computer purchase will probably be an Apple.)&nbsp; This was horrible.</p>

            <p>You are correct. &nbsp;The AE1200 does not have an update since Windows 7. &nbsp;I was disappointed with that too. &nbsp;I bought a Panda Wireless usb adapter and it is 100% compatible. &nbsp;$10 on Amazon. &nbsp; Like most manufacturers, Linksys doesn't continue to write updates
 for a model that has been superseded for some time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The compatibility report obviously does not take into into account all the peripherals. &nbsp;If Windows itself will run properly I guiss you get a pass.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you used the Windows Feedback app on your All Apps menu to report this? &nbsp;Not that I think Microsoft can do anything about it, but they do pass incompatibility data back to the developers. &nbsp;I dropped a note to Linksys. &nbsp;They have live chat and twitter
 links at&nbsp;</p>

            Andre, I didn't have a reason to look for another driver before the upgrade.&nbsp; Windows was saying my PC and my applications were compatible.&nbsp; So, why worry?&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Problem was, after the upgrade you couldn't access the internet!&nbsp; And the staff at
 the Call Center didn't seem to understand what was required - much less have any way to get me a new driver.&nbsp; They persisted in saying right click on the Windows icon in the bottom left of the screen, look for Network Adapters, click there and look for solutions.&nbsp;
 Problem was -- Windows 10 only produced solutions involving dial up or an ethernet cable.&nbsp; And neither was right, since I wanted to connect by Wi-Fi, the same as before.&nbsp; Now, Windows 10 did list my Linksys Network Adapter below Network Adapters - under Other
 Adapters -- but when you clicked there, it said there were no drivers available for Linksys with Windows 10.&nbsp; So, back to your idea -- going on the internet (if I was able) wou

            Yes, this is the only PC in the house - which makes it tough to download drivers after you upgrade to 10...&nbsp; So again, this clearly needed to be diagnosed before the upgrade.

            It is a myth that the AE1200 is not compatible with Windows 10. The reason there is no driver update is because the Windows 7 driver for the AE1200 works with all later versions of Windows, including Windows 10. What is causing the problems here is that
 when you upgrade to Windows 10, or a major Windows 10 update is pushed onto your computer, the AE1200 driver temporarily stops working. The fix is to simply uninstall it in Windows Device Manager and then reinstall it. This is a bug in Windows 10 installation
 that can be fairly blamed on Microsoft, but its Windows 10 Ready utility is not itself making an error. The AE1200 and its Windows 7 driver are compatible with Windows 10.<br />

            <p>Rick, thanks for your post. Just had the same issue when the Windows 10 upgrades ignored my scheduling to do the work on Saturday the 26th and decided to do the Win7 reinstall and Win 10 install almost immediately ( 1 hour after this attempt to schedule
 it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Arrrrrrgh!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, no more network as the Ethernet connection on my Dell XPS tower is dormant and the fix two years ago was a Linksys AE1200 on Win7 Pro. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To to make the story short...your comment above saved the day! &nbsp;Yes, once I deinstalled the win7 driver ( mine was under "Other" in the Win10 Device Manager) I reinstalled the same one using the Linksys Setup CD that I kept, and it works! &nbsp;thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mike</p>

            Wish I had known this.&nbsp; I upgraded to Windows 10 early--maybe last August or September.&nbsp; Then found that I had no internet connection because my Linksys AE1200 would not work.&nbsp; So I restored back to Windows 7.&nbsp; But my old "My Documents" had moved to "Windows-old"
 with the upgrade.&nbsp; When I restored, I lost all of Windows-old, and many of my old "My Documents," including some irreplaceable photos and documents!&nbsp; Caution:&nbsp; if you restore from Windows 10, rename "Windows-old" before you do.<br />

<h2>            Windows 8 Keeps freezing while in internet browser</h2>
                    <p>It started happening in the internet browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google Chrome would be opened and as soon as there was a second tab the entire computer would freeze up and then if you waited a while windows would do a shut down because there was problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cleaned up the registry and ran my cc cleaner. no effect&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8 is up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ran a memory check, no issues there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it might have been the browser so I tried uninstalling and reinstalling chrome. I also tried what this webpage suggests&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.quora.com/My-Google-Chrome-keeps-crashing-keeps-freezing-so-much-How-I-do-fix-it</p>
<p>
</p><p>but still no changes. google chrome keeps freezing the computer with a new tab open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using a different web browser such as firefox. still freezes.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<br />amd_sata.sys - AMD Sata Controller Driver
<br />Date: 29-Mar-2015
<br />
<br />Recommendations
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />2. ATI Video Driver - Your ATI video driver is of Oct-18 which is quite recent. Locate this in Device Manager and roll back. If there is a driver on your computer manufacturer's website which dates post 19-Oct-18, then you can update this driver as well.
<br />3. AMD Sata Controller Driver - Try to update your Chipset and BIOS from computer manufacturer's website

<h2>            Ghastly unsuccessful WIN10 Upgrade experiences</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying to upgrade my desktop PC over the past few days, UNSUCCESSFULLY, and a chat session with a Microsoft Tech left me with the advice that my motherboard is NOT Windows 10 compatible. This I find a bit hard to believe, my PC was only built in
 June 2013 and has an ASRock B75M R2.0 motherboard. I've upgraded it's BIOS to the latest 1.60 release. My most recent upgrade attempts were done with all USB devices disconnected, wireless networking adaptor disabled, lan cable unplugged, antimalware &amp; antivirus
 software disabled, and the upgrade was performed from a DVD created from the Build 10565 (Nov Update) .ISO obtained via the MediaCreationTool. &nbsp;STILL it failed and I'm pretty P%$#@ed off as this means I will miss out on my free legitimate Win10 upgrade.</p>

            I don't really think this is an option when one has about 220 installed items of software. The objective is to avoid a complete rebuild of a virgin install at all costs !

Mate, I've done so many clean rebuilds to desktops and laptops over the years I could just about do it in my sleep. It's a (dog poop) job but I have prepped myself to do this in the end. What I am unsure about is if my hardware is compatible, so if I go this
 route and a clean Win10 install fails, I guess a clean reinstall of Win7 won't go amiss !

            <p>So during the reinstall after making sure all Updates are installed with no more available when you Check for Updates, report back the drivers still missing in Device Manager so we can help you find them.&nbsp; I have never not been able to find one.&nbsp; Normally
 Windows 8.1 drivers will work fine, even 8 or 7 if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is similar to hundreds of models of Windows 8 PC's which offered no driver support for Windows 7, but there wasn't a single driver we were not able to find.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a matter of fact I can't remember a driver were ever not able to find.&nbsp; So Driver Support is almost a non-issue.</p>

<h2>            Booting from cd&#47;dvd stuck problem</h2>
                    I have a problem:I want to format my hard drive and at the same time rewrite windows.So,I took my Windows 7 disc,booted the pc with cd/dvd and got through all the "retrieving information" (or files,don't remember exactly) screens,then the windows start-up
 screen showed-up and when it loaded,I know,that it should have shown me the Windows 7 option screen,but it didn't-it just stuck on the screen,that looks like windows 7 welcome screen,just without the text and with lower resolution.I was able to move the mouse,but
 nothing more.The only option then was to restart my pc manually (when restarted and booted from hd it works fine as before).So,my question is how to fix this problem to be able to reinstall windows 7 clean.<br />
<br />
P.S.When I start the windows 7 cd through My Computer,the setup screen shows and everything's just fine:I can rewrite windows that way,but I can't format my hard drive.<br />

            <p>If you have backed up any personal data files you may have AND located all your application installation media (CD/DVD) then formatting the drive will not prevent you from installing Windows unless either the drive or Wndows 7 DVD installation media is defective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does partition wizard show more than two partitions? The first should be a small (100MB) System, Reserved partition and the second would be your existing Windows partition. If there is a third partition this could be a recovery partition that the computer
 manufacture provided.</p>

                    I installed Windows 7 (64bit).&nbsp; Now I can not use my printer/scanner/fax Sharp AM-900.&nbsp; Sharp's reply was -
<p><span>"Thank you for your email. Unfortunately, Sharp will not be developing any additional driver software for the AM-900. The unit is supported with up to Windows XP only, and there is no software driver support for Windows Vista
 or Windows 7. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause."</span></p>
<p><span>Does anyone have another solution other than Sharp's intended solution of "go buy a new printer"</span></p>
