<h2>            GTA 4 not working on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I tried installing Grand Theft Auto 4 on windows 8.1, it installed without any problems, and I upgraded it to patch 1.0.4.0, and when I am clicking the icon, only the CD icon appears as the pointer (this shows the game is going to start), but nothing happens
 afterwards. Please help meeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

            Hello
<div><br />
<div>There is a fix for this issue going around, try this:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>DOwnload&nbsp;https://support.securom.com/analysis.php and use it to see if the game protection software is causing issues.&nbsp;</li><li>Download games for windows:<br />
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=201134</li><li>Then go to the installation folder of the game</li><li>Right click GFWL.exe</li><li>Choose Run as Administrator</li></ol>
<div>Does the game now boot?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If not, then disable all virus and other protection software and try again. SECUROM might be blocked by these software.&nbsp;</div>

            Thank you so much. You see, my friend told me to install GFWL (Games For Windows Live) and it worked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But patch 1.0.4.0 is not working on it. Do I have to install patch 1.0.7.0 or is there a solution for this also. By the way, thank you sincerely.<br />

            Hello. I may have the solution to your problem. Firstly, when that Rockstar Games Social Club Terms And Coditions window opens, it is displaying all the terms and conditions, right? The 'I Agree' button can't be clicked on. You can go to the right side
 of the Terms And Conditions window, there you'll see a bar to scroll down the window, click and hold on that bar, scroll down all the way till the end of the terms and conditions, then the 'I Agree' button will automatically illuminate, which means that you
 can click on it, and it'll ask you for your login (it is your choice, you want to log on by putting your username and password or leave it by clicking on 'skip login', then the window will show up on which you'll have to click on 'PLAY' and your game will
 start. I hope your problem will be solved.<br />

            The SecuROM picks out 2 GTA 4 files, then immediately crashes. I've been trying to troubleshoot GTA 4 for 5 hours now, fixing something, just to have another thing break. Not buying GTA 5 when it's released for PC, based on this experience. (Bought GTA
 4 thru Steam, have Asus ROG, Windows 8.1 Intel i7 @2.5Ghz, and Nvidia GeForce GTX 860M.)&nbsp;

            GTA 4 is no-longer supported, honestly. &nbsp;GTA 5 has no problems, so far. &nbsp;It's a-lot easier to install it, I highly recommend getting it.

<h2>            Clean Install Windows 10 and port programs</h2>
                    <p>I've just upgraded to Windows 10. All is well. However, there are remnants on the drive I want to clean up. I know wiping the drive (not with a rag) and doing a 'clean install' will resolve that but, here's my dilemma;&nbsp;Some of the programs, apps to you youngsters,
 I no-longer have all the assets to reinstall. My question is: Can I image the &nbsp;'Program Files', 'Program Files (x86)', 'ProgramData' directories and export the 'Registry' then restore them to the 'clean install'? Or, is there a better a way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know, that will destroy the OEM partition and I'll &nbsp;no longer be able to restore to Out-of-Box status but I don't plan on going back in time besides, I have a 'disk image' for that. There are extra recovery partitions as well as the OEM partition I want
 to get rid of. Not to mention Windows 10 seems to preform better after a 'clean install'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any assistance you can provide.</p>

<p><em><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Not even close</span></strong></em>. Did you read anything beyond the title? I have 5 computer, all have been UPGRADED to Windows 10 within a week of release. I also have backup images for ever one before
 and after the upgrade. So, I'm familiar with the upgrading procedure. However, my son has an older Lenovo B570 which I UPGRADED to Windows 10 and as the 2nd sentence states "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>All is well</strong>"</span>.
 &nbsp;I could give it back to him now with Windows 10 with his old software installed. If he was just 'some guy' I'd do just that. However, it's my sons computer and I'd like to go beyond "good enough".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the links to pages I read before I did my first upgrade. I guess there's points for a "reply" weather it is pertinent or not. Next time READ the questions. You know the one's with question marks after them. Otherwise you're wasting not only my
 time but all those with the same questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, there no need to reply to this post unless you need brownie points. In that case, send a link to some pretty girls instead.</p>

<h2>            Failed to connect to a Windows Service due to WLM in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Original Title: Windows 10</strong></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased a new Asus desktop computer with Windows 10 pre installed.</p>
<p>After a week I was getting a box with the message Failed to connect to a Windows Service. Windows could not connect to the Group Policy Client Service. This problem prevents standard users from signing in.</p>
<p>I tried all the regular scans which did not fix it.</p>
<p>After getting nowhere with Ausu and PC World. I stared to uninstall the software one by one. I eventually found that Windows Live Mail was causing the problem. Once I uninstalled it the error box did not return.</p>
<p>I have a laptop with Windows 10 on which I can run Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>Why is it causing a problem on my desktop ?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience caused due to Windows Live Mail and I will be happy to answer&nbsp;your query.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you notice any issues with Windows service in safe mode?</li></ul>
<p>You may want to re-install the Windows&nbsp;Live Mail fresh and check if it works fine. If not, you can try the following&nbsp;methods and check if the issue remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>Start the computer in Safe Mode and check if the issue persists. If the issue does not persist in safe mode, place the computer in clean boot state and check.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 1: </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Start the computer in Safe Mode
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
<strong>Safe Mode </strong>appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you're using.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a.</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> When you hit the power button, hold down the
<strong><em>Shift</em></strong> key when clicking the <strong><em>Restart</em></strong> button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b.</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> The next screen will present you with three options. Click
<strong><em>Troubleshoot</em></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c.</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Next, hit
<strong><em>Advanced</em></strong> options followed by <strong><em>Windows</em></strong>

<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">d.</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 2:&nbsp; </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Place the computer in clean boot state to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <p>Hello mrsingh2,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it was Autodesk Alias Automotive 64 bit, then we should uninstall it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check with the manufacturer to see if there is an update that solves this issue or if they have a newer version that does not exhibit&nbsp;this behavior at all.</p>

<p>That directory does exist, but I don't see a "pictures" folder at all. &nbsp;The "music" and "documents" folders in that directory are empty.</p>
<p>I did the upgrade online.</p>
<p>I backed everything up about a month ago, but there's a lot of recent stuff that was only saved to this computer.</p>

            That indicates that the folders/files were under Windows.OLD someplace - since that is where the rollback pulls from...

    <title>Can&#39;t change file association for .jpg to open with Photoshop ... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kooolerking  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t change file association for .jpg to open with Photoshop ... how to change&#63;</h2>
                    I am familiar with setting the file associations, but have situation where XP is acting dumb.<br />
<br />
I have stand-alone copies of Photoshop CS2 and CS4 installed, both are activated and fully functional and can open .jpg from within each of their menus. Before I added PS CS4, CS2 was my default "open with" program for jpegs.<br />
<br />
However, now with CS4 installed, the Windows "right-click open-with" list shows several options to open a .jpg file, including PS CS4, but not PS CS2.<br />
<br />
Using the file association "browse" button allows me to find the PS CS2 program and select it, but it will not actually add it to the list, ignoring the selection, ignoring my attempt to set the preference to open with CS2.<br />
<br />
I assume Windows XP is getting confused with 2 rev levels of Photoshop installed, but it should be able to tell them apart ... is there a registry edit to work around this and force it find CS2? Thanks in advance for any ideas.<br />

 CS2 executable.&nbsp; Make sure that you leave the rest of the information in that box intact, as well as anything that may be filled in or checked elsewhere in the window.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
For example, the TXT extension has the following "Application used to perform action" for the "open" action:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\WINDOWS\system32\NOTEPAD.EXE %1<br />
If I wanted to use <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.5.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Notepad++</a> for text files instead of Microsoft's built-in notepad, I would change the "Application used to perform action" to the following:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Program Files\Notepad++\Notepad++.exe %1<br />
making sure to leave the space after "exe" and the %1 as in the original line<br />
</li><li>OK your way out.<br />

            Thanks for step-by-step, but that's essentially what I was trying to do; "Folder Options"&nbsp; won't allow me to edit the file association except from the short list it has already created ... that's the problem.<br />
<br />
When I get to the "Registered File Types" list, some extensions will display the "Advanced" button, but for others, the button changes to "Restore", which simply resets it to a generic icon, which in-turn will allow the "Advanced" button to re-appear. In clicking
 the "Advanced" button, the window that appears contains no "Actions".<br />
<br />
However, if I click "Change", it will give me a short list of programs from which to choose, including PS CS4, but not PS CS2. If I then go to the "Browse" button, I can locate and select PS CS2, clicking "open" returns me to the previous list which shows PS
 CS4 as the selected program, PS CS2 is nowhere to be found.<br />
<br />
If I then go back to the "Registered File Types" list, .jpg is shown as being associated with PS CS4, but there is no "Advanced" button, only "Restore", "Change", or "New". Following any of those alternate button paths simply repeats the same outcome described
 above ... no way to reach the "Actions" list to perform the path editing that you've described.<br />
<br />
There is at least one odd extension (.jpj) where both PS CS2 and CS4 show-up under the "Recommended Programs" list ... this should be the case for .jpg as well, but it is not. Unfortunately, when looking at the .jpj extension, the "Advanced" button does not
 display, only "Restore". If only it was possible to edit the "Recommended Programs" list from another approach, that would resolve the issue.<br />
<br />
Based on what is happening, perhaps there needs to be something changed in the registry via a 3rd party utility or direct editing (if I knew where to look). This seem like a lot of bother for a simple Windows Explorer change ... it should be easier than this
 ... I hope Windows 7 is better than XP for this sort of mild but obvious interface customization.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any ideas.

            I researched this further, and found that if I go into the registry;<br />
<br />
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/Applications<br />
<br />
Within that registry, duplicate the key and subkeys already there for Photoshop, giving the new key a unique name and changing the entries for the commands associated with "open" and "edit" subkeys to point to the CS2 application instead of "CS4". Now both
 versions of Photoshop have registry key in this folder ... this seems to work in that it at least forces CS2 to now show up under the "other" programs list after a "right-click open with" so that the file association can be mapped via the "Folder Options"
 method.<br />
<br />
Now, when I double-click a .jpg file, it opens with PS CS2. PS CS4 still shows up under the "open with" list of "recommended" programs, but CS2 shows only on the "other" programs list. How do I move it from the "other" list to the "recommended" list so as to
 have that option in the future?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
PS: Now I know why I've preferred using a Macintosh for the previous 20+ years ... whew, what a pain!<br />

            You're correct that the "Change" button behaves essentially the same way as the "Open with &gt; Choose default program &gt; Browse" method, which is why I suggested you use the "Advanced" button instead.&nbsp; I forgot, however, that once there has been a change
 from the default handler, the button changes from "Advanced" to "Restore."<br />
<br />
Here's how to do it:<br />
<br />
Go to the JPG file extension and click the "Restore" button (assuming that it's now configured to open with Photoshop CS4).<br />
<br />
The File Types window should now show that JPG files open with the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer and the Advanced button should now be available (if you have Microsoft Office installed, the default might be the Office Picture Manager instead, but I'll ignore
 that for the sake of this discussion):<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ef04c1f2-0440-4513-a241-8f2d2a85d460" /><br />
<br />
When you click the Advanced button now, you should get the following (I realize that you said that you didn't see any actions; if that's still the case, what does the above screen say for you after "Opens with"?):<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6743fe28-cebf-4102-88ce-1e05f842399e" /><br />
<br />
Clicking the Edit button (for the "open" action) should get the following:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f8a8b3cb-4bfe-4b41-a158-2681bc5dfb75" /><br />
<br />
What you need to do at this point is to completely change the contents of the "Application used to perform action" box.&nbsp; Click the Browse button and go to the CS2 directory under C:\Program Files and find the CS2 exe file.&nbsp; Select it and click "Open".&nbsp; I've
 done it with IrfanView as an example:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2ca5b858-6849-493b-960c-210117b9a39f" /><br />
<br />
After you click the "Open" button, the path to the CS2 executable, surrounded by quotes, should appear in the box:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a68d6d39-5620-4067-89f6-3540422be7a1" /><br />
Click in the box after the quote at the end of the executable, type a space and then %1
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f6d61aa7-6b37-4bd6-b8d3-7ef116826207" /><br />
<br />
Click the OK button in the "Editing action ..." window.&nbsp; Click the OK button in the "Edit File type" window.&nbsp; You should now be back at Folder Options window with the "Opens with" changed:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ef4a016d-a905-4545-a5b3-2b51adc7f14f" /><br />
<br />
Interestingly enough, doing it this way doesn't give a "Restore" button and the "Advanced" button remains.&nbsp; It must be that the "Restore" button only appears when you make the change using the "Change" button or the "Open with &gt; select default program" method.<br />
<br />
Now, what to do if there are no actions when you first click the "Advanced" button?&nbsp; Just click the "New" button in the "Edit File Type" window, type "open" (without quotes) in the "action" box in the "New Action" window, complete the "Application to be used
 ..." box as before, and OK your way out.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03892324-3e78-4a40-8aa1-2efb607a74ae" /><br />
<br />
I believe that you don't have to worry about the "DDE" check box and associated entries.&nbsp; At least when I changed to use IrfanView as in the examples above, I left everything just as shown in the pictures ... and double-clicking on a jpg file opened it in IrfanView,
 just as expected.<br />

<br />
Thank you for the detailed reply; what you are showing is what I had hoped to find, but unfortunately, after restoring the default application, which ends up being either the "Windows Picture &amp; Fax Viewer" or the "MS Office Picture Manager" (it seems to change
 for no particular reason?), there are no actions showing to be able to edit, so then it becomes a dead end to simply edit an existing action, excepting to create new actions in that same window.<br />
<br />
Based on my previous post, I have been able to set PS CS2 to be the default program to open JPG files, but it still does not show on the "Open With" right-click menu, except via opening a 2nd window sub-menu "Other Programs"<br />
<br />
I suppose the install of latest Photoshop upgrade could have messed up these file association preferences, but it would seem Windows should have a preferences menu to reset these without having to resort to editing the registry or mapping programs, locations,
 and actions. E.g., a user created list of "Recommended Programs" to be on the short list after a right-click for each file type.<br />
<br />
Is there a 3rd party software program to take the pain out of setting Windows XP look &amp; feel for preferences and actions? I plan to upgrade to Windows 7 in a couple of months, so maybe this is all a moot point now? Thanks again.<br />

            I was not able to get the "File Type" method to give the hoped for results; However, I did get the results I wanted via regedit to reassign one of the long-uninstalled picture editing programs that still showed up under "open with" and reassigned the PS
 CS2 application to it. It's a bit of a hack, but it works fine. Thanks again for all your help!<br />

            YW.&nbsp; Glad you got things working, even if in a round-about manner.<br />
<br />
Windows 7 will have a whole new set of things to deal with, although on the whole, I think it's a very good successor to XP.<br />
<br />
If you haven't done so already, run the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor</a> to see potential pitfalls for your planned upgrade.&nbsp; Even if you plan to get a new computer, the Upgrade Advisor should give you an idea (it isn't infallible or comprehensive) if any of your programs may have problems.<br />

I would suggest you to try the following steps to repair these files:

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>&nbsp;a)<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>Open command prompt by pressing Windows key + X and selecting “Command Prompt (Admin)”.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>&nbsp;b)<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>In command prompt, type the following commands and press Enter after each command.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>&nbsp;c)<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>Close the command prompt after this step.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now, restart the computer and check. Please post back your results for further assistance.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
</p><p>This&nbsp; is a very peculiar issue that I face hear, I suddenly stopped recieving&nbsp; win updates on Win 10 since Nov-24/17. So I thought some files could have been corupted and also it was while before I formatted&nbsp; my PC, so I formatted and reinstalled my Win
 10 O/S now I face this error message<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> </span>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Sad part is that I did contacted microsoft support they adviced to the clean install again and also they performed some tasks and confirmed that the CD key and the O/S was geniune and the issue was not resolved, even
 they recieved the same error.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>SO I turn to the community to get some help have this issue resolved. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

            <p>Hey there! So I think I know what you are having an issue with. Open the App, click on the 3 lines (menu) on the left. Go down to consoles and under the refresh icon there should be a console with a + symbol, tap on this. That should allow you to then connect to the console. It sounds like you are selecting to set up console and instead you need to select to connect to Xbox/Console. Also be sure you have your console settings set to allow the connection by going to the Xbox and then going to Settings&gt;Preferences&gt;Xbox App connectivity https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/apps/smartglass-console-setup</p><p><br /></p><p>Also be sure that your console is turned on and connected to the same Network. Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>If you have functional Wireless card in your laptop and see other Wireless Networks but No<strong>optimumwifi.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Call them it might be that the signal is Not available at your location.</strong></p>
<p>Win 7 instructions should be similar to Vista.</p>
<p><strong>If your Laptop is not set for Wireless connection this might help.</strong></p>
<p>Most Laptops have a physical switch for the Wireless card. Read the computer's manual and make sure that the Wireless card is On.</p>
<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wireless card entry.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a></p>
<p>If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wireless card's Drivers.</p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Wireless Network Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Make sure that if there is a vendor's Wireless Utility the utility is Not Running together with the Windows native Wireless utility.</strong></p>
<p>Make sure that No Firewall is preventing/blocking the Wireless components to get to the Network.</p>
<p>If everything above is OK and it is not connecting to the Wireless router. Log from any computer that is, or can be connected to Wireless Router with a Wire, disable the Wireless Security, make sure that the Wireless broadcast is On, and try to connect with
 No Wireless security.</p>
<p><strong>When working turn On the Wireless security.</strong></p>
<p>Note* People sometimes make mistakes in writing and retyping the security passphrase.</p>
<p>Alternative way is to copy it from the Router's menu, and then paste when asked by the Wireless card.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>I really checked and configured every thing and it does Not work.</strong></p>
<p>Software Firewall application that is Not configured to allow local traffic (between the computer and the Router is a possible issue too.<br />
some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic. If the 3rd party software is
 uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is <strong>On </strong>

<h2>            Keyboard stops working - steelseries merc stealth keyboard</h2>
                    
<p>I am on win7 64bit and I installed an optional driver from Windows Update...</p>
<p>SteelSeries - Input - SteelSeries HID Device<br />
Installation date: ‎9/‎12/‎2010 10:16 PM<br />
Installation status: Successful<br />
Update type: Recommended.</p>
<p>SteelSeries Input software update released in September, 2010.</p>
<p>After I installed driver the extra keys for gaming stop working the ZEngine system tray icon would show red (which indicates it cannot find the keyboard).</p>
<p>The driver I am using (ZEngine_x64_25029_NA.exe) is the latest one from the SteelSeries website.</p>
<p>I get no errors from my system. One minute my keyboard works with all the extra keys enabled and the ZEngine is using the profile I selected, and without warning it stops.</p>
<p>The ONLY way it will work correctly again is if I restart my PC then uninstall the ZEngine and drivers, and reinstall them with the installation file for a while.</p>
<p>Everything worked great until the SteelSeries update but there is no way to REMOVE the update like there is with most of the other updates that get offered.</p>
<p>As posted in other similar questions for problems with the SteelSeries I looked in the registry under<strong> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{36FC9E60-C465-11CF-8056-444553540000}</strong></p>
<p>for the “UpperFilters” or “LowerFilters” and there are none.</p>
<p>Legacy support for USB is turned on in BIOS but I have tried it both on and off with the same result.</p>
<p>I have also tried using the keyboard on a laptop running Windows 7 64bit and all works great but the update was not applied due to it only being a test.</p>

<p>Hi Monstrlama,</p>
<p>You might change the settings for Windows Update to only install Important updates automatically.</p>
<p>As this is a Recommended Update, that should prevent it from being reinstalled.</p>
<p>You would do this after reinstalling the ZEngine drivers, after the restart.</p>
<p>There should also be the option to hide the update before it installs, which would prevent intsallation as well.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, post back and we'll see what we can figure out.</p>

<h2>            Gespeelde spellen en behaalde achievements niet zichtbaar op xbox.com&#47;NL, we op xbox.com&#47;US</h2>
                    
<p>Hallo,</p>

<p>Hebben sommigen van jullie ook last&nbsp; van dat xbox.com/NL je gespeelde spellen niet weergeeft in de lijst met achievements?</p>
<p>Zover ik maar kan raden wat het probleem hiervan is, denk ik dat het gaat om 'nooit toegevoegde games' in de NL regio, want zodra ik mijn regio wijzig naar de US, worden deze "onzichtbare games" met achievements wel getoond&nbsp; op xbox.com/US.</p>
<p>Kan Microsoft hier nog wat aan doen door de ontbrekende games alsnog toe te voegen aan de verzamel lijst van games die er beschikbaar zijn?</p>
<p>In mijn geval bijv gaat het om de spellen Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, Wolfenstein The New Order en nog een aantal andere titels die niet worden weergegeven in mijn lijst van gespeelde games.</p>

<p>Verder kan ik alleen maar hopen dat Microsoft en Xbox dit probleempje (ook wel een leuke glitch in het systeem te noemen) kunnen verhelpen en dat alles weer op normale wijze en zoals het hoort word weergegeven hier op de Nederlandse pagina.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Even though it is a new router is probably shipped with early stage production firmware.<br />
Check with NetGear Support, their on-line documentation and downloads, and ask in their<br />
forums about any known issues.<br />
<br />
NetGear<br />
<a href="http://www.netgear.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://www.netgear.com/</font></a><br />

<a href="http://forum1.netgear.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://forum1.netgear.com/</font></a><br />

Also check for updated Wifi/Wireless and the other drivers for the laptop.<br />

<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
</strong><br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible<br />
solution?&nbsp;And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are <br />
you positioned from the router? Are there obstructions in the way?<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - click Update Driver (may not do<br />
anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi<br />
Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows&nbsp;7 (updating drivers manually <br />
using the methods&nbsp;below is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System <br />
maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated <br />
drivers as Windows 7&nbsp;loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />
I would also disable auto-updates for drivers. If Windows Updates suggests <br />
one just HIDE it as they are almost alway old and you can look for drivers<br />
manually as needed.<br />

            Can the desktop see the wireless network at all? How much signal strength is the desktop getting? How high off the floor in the basement is the router sitting? Have you tried repositioning the router (moving it around, or even placing it on its side)&nbsp;to
 see if the desktop can then connect? Sometimes, when a device is getting a "low" signal, it can prohibit the device from connecting because while the device and router are negotiating a connection, there is some signal loss during that period, and when the
 signal drops below a certain threshold, it just can't connect at all.

    <title>Enable VT on Surface 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> song fangcheng  say:</h3>
<h2>            Enable VT on Surface 3</h2>
                    <p>Many people find Atom Z8700 on Surface 3 supports VT-x, but on Windows 8.1 and 10, VT is disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use CPU-Z and SecurAble to detect Atom Z8700, and both say it DOES support VT-x, so Hyper-V can run on Surface 3, I think.</p>
<p>Many Android simulators need VT set enable for better performance. Some Surface 3 get VT enabled after installing some simulators like DuOS, but I still want Microsoft enable VT by update firmware. BTW, some Surface 3 get VT disabled after re-enable VT by
 installing simulator in few days.</p>
<p>There are also some people who bought Surface 3 very early find at first VT is enabled, but after some Windows update, all VT on Surface 3 is disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I ask Microsoft to reconsider enable VT on Surface 3. It's very useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A screen shot for CPU-Z and SecurAble my Surface 3:</p>
