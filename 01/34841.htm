<h2>            Nyko zoom for kinect, any good&#63;</h2>
                    Thinking of getting the Nyko Zoom for Kinect add on due to the small space in the living room, seen mixed reviews and wondering if anyone here has experience with it?

<p>I bought one of these from play.com for around £18. Still a lot of money for a bit of plastic, but yeah, it does work pretty well. The only draw back I found, is a hanging overhead light tends to reflect off the surface of the lenses, due to their shape,
 which can cause problems that do not occur without the zoom lens connected. I have two ceiling lights, so I just turn the offending one off, but may not be possible for everyone. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm holding out on buying one, our room is ok with the current layout for single player but we have slight trouble with multiplayer on games like Raving Rabbids (can't hit the back row fully on "Whack a Rabbid" and the like). &nbsp;I'll wait until / if it becomes

            I bought one of these a few months back, seems to do the job quite nicely. However I did notice that it reduces e amount of light the kinect sensor gets (not a problem for me as my living room looks like it was designed by the guys who did the Blackpool
 lighting). Space reduction wise I can pretty much stand at arms length from my 50" plasma screen and play (although that's the bare minimum) and play single player kinect, but previously I was a far back as I could go and was still getting "standing too close"
 message. If I can find a non permanent marker pen I'll draw out the minimum (before &amp; after) marks on the floor and post a pic for you to see the difference.

<p>I too, am after one of these. But, after all the mixed reviews, I'm still not sure. £20+ for this is too much of a risk. If only there was a way to try before you buy.</p>

                    When I log onto Skype all I get is my Account page with my photo on it and a bunch of advertising to try to get me to add credit and make calls to cell phones.&nbsp; For the life of me, I can't find where to go to the Home Page to just begin making Skype calls.&nbsp;
 What am I missing?&nbsp; . I am using Skype on a windows desktop with Windows 7.&nbsp; Thanks.

            Hi Joe.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues with Windows Updates one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows 10 laptop keeps on shutting down and restarting after recent Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>greetings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the recent MS windows update, my LT keeps unexpectedly shutting down and restarting. I have checked this site for possible solutions but nothing has proved effective in stopping this annoying phenomenon.&nbsp; It has only started happening since the update.
 MS help also proved ineffective and took nearly an hour. No heat issues, MS disabled fast set up. Use google which does clash a little with Ms edge, which I do not use and McAfee AV. All three vie for search engine supremacy, but there were no problems at
 all before the update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be extremely grateful to anyone who has solved this problem and can advise me accordingly.</p>
<p>

    <title>Skype to Phone Caller ID not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marcforeman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype to Phone Caller ID not working</h2>
                    <p>Skype version : Skype for Windows 10 (version 8.34.0.78).</p>
<p>Anyone else getting this? I'm based in the UK, which is a supported area for Caller ID. Caller ID is set up correctly in my Skype account online, and I've also verified my mobile phone number by going through the code-SMS process, and punching in the code
 the SMS sends me into my Skype account dashboard online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when dialling other phones (including my mobile) from my Skype-to-phone number pad, the caller ID is not displayed. Instead, I see "unknown" on the incoming call list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very damaging for me, as I contact many of my clients by skype-to-phone, and they need to know it's me in many cases before they'll even pick up for fear of nuisance calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone managed to fix this? Is there a Microsoft Moderator on this panel who can comment?</p>

<h2>            Laptop only intermittently connecting to internet, good wifi signal, android phones and apple products working with no problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm after some help as I'm a bit flummoxed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone abroad for a couple of months and took my laptop with me. It's fairly old, runs windows 7 and AVG free. I had zero problems with connecting to the internet/wifi at home and in various public places (coffee shops etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On arrival here I've been able to connect to the wifi/internet on my samsung phone with no problem. The connection speed is pretty slow but that's just because of where I am and I can live with it. However, my laptop will connect to the internet for intervals
 ranging from 10 minutes to several hours and then just stop. The wifi connection is fine and when I try to run network diagnostics it says that my modem is experiencing connectivity issues. The phone is still working at this point, as well as the various apple
 phones/devices that my housemates are using. Initially it was returning error messages about not being able to connect to the DNS server and I spent ages trying to sort that out, but these messages have now stopped. It still won't ping the DNS when it's not
 connecting but I presume that's because of a general rather than DNS-specific issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried which have made no difference:</p>
<p>Power cycling my laptop and modem</p>
<p>Turning off windows firewall and AVG</p>
<p>Starting in safe mode with networking (still won't connect when it's in its phase of not connecting)</p>
<p>Updating my network adapter driver (I haven't tried un-installing it but I have no way to re-install anything)</p>
<p>Turning off all additional network connections including microsoft wifi miniport</p>
<p>System restore to before I left home</p>
<p>Turning off IPv6</p>
<p>Changing the power settings on my network adapter so it doesn’t get switched off</p>
<p>Flushing DNS</p>
<p>Specifying DNS address (I have currently just stayed with automatic assigning)</p>
<p>Resetting TCP/IP in command prompt (this does sometimes seem to work but not every time - sometimes I get an error message after ipconfig/renew - and the problem eventually recurs)</p>
<p>Scanning for viruses (I found a trojan on the first scan, deleting this has made no difference)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think this can be a hardware issue, though I may be wrong. My laptop is four years old and fairly rubbish, but surely this would be a persistent problem rather than just intermittent and it's a bit of an odd coincidence. Additionally, another person
 has just arrived whose laptop runs windows 8 and they are having EXACTLY the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I wondered is if the connections are effectively just timing out because the connection is slow (speed test: 128ms ping, download speed 0.52Mbps). Part of this is because it seems to stay connected longer early in the mornings (when there's
 less traffic) and it seems to work a lot less well in the afternoons/evenings. But again I'm not sure why this is only affecting the windows devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes when I change settings the internet connection works for a bit but it's really not consistent (in fact if I do nothing and leave my laptop sitting there for an hour it'll usually connect spontaneously) so I'm struggling to identify the underlying
 problem. The only thing I've not done is logged into the router itself but as this does not belong to me and it's currently working for the three other people here I'm not particularly inclined to mess with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be much appreciated!</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We're sorry to know that the issue still persist after all the steps that you have tried. I appreciate you for giving us the detailed information. I
 would like to know the make and model of your laptop. One step that we can try is to reset the Winsock first and see if it helps you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow the steps given below to reset Winsock.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press Start button, type
<strong>cmd. </strong>Right-click on it and choose <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>
</span></li><li><span>Type <strong>“netsh winsock reset”</strong> in the Command Prompt shell, and then press the Enter key.</span></li><li><span>Restart the computer and check if it helps.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above step won’t help let’s try resetting Winsock from registry key. Please follow the below steps.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Check to see if the problem is resolved. If it isn't, open the Windows Registry. Click "Start" and type "Run." Type "regedit" in the open box.</span></li><li><span>Select "File" from the menu. Click "Export." Choose a location to export the Registry to. Name the exported file "backup.reg."</span></li><li><span>Choose the key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE." Click the plus sign to expand the key. Click the key "System" and expand it. Navigate to "CurrentControlSet\Services\Winsock." Right-click the "Winsock" key
 and select "Delete." Click "Yes" to confirm the deletion.</span></li><li><span>Navigate to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Winsock2." Right-click the "Winsock2" key and delete it. Click "Yes" to confirm. Exit the Registry Editor. Find the file "backup.reg"
 that you exported and save it to a CD or disk. Restart the computer.</span></li><li><span>Right-click "My Network Places" on the desktop. Right-click the network connection icon. Click "Properties." Click "Install," "Protocol" and "Add." Click "Have Disk" and type in "c:\windows\inf."
 Click "OK."</span></li><li><span>Choose "Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)" from the list of available protocols. If it does not appear, click "Start" and choose "Search." Check the options to search system folders, hidden files and
 folders, and subfolders. Search for the file "nettcpip.inf." Click "Install." Restart the computer and see if it helps.</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>To do so: Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.
 For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft
 Knowledge Base: 322756 (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/</a> )
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using a HP laptop, please check if Family Safety Controller is enabled. If yes, turn it off and try connecting to internet.</span><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">
</span><span>As the issue persist with another windows 8 laptop there are chances that the issue may be with the modem. As you have already said that you don’t have access to modem, but
 if at all you have access to the modem you can do a hard reset of the modem and see if it helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>I hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need any further assistance, we will be glad to assist you.</span>

            You could also try uninstalling your network adapter drivers in Device Manager (available in the System page in&nbsp;Control Panel)&nbsp;then restart the computer to reinstall the drivers from the backup copies.

    <title>How do I recover with the my USB system image&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jahmen myst  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I recover with the my USB system image&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Having created a system image onto my USB Flash Drive, I can't figure out how to get the restore system to recognize it.<br />
How I created my USB Flash drive "backup system image" by formatting the USB drive into NTFS format.&nbsp; Then right click the USB H: drive to Properties to click on Sharing tab.&nbsp; Checked the Share box. Clicked on "Advanced Sharing". Permissions; set to Allow on
 Full Control, Clicked on Apply, then OK, then OK again.&nbsp; This made the USB drive accessible as a network drive by using the share path \\example\h<br />
for the the system image to copy to. <br />
From the Windows 10 Control Panel\&nbsp; Click Backup and restore (Windows 7) <br />
Noting; Microsoft has Windows 10 using Backup and restore (Windows 7) for system backups.<br />
At the bottom under Restore, click-on <strong>Select another backup to restore files
</strong>opens Restore Files (Advanced), Click-on the Browse network location and type in the USB shared path; \\example\h.&nbsp; This was the path for the image USB I made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep getting this error message; The network location cannot be read&nbsp; Details; The network name cannot be found. (0x80070043)<br />
NOTE: I can't explain why the USB system image I created had drive letter \h but when I plug it in it for the restore it reads as USB Drive (E:)</p>
<p>
</p><p>PROBLEM; is the latest image was on the USB Drive. I have others on Hard Drive D: and network TB Drive. The USB I made as an additional backup to test out if a USB Drive system image could be done.&nbsp; If anyone knows more about how to fix this, please post
 back</p>

            I vaguely remember reading somewhere that you can't use a Flash drive as backup media. I can't say that with certainty though.

            Yes I read that as well, that you can't use a Flash Drive as a backup media.&nbsp; And it's true, the backup and restore system image can't see the USB as a drive.&nbsp; However, I then found the steps posted here in the answers.microsoft/forum.for creating a USB
 as a network drive. I figured since it was able to see the USB drive and write the system image to it successfully, I also assumed it could also read it the same way in reverse.<br />
<br />
Again, the only thing I can't explain is why the share path was\h and not the E: it's showing up as now.
<br />
I'll guessing maybe because I might have also had my external USB drive also connected at the time and didn't realize it.&nbsp; At this point I'm mostly looking for an explanation for the failed USB network path.<br />

<p>James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have been using the procedure for restoring files backups.&nbsp; You need to use the procedure for image restoration, as given below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>By the way, the change in drive letters is not a problem and needs no action to be taken.&nbsp; Windows only uses consist drive letters for internal drives unless you force it to assign them to others [and it sometimes forgets them after major updates].</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp; Go to </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Settings</em>, </li><li><em>Update &amp; security</em>, </li><li><em>Recovery</em>,</li><li>Under the <em>Advanced startup</em> heading, click on the button for <em>Restart now</em>.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; This will take you into the onboard Windows recovery environment [WRE], a menu-driven environment -
</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Troubleshoot</em>,</li><li><em>Advanced options</em>,</li><li><em>System image recover</em>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>3&nbsp; You will be rebooted into the <em>System image recovery</em> procedure -</p>
<ul>
<li>Log into an Admin account,</li><li>Connect the drive containing the image,</li><li><span>Accept the latest image identified by the system or </span><span><em>Select a image</em>,</span></li><li><span>The rest is entirely menu driven.</span></li><li><span>[Whilst there are some options that can be chosen, the defaults are normally off for all these and should be accepted.</span>]</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck,</p>
<p>Denis</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS Do please post back to report your success.&nbsp; I understand the steps you took to make an image on the USB memory stick but I have never heard anybody report the results of trying to restore from&nbsp;one later on.&nbsp; There is no logical reason to expect any problems
 at the restore stage.</p>

            I understand the steps to create the USB image file and used the network option.&nbsp; Everything looked fine and I wanted to make sure I could load the image back from the USB.&nbsp; I followed the steps above.&nbsp;
<span>"Accept the latest image identified by the system" is greyed out so I have to select an image.&nbsp; I go through a few more screens and get to one where I have to put the network information in.&nbsp; \\laptop-va80947g\e&nbsp; I hit enter and I get&nbsp; "the network name
 cannot be found. (0x80070043)"&nbsp; So the rest are menu driven is great till it wants the network info.&nbsp; I am typing in what I used to create the USB network image when I created it.&nbsp; Is there there a different network name I should be using/</span>

            <p>THIS PROBLEM WAS RESOLVED SEVERAL HOURS AGO WHEN I REVERTED TO WINDOWS 8.1 AFTER HOURS ON THE PHONE WITH HP CUSTOMER REPS TRYING TO FIX THIS AND OTHER PROBLEMS THE UPGRADE HAS INDUCED ON MY PREVIOUSLY FLAWLESSLY FUNCTIONING HP PAVILION. &nbsp;THEY COULD NOT AND
 RECOMMENDED TO GO BACK TO 8.1. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I BLAME MYSELF FOR THE PREDICAMENT I AM IN. &nbsp;USUALLY I NEVER UPGRADE UNTIL AT LEAST 6 MONTHS TO A YEAR OR MORE WHEN AN UPGRADE COMES OUT. &nbsp;THIS TIME I WAS LULLED INTO COMPLIANCE AND GOT MY WINDOWS 10 INSTALLED IMMEDIATELY. &nbsp;SHORTLY AFTER THE FIRST UPDATE
 FROM WINDOWS CASCADING PROBLEMS BEGAN TO DEVELOP OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. &nbsp; THIS IS THE LOGICAL CONSEQUENCE OF MY VIOLATING THAT PROTOCOL AND LISTENING TO YOU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOW THAT I AM REBUILDING MY HP PAVILION I REALIZE I HAVE WASTED HOURS AND HOURS BECAUSE OF MY LACK OF JUDGEMENT AND YOUR DRIVING FORCE TO GET THE NEXT PRODUCT OUT INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN FOR ECONOMICS, SALES, NOTORIETY, LEADING-EDGE MANTRA OR WHATEVER DRIVES
 ALL OF YOU. &nbsp;IT ENDS UP THAT MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE INSIGNIFICANT PLAYERS IN THIS POOL OF HIGH TECH GET THE PLEASURE OF SCRAMBLING IN YOUR WAKE TO MAINTAIN OUR BALANCE OR KEEPING OUR HEADS ABOVE WATER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IN THE END I HAVE "GROWN-UP" AND SEE THIS AS A STRICTLY MONETARY RELATIONSHIP. &nbsp; MY NAIVETY IS MY PROBLEM.

            After losing all of Office and all the word documents on the laptop, I have also re-established what I had to a workable extent. Thank you for stating what we're all feeling -- MS sent Windows 10 out to let us trial test it.....and cost us time, money
 (for reloading Office) and headaches for lost documents and peace of mind. I'm never uploading something new again from MS.

            I just got my HP laptop and have the same problem but I can't get to 8.1 because it came with 10 on it. Only way I can is to spend more money and buy windows 8.1!&nbsp;

    <title>Why does the print queue display jobs to be printed in a shuffled - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does the print queue display jobs to be printed in a shuffled order&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Windows 7, I am trying to print a large set of Office document files in an automated manner and noticed a rather odd behavior from the print queue. Currently when&nbsp;jobs are added to the print queue list they appear in a random order whislt in spooling,
 printing, printed etc..... mode, however the paper output is in the correct order. The other thing i noticed is that printing or spooling jobs will always appears somewhere in the center of the queue.
</p>
<p>I have tried to sort the queue using the Submitted column. By sorting the list using that column i would expect items to be added either ad the top or bottom of the queue, depending on the ascending/descending order&gt; But this is not the case and new&nbsp;job
 will restart shuffling and start appearing the center of the visual list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the order of the printed pages is clearly more important, from a print operator's point of view i would expect this list to be displayed in the correct "Submitted" order. Does any one know why the queue does shuffle files and if possible how to
 stop it from occuring.</p>

    <title>No more system audio sharing on my iMac - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No more system audio sharing on my iMac</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my iMac to Mojave 10.14.4 and lost the ability to share my SYSTEM audio via skype and Ecamm Live. I am a podcaster and used to be able to share the system audio to anyone on my skype call and this has now disappeared when I updated
 my OS. I am using the most recent version of Skype and have everything running through a Soundcraft Signature 12MTK mixing board. The board is correctly configured and hasn't been changed since the last time the system audio was shared successfully. Is this
 a known issue with the new iMac OS? Any help is super appreciated.&nbsp;

<p>Hello Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still no shared system audio. There is no shared system audio on my webinar software, Ecamm Live as well. Don't know if that helps to know. Any other fixes we can try?</p>

<p>Just Dowloaded Skype for Mac, and kept both versions instead of replacing.</p>
<p>Opened Skype for mac - microphone and camera working.</p>
<p>Both Skype Preview and Skype 'proper' now appear in system preferences&gt;Security&gt;Privacy.</p>
<p>now can delete Skype Preview.</p>
<p>One more tip - when you first open Skype preview - go into setting&gt;audio, and this prompts Skype to ask my Mac for permissions.</p>

    <title>windows 8.1 kernel_data_inpage_error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larissarenwick  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 8.1 kernel_data_inpage_error</h2>
                    <p>I have an Hp Pavillion g6 1b59wm notebook pc. I updated it to windows 8.1 and I keep getting a blue screen error every time my computer starts up.
<br />
</p>
<p>I have tried recovering my system and doing a new install. There are no extra programs on my computer. I have ran tests on my hard drive and on my memory with no errors. There are no viruses on my computer. I updated all my drivers. I am running out of ideas.
 Somebody please help. I have contacted BOTH Microsoft tech support and HP tech support and got no solutions. Here are the minidump files:<br />

<p>
</p><p>Your hard disk is likely dead/dying, so please run Chkdsk + Seatools:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Chkdsk (there are various ways to run Chkdsk):</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search bar &gt; Type cmd (right click run as admin to execute Elevated CMD)<br />
<br />
Elevated CMD should now be opened, type the following:<br />
<br />
<strong>chkdsk x: /r</strong><br />
<br />
x implies your drive letter, so if your hard drive in question is letter c, it would be:<br />
<br />
<strong>chkdsk c: /r</strong><br />
<br />
Restart system and let chkdsk run.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the "Computer" window<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click on the drive in question<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the "Tools" tab<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Error-checking area, click &lt;Check Now&gt;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Press Windows Key + R and type powershell.exe in the run box<br />
<br />
Paste the following command and press enter afterwards:<br />
<br />
get-winevent -FilterHashTable @{logname="Application"; id="1001"}| ?{$_.providername –match "wininit"} | fl timecreated, message | out-file Desktop\CHKDSKResults.txt<br />
<br />
This will output a .txt file on your Desktop containing the results of the chkdsk.<br />
<br />
<span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>If chkdsk turns out okay, run Seatools</strong></span></span> -<br />

You can run it via Windows or DOS. Do note that the only difference is simply the environment you're running it in. In Windows, if you are having what you believe to be driver related issues that may cause conflicts or a false positive, it may be a wise decision
 to choose the most minimal testing environment (DOS). I always recommend running Seatools in DOS if absolutely possible.<br />

                    <p>Original title: Remote Desktop RDG </p>
<p>The app works very well except that you can't have more than one remote gateway server.&nbsp; I have two different infrastructures I connect to and they have different RDG setups.&nbsp; You can't change any advanced options when you create a new connection.&nbsp; You can't
 get the edit until you connect once.&nbsp; I can't connect because the RDG settings are for a different server.&nbsp; Please make the connection options available during initial connection setup.</p>

            <p>OK, never mind.&nbsp; I figured this out.&nbsp; When you are on the home screen you bring up the charms bar and select settings.&nbsp; From there you can change the default RDG server that new machines use.&nbsp; This is exactly what I needed.&nbsp; Works great now.</p>

<h2>            Does windows 10 pro provide VM for windows 7 pro</h2>
                    <p>I have to support clients who will be on windows 7.&nbsp; I have windows 7 pro and used the VM function to support windows XP users before XP's EOL.&nbsp; I'd like to use VM to support windows 7 in a similar way.&nbsp; Also, does the VM emulate a modern graphics chipset?&nbsp;
 I also VM linux.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternately, if Virtual Box gets a Windows 10 version can I use the disks and product key for my Windows 7PRO to install on the same Box I've upgraded to Windows 10
</p>
<p>BTW I'm on&nbsp; a i5 750 CPU</p>

<p>I don't think you understood the question.&nbsp; As part of windows 7 pro there was a package to support XP as a virtual guest.&nbsp; I am asking if there is a package to support windows 7 as a virtual guest of Windows 10 pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Yes, its called Hyper-V and I specifically linked to it with instructions how to set it up. There is course no Windows XP Mode.
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't have a spare box I can upgrade to 10 pro and then back it back down.&nbsp; I already have 6 computers on my desk (three supporting a Linux server test bed, an office windows 7 pro, personal windows 7pro and a windows 8.1 (not pro)
 laptop because IE on 8.1 != to IE on Win 7. <br />
</p>
<p>Second question was a licensing one: can I legally run Windows 7 with the same product key in a Virtual Box&nbsp; that I am using to upgrade the Windows 7 pro to Windows 10 pro?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>No, you will need another license or its best you install the Windows 10 Insider Preview now.</strong></p>

<p>As long as the external hard drive meets the external storage requirements of the Xbox One then yes you can.</p>
<p>For an external storage drive to save games and apps from Xbox One, it must meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;It uses a USB 3.0 connection. If you’re using a USB hub, the hub must also be USB 3.0 or later.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;It has 256 GB or larger storage capacity.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;It has a partition. Typically, drives come with a preformatted partition. For more information about partitioning an external hard drive, refer to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>

<h2>            Mp3 and iPod not working on Xbox 360 Slim.</h2>
                    
<p>I know iPod Touches no longer work on Xbox 360's, so I used a really old mp3 player to try to play music on there. Didn't work. Its a direct plug in, so there's no cord. Its an old MuVo mp3 player. Tips? Thanks!</p>

<p>Greetings, peggy2317! Thanks for bringing your question to the forums. I used to have that mp3 player myself back in the day and I believe it slides out into a USB drive. Are you plugging it directly into your console like a USB drive? Instead, can you connect
 it using a cable and see if that makes a difference? Thanks! Keep us posted</p>

<p>I'm positive that you can no longer use apple products on the Xbox due to the fact that they make Zune now. This was done to help raise sales of the Zune's. At one time it did work but since the 2nd generation Zune came out they have been blocked.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Ok so this isn't the apple support forums but if your ipod has wireless capability and you use a wireless network in your house you can use an amazing little free app to share your music to your Xbox or Internet enabled tv etc.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Look on the store for syncstream and media:connect both do pretty much the same thing.</p>

<p>Only MP3 players and devices that allow Mass Storage style management (and Zunes) work on the Xbox 360. That would mean any device that you manage music via the Windows Explorer, rather than some Proprietary management software such as iTunes. Are you able
 to manage music on the VuMo via My Computer on your desktop?</p>
<p>iOS devices never worked because the OS would have to stay partially active at all times, say, if you were to receive a phone call. iPod classics work because they offer Mass Storage usage, you can use them like flash drives as well!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Reinstall From Blank Slate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jtoomer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Reinstall From Blank Slate</h2>
                    <p>Alright, this all started about two weeks ago. I was up working late at night (about maybe 2:00 A.M.) and shut off my computer to go to bed, but after a few minutes I realized that the fans were still running so I forced it to shut down by shutting off the
 power supply. Yes, now I realize that was probably an update and yes, I know that is probably what caused all of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the next morning I got up to do my online school and got the error screen on Windows 10 about "Windows failed to start" and of course I was a bit annoyed but just had it run startup repair. Nope, startup repair failed. So, by this point I began trying
 everything else from all of the menus. Backup? There wasn't one. System Restore? No point to restore to. Startup Repair? Fails every time. Then I just gave up and went to work on my laptop but that evening I went back to trying to fix it. I finally decided
 that it wasn't worth it to try fixing it with these methods so I clicked on the "Reset" which would delete all of my personal data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Reset failed. Data was still lost but Windows 10 would still fail to boot up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So by this point I was thinking over every possible solution (as this was the computer that I had built for gaming and I was not about to lose it and had no spare Hard Drives to work off of). Finally I decided to install Windows 7 from the disc that installed
 it on my computer originally (before I upgraded to Windows 10) and tried to install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you know, failed to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I decided "I probably have lost everything by now, only one thing left to try". So I used the Windows 7 install disc to reformat the drive. It failed to reformat. Now here I am about two weeks later after using my spare Linux-based laptop to reformat
 the drive and reinstall windows 7 to it. But I no longer have a key that works (When I got this working the key I had was already typed in to activate it but when I go to activate it I get an error saying that it is invalid). So here is my question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I going to have to buy another product key for Windows 7? If so I will just buy windows 10 instead (which I really can't afford either right now so it would be quite a while until I can get a new OS). Or is there a way to get that product key to work?
 I only have 3 days in the trial before it will force me to activate so I really need an answer.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You really should not do that as the Guest Account's set of privilege is important. You can Turn OFF&nbsp;<br />
the Guest Account. Create extra Admin Accounts (including one do not use on a regular basis to
<br />
text and fix) and name one Guests or Welcome Guests.<br />

            Is anyone at Microsoft working on this. I have several customers with the same complaint. I have tried playing with permissions. I personally have the same error when attempting to read/write from any sdcard on my own win 10 systems having nothing to do
 with pictures.
