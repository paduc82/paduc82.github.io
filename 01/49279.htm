            Hi Ailish 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. SrtTrail.txt error is fixed by clean install. But before that try other steps as well.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            Hi Ailish,
<br />
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />Let us try repairing the existing OS.
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21284-enable-disable-fast-boot-uefi-firmware-settings-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21284-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html#option6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help, consider doing a clean install after rescuing your files.

    <title>&#34;Network password&#34; needed to link to Seagate GoFlex storage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bill in chappaqua  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Network password&#34; needed to link to Seagate GoFlex storage device</h2>
                    <p>For two years I've had two Windows 7 computers linked to a Seagate GoFlex backup storage device.&nbsp; The computers connect to the router wirelessly and the GoFlex connects to the router by Ethernet.&nbsp; Backups have been working well.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm now replacing one of the Windows 7 machines with a Windows 8 machine.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Windows 8 machine also connects to the router wirelessly.&nbsp; &nbsp;In the Network view, I can see the GoFlex attached to the router, but when I double click on it I receive a Windows
 message that I need to enter the Network Password.&nbsp; Apparently because of this, the Seagate Desktop software can't connect to the GoFlex and the Memeo backup software supplied by Seagate also can't see the GoFlex.&nbsp; (The Seagate Desktop and Memeo software connect
 to the GoFlex perfectly from the Windows 7 computers.)&nbsp; I upgraded from Windows 8 to 8.1 and I have the same problem with the need to enter a Network Password in both versions of Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps there is a Seagate connection problem as well, but the first issue to resolve seems to be that Windows 8/8.1&nbsp;needs&nbsp;a&nbsp;Network Password.&nbsp; I've tried my new Windows 8 user name and password, my router name and password and my HomeGroup name and password.&nbsp;
 I've even tried my Seagate user name and password, but this seems unlikely since the pop-up is Windows generated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I updated the Seagate Dashboard to the new version that works with Windows 8 -- but the fundamental issue seems to be that Windows 8 needs a network password but it won't tell me which network password to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm guessing there is a new security setting in Windows 8 compared with Windows 7.&nbsp; (I generally use the default security settings.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would someone know what network password I'm supposed to supply or what security setting I need to change in Windows 8.1?</p>

<h2>            UserModePowerService keeps resetting</h2>
                    <p>I just installed Windows 8.1 (previously using Windows 7) and I get every ten minutes or so an event in the event logs:</p>
<p>Process C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe (process ID:2356) reset policy scheme from {381b4222-f694-41f0-9685-ff5bb260df2e} to {381b4222-f694-41f0-9685-ff5bb260df2e}</p>
<p>
</p><p>At that moment my input freezes (I use a USB keyboard) and is suspended for 10 seconds or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to fix this? It starts to become very annoying, it doesn't happen only in games, but also when typing and it bothers me a lot.</p>

            It seems that for me there was some hardware issue; a wired USB keyboard that probably had the wire almost broken; after replacing it it worked; this might be a hardware problem then :)

            <p>Hi ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to know few more information about this issue to assist you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are you trying to login to Microsoft Account from a local account when you try to use the Xbox app, Cortana?</p>
<p>2. From which Operating system was the computer upgraded to Windows 10?</p>
<p>3. What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would suggest you to check for the issue by using an SFC scan.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Win + x</strong> and select <strong>Command Prompt(Admin)</strong></li><li>Type <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You may also try these DISM command and check.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Win + x</strong> and select <strong>Command Prompt(Admin)</strong></li><li>Type <strong>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /</strong><strong>ScanHealth</strong><strong> -
</strong>This will scan for the <strong>Health</strong> to scan the image for component store corruption. This operation will take several minutes.</li></ol>
<p>Once the scan is done you may use the Restore health&nbsp;with this command&nbsp; to scan the image for component store corruption, and then perform repair operations automatically. This operation will take several minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. <strong>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps.</p>

i tried to open the calculator app and it gave me a message that it couldn't open calculator because User Account Control was turned off. &nbsp;Once I turned UAC back on, I can now open the Microsoft Account sign in screen. &nbsp;I turned it back off and I can still
 access the sign in screen and open calculator, so I must have triggered something when I turned it off and back on.

</p><p>@Ravinth P, I tried your steps, but have heard nothing else from you. Are there any more moderators/MS pros out there that have any input?</p>

<h2>            Acct Hacked 2X and no help from XBOX Support</h2>
                    
<p>My sons acct was hacked into and they were able to change windows live ID and the answer to his secret question. After 4 investigations and 3 months, XBOX LIVE can't help or talk to us unless we answer the secret questions. WTF..it was stolen ! We have called
 11 Times, opened 4 investigations, spoke to 9 different people with 4 being supervisors that were going to call us everyday until this was going to be resolved and promised this was going to be their #1 priority. The last call they said they couldn't talk
 with us if we couldn't answer the question. The 10 times before, they took all the info, created case numbers and everything. Any suggestions of how to get my sons acct back. The big Microsoft company doesn't have the technology to transfer me to any of the
 1st 10 people we talked to. They gave us a corporate address. What to do next?</p>

                    <p>Hello Good day,</p>
<p>I have recently upgraded my laptop OS from windows 8.1 to windows 10 enterprise, but unfortunately my printer's driver didn't work with windows 10 which was previously worked with. It shows me " the application couldn't work with or windows has blocked it
 because it will damage the system or hard drive".</p>
<p>I yesterday downloaded the driver from printer's manufacturer.</p>
<p>Here is the printer model: HP Deskjet 2050A All in One Series. Thanks</p>
<p>My regard to technicians and and engineers working to solve problems.</p>

            <p>Windows is preventing the driver of your printer to be installed properly, because Windows Enterprise Edition has more security features than Windows Home and Pro, because Windows Enterprise was designed especially for business purposes. Thus, we suggest
 switching to Windows Home or Pro Edition so that your printer will be installed without any difficulties.</p>

    <title>Video card driver problem on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> valentincazacu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video card driver problem on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Hello! </p>
<p>I have a notebook acer Aspire 5935G with Nvidia GeForce GT 130M and i can't install the video drivers on Windows 10 OS... and without these video drivers the HDMI port it's not working...</p>
<p>I tryed all the posibillities including compatibility mode but no result...</p>
<p>I make a research on this situation and i disovered this notebooks use a hybrid video technology for power saving and consumption... So, somehow this notebook have a NVIDIA video card and also have a Intel video card but this second one is used
 only when you browse the internet or do simple things, for preserving the power, and when you play games or watch videos it is using the NVIDIA video card.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows 7 everything its working fine but on Windows 10 the NVIDIA GT 130M driver can't be installed so that's why HDMI its not working because works only with these driver...</p>
<p>When i install the Windows 10, the intel driver installs automatically and after i should be able to install the NVIDIA driver but i can't.... same on Windows 7 the intel driver is allready installed after setup but after i can install the Nvidia
 driver and it's working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone can do something about this or we have to roll back to older versions of Windows? This notebooks have the potential to run Windows 10 with their configurations easily better than other new notebooks....</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi Valentin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to do further investigation so that we can identify the cause of the issue. What is the message/error message when you try to install the NVIDIA driver? It's also possible that the current version of the NVIDIA driver that you have is not compatible
 with Windows 10. We suggest that you download a fresh copy of the NVIDIA driver from their website and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

<h2>            Showing as offline to contact</h2>
                    I use Skype only for instant messaging, not for voice or video. When I'm logged in, I still show as offline to the contact I communicate with the most. I'm on the most recent Skype for Windows 10, but I believe my contact is a version behind. I searched
 but didn't see this in the community as a known issue. Anyone else having this problem, and if so is there a resolution/workaround?

<p>Same problems, different version (12.9.604.0), same experience on reinstalling Skype and I totally agree on your comment to ridiculous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW</p>
<p>On other desktop with same version of Skype I do not experience this problem of 'being online for approximately five minutes.'. Status online on&nbsp; faulty environment (laptop) will be triggered&nbsp; again when the app Skype gets the focus in Windows. And after
 five minutes I'm offline again, until Skype gets focus. Very nasty issue to stay tuned in.</p>

            A little more info: it wasn't necessarily the sound notification setting that resolved it. I logged in this morning and was offline to my primary contact. I went into settings and toggled "do not disturb" and "do not share my presence" on and off, and
 then my little green dot appeared.

<p>Your method was exactly what I did before, before only focusing the app Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought this was a workaround to show my presence. After a while I found out that just clicking&nbsp; the app (giving focus) did have the same result. In both cases it did not last longer then approximately five minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I have experienced some improvment on this issue. At first I thought I did something yesterday that solved the problem, but this morning I experienced the same issue again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But later today Skype showed my presence fore a couple of hours instead of the five minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I wrote this I had again the max five minutes presence, but now my presence lasts at least longer then 15 minutes. I'm writing this on an other computer, than the one I experience this&nbsp; particular problem with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short: today (dec. 6th) there is an improvement compared to the last two weeks before, but it is definitely not stable yet.</p>

            the only rumored free upgrades will be those offered folks who purchase a new pc within a specific time window (between June 26, 2009 and Jan. 31, 2010) with specific vista editions (Vista Home Premium, Vista Business and Vista Ultimate) preinstalled.
 the vista edition determines the win7 upgrade edition.<br />

<p>Call up the store if they can't help, call THQ or Xbox to see if they can do anything. If no one can help then return the game. This game is not as good as the others and is not worth $60.

<p>While SRTT may not be as good as the others, it still is a good game in it's own right (even with all it's flaws, as there is no 'perfect' game) I'd say to at least give it a try first, BEFORE trading it back to the store of purchase.</p>

<h2>            where is &#39;stella fella&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    

<p>hello&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right, heres the story....&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have 2 xbox's, 1 premium 250 gig and 1 250 gig new elite.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the premium i can play all tiger's and other games cod, halo etc etc online/offline without a problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same goes for the elite all game profiles/saves etc etc will load EXCEPT tiger 12!! The game loads as normal but It will load my gamer tag STELLAFELLA69UK but not my golfer, which i created and progressed with on the premium, 'stella fella'... It will not
 find it!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game just loads as if its the first time i have played. I am currently about 3/4 of the way finished so i dont really want to start over again &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No matter what i try, loading profile from MU or HDD, clearing cache, kicking it several times or reinstalling game,recovering gamer tag.... NOTHING WORKS!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even let the game run its course and created a new golfer and saved that. That golfer is found and loads,but when i try to change golfer in main menu 'stella fella' is no where to be found!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now like i said, i can take game and MU and put in my premium, and hey presto... it finds 'stella fella' not a problem. Why not on the elite??&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today i spent an hour on the phone to a nice EA rep but he was at a loss also!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone shed any light on this for me please.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>many thanks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>STELLAFELLA69UK&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS check out the ONLY footage of a perfect 600.00 yard long drive and some other awesome shots on my tiger 10 challenges &nbsp;</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, it sounds like the profile may be linked to the console it's created on, which would explain why it shows up when HDD A is on Console A, but not when it's attached to Console B. Why this would be, I'm not sure, but it sounds specific
 to that game, correct? Nothing similar is happening if you move HDDs for any other game? In that case, it sounds like an (admittedly odd) choice on the developer's behalf.
