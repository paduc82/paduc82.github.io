    <title>Installation Error when install of SQL Server 2008 R2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mis tech support  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installation Error when install of SQL Server 2008 R2</h2>
                    <p>When we are trying to re-install SQL Server 2008 R2 on a machine that was installed and operational until we determined a Collation error that forced us to 'uninstall' SQL Server.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then we have not been able to get an installation to complete.&nbsp; Each time we do we get the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>****</span></p>
<p><span>A network-related or instance-specific error occured while establishing a connnection to SQL Server.</span></p>
<p><span>The server was not found or was not accessible.&nbsp; Verify the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connnections.&nbsp; (provider: TCP Provider, error : 0 - No connection
 could be made because the target machine actively refused it.)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Click 'Retry' to retry the failed action, or click 'Cancel' to cancel this action and continue setup.</span></p>
<p><span>****</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This message is presented at the point of the istallation that the progress bar is showing :</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>RS_RunInstallScriptsAction_Cpu64
</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>is showing - and the menu on the side bar is showing:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Installation Progress</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>******</strong></span></p>
<p><span>At this point there is is only Retry and Cancel - retry will cycle this message again.&nbsp; Cancel will take us to the end of the system messages that then generate another
 series of error messages, that tell us that the <strong>DATABASE ENGINE SERVICE </strong>
failed, along with the first 4 lines of the ending screen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Environment<br />
We are running on Small Business Server 2011 - which is the Domain controller - this client has a single server for all needs - small company - small network requirements.</span></p>
<p><span>We need to REMOVE SQL server from this machine and reinstall - there is no other option - we do not need to worry about the SHAREPOINT or the MONITORING features as the
 client is using neither of these and has no plans to use either.</span></p>
<p><span>Priority is to remove SQL and then Install SQL correctly with the correct Collation.&nbsp; Currently SQL Server is not running - so offers to fix the collation is not the
 answer - SQL NEEDS TO BE INSTALLED</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thanks in advance.</span></p>

<p>Hi Marcusvan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message "0xC1900101 - 0x4000D Setup failed in SECOND_BOOT phase with an error during MIGRATE_DATA operation" may have something to do with incompatible drivers or with the software installed on the computer. With that said, we will be performing
 some troubleshooting steps to isolate the cause of this issue. Before we proceed, kindly answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li><li>Can you send us a screenshot of the error message you are getting? Make sure that you remove all personal information.</li><li>Is this the first time that you encountered this concern?</li><li>Do you have any antivirus program installed on your PC? If so, did you disable it before you update your computer?</li></ul>

<p>Hi Jimmy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might be caused by an error with Windows Update. Usually, manually updating to the latest version of Windows 10 resolves the issue, however, that seems to be not the case with your situation. At this time, we suggest that you use the ISO again
 to upgrade to Windows 10, version 1709 but choose not to install the updates. The upgrade should now push through. If it does push through and you find that a certain driver is missing because no updates where installed during the upgrade, you can download
 the driver from the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>

<p>Hi Jimmy - did you manage to resolve this issue - i am have the same PC and hitting the exact same issue.&nbsp; Had MS Level 3 support trying to install it but the conclusion was i need to either update my motherboard to a latest version (as there is a supposedly
 a driver compatability issue with the latest update) or go back to windows 7.</p>

<p>I've always managed to run Windows 10 Build 1703 with no problem, but upgrading to the Creators Fall update (Build 1709) just doesn't happen. Luckily at least my PC reverts to Build 1703 after the update failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fear we may be stuck unable to update, unless Microsoft being aware of the problem amend the Creators Fall software to get round our difficulties - or Packard Bell contact Microsoft with a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However it would be nice to have known from Microsoft that Windows 10 might eventually render our PC's obsolete BEFORE we bought their operating system !!</p>

            I am having the same problem. I even tried a clean install, but it always fails at the same point. I have the log file but it is too large to post. Is there any way to have someone review the log file and tell me what is preventing installation?

            When level 3 were reviewing my issue they were able to log in remotely and upload log files against my ticket and then review them. So it is possible if you have a case open and they deem the log file might have some useful information. I'm my case they
 didn't find anything. Hopefully someone from Microsoft can assist here?&nbsp; I'm still stuck with the same issue so would be keen to know if it can be fixed also.

<p>Hi Tori, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering that the message indicates that the system doesn't meet the minimum requirements might means that the device is not compatible to it. We suggest contacting your device manufacturer for further assistance in checking the compatibility of your
 video card in using Windows 7 Aero. They will also be the one to suggest which driver will be appropriate for your device.

<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
</span>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the recovery partition is not working, see the following:</p>

<h2>            Skype keeps signing me out</h2>
                    <p>I have a OnePlus 5 and the latest version of Skype. Every time I restart my phone, to start Skype I have to sign in anew. This is the only app that does this - all the others including Office and Outlook, remember my user id and password. Any way to fix
 that?</p>

<p>no disrespect to the people who purchased hardened edition or seasons pass in order to get the nuketown 2025 zombie map, but, i had a dlc for it for free, and everywhere i look, it's still saying it's available for free dlc. hung up by xboxlive customer
 reps 3 times today, but on the 8th when i tried the download it went to 99% then down to 0% and kept re-setting the download. I called xbox on the 8th, and was told activision made a "boo-boo" by releasing early and that it would be available for everyone
 for free on the 12th, as advertised on the 8th through my console's downloads. how do i get it as promised and featured. again, no disrespect to anyone who "purchased" this map, but i and others where told we could download it for free, and others are also
 commenting in activision's forums that can't get it either. how did you get it, where did you get it? why does it say it's free, but now there isn't even the option for me to download it and xbox disconnects our phone calls, and says they'll call me back if
 our call is disconnected, yet they don't. anyone here that can help? it's for my kid, i could care less, i don't play zombies, yet he does. trying to make him happy. can you help? thanks.</p>

<p>who "told" you it was a free download? it is not. it was a mistake and what you downloaded was an incorrect placemarker for the nuketown zombies DLC. if you didn't buy it or have a code from the hardened/CP edition, you're not getting it for free. sorry</p>

<p>it was on our dashboard, as a free download, 1st appearing on the 8th. problems downloaded it prompted me to call xlive, they told me activision screwed up by releasing it 4 days early and that it would be available on the 12th. so i'm guessing now, that
 activision also screwed up by saying it was free for everyone? but i [re-ordered it, and followed all codes, and still didn't receive all bonus content for pre-ordering? this will be the last time i pre-order a game, which helps in the costs of production/distribution
 of a game, since i am not receiving all promised content. would be very helpful if xbox live reps calls were not disconnected, or if they called me back as promised, in case we got disconnected. thanks for trying to help me here. Sucks, and i'm not the only
 one who saw that this was free for everyone to download.</p>

            Hi Joonkit95<br /><br />I am an independent advisor here to help<br /><br />This is an essential part of the Windows operating system. In order to restore it I would recommend that you reset Windows 10 using the steps in this guide<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>

            Hi joonkit95 
<br />
<br />Can you actually get into Windows 10 with ntkrnlmp.exe missing?
<br />
<br />If you can you should immediately go into your Anti-malware and restore that file, that is one of the most essential party of Windows - I am very surprised that Windows actually allowed that file to be deleted . . 
<br />
<br />If you cannot get into Windows:
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

<h2>            Windows 8 Mail app does not send email &#40;stuck in Outbox&#41;</h2>
                    <p>The Windows 8 Mail app had been working like a charm, and suddenly it stopped working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have two accounts : Outlook.com and my ISP's mailbox (POP3/SMTP). Outlook.com works OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For my ISP's account, I can receive emails via POP3, but outgoing emails get stuck in the Outbox, and the mail app says "*** Email address is removed for privacy *** is unavailable."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem is present on all my Windows 8 machines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sending email using Outlook 2010 (via the same account) works, and also using a command-line SMTP email sending program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I even try disabling Avast's email filter, to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I troubleshoot this (I am a software engineer)? Is there a means to have the app log its SMTP transactions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>well... this looks like a very "boilerplate" answer to me...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found out that using non-secure SMTP on port 25 restores normal operation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you suggest to troubleshoot issues with SSMTP?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll check whether it's enabled in my Outlook 2010&nbsp; setup, if it works there then the app's the culprit, if not then that's an SSL-related problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any further hints ?</p>

            This is a meaningless answer. &nbsp;The problem people are having is only in Windows Mail 8. &nbsp;Get it? &nbsp;The guy said that it works in other applications. &nbsp;Get it? &nbsp; So when is this going to be fixed??????????

            <p>Please read the entire thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Originally I wrote that Outlook worked whereas the Mail app didn't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But then I realized that Outlook was configured not to use SSL, whereas the Mail app was configured to use SSL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tested enabling SSL in Outlook and that caused it to fail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the problem is indeed related to SSL, not to the Mail app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I understand that other people might experience the same symptoms (mail stuck in Outbox), but with a different root cause.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to track down the problem to the firewall in my ISP's box (Orange's LiveBox Play Fibre)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some reason, when one switches from a predefined firewall configuration to a custom one, the rule that allows outbound SMTP/SSL traffic on port 465 is
<strong>not</strong> carried along.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I created the rule manually and voil√†, problem solved!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thx anyway for your help.</p>

</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screenshot you posted does not look like you have Windows 8.1 installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The gray command bar at the bottom of the screenshot is from Windows 8 and it&nbsp;no longer appears in Windows 8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you Right Click a Tile in Windows 8.1 you should see the following Context Menu.</p>

</p><p>Check Windows Update to make sure you have all of the latest updates installed.</p>

<h2>            My account is no longer my account - possibly hacked - please help</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, hoping someone can help and not sure where to put this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just got an e-mail adivising that my purchase of 6,000 points was succesful, although I never made this transaction myself.&nbsp; I tried to log into the xbox site (this one) with my gamertag but I was then told the password was incorrect, though I never changed
 it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've taken the 'reset password; option and changed it myself back, hence being able to post this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm very concerned as I cannot remove my credit card details from the account, log in under my own xbox/gamertag and I have no way of stopping this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If someone can please advise me I would be greatly appreciative, thank you.</p>

<h2>            Google Earth keeps freezing up on surface pro 3</h2>
                    I look at a lot of buildings in google earth to measure the buildings. When I had my surface&nbsp; pro it worked fine now that I've upgraded to the 3 every time I start working in google earth the picture freezes and I have to restart the program to get it

            I put it in compatibility mode back to Windows 7 and it still freezes after about 3 minutes of using the program and you have to close and re-open the program for another 3 minute session.

            Compatibility mode didn't fix my freeze issue. &nbsp;What did work was changing the memory cache from 500 to 1000. &nbsp;Under tools, options, cache. &nbsp;

<p>Increasing the size of cache doesn't seem to work. It takes the program longer to freeze but in the end it still freezes.</p>

</p><p>Could be a direction to a proper solution though? Not sure if Google will ever update the desktop GE apps again however.</p>

    <title>AVI in Windows Media Center - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beach farmer  say:</h3>
<h2>            AVI in Windows Media Center</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings:</p>
<p>I've imported AVI video from my Sony mini DV with "Windows Import".&nbsp; I have Vista 32 Ultimate and assume the "Windows Import" is a function of "Windows Movie Maker".</p>
<p>I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">can</span> play the AVI video in Windows Media Center on the PC.&nbsp; My Xbox is wired through a router to my Windows Media Center PC.&nbsp; When I access Windows Media Center from the Xbox, I can navigate to the AVI video
 on the PC and can see the file icon.&nbsp; The file icon actually shows a picture frame of the AVI video!&nbsp; However, when I try to play the video, I get a message that it cannot play do to not having the right codec.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; How do I play the AVI over the Xbox.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I read other threads discussing a divx codec.&nbsp; Do I need this since I can alread view the AVI in Windows Media Center on the PC?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Am I foolish to think that if I import the AVI video through the "Windows Import" function that it should used the proper codec to allow the AVI video to play through the Xbox (since this is microsofts product as well)?&nbsp; Or am I mixing apples with oranges
 in this question.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The Windows Media Center in the Xbox works fine for all other functionality with PC.&nbsp; However, an issue I have been having with the Xbox is that it does not "see" the PC in the video menu.&nbsp; This may have been a result of a installation of a new Linksys
 Router.&nbsp; I noticed that the router has a firewall option and I'm also running a firewall through McAfee Security Center.&nbsp; I am not using Windows firewall.&nbsp; Do I need to run both Linksys and McAfee firewalls?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help anyone can provide...j</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p><span><span>Hello jcgreen75,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Are
 you using a Media Extender on your computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here are the Answers to your questions:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Question 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>The Xbox 360 supports most of the AVI files on and plays the files with the Extensions .avi, .divx.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>All thought that the extension for the files says AVI, doesn't mean that it is a Xvid or Divx video. It could be ANY format, just with an AVI extension.
 Find the details of that individual AVI files and see what video format it is.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are trying to play any other video format, it could be possible that you don‚Äôt have the required codecs to play the Video file you might have
 to convert the files that are readable by your Media Extender that. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There are several Third Party Converters or codec software to play these files in X box. You can use your favorite search Engine and look for these
 software.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE DISCLAIMER:<br />
<br />
</span><span>Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use
 of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk</span></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>You can check out the below link that will give you information on ‚ÄòVideo Playback FAQ‚Äô:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/nxe/gamesandmedia/movies/videofaq/viewvideoplaybackfaq.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/nxe/gamesandmedia/movies/videofaq/viewvideoplaybackfaq.aspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Question 2:<br />
</span></strong><span>Your question does make sense that if it plays on the PC, you should be able to play the same file on X-box.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However, this depends on whether your Media Extender Supports the file (Video) format that you are trying to play.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Question 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>It could be possible that the ‚ÄòLinksys Router‚Äô router firewall could be blocking you from seeing the Computer as this was the recent change made
 on your computer. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You might need to configure the Router firewall to allow the computer to access Xbox. You will need to refer the router configuration settings to
 give exception to allow it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However, my suggestion would be that you don‚Äôt make any changes as it is working flawlessly on your computer.</span></span></p>

<p><span>Hi PoconosLorraine,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you receive this message when you try to make a video call in Skype?</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you‚Äôve any other video chat programs other than Skype on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the version of Skype that you‚Äôve currently installed?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Firstly,
 if you‚Äôve face recognition enabled on your Dell machine, then disable it and check if you‚Äôre able to use webcam.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>You
 can also turn off the webcam and then open Skype to make a video call which makes the camera to turn on automatically and then you‚Äôll be good to go.</span><span>The same if you go to tools
 and check video, this also turns on the camera, giving you an image to save.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If none of the above works, then I presume that the issue is with Skype. I would suggest you to re-install the latest version of Skype
 and then check if that resolves the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Get Latest version of Skype</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/get-skype/on-your-computer/windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/get-skype/on-your-computer/windows/</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to check if Skype has any suggestion on this issue.</span></p>

<p>It is "Phaser 3124", not phase.</p>
<p>Download the Windows 7 Drivers from Xerox (use drop down menu for Operating System.)</p>

    <title>Re-installing Windows 7 on an old laptop. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Re-installing Windows 7 on an old laptop.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have an old laptop that was handed down to me by a friend. I uninstalled Windows and replaced it with Linux, I am now hoping to re-install windows seven but have read that this is not possible without purchasing another licence.&nbsp; The product key
 is still visible on the underside of the laptop but apparently this will not work with a downloaded boot image of windows. Is this correct or is there any way to re-install it without having to buy yet another licence of windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>I don't know what you mean by "<span>downloaded boot image".&nbsp; Use a normal Win7 install disk.&nbsp; If the computer came with Win7 installed and you have the product key, you should have no problem.</span></p>

<p>Further to Canadian Tech's accurate information, if you need an installation DVD, download the ISO file corresponding to the edition (including "bitness") of Windows shown on the COA sticker on your laptop using the tool from this site:&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-and-office-iso-download-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-and-office-iso-download-tool</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create the required installation DVD from the ISO file using <a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
ImgBurn</a> or, if the laptop is capable of booting from USB, you can create a bootable USB flash drive from the ISO file using
<a href="https://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Rufus</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before starting the installation, you should go to the website of the laptop's manufacturer and download (and save to a USB flash drive) all of the required drivers.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have been using Windows 8 &amp; 8.1 for a while now on my HP laptop. I usually set my wifi connection to be metered by bringing up the wifi connections charm, right clicking on my wifi and selecting "Set as metered connection".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased my surface pro 3. however i cant find this option?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me please?</p>

            Go to the settings charm again, wifi connections.&nbsp; And then select View Connection Settings right at the top.&nbsp; From there you can select the connection you want to change and adjust various settings including metered connection. That's also where you can
 add VPN connections.

    <title>&#34;Disconnect Projector&#34; equals Black Screen, forced to use - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janrkr  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Disconnect Projector&#34; equals Black Screen, forced to use Extended or Projector mode</h2>
                    <p>Trouble started with my Laptops Brightness control. I cannot adjust brightness on my screen, eventhough it always has been working. Display is not damaged, so I happened to check in which mode my display is in -&gt; Connected to Projector mode.<br />
<br />
So I chose "DIsconnect Projector" mode. Black screen. I used Win+P, double tapping it to get it into Extended mode -&gt; My screen started showing my desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I checked my Screen Resolution page. Shows that desktop number 2 is my Main Desktop. Alright, I wanted to change it, so my main Desktop would be number 1 desktop, just like my Catalyst Control shows it to be. I can't change it, because it won't let me.
 "Applying" these settings will not result any changes. "OK" won't apply any changes to these I made. Choosing "Show only Desktop 1" will show me black screen where I can Right-click and see the regular drop-down menu which occurs when You right-click in working
 desktop environment, but without the windows bar below or without desktop icons. So I assumed I'm in the "First Desktop", which isn't the Main Desktop, and I'm suddenly in Extended Desktop mode, eventhough I never told it to go in this mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I thought maybe something will change for better if I disable my Catalyst Control Center from device manager. When I did that, windows screen resolution page no longer showed "Display number 2" active on the display detection box, but when I re-enabled
 my catalyst, desktop 2 again became active and the main desktop device or w/e.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So bottom line - My catalyst says i have Desktop mode 1, my windows says im in desktop 2, and my brightness doesnt change when changed either with Function+Home/End or within battery settings (Adjust screen brightness section). And, I cannot use regular
 "Disconnect Projector" mode because it will be black screen with no right-clicking on the screen, I have to use "Extended" or "Projector" modes but neither seem to work anymore.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>MY PC HAS GONE ROGUE. That's the verdict. I'll be soon blow-torching this pc and turning my back on everything that contains Windows or ATI, and go for friggin Linux or OS X which makes perhaps more sense than this.... im making changes but its not changing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried basically every different setting there is - Changing display mode to be "extended" in both catalyst and windows to see it this changes anything..<br />
I have tried changing them both to desktop 1, no help, won't change, just because it doesnt want to.</p>
<p>I have tried forcing them both to be as desktop 2, still one will be for number 1 and another one for number 2..</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyways, I am really confused, and the stuff my computer does is exactly as confusing as my explanation above. If anyone has any idea or method that could work, please let me know. Going with "Press Win+P" or "Function+F8 (does absolutely nothing for me)"
 is pointless, ive tried everything and I just want my pc to be "disconnected from projector" in "desktop ONE" without all this ****.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for those who bother to think with me!<br />
Jan</p>

            <p>Hello Jan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
Based on the description it looks like you are facing an issue while connecting projector to Windows 7 Operating system. The issue could be due to some settings problem or if display drivers are not updated or get corrupted. There might be a chance that some
 system files are corrupted or
</p><p><span>missing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It would be great if you could answer these questions in order to assist you further.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What happens when you try to connect, are you getting any error message or error code?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try the following methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Run the <strong>Hardware troubleshooter</strong></span></p>
<p><span>An automated troubleshooter is a tool that can find and automatically fix some problems with your computer. These troubleshooters aren't designed to fix every problem, but they're a useful tool
 to try because they can often save your time and effort.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</span></a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This might be the issue with the display card. You may try to update the display card drivers from the manufacturer‚Äôs website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Drivers are updated occasionally. Windows can update them automatically, or you can install the updated drivers yourself. It's important for you to have confidence in the updated drivers you install. Windows notifies you if it detects a suspicious or unsafe
 driver you shouldn't install.<span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></strong><span>:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong></p>
<p>If issue still persist, <span>I would recommend you to boot the computer in <strong>
clean boot state </strong>and then try to connect the projector to the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> </span><span>After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank You for replying to my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I'm not even trying to use an external monitor or projector, this problem occurs and persists without any hdmi/vga cable connected, i cant get it to work normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Make and model is Lenovo Thinkpad T420 with Win7 64bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Catalyst driver appears to be fully updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try the troubleshooting and perhaps I should check eventviewer as well. I'm kind of advanced user in Windows but this problem even I cannot wrap my head around.</p>

            <p>Hello Jan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am following this thread just to know the current status of your computer. Is issue still persisting or it has been resolved. If issue is still persisting you may try to check the system files, are they working fine or not
</p>
<p><span><span>and to check that try to run
<strong><span>System File Checker (SFC)</span></strong> tool.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows Firewall and defender not Working</h2>
                    I've been trying to get windows firewall up for a few days now. I tried the netsh command prompt solution. now, instead of getting an error code( 0x80070424) it just loads forever. Then I found the "start it in services" solution that is where our grand
 adventure begins.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I scrolled down to windows firewall and noticed it wasn't started, so i naturally opened it and clicked "start" and instead of my computer being protected, i get error code 5. When i try to open windows defender, it say it is turned off, when i try to
 turn it on i get 0x80070424 aswell.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You are missing important&nbsp;information for us&nbsp;to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You do not tell us what Antivirus you are using or if using a &nbsp;3rd Party Firewall (Zone Alarm, etc)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using an Internet Security Suite&nbsp;(Norton, TrendMicro, McAfee) they have their own Firewall and will disable Windows Firewall, as you do not have two firewalls running at the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><u>Defender problem:</u></em></p>
<p>If you are using Norton, AVG, Avira, Microsoft Security Essentials, McAfee, etc the default action is for&nbsp;Windows Defender to be disabled, as those AntiVirus Programs have their own Antispyware Applications.</p>
<p>It is nothing to be worried about.</p>
<p>Using the two Programs at the same time can cause System conflicts, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to have extra protection against&nbsp;Malware&nbsp;use the FREE version of Malwarebytes AntiMalware:</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 DOS Prompt loses focus</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a strange problem with My Windows 7 Professional PC.</p>
<p>When I open a DOS-box and start typing it loses focus every few keystrokes</p>
<p>Focus will come back after 2 a 3 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I don't type focus stays on.</p>
<p>It only happens when I start typing...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this problem <span><span>a few months ago and then it dissappeared.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now it's back again and is very annoying...</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This only happens with the DOS box, not in any other program.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I closed every program and background processes that could be closed but nothing helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Can anyone tell me what this could be?</span></span></p>

            Thanks for the advice I'll give it a try. I am not sure about getting a refund since it was still purchased on my console even though I didn't authorize it. I am just having issues trying to get the game started since it takes me to the MS Store to purchase
 it again anytime I try and see how the game is.
