<p>I&nbsp;think the class 10s are the fastest and most suitable for the surface 2, I would guess pay more keen attention to how much read and write data transfer they offer for example depending on if your card is an extreme or pro version it would offer like 45-90
 MB/s transfer speeds, not really sure how true that Is but that's what Is being advertised by there respective companies. I'm using the Samsung Evo 64GB which offers 48MB/s transfer speeds.

<p>Simply stating Class 10 is not definitive as there are different speeds of class 10 (i.e. UHS-I, Pro, etc).</p>

            sorry but my devices are not test bunnies that I would just transfer random files in the manner. @48mb/s is what I get when and when ever I record a video for work longer then 2mins it usually takes 5 seconds to appear in my gallery.

<p>It says 90MB/s but you only got 20MB/s out of it? Did you reformate the card to Nfst instead of using the default exfat I know windows doesn't really like using any other format base. That could have been the reason why. My thought's.
<br />
<br />
Not sure what you mean exactly by "48mb/s is very slow.&nbsp; Are you sure you did not mean 48MB/s?"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But here is a link to the card I am using which on my S2 </p>

            <p>I almost purchased the Samsung Evo microSDXC but the PRO was faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>mb = megabits and MB = megabytes.&nbsp; 48 megabits is not fast at all.&nbsp; 48 megabytes is though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to that link and it states 48MB/s but that does not neccessarily mean that the speed you are getting though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NTFS versus FAT only becomes useful when dealing with a physical hard drive.&nbsp; NTFS allows multiple read write actions and has&nbsp;a larger filesize capabilty than FAT.&nbsp; FAT versus NTFS&nbsp;does not make a significant difference in reference to flash memory though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I left out a small piece of the puzzle which was I tried the aforementioned cards using a USB 3.0 card reader and got 43.05MB/s max read speed.&nbsp; It would appear that the Surface 2 microSD slot maxes out at 20MB/s.</p>

            <p>Is there something in particular that you are trying to accomplish by purchasing the most expensive and most fastest micros SD card there is on the Surface 2 to be honest what really benefits can be taken advantage of by the hardware device it self.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if I may ask why do you consider 48MB/s to be the slowest in that bracket when other brands offer less speeds with the same capacity?
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion anything above the 48 mark doesn't not deliver any real world advantage due to limitations, if I'm wrong please do enlighten me.
<br />
<br />
And if I may just to take a few minutes out of your time to check a video that i recently viewed before purchasing the Samsung card, it some what assisted or swayed my choice. Maybe this test has absolutely no bearing in what we are discussing but&nbsp;I find it
 some what justifiable in regards to price and performance, again maybe this has absolutely no bearing hear but still it does raise some question.
<br />

45MB/s vs 90MB/s class 10</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/GkRiIbxNzwQ?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/GkRiIbxNzwQ?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>
</p><p>The person in the video was using regular cards not micros btw and as to minimize time please scroll to 2:40 mark to get a basic grasp of why I'm making this point.

<p>
</p><p>Let me know your thoughts here after, who knows i might be completely off the mark on this one.</p>

                    <p>I recently bought a Surface Pro 3 around 2 weeks and started to notice a dead pixel on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contacted the customer support (Hong Kong) and they only agreed to replace my 2 weeks old surface with a refurbished one (same model)!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hugely disappointed with their response and have anyone got similar experience?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Disabling touchpad gestures in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrzej_370  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disabling touchpad gestures in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a big problem, that makes my tablet computer (Kiano Intelect X1 FHD) completely useless:<br />
</p>
<p>because of wrong working touchpad gestures all the windows minimize every 10-60 seconds.<br />
This is extremally annoying. The built-in touchpad is recognized by Windows as a standard mouse.<br />
I have spent hours on searching for solutions but none of them worked out.<br />
<br />
I would like to add that this problem appears in all the tablets of this kind (even the reviewers have mentioned it).<br />
</p>
<p>How to completely disable the touchpad gestures in Windows 10? <br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance&nbsp;</p>

            Dear Anne!<br />
<br />
Thank you for the response, however it did not solve my problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm using the most actual Polish version of Windows 10 (compilation 15063).<br />
Since, as I wrote previously, Windows recognizes the touchpad of my tablet (it is 2in1 tablet with keyboard and touchpad) Kiano X1FHD as a standard mouse (mouse compatible with HID) I can't see the touchpad settings.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It is possible to turn the whole device off by turning off the mouse driver, but the touchpad is ok itself and works well. Just the gestures cause the whole problem. Since the computer is very small and does not have a USB port (it needs a special cable to
 connect an USB device) I would prefer not to buy a mouse.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there any way to disable just the gestures (maybe turning off some services or modyfying the system registry)?<br />
<br />
Please advice,&nbsp;<br />
Best regards<br />
Andrzej

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Outdated or misconfigured touchpad driver could be one of the factors why you are having touchpad gestures issue. We would like to verify if you were able to download the latest touchpad driver from the manufacturer's website. The touchpad should not be recognized
 as a standard mouse.<br />
<br />
We'll keep an eye out for your response.

<p>Dear Ronalene!<br />
<br />
Unfortunatelly it is impossible to update the driver since Windows does not allow it, informing that the driver that is used is the most proper and up-to-date; it is a standard mouse conforming with HID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way just to disable gestures?<br />
<br />
Please advice<br />

<p>There is a way to disable gestures but we need to ensure that the proper driver is installed. Some software driver has an option to disable the gestures. We would like to verify if you were able to check if there are drivers available on the website of your
 manufacturer. If there is, follow the methods below:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Uninstall the current driver.</li><li>Install the latest driver from the manufacturer's website.</li><li>Check if the driver software has an option to disable the gesture.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the drivers were installed successfully and the gestures have been disabled, run the tool from this

<p>When you first power up the system nothing you see being displayed on the monitors has anything to do with Windows, it is all direct from the hardware/firmware in the system. What you're seeing is that the VGA output on your video card is actually the primary
 output of the card and the HDMI (or DVI) is secondary. After Windows starts&nbsp;running and the video drivers are loaded then Windows&nbsp;can switch to using the monitor you selected to be your primary display.</p>

<p>I'm not sure about this behavior being&nbsp;'by design' - I'm thinking it has something to do with&nbsp;the 64-bit machines or Windows 7 (though Ralf_G says it has nothing to do with Windows). &nbsp;My previous setup didn't do this, but my new setup&nbsp;does (which is why
 I found this thread).</p>
<p>My previous setup was two computers, two monitors, NVIDIA GeForce 6800 display adapter,&nbsp;one keyboard, one mouse&nbsp;and a KVM switch. My 'main' computer was a Dell&nbsp;XPS 410 running Windows XP with dual monitors - primary desktop a Dell 1907FP, secondary/extended
 desktop a SyncMaster 175v. My stepchild computer was an older Gateway something, also running XP, configured for only one monitor (the SyncMaster).&nbsp; When the Dell booted, pre-logon stuff was mirrored on both monitors, then the&nbsp;logon screen appeared on the
 primary. I had use of my keyboard through the whole process. When&nbsp;I toggled to the Gateway, keyboard and mouse went with it and it displayed on the&nbsp;secondary monitor.</p>
<p>I recently replaced the Dell with an HP Pavilion p6320y&nbsp;running Windows 7 64-bit (NVIDIA GeForce 9100).&nbsp;Fortunately, when&nbsp;I plugged the cables from the switch&nbsp;into the new HP (nearly) everything still worked as expected (actually - unexpected - I NEVER imagined
 that kind of luck). I reformatted the Dell and that's temporarily the secondary computer; like it's predecessor, it uses the secondary monitor as its&nbsp;single display. Now, however, the HP boots on the secondary monitor only, then switches to the primary for
 logon. This is cool, except I have no keyboard prior to logon. I realized this when I needed to access the HP BIOS and found I had to&nbsp;plug another keyboard in&nbsp;to do it.</p>
<p>I noticed I have fewer&nbsp;Geforce options than with the older software (I can no longer set how and where I want windows to open, etc.). The obvious differences in the setups are that&nbsp;one machine is now running Windows 7, and one machine is now a 64-bit. Don't
 know if this is relative, but the old setup/Dell XPS&nbsp;always showed one or two generic monitors plus the Dell 190 and SyncMaster, whereas the&nbsp;new setup shows the Dell 190 and a generic PnP monitor.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

            I am also having this same problem since setting up dual monitors.<br />
I was originally connecting my 1080p HD TV as a monitor via the VGA cable, which resulted in a nice sharp clear 1920x1080 resolution, superb picture.<br />
<br />
I decided to try dual displays, and dug out my older flatscreen (VGA only, 1600x900).&nbsp; My video card has both VGA and HDMI outputs (its a radeon HD 4650 card).&nbsp;&nbsp; So I tried connecting my main 1080p screen via the HDMI cable, and my old monitor via the VGA.<br />
<br />
Now, overall this is working, just not as good as I understand it should be.&nbsp;&nbsp; The displays are indeed across the two screens, either duplicated or extended as per settings.<br />
<br />
BUT:&nbsp; the HD screen for some reason, while still in 1920x1080 resolution, isn't anywhere near as sharp or clear as when it was via VGA cable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I have noticed during bootup, the BIOS bit displays on both monitors, then when the windows logo first comes
 up, it's only on the 2nd (VGA) screen.&nbsp; When windows finally reaches the 'welcome' screen its back on both.<br />
<br />
Can anyone advise?<br />

<h2>            Surround sound problems</h2>
                    
<p>I have my Xbox &nbsp;sound set on 5.1 through the HDMI to the TV. The TV is connected to my Sony 5.1 home theatre via optical cable and I get perfect surround sound when watching TV or playing games, or I thought I did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playing Just Cause 3 was fine, sounds seemed to come from where I expected them to until I entered a scene with dialogue. it was only the subtitles that gave away that I was being spoken to. I quickly changed to stereo sound as I've seen people mention on
 other forums and then I could hear the speech. Why then, with everything seeming to work in 5.1 mode, does the dialogue fail to play?</p>

<p>You're not alone and no one seems to be addressing this issue.</p>
<p>My 5.1 is connected via optical as well. &nbsp;Only some items I watch does my surround work correctly.</p>
<p>Some shows on netflix work, while others don't and the vocal center channel does not work at all. &nbsp;Same with Apps like the NBC app, nothing ever works for the center channel when set up for 5.1.</p>
<p>It's the Xbox, and personally I'm getting pretty PO'd that it doesn't work properly and it sure doesn't look like Microsoft is going to fix it.</p>

<p>Same here, no fix. I have to connect sound directly to a/v from my cable box to receiver in order to get center channel, no center channel if connected through xbox 1.</p>

    <title>Partitioning for a dual boot &#40;I&#39;m brand new&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Partitioning for a dual boot &#40;I&#39;m brand new&#41;</h2>
                    <p>
So I have a bit of an issue. I'm trying to dual boot linux on my machine which is currently running Windows 10. I made another 70GB primary partition so I could install it there. When I try to install linux there I get an error saying "starting sector number,
 XXXXXXXXX exceeds the msdos-partition-table-imposed maximum of XXXXXXXXX." I tried changing the size of the partition and such but no matter how small I made it I got the same error. I turned to the internet for help but didn't really understand what people
 were saying the problem was. I tried to make the free space a simple volume to see if that would resolve the issue. It wouldn't even let me do that saying I didn't have enough space, but yet again, no matter how low I made the number it still said the same
 thing. Below are some screenshots if anyone is kind enough to check into this for me.</p>

<h2>            Computer program woes</h2>
                    Hey I am have trouble with a program and I am not sure if it is a windows issue or an issue with the program itself. Whenever I try to left-click the program my computer tells me it has stopped working and gives some info along with it that makes no sense
 to me; and when I try "run as an administrator" not to long after I get the message 'ERR09 : Unsupported Function.' I am totally lost on what to do or what it means.

                    I have Windows XP Professional as an operating system.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The computer used to be hooked up to our office network. My wife brought her computer home and to my understanding since the computer wasn't hooked up to that network for several months, there is a security issue that will not allow it to connect to the
 internet. It connect to the router but will not allow us to access the internet.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The computer sat for several months as it was useless not being able to connect to the internet.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We purchased Windows 8 as a solution to overcome this issue as we are not computer people.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The disk drive we are attempting to use is a Sony CDRW drive. It works fine with any disk in there BUT NOT the 32 or 64 bit disks.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The disk just goes in and nothing else, I can load it, can't explore it, nothing. Its like nothing is in there.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be huge, 1) either get connected back or 2) Get the install to work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I wanted to do a 100% erase from boot, but I don't know and am confused about ISO/ ZIP bootdisk stuff with no internet connect.</div>

<p>
</p><p>Google Chromecast is a device that permits you to connect a "smart TV" to the Internet.&nbsp; Are you saying that
<strong>BOTH</strong> the Chromecast device <strong>AND</strong> your computer can't find a wifi signal (or did you mistype and mean to say that running Google Chrome browser on your computer gives you that error)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Device Manager (type device manager in the Search box and press Enter)</p>
<p>Expand the Network adapter section by clicking the arrow to its left</p>
<p>Please provide the full name of each of the entries in the Network adapter section</p>

<p>Double click on each entry; what is shown in the box under "Device status"?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am only asking why there is no ICON (or other indication) indicating wifi is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I stated, my wifes NOOK recognizes the wifi is running and she can use the wifi on the NOOK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't believe telling you the system is an assembled unit (originally Barebones) will help but it uses an&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>The Chromecast warning that I need to activate the wifi is the reason I asked about some visual indicator&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You keep holding back information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So ... your question is why there is no indication on your desktop computer that your wifi is "running."</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, desktop computers don't have wifi adapters (one certainly isn't included in the MS-7312 motherboard).&nbsp; If there's no wifi adapter, there will be no wifi icon.&nbsp; So ... did you install a wifi adapter in the desktop?&nbsp; And if so, is it working properly?&nbsp;
 That's why I asked you to report what was in the Network adapters section of Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any event, if the Nook is connected to the Internet, then your wifi network is running ... unless, of course, the Nook is connecting through another nearby network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chromecast is, of course, a Google product, so technical questions about Chromecast are best directed to
<a href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/3210071?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Google support</a> and not here.&nbsp; However, if you provide the complete text of the error message you're seeing during Chromecast setup, perhaps I or someone else here can interpret it.&nbsp; Most
 likely, there is some security setting on the router that needs to be changed.</p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have a terminology problem.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The router is <strong>not</strong> an adapter.&nbsp; It is a router.&nbsp; It also is a wireless access point.&nbsp; And it also is an Ethernet switch (the 4 "local area network (LAN)" ports on the back of the router).<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Every computer that is to connect to a network must have a network adapter.&nbsp; The adapter can either be an Ethernet adapter (typically shown in Windows as a "Local Area Connection" or a wireless network adapter.&nbsp; Today, almost all laptops have both:&nbsp; that
 is, an Ethernet adapter and a wireless network adapter.&nbsp; Tablets, e-readers, and smart phones usually have&nbsp;only a wireless network adapter.&nbsp; And desktop/towers usually have only an Ethernet adapter, although it's easy to install a wireless network adapter
 in a desktop/tower either as an internal card or as an external USB-connected device.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If your desktop computer is connected by a wire (i.e., an Ethernet cable) to your router, the end of the wire connected to your computer is plugged in to your computer's Ethernet adapter.&nbsp; If you don't have any antennas coming out of the back of your computer
 or you don't have a USB-connected device that says that it is a wireless network adapter, then you don't have a wireless network adapter.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If your desktop computer has only a Ethernet (wired) network adapter, the network icon will look like the icon on the left; if you have a wireless network adapter, you should see the icon on the right:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/770b344b-6cbf-4c56-9f4c-98bec14476a7" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If your desktop computer does not have a wireless network adapter, the "issue" is that it can't tell you
<strong>with an icon</strong> whether or not your wireless router (i.e., your wifi network) is working.&nbsp; If you can access the Internet on the desktop, all that tells you is that the rest of your router (the router part and the network switch part) is working
 properly. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On the other hand, because your desktop is connected to your router, you can log into the router's configuration utility which will, among many other things, let you know if the wireless access point portion of the router is turned on (you know it is, however,
 because the Nook can connect to it).&nbsp; You also can determine whether the router's wifi system is working by looking at the "wireless" LED on the front of the router; it should be solid blue.&nbsp; Note that there is a button on the back of your router that turns
 the wifi on and off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From any computer connected to the router, you can open a browser and go to http://www.routerlogin.net or http://www.routerlogin.com (or simply go to the router's local IP address, which by default is 192.168.1.1 or you can find it as the "Default Gateway"
 if you do the ipconfig command that I described earlier).&nbsp; At that point you have to log into the router's configuration utility.&nbsp; For your router, the User name is "user" (without quotes) and the password is "password" (without quotes) unless you have changed
 these values.&nbsp; This information should conveniently be printed on the back of your router, just above the USB port (which is only to be used to connect an external storage device; do not connect computers, USB modems, CD drives, or DVD drives to the router
 USB port).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not already familiar with your router's configuration utility, the User's Guide should be available on the CD that came with the router or you can download it here --&gt;

http://www.downloads.netgear.com/files/GDC/WNR3500LV2/WNR3500Lv2_UM_8Sep11.pdf</a>&nbsp; I expect that Google support will tell you to do things that involve using your router's configuration utility.</p>

                    I have been getting calls for the past two years from A "Windows Tech" claiming I have a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>SERIOUS VIRUS </strong></span>in the computer. When I ask how did they get my number or how do you know I have a computer they hang up. Today they left a phone number on my
<strong>caller ID </strong>but when I called it I was told by&nbsp; a&nbsp;voice simulated&nbsp;operator that the number is not in use. I know it's a scam. Can this be reported? The number is

<h2>            BitLocker deactivates and corrupts user profile - Win7Enterprise x64</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've recently experienced that some user profiles for some reason gets corrupted and in turn corrupts Outlook.
<br />
The error comes when trying to open an email. Outlook says it has encounted a problem and needs to shut down.
</p>
<p>I've noticed there's a warning sign next to the system disk (C:) and I have to right click and&nbsp;reactivate BitLocker on the system disk.
</p>
<p>My solution to getting Outlook to work again (after enabling BitLocker) is to delete the Default Outlook User Profile and rename the Outlook folder in C:\users\user name\AppData\Local\Microsoft to e.g. "Outlook-old"</p>
<p>Then start Outlook again and define a new user profile. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any idea what causes BL to deactivate? The event log does not give any clear answer on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>morradi</p>

    <title>should i delete partitions before installing windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulask  say:</h3>
<h2>            should i delete partitions before installing windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I am installing Windows 7 on a Dell Insprion 1505 which previously ran Windows XP Media Center</p>
<p><br />
I was going through the instructions on TweakHound for a clean install of Windows 7.
</p>
<p><br />
1 - Boot up from the Windows 7 installation disc.<br />
2 - Choose Repair your computer.<br />
3 - In the System Recovery Options screen, choose Use recovery tools... and click Next.<br />
4 - Open the Command Prompt.<br />
5 - Type diskpart and hit Enter.<br />
6 - Type list disk . Find the disk you wish to install Windows 7 on. If you only have one disk then it will show as disk 0. If you have multiple disks find the drive you wish to install 7 on.<br />
7 - Type select disk 0 (or use the number of the disk you wish to install Windows 7 on)(note - that is a zero)<br />
8 - Type list partition. There shouldn't be any.<br />
9 - Type create partition primary.<br />
10- Type select partition 1.<br />
11- Type active.<br />
12- Type format quick.<br />
13- When finished reboot and begin your installation.<br />
<br />
I got to step 8 and when I did a "list partition" there are 4 partitions on my machine.
<br />
Partition 1 - OEM 47MB<br />
Partition 2 - Primary 51GB<br />
Partition 3 - Primary 17GB<br />
Partition 4 - Primary 4753MB<br />
<br />
Where do I go from here? Do I use the current configuration? Delete partitions (if I do that how do I do that?) Which partitions to keep?<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />
Paula </p>

            <p>Your hard drive is small, and by the time that you have installed Windows 7, updates, av solution, applications and whatever else you like to have, there will not be much space left&nbsp; for further updates, pagefile etc.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Windows 7 installation process will ask where you&nbsp;want to install, and should also give you the option to delete partitions and start with a fresh new partition. Assuming that there is nothing on any of the partitions apart from Windows Media Centre,
 delete them all and then create one large partition.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What type of installation disk do you have? Upgrade, OEM or full retail?</p>
<p>If you have OEM or full retail, consider replacing the drive now and start fresh..

            I would keep Partition 1 which is the OEM Partition<br />
<br />
I am not in front of your computer, so I don't know whats on partition 2 and 3, I assume partition 2 would be system partition where Windows is normally installed due to its large size, so that would be safe to delete.<br />
<br />
I am not sure about partitions 3 and 4, since those could be recovery partitions that stores installation files in case you need to reinstall Windows XP Media Center.<br />
<br />
If you are able to boot into Windows XP, I suggest you do so and check before deleting them. You can delete partitions during Windows 7 setup by doing the following instead of using the method on TweakHound:<br />
<br />
Boot from the Windows 7 DVD<br />
Click Install Now<br />
Accept License Agreement<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)<br />
Click Drive Options<br />
Select the drive/s click Delete<br />
Click New<br />
Click Apply<br />
Click OK<br />
Click Format and click Next to proceed with the installation<br />
<br />

<h2>            Skype 8.34 Unexpectedly Quits on Macbook Pro 10.13.6</h2>
                    I've tried the permission suggestion, a new user, uninstall and re-install, deleting Skype files, etc. and nothing works.&nbsp; I did download the preview version of Skype and it works but I can't use the full version.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any additional
 advice.

<p>Thanks Joseph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It still crashes when I launch Skype.&nbsp; It creates a new <strong>Skype for Desktop
</strong>folder whenever I launch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if the preview version has all the features and capabilities of desktop version, I'm fine just to use that one.</p>

<p>Hello James, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We appreciate your patience on this. Kindly wait for the next update with v8.37.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Skype Preview works for you, be assured that it has the same functions as with your current version. In fact, there are other features that you'll be able to enjoy firsthand with it.
</p>
<p>

<br />
If you are using Windows 8.1, The default version of Internet Explorer is Internet Explorer 11. You will not be able to install Internet Explorer 10 in Windows 8.1. I would suggest you to reset Internet Explorer settings and then try the steps from the above
 links and see if that helps.<br />

                    <p>I am trying to install the software to allow access to a printer connected by USB to my DLINK DIR-655 Router. &nbsp; I get a message that the publisher has been blocked. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The certificate on the software (latest version from DLink Website) expired in Sept 2015. &nbsp; I expect this is the problem but the router is old enough I doubt a new version will be put out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen posts on IE but I do not use IE and their are no blocked publishers.</p>
<p>I have seen posts on running as an admin but It just comes up with another blocked warnging</p>
<p>I have seen posts on running from an administrator cmd prompt but I still get the same error.</p>
<p>I have turned UAC completely off but that does not seem to do anything.</p>
