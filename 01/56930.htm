<h2>            Windows 10 Install from XP - Invalid Partition Table</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft<br />
<br />
I have purchased Windows 10 Home&nbsp; installation USB from your microsoft store on USB stick
<br />
I have followed your instructions, which are<br />
<br />
1) Insert USB in device port<br />
2) Power on computer and boot from USB<br />
But I&nbsp; do not get as far as step 3 enter product key {never mind- step 4 the "Relax" part)<br />
<br />
As you can see from this image:<br />
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C8ueTFpXcAAa2Ks.jpg<br />
<br />
I get the error : Invalid Partition Table<br />
<br />
I can escape from this by using crtl+alt+del and the PC will boot XP from HardDisk as normal<br />
The USB key looks fine, you can see it listed at the top of the iamge<br />
From Windows, I can see its got folders x86 and x64 and boot.<br />
<br />
<br />
My current system is Windows XP running on a Gygabyte motherboard<br />
<br />
G:\&gt;wmic baseboard get product,Manufacturer,version,serialnumber<br />
Manufacturer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Product&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SerialNumber&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version<br />
Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.&nbsp; M57SLI-S4&nbsp; Mon Jan 01 00:03:02 2007&nbsp; x.x<br />
<br />
<br />
What am step am I missing here?<br />
Is this USB drive fit for purpose?<br />
<br />
I see lots of questions similar to this on the internet and in the MS support forums,<br />
but I do not understand why this&nbsp; USB stick&nbsp; which I can read from my Windows XP<br />
won't do the job it is supposed to do , which is allow my PC to boot from it<br />
and then install windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Support and explanations for these questions would be much appreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Fionn</p>

            <p>That's okay. I've been at this for a long time. I know the difference between something that really works - now and for the future - and something that 'sounds right' and might start off looking good, but then causes no end of trouble shortly thereafter,
 or during the next week, the next month or with the next upgrade.</p>

<p>Issue still not solved, but I might as well put in an update.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found another PC with Windows XP on it<br />
And I was able to load the Windows 10 installer on it.<br />
I pressed "esc" to abort the process as it was not ready to upgrade , yet.<br />
<br />
This other PC is&nbsp; different from the one I am trying to upgrade:<br />
&nbsp; - It has a different motherboard, different boot menu,<br />
&nbsp; - has a single SATA hard drive, <br />
&nbsp; - ... and a sticker on the front saying Vista-Ready (don't laugh).<br />
But it is still an old PC, probably 8 years old hardware. <br />
<br />
I can conclude from this exercise :<br />
&nbsp;1) that the Windows 10 installer USB does work. <br />
&nbsp;2) The presence of XP as OS on disk is not a blocker to upgrading to Windows 10<br />
<br />
I was concerned 1) would be false - I am glad it is true <br />
I had already believed item 2) was true as it is the motherboard , not the OS, that loads boot software,<br />
and which is why I was dismayed with the answer from BullDogXX above.<br />
<br />
Getting back to the PC that I want to upgrade...<br />
<br />
I could presume there is a problem with my Motherboard's bootloader, or its firmware
<br />
<br />
<br />
I have tried copying the installer onto another USB stick, but that did not work either ( same error).<br />
I made a ISO using Nero software of the USB contents.<br />
I have NOT tried burning a DVD, since the ISO seems too big </p>
<p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>The solution ...........<br />
<br />
Things used:<br />
1) Nero CD burner<br />
2) Rufus ( to create bootable USB flash drive)<br />
3) 8 GB USB stick or bigger.&nbsp;<br />
4) time &amp; patience<br />
<br />
Some things I learned:<br />
1) Windows isntaller did NOT ask if I wanted x86 or x64 install;<br />
it chose x64 as far as I can tell ( I have two sets of Program Files folders).<br />
2) I thought it would wipe out the existing C: drive partition, it did not.&nbsp;<br />
It copied old windows install to windows.old And I can get at my old folders.<br />
3) The crucial factor that got me over the hill was the&nbsp;<br />
"Hard Disk Boot Priority" not the the list of boot &nbsp;devices.<br />
4) The orginal USB I purchased from MS was FAT32 but the install I made was NTFS.<br />
<br />
On another motherboard, choosing F12 to alter the boot device to USB would work,<br />
but for my Gigabyte motherboard, using this method did not work.<br />
I definitely had to create my own USB install.<br />
<br />
As I had multiple partitions, setting the boot priority made a differnce<br />
Setting to boot from USB with F12 as advised by several other webpages, but did not work.<br />
In fact the boot sequence ignored my new USB drive, which was a different "failure"&nbsp;<br />
from stopping &nbsp;because of "Invalid partition table"<br />
But this is an issue with my motherboard.<br />
<br />
Once I had the boot priority correct, then in the place where I previously saw<br />
"Invalid Partition table"<br />
I now saw:<br />
"Press Any Key to boot from USB .."<br />
<br />
<br />
....<br />
so how did I get there???<br />
<br />
<br />
First, since a lot of the tasks with Nero &amp; Rufus were time consuming I disabled timeouts on my display.<br />
Normally my display locks after 10 minutes of inactivity. I disabled that in case it had an adverse&nbsp;<br />
effect on the following steps<br />
<br />
(note, some names of files and/or folders are examples)<br />
<br />
STEPS on XP :<br />
<br />
1) copy contents of offical Windows 10 Install USB to PC. C:\Win10-USB-Backup<br />
<br />
2) Use Nero CD burner Create iso file on PC from those contents&nbsp;<br />
and put the iso file in a separate folder. C:\Win10-ISO\mywin10install.iso<br />
Creating the iso file took a while (cannot recall how long)<br />
<br />
3) Insert blank USB drive&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;Use Rufus to create a bootable USB from the iso created above.<br />
This step took over 4 HOURS on my PC!!<br />
Rufus settings:<br />
&nbsp;First choose the iso, then,&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;USE NTFS (not FAT32 )<br />
&nbsp;MBR scheme for both BIOS and UEFI-CSM,&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;check/tick all the format options.<br />
and let it run......<br />
<br />
<br />
4) Backup PC.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
5) Pull out any unnessary periferals from PC, except for your install USB, and reboot.<br />
<br />
Choose &lt;del&gt; to get into Boot software.&nbsp;<br />
Select Advanced BIOS features.<br />
<br />
- alter boot sequence to boot from USB using PageUp/PageDown to promote USB.<br />
<br />
See images here as examples....<br />
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DBkWZlBXcAAPNPU.jpg &nbsp;<br />
BIOS &nbsp;set Hard Disk Boot Priority<br />
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DBkWqlZWsAA_v35.jpg set boot priority screen as it look after install<br />
Try to imagine USB at top.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
SAVE &amp; EXIT BIOS and hopefully you will get to boot from USB....<br />
<br />
&nbsp;= = = = = = = =<br />
<br />
Install notes...<br />
I1) When creating users for Windows 10, you are always first offered the use Microsoft account,<br />
you can skip that, &nbsp;and just creat a new account for PC.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I2) The installation of Windows 10 took 49 minutes. Possible that was partly due to USB 2.0.<br />
The setting up of Windows, downloading Office, installing browsers, configurating; installing old software<br />
(screen drivers, printers , CD burner) can take several hours.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I3) If moving from XP, which is 32bit , to an x64 OS then try to get x64 bit versions of the software you like.<br />
Although you might have downloads already for XP, they are probably not good enough any more.<br />
Old CDs with XP software will be no good, and in soem cases you will have to buy a new license.<br />
<br />
I4) Pretty soon Windows will realise that it needs to install updates&nbsp;<br />
( if you have old disk, (not solid-state) then you will hear a familiar churn )<br />
Get thsoe updates! and keep windows 10 up to date.&nbsp;<br />
I have seen people who avoid updates getting into problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
I5) It is good to have a Microsoft Live login, but remember that it is not mandatory for install of Win10!<br />
<br />

<br />
notes on&nbsp;<br />
4 ) Backup PC.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;a) Make a list of all currently installed software and useful drivers&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; ( screen , printers, and other periphal devices on your PC),<br />
and make sure you can get them again.<br />
&nbsp;b)Save your &nbsp;browser profiles/ bookmarks / logins &amp; passwords etc.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;c) Clean up &nbsp;C drive - maybe use CCleaner , if you have superfluous documents and they are backed up, &nbsp;then delete them.

            Hi Stewart.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you want to suggest this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback and may interact with you. But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br /> 
<br />If they replace Snipping Tool someone may create a replacement to install, just as they did with 8 Gadgets I'm still using in WIndows 10, and WIndows 7 Games for WIndows 10.  We'll just need to watch for it.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello Barry
<br />My name is Ben

<br />I hope to help.
<br />
<br />	Many updates require restarting the device. Save your work and close all open applications.
<br />
<br />	Next, select the Start button, go to Start / Shutdown, and select Update and restart or Update and shutdown.
<br />
<br />	This could solve the audio problems automatically.
<br />
<br />	Now, to run the problem solver, select the Start button, type the audio problem solver, select Find and solve audio playback problems in the results list, and then choose Next.
<br />
<br />       You should also check the Device Manager to verify if the audio driver is disabled, or not available for this update. Try these steps:
<br />
<br />• Select the Start button, type Device Manager and then select Device Manager in the results list. In Sound, video and game controllers, select the sound card, open it, select the Driver tab and then Update driver. If Windows does not find a new driver, look for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow its instructions.
<br />
<br />• If that does not work, try the following:
<br />
<br />• Uninstall the audio driver: open Device Manager, right-click (or press and hold) on the audio driver and then select Uninstall. Restart the device and Windows will try to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />	And, if that does not work, try using the generic Windows audio driver. This is the way to do it:
<br />
<br />• Open Device Manager, right-click (or press and hold) on your audio driver&gt; Update driver&gt; Search for driver software on your computer&gt; Let me choose from a list of device drivers on my computer, select Device from High definition audio, then Next and follow the instructions to install it.

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10, your device is always kept up to date with the latest features and fixes. Windows Updates are installed automatically, with no need to select which updates are needed or not needed. In rare cases, a specific update might temporarily cause
 issues with your device, and in this case you will need a way to prevent the problematic update from reinstalling automatically the next time Windows Updates are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To know more about how to temporarily prevent a Windows Update from reinstalling in Windows 10, check this

<p>
</p><p>Do update us with the result.</p>

<p>Hi Julie,<br />
</p>
<p>I have used the wushowhide.diagcab utility to successfully block the 1607 and 1703 versions of the creators update, but this utility does not offer the option of blocking the Fall Creators version.&nbsp; I just followed the link you provided and the "Show or
 hide updates" troubleshooter package did not list the Fall Creators Update.&nbsp; Is an newer version available or is there another method for blocking the update until MS can correct the issue?&nbsp; My system is in an infinite loop of downloading/installing the update
 and recovering back to version1511.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>The Windows 10 Fall Creators Update includes features and updates necessary for your computer to function properly. This also includes necessary updates for Windows Defender to keep your computer safe online and offline. Can you tell us why would you like
 to block the updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most well-known reason for failed updates are third-party antivirus programs that cause issues in downloading/installing necessary updates for your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>None of the Creators updates have worked on my system.&nbsp; They all indicate that my system is fully compatible, they install successfully and then fail during the reboot.&nbsp; I am prompted to select my keyboard layout and then choose Startup Repair or shutdown.&nbsp;
 After restarting my PC, it has reverted back to version 1511.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent many many hours on the phone with MS support trying to install the 1607 update and then many many more hours with them trying to install version 1703.&nbsp; In both cases, after they have exhausted all of their knowledge, they magically just disappeared
 into the ether without so much as a "Sorry" of "Good bye".&nbsp; Blocking the updates has been my only solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to discuss the Fall Creators update with MS support via phone two different days, but after they called back, I was left on hold for over two hour each time and had to give up.&nbsp; I can't select the chat method because the Fall Creators update will
 install and reboot my system during that effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have researched this issue online and have stripped my system down to the bones, ran DISM and sfc many times, ran the windows update repair utility, cloned my SSD back to a hard drive, tried installing from an ISO image, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;The last clues that I have
 found are the online messages that indicate MS is aware of issues with Asus motherboards (which I have) and are working on a solution.&nbsp; The inability to block this update until the issue is resolved, has rendered my system nearly useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am all ears if you can offer additional information of diagnostics procedures.</p>

<p>If you really wish to block updates in Windows 10, what we can offer you is to defer upgrades. When you defer upgrades, new Windows features won’t be downloaded or installed for several months. Deferring upgrades doesn’t affect security updates, but it does
 prevent you from getting the latest Windows features as soon as they're available. Note that if your PC is managed by an organization, you may not be able to defer upgrades. Or you can just use metered connection so that certain Windows Updates will not be
 able to install or download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps in deferring upgrades in Windows 10 are found on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026834/windows-10-defer-upgrades" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link.</a></strong></p>

<p>Julie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already had the defer upgrades box checked.&nbsp; It doesn't stop the Fall Creators update.&nbsp; My system just went through another install/reboot/fail/recover cycle.&nbsp; I truly do not want to block the Creators updates, but they just don't work and are rendering
 my system nearly useless..&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I do need further assistance to determine the cause and find a solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Creators update installed on my laptop successfully, but broke&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">every</span> Microsoft app on the machine.&nbsp; My mother had just sent it to me.&nbsp; I rolled it back and no sooner than it rebooted, it began installing it
 again.&nbsp; The only solution I had was to go to the services.msc and disable updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read an article that Microsoft urged users to roll back the update if it caused problems.&nbsp; The biggest questions I have:&nbsp; Why did this make it out of quality control?&nbsp; Why do we no longer have any control over our operating system?</p>

<p>I&nbsp;spent 6 hours reformatting my hard drive back to 1607 yesterday only to have the Fall Creators Edition force itself upon my PC again this morning. I had to roll it back, again, because it messed up my sound drivers (again), added a bunch of bloatware (again),
 and jacked up my start menu icons (again, all blank squares). I'm not sure what is going on at Microsoft but I seriously don't want all this crap on my PC. I have no use for any of the 3D, virtual&nbsp;reality, store, Cortana, xBox, OneDrive, Skype, Edge, Connect
 (that doesn't work anyway), People, Messaging, it does NOT need to connect to my cell phone, Mail/Calendar,&nbsp;can't reduce size of calculator (really? Microsoft had to mess with the calculator sizing?), and I could go on. Cannot get junk shortcuts off start
 menu or combine like items, and for some reason I'm evidently too stupid to know the alphabet because I have to look at&nbsp;letter headings between&nbsp;the programs. If I needed the crap Windows kept putting on my $1700&nbsp;laptop I would put it on. This whole Win10 OS
 is junk. </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is a service, which means it gets better through periodic software updates. It is possible that there has been a conflict with the software during the upgrade that's why you're experiencing issues with some of the applications. With that, we highly
 recommend that you perform a clean install. To do so, you may follow the steps provided by
<strong>Andre Da Costa</strong> in this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install-insiderplat_pc/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">Forum Article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Note: Make sure that you back up your files first before performing a clean install.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, please don't hesitate to post back.</p>

<p>Julie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to let you know that a clean install has allowed the Fall Creators update to boot up.&nbsp; It is insane to expect people to go through what I just did in order to install an update into a previously working system.&nbsp; There has to be a better way for
 MS to identify the compatibility issues that prevent an update from installing.&nbsp; It would be way more acceptable to have to remove one offending application or driver than to spend days reinstalling a complete system and its applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help,</p>

<h2>            &#34;People You May Know&#34; is a Ridiculous Violation of Privacy</h2>
                    <p>How can I make it so my contacts do not appear in others "people you may know" section? If this isn't possible, please let the developers know this is a complaint, and a request for a feature such as "disable my contacts from appearing in other peoples'
 "people you may know section".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This feature is ridiculous, as anyone in your contacts can see anyone in your contacts, this means:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Your family members could see the friend you're not supposed to be talking to</li><li>Your wife/gf could see another girl you're not supposed to be talking to</li><li>Competing business contacts could see you're working with both of them</li><li>Clients could see they're all clients of you</li><li>Family members could see you talking to that family member that has been ostracized</li><li>Significant other could see the mistress you've been talking to</li><li>Family members could see the friends, lovers, types of people you've been talking to</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>This is like your phone broadcasting all the people that you text or call to all of the members of your address book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is such a ridiculous violation of privacy by Skype. I am in shock they would do this with a piece of software that is used for such personal conversations.</p>

    <title>Can Windows Live Mail be used with Windows XP or Windows 98&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beowulf1954  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can Windows Live Mail be used with Windows XP or Windows 98&#63;</h2>
                    My aunt has a laptop which used to have Outlook Express on it but it became corrupt and some 'computer expert' removed it and set her up with a web based account which she accesses God knows how to be honest. I would like to get her back to using a decent
 email program as at least then I could maybe answer her questions. I can't remember if she is on Windows 98 or Windows XP but the laptop is about 7 years old. Is it possible to use Windows Live Mail with either 98 or XP, or can it only be used with Windows
 7? If that can't be used is it still possible to get a copy of Outlook Express anywhere?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Base on the system requirements provided by Microsoft if you are using XP it should be
<span>Windows&nbsp;XP</span> with Service Pack 2 (32-bit edition only) provided with a processor of&nbsp;800 MHz or higher and a memory 256 MB or more recommended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Essential would work fine in XP if your system meet all the requirements needed.</p>

<h2>            How can I change my desktop appearance when the normal process won&#39;t work&#63;</h2>
                    I've tried to change my desktop appearance for awhile now. Only one photograph shows all of the time. It used to shuffle but hasn't for a few weeks. I have uploaded a new set of photos that I would like to see rotate through but can't seem to get off this
 one photograph.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Was there any recent changes made on your computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What&nbsp;is the version of Windows 7?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>Change desktop background after deleting slideshow.ini</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;Open the Windows Explorer (Windows key + E)<br />
b)&nbsp;Enter %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Themes\ into the address bar. If this does not work for you simply go to C:\Users\[yourusername]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Themes</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;There will be a file called slideshow.ini in there as well as another file called TranscodedWallpaper.jpg. If the files do not currently exist, create them.<br />
d)&nbsp;Open slideshow.ini; remove the text inside it and save the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, the slideshow.ini can be corrupted, so you might want to delete the file slideshow.ini and create a text file with the extension .ini instead of .txt.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p><br />
You may check if you face the same issue in different user account or new administrator account.&nbsp; You may create a new user account on your computer and then check.</p>
<p>Create a new user account-<br />

<p>Oops. I know what happened.</p>
<p>I am a FREAK about behind the scenes stuff being sent over my Internet connection, so I went into the "Turn Windows Features On or Off" function and turned off Media Center and other stuff that I don't use. I guess I turned off the Fax capability too. I
 just went in and restored it though. Now I will try to see how it works.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h3> spinecho  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 0xc000000e with Windows 8.1 Preview to Windows 8.1 Release upgrade</h2>
                    Hello All
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance for reading.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am currently on the 8.1 Preview (Pro with media center) having successfully upgraded to this from 8. 8 was an upgrade from 7 on the initial upgrade offer that came out from MS. I have the Windows 8 discs.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is running on a bootcamp partition of a Late 2009 27" Imac.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have not had any problems until now.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I understood that I would lose my applications and need to re install if I tried out the preview.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I initiated the download from the windows store (following one of the links available as it didn't show directly in the store) everything seems to go fine, the install appears to run in the background and you get to the point where the installer asks
 to reboot the machine. This works fine but then the following comes up after the reboot:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8235ad88-1389-44b1-a0d0-1e75572ef4e7" /></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The error is 0xc000000e.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I try the first two options (enter and f8) the screen just flickers.</div>
<div>The final option f9 boots the machine back to the preview version and I get.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3a84d4c2-8457-4eef-b0da-75759abe622d" />&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I thought about trying a refresh however when tried through the PC settings in windows it states I don't have a recovery partition and suggests trying the install media.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I tried a refresh from the Win 8 Install DVD I get an error telling me the Refresh was not possible. Sorry forgot to get a screen grab of that.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I unplugged all additional usb devices during the above.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone suggest a next step.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was thinking of running a fresh install of windows 8 without formatting the C drive. The Installer comes up with a message saying all old items will be copied to a windows.old directory. Would I be correct in that all my folders etc would remain if I
 done this. I would just lose installed programs etc but my file (music,photo's, downloads etc should be intact.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for reading.</div>
                </div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I dug around a bit and discovered that the above type of error at install may come from software that integrates itself into the OS when installed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As I was upgrading from the Preview and was going to need to reinstall everything anyway I just started uninstalling all non Microsoft software that was installed on my computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After getting rid of everything I restarted the install and hey presto a few hours later I am updating my post from my new 8.1 Install.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I think the program that probably made the difference was bitdefender. Some one on another forum uninstalled a different firewall and that helped them. however I also uninstalled lots of other things so any one or combination may have made the difference.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I had things like Nero, PowerDVD, DAP, DVDfab, HTFS driver, &nbsp;Copernic etc installed and some of these are drivers which may have had something to do with the problem. As I said uninstalling the lot done the trick.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope this helps others out there.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to run Startup repair from Advance boot option.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>It may ask you to insert the Installation DVD/USB while doing startup repair.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you don’t have an installation media, you have to create an installation media for that.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may download an ISO from the below link:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once your media is ready follow the steps.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>After you boot your computer using Windows 10 CD/ DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD". Press any key.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select the correct time and Keyboard type. </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on Repair your computer in the lower left corner.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<span>Click on Advanced options in Troubleshoot screen.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on&nbsp;Startup Repair from Advanced Options screen.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Next, choose the operating system by clicking on its button.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Windows 10 will look for problems on hard drive(s) and verify that all required files are intact.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</span></p>

            <p>Wow,&nbsp;that's complicated</p><p><br /></p>
<p>I'm not sure.. But I would try to contact epic games</p>
<p>I don't think Xbox support can refund digital currencies. Might be the job of the company who&nbsp;owns the game..</p><p><br /></p>
<p>But you should at least&nbsp;contact the&nbsp;support directly. Xbox or Epic Games.</p><p>Chat, phone or e-mail.. something like that.</p><p>People in this forum are not "powerful"&nbsp;enough&nbsp;to solve this problem.</p>
<p>But maybe&nbsp;the official support could refund you.</p><p><br /></p>

<h2>            Error 1935 &#40;HRESULT&#58; 0x8007054F&#41; trying to install software</h2>
                    
<p>I recently bought a new laptop with Windows 7 installed, and am trying to install some of the programs I had on my old computer. Everything installed fine except for 2 programs - Logitech StreamPoint and H&amp;R Block At Home tax software. These both use the
 InstallShield Installer, and near the very end of the installation an error pops up:</p>
<p>Error 1935. An error occurred during the installation of assembly component {844EFBA7-1C24-93B2-A01F-C8B3B9A1E18E}. HRESULT: 0x8007054F.</p>
<p>When I click OK on the error, the installation rolls back. I have tried every solution I can possibly find on the internet, other than re-installing Windows 7. Many of the forums say it is a corrupted .NET install, and to un-install and re-install .NET,
 but Windows 7 has .NET 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 as part of the operating system, so I can't un-install those. I have .NET 4.0 installed, and tried un-installing and re-installing that, but it didn't fix anything. I have tried clean booting and installing, but that
 doesn't work either. Other solutions say to run sfc /scannow, but when I run that, it says there is a system repair pending. No matter how many times I reboot, that message always appears. I tried deleting the pending.xml file at C:\WINDOWS\WinSxS, which got
 rid of the sfc error, but managed to completely screw up the computer and I barely got it back with a System Repair disk.</p>
<p>Is there anything else I can try? At this point I can't waste too much more time and may have to give in and re-install the operating system.</p>

<p>Hopefully this is not an example of trying to run 16 bit installation programs on a 64 bit Windows version as that will<em> never</em> work unless you install&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Windows
 Virtual PC</strong></a> (aka XP Mode) (for Windows Professional, Ultimate and Enterprize) or an emmulator like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dosbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>DosBox</strong></a> to handle the 16 bit subsytem
 for Windows Home versions.</p>
<p>With luck, this may simply be insufficient permissions to handle .DLL replacement and registry writing during installation. First uninstall and/or delete any remnants of the partially installed programs. Put your program disk into the computer but when the
 installation program starts, immediately<strong> Cancel</strong> it. Using<em> Explorer</em>, locate the installation application (e.g.<em> setup.exe?</em>) and right click it. Select<strong>
 Run as Administrator</strong> from the menu and proceed through the installation normally. Since your previous attempts always crashed at the end of the installation cycle, there is a good chance that the<em> elevated permissions</em>
 will be sufficient to complete it.</p>

<blockquote>I am using an Administrator account, but I tried again using "Run as Administrator" just to make sure - same error. Any more ideas?</blockquote>
<p>The<em> Run as Administrator</em> command does grant<em> Elevated Permissions</em> compared to an<em> Administrator</em> account. These are particulary useful when dealing with the registry
 or system objects.</p>
<blockquote>Any more ideas?</blockquote>
<p>At this point, I can only suggest restarting into a<em> Clean Boot</em> to remove any other programs as a conflict. Once you've booted up into a clean environment, I would still use the<em> Run as Administrator</em>
 command option to run the setup program.</p>

            As of Sept. 24th 2012 - this problem still persists. I have seen on the net discussions related to -<br />
<br />
01. Windows Installer not updated to the latest<br />
02. While Installing - Transaction Log got corrupted<br />
03. Dot net framework not updated<br />
<br />
Since 01 and 03 were not our case, we followed the solution related to 02.<br />
<br />
Observation is - for a machine where the product was not installed with earlier version - this method of solution works fine.
<br />
<br />
Question remains - Why should the "Installation Transaction Log" get corrupted ??<br />
<br />
And, on another machine, where there was an earlier version installed, even after uninstalling and removing all traces of the product of earlier version - did not allow to install and gives the same error message.<br />
<br />
Why the earlier version of the same product does not have this issue ?<br />
<br />
Why the new version ( we are the producer of the product) corrupts the transaction Log ? - We are using the same machine for creating setups with Install Shield 2009.<br />
<br />
Any advice will be highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            0x8007054F&nbsp;stands for ERROR_INTERNAL_ERROR which isn't much help except saying the error is unexpected by the installer.
<div><br />
<div>The component in the log that throws the error out is identified as {844EFBA7-1C24-93B2-A01F-C8B3B9A1E18E}, which is&nbsp;<span>Microsoft.VC80.CRT. Good news is this component is well-known, you can get more information by downloading Visual C++ 2005 redistributable
 and run it in verbose logging mode.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>See&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2007/02/07/update-regarding-silent-install-of-the-vc-8-0-runtime-vcredist-packages.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2007/02/07/update-regarding-silent-install-of-the-vc-8-0-runtime-vcredist-packages.aspx</a>&nbsp;for
 instructions, but append the command line with&nbsp;/l*v %temp%\vcredist_x86.log" to enable verbose logging. After collecting the logs you can share it on the internet and post the link back.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you get the error with other component too (not limited to the one identified by the thread starter) then the issue is most likely to the Windows Installer engine, like crashed Installer or power loss caused registry keys under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\COMPONENTS
 to be in&nbsp;<span>inconsistent</span>&nbsp;state.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Unable to download Windows Essential</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Community.&nbsp; I am hoping that some can help me with this little issue I am having (Unable to download Windows Essential).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently did a reinstall of Windows 7 on my computer.&nbsp; Reason was that the upgrade in Windows 10 crashed the computer, wanted a password that I never happen.&nbsp; So I reinstall Windows 7 and had old Windows files that I had disk cleanup remove.&nbsp; So I thinking
 that maybe by removing old Windows files may have corrupted the system (no sure).&nbsp; So when I went to install Windows Essentials, I started running into problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seem lots of suggestions on this issue here in the community, but none of it seems to work.&nbsp; In the last 4 days I have been tried number of times to download Windows Essential from: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/essentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the number of times I have failed, I have gotten these errors:&nbsp; 0x80070643 source: soxe.definitions,
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa9fc197-087e-4532-a1e4-107d1967f10c" /></p>

<p>
</p><p>Also have gotten: another program is preventing Windows Essentials from installing; It looks like program is preventing the Installer from working. (Checked Windows Installer and it is working)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking System Update Readiness.<br />
Binary Version 6.1.7601.22471<br />

<p>
</p><p>also DISM which is a large file, but don't understand it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also done a error-checking on my local C drive and it did not find any error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time I tried to download Windows Essentials, I checked the: Programs&nbsp;File&nbsp;(x86) and there was a folder with "Windows Live" with a file for "Installer" with nothing in it.&nbsp; I deleted the folder and kept trying to reinstall Windows Essentials and kept
 getting the error codes</p>
<p>above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm hoping I can get help here.</p>

 certain to get a higher score than a 128-MB card.</div>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 happens when you try to play in compatibility mode?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you get any error message?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>With
 which version of Windows did you try to play the game in compatibility mode?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have not tried with Windows 98, then check that.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the exe file for the game.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 properties.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Check
 the box”Run in Compatibility mode”</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>From
 the drop down select Windows 98.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Apply and click ok.</span></p>

<p><span>If that does not help, you may have to contact the game manufacturer to check if there are any updates.</span></p>

<h3> km maniak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pausa de descargas activas</h2>
                    
<p>Que tal, ¿alguien sabe de alguna forma para que mis descargas activas dejen de pausarse mientras estoy jugando?, no me molestaria si solo ocurriera cuando juego en linea, de esa forma tendria algo de sentido, pero incluso mientras juego la campaña de algun
 juego las descargas se pausan, ¿es posible hacer que esto deje de pasar? ¿o es que solo puedo descargar cosas mientras veo el dashboard como idiota sin hacer nada?</p>
