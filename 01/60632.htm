<h2>            Black screen after Windows &#34;splash screen&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>My computer is pretty old, an HP Pavillion Desktop about 10 years old, but has been kept fairly current with upgrades and some new RAM, has&nbsp;been working great, just maybe not the fastest CPU on the block.&nbsp; I left the room yesterday with it working perfectly,
 came back to an unresponsive computer.&nbsp; I tried to reboot, but after the Windows splash screen, the one with the little blue bar moving from left to right under it, it changes to a blank, black screen, no cursor, no response.&nbsp; I have to unplug the tower to
 even try to reboot it.&nbsp; It will, however, boot OK in safe mode, I even defragged it in safe mode hoping that would help.&nbsp; I've tried the "Last Known Good" option, no better.&nbsp; Right after it happened, it booted all the way to the desktop two or three times,
 but then while it was still loading items that run in the taskbar, it went black.&nbsp; Also, after I let it sit all night unplugged (thinking it might be the power supply unit), after the first splash screen it displayed a screen of random colored lines, and then
 froze.&nbsp; That has happened a couple of times.</p>
<p>We've been having some "brown outs" in my area lately, lights dimming for a few seconds, that kind of thing.&nbsp; I suspect it might have damaged something, or spiked my hard drive, but I'm not sure. It's so old, I don't remember if I even had an XP recovery
 disc, I do have a SP3 upgrade disk.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

<p>If it boots into Safe Mode, then likely a driver is the issue, if you have restore points try one of those</p>

<p>Well,&nbsp;after reading a lot of other posters with similar problems, I decided it was probably something to do with my video card/drivers.&nbsp; I had already tried restore points, but because the computer could never get past the POST screen, the system restore
 wasn't completly finishing, and would stop during the reboot at the same place, just after the screen with the blue bars.&nbsp; That caused checkdisk to start a couple of times, but everything reported OK with that.&nbsp; So I booted in safe mode, and completely uninstalled
 the video card in device manager.&nbsp; When I rebooted normally, everything seemed to be working great, except that when Windows "found" the video card, it set the refresh rate at 60 hertz.&nbsp; When I went into control panel to chang it back to 75 hertz like it used
 to be, (less flicker on the monitor), it crashed again.&nbsp; So I took the video card out completely and replaced it with the old&nbsp;one that had come with the system originally, and now everything is fine, just a tad bit slower.&nbsp; Time for a new video card. ;)</p>
<p>I hope this helps someone else who's having the same problem, I was about to conclude that I had a fatal problem with the hard drive or something, and was ready to go looking for a new system.&nbsp; As it is now, less than $20 on ebay will buy me a better card
 (used) than the one I just took out, and will be faster too.&nbsp; Gotta love it when you dodge a bullet.</p>

            Mines doing the same thing except no mouse etc. It will load past the password screen and after that sometimes if I'm lucky I can get my password in there other wise the screen goes completely blank. No mouse Nothing. Therefor I have to Manually power
 it down And back up. I have it running MEM-Test now and it found bad mem so I guess I need to get a new stick of ram for it. my machines old to its an Compaq Presario SR1215CL it houses an AMD sempron processor 2 gigs of ram. with an azus mother board and
 a 650 watt power supply. It may be an older machine but it does what I need it to do.&nbsp; Any additional help would be appreciated. thanks :-)

2. Did clean installation.<br />
3. Now windows doesn't want to activate, getting error&nbsp;0xC004C003.<br />

            <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Due to high demand for Windows 10 globally, few of us may experience a temporary delay in activation. For Activation Errors 0xC004C003 or 0Xc004F050; request you to wait for 24 hours and Windows 10 should activate automatically without any issue on
 your machine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also,&nbsp;a<span> clean install of Windows 10 will not make the device eligible for the free upgrade. I</span><span>n order to be able to use free upgrade of Windows 10 on your computer, you will have to upgrade from an existing eligible operating system like
 Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Appreciate your patience.</span></p>

            <p>Similar scenario. &nbsp;Part of the insider group and have been running the betas for months. &nbsp;Fully upgraded and activated. &nbsp;Confirmed PC showed in my account devices with correct build # then did clean install. &nbsp;Will not auto-activate... &nbsp;Unimpressed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: &nbsp;36+ hrs later, still no love. &nbsp;Multiple reboots. &nbsp;My account shows a 2nd PC, so its obvious it doesn't recognize the machine for whatever reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update 2: Over a week later and no love from Micro$haft. &nbsp; &nbsp;Decided to give up on my license of Win10 Pro, and reinstall the OEM Win7 back on the laptop and upgrade it to Win10 Home. &nbsp;BUT, I had long since replaced the original hard drive and did not have
 a working OEM iso or other install media and T/Poshiba was no help. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I'm sitting here with 2 TWO valid licenses and NO working OS! (Aside from my trusty Linux box) &nbsp;So what did I do? &nbsp;Installed a preactivated PIRATED version of Win7 Ultimate and then upgraded IT to Win10. &nbsp;And gee, IT ACTIVATED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So listen up Micro$hit. &nbsp;When someone can pirate a copy EASIER than installing legitimately in the first place... YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did I want to? &nbsp;No. &nbsp;But I needed my laptop up and running again and your system is FUBAR! &nbsp;</p>

I did an upgrade first and then a clean install. <br />

            <p>I have the same issue after upgrade from last W10 Technical Preview. &nbsp;It has now been 4 days and my copy still won't activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like many of you, I wanted to do a test on one of the secondary computer before installing W10 on other more important machines. Well, good thing I did. &nbsp;I will definitely wait and see. &nbsp;This, to me, is a significant issue with W10. &nbsp;I'm putting a "hold"
 on everything before risking losing all my valid licences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there someone at MS that is looking into this, apart from telling us the server is busy. &nbsp;How can we possibly know this is indeed the reason rather than some issue with our "key" or some bug with W10?</p>
<p>Also, in other versions, there was the possibility to activate by phone. &nbsp;What happened to that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>W10 may possibly be the best Windows yet but, you should know, I never had this issue with Windows 7 (which was a great experience from day 1).</p>

<em>2. Did clean installation.</em><br />
<em>3. Now windows doesn't want to activate, getting error&nbsp;0xC004C003.</em></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been participating in the Insider program for long months, when time had come to upgrade. I could not upgrade my previous copy as it was a bit broken (ntdll.dll was corrupt) and the installation just exited all the time after downloading the necessary
 files.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I had to go for the Clean Install, what I did. Now it does not Activate. I also hold a legit win7 and win 8.1 Copy for the same rig. It may help.
</p>

<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues!
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />Skype does run in Linux systems :-). The system requirements are:
<br />64-bit Ubuntu 14.04+
<br />64-bit Debian 8.0+
<br />64-bit OpenSUSE 13.3+
<br />64-bit Fedora Linux 24+

<br />May I ask if your Ubunto version is compatible with Skype's system requirements?
<br />
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week!

<h2>            0x800706d9 on all hotmail&#47;outlook addresses in windows 10 app and outlook 365</h2>
                    I originally&nbsp;had a warning&nbsp;saying I had to resign in.. the error code&nbsp;

0x800706d9
<p>
</p><p>Next, I removed email addresses both Hotmail&nbsp;and the outlook</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same code came up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows are up&nbsp;to date&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to take the computer back to a date before it happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only 2 dates and both came up with not being able to take the computer back&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I switch firewalls off as other posts on google search said they had the same and firewall could be the problem..&nbsp;it's not&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did anyone get any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>next stage is a totally reinstall and that takes a day putting everything back on&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the trouble to reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made&nbsp;changes but because the cause ended up being a corrupt&nbsp;windows update I lost all internet and sign on. I took to a local PS repairer to sort out in the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe your fix will work on other problems with a similar error code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Error - Backup skipped backing up E&#58;&#92;filename as it is on the backup target, in Windows 7.</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: Back Fail! Skipped Backingup!</p>
<p>I am trying to create a back up. I get an error message saying that the "Backup skipped backing up&nbsp; E:\filename as it is on the backup target". I unintalled the program with the filename in question and removed any leftover files. Am I missing something?</p>
<p>It appears that the Windows Image Backup worked but not the personal files. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <blockquote>I know that this is a late response to this thread. I had the same issue and it said the the following<br />
&gt;Backup skipped backing up D:\Users\Joshua\Documents as it is on the backup target.<br />
Backup skipped backing up D:\Users\Joshua\Music as it is on the backup target.<br />
Backup skipped backing up D:\Users\Joshua\Pictures as it is on the backup target.<br />
Backup skipped backing up D:\Users\Joshua\Videos as it is on the backup target.<br />
Backup skipped backing up D:\Users\Joseph\Music as it is on the backup target.<br />
Backup skipped backing up D:\Users\Joseph\Pictures as it is on the backup target.<br />
Backup skipped backing up D:\Users\Jodi\Pictures as it is on the backup target.&lt;<br />
I used to have a 40gb hard drive on this computer and ran out of space really fast so I changed the storage location from C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\... to D:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\etc...<br />
The D drive is now my location that I am saving windows 7 backups to and i have since moved my users documents back to the C: drive when I got a bigger hard drive. something in the registry or some file still has entries referencing the D:\Users\etc... directory.
 anyway. just thought I would add to the confusion :).<br />
Have a good day.<br />
</blockquote>
I just fixed it.<br />
I went back and restored default storage locations on all folders (i.e. Pictures, Documents, Downloads, Favorites, Searches etc...) then renamed the folder in explorer to match the default folder. For example after restoring storage location from folder called
 My Pictures to the default Pictures name, it was still named My Pictures inside windows explorer. I right clicked and renamed it from My Pictures to Pictures and hit enter. Lastly after this I deleted all my libraries and restored the default libraries and
 now all is working fine in windows backup.<br />

    <title>Caps lock key toggling on and off randomly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> missvassy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Caps lock key toggling on and off randomly</h2>
                    My caps lock key has been randomly turning off and on.&nbsp; I tried disabling the caps lock in the registry, but it doesn't help.&nbsp; When I shut down my computer and reboot, it always reboots in caps even though that is supposedly disabled.&nbsp; It does not seem
 to be related to any specific program.&nbsp; At first it would toggle on and off every couple of hours, but now it is starting to do it every 30 minutes or so.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I would have dealt with it sooner but I am in school and could not do without my computer for a couple of days if, god forbid, I have to take it in somewhere and have them fix it.&nbsp; I have an HP Pavillion laptop running Windows 7.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It's only three years old, but I do use it a lot.&nbsp; Incidentally, the "Z" key will only capitalize if I hold down the right "Shift" key so I am thinking it might be the keyboard, but it just seems weird that it goes on and off randomly even though the registry
 has been changed.&nbsp; I thought that if the registry had been changed it wouldn't matter what the keyboard was doing.&nbsp; Please help.&nbsp; I am a computer novice, but I can follow directions really well so any advice will help.

            Hi CameronE1
<br />
<br />Do you have a RipJaw KM780/KM780R MX Mechanical Gaming Keyboard?
<br />
<br />If so, you should re-install the software and device driver associated with that device to remove this error . . .

<h3> mikes.uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface RT on screen keyboard disappears after each letter in internet explorer</h2>
                    <p>I've &nbsp;been experiencing issues typing on certain websites from my Surface RT such as Facebook and Strava, every time I bring up the on screen keyboard to reply to comments it minimises after one letter and is really frustrating as I can't update from my
 Surface...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating this post isn't an issue but some websites are a complete pain and this looks to only be a recent thing, any one got any idea's, I've refreshed my settings but to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Jesse, </p>
<p>Thanks for the info, unfortunately a refresh hasn't solved the issue.. There has been no hardware changes to my Surface nor software and the only change will have been that from Windows updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I try a complete Windows re-install and report back later.</p>

<h2>            Asus zenbook ux303ub performance issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I got a new laptop over the holidays&nbsp;</p>
<p>because my old Mac had broken. That new PC was a zen book ux303ub with Nvidia 940m, 12g ram and a quad core i7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I use it for gaming and school stuff, I need that extra GPU. But, whenever i run a game, like portal or mine craft for example, it's slower on my discrete gpu than it is the integrated one. DRIVERS ARE UP TO DATE!!! All I have is photoshop, flash,
 365 and avg. Any suggestions? By the way The Mac is still usable and its iris pro graphics are somewhat better for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit : the Intel graphics crash randomly when using Chrome and I am on win10 x64</p>

            <span>Nope. Nothing happened to the laptop, gpu still yields 25fps less than the Mac, which is awkward because this is supposed to be some good gaming ultrabook. I will be going to Microsoft where I bought it and having it checked out</span>

<h2>            After Update to 10 - WiFi drops, streaming doesn&#39;t work, computer won&#39;t come out of sleep</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just upgraded to Windows 10 and I'm having a few issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) My WiFi signal won't hold. It drops every 30-40 minutes.. and if I'm trying to stream something it drops every 2-3 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) ..speaking of streaming.. I can't stream any videos. Facebook, netflix, youtube, hulu.. nothing. It looks like it buffers forever and never plays. Or it'll take forever to buffer then play but it's all frozen frames with delayed/broken audio. I've tried
 this on Edge and Chrome. Nothing on both browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) My HP laptop never comes out of sleep mode... I can hit any and all buttons and nothing happens.. I have to hard reset to use it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>

            Hi Ruth
<br />
<br />What application did you use to scan the documents?
<br />
<br />Was that the software that came with your scanner or the Windows Fax and scan app?
<br />
<br />If that was the Windows Fax and Scan app, you should find the documents in this folder (replace username with your login name)
<br />
<br />C:\Users\username\Documents\Scanned Documents

                    My computer screen freezes quite a bit, sometimes when I'm watching a show online. Do any of the F-keys help to unfreeze? Also, I had bad memory replaced in March 2011 on my laptop, so don't know if it's the memory.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>Pressing function keys may no help you in unfreezing. You may check if the issue persists in clean boot state.</p>
<p>Starting your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program. This kind of startup is known as a "Clean boot."</p>
<p>Refer:<br />
<strong>How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a>
</p>
<p>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
1.&nbsp;Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Run</strong>. <br />
2.&nbsp;Type <strong>msconfig</strong>, and then click OK.</p>
<p>The System Configuration Utility dialog box is displayed. </p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Click the <strong>General</strong> tab, click <strong>Normal Startup</strong> - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.
<br />
4.&nbsp;When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.</p>
<p>Check for error messages in event viewer. If you find any error messages then post back the exact error message so that we can assist you better.</p>

            Sounds like it might be a video driver problem, but we don't know anything about your system.<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving
 these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
What is your Internet browser and version?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now provide a few more details:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.<br />
<br />
For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.<br />
<br />
For audio driver information, expand the Components, click Sound Device, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.
<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.<br />
<br />
This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork.

            Hi Joseph.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This is a known issue where Pro Upgrades wrongly reported Enterprise, which was supposedly resolved by a subsequent Windows Update.  So expedite Windows Updates to see if they correct the version to Pro and activate.
<br />
<br />If not contact Microsoft Support phone or chat options here:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p><span>Certainly, there is an option of delete all of these emails in the Junk and deleted folders. There are two ways of going about manually- which means, you have to perform yourself the steps below:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. After signing in to your account, go to each of this folder.</span></p>
<p><span>2. On the top of these emails, tick the box before the word ALL.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click delete menu above Junk or Deleted folder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Another way to do it manually is doing the following steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Hover the mouse cursor over the folder.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Right click and choose empty folder.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The option for "allow remote connections to this computer" only shows up if you're using Windows professional edition (not home edition). &nbsp;But, that only applies to the actual Microsoft Remote Desktop system, so it doesn't impact your ability to use VNC.
 &nbsp;As long as the "VNC Server" is running down by your system clock, you should be able to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly for personal use, I use a free program called Team Viewer that has far easier setup and works reliably -- and is much easier than setting up port forwarding and other network conditions for VNC.</p>

<p>Yeah it sucks dude, but do as Grey has suggested, as that is the best way for them to get dealt with. Hackers and glitchers are pretty much standard in COD games these days (hence why I no longer play them)

<p><font color="#000000">Doug, it worked OK on Windows Photo Viewer on Windows 8. After the upgrade to Windows 8.1 the rotate no longer works. I have tried it with both Photos app and Windows Photo Viewer. The rotate does not work in either of them. When using
 the Photos app the rotate is there as you show. Clicking rotate gives the message “Tap Edit, and then make changes.” So I tap Edit and there is no icon to rotate the picture. What worked in Windows 8 does not work in Windows 8.1. The file is a .jpg. This is
 not a file I create but one that is shipped to me every day with different information. Now I have to tip the laptop 90 degrees to read the information in the .jpg file. Before I just rotated the file for an easy view. The Window developers need to put the
 code back in they took out and all would work OK. Also, the .jpg file is in this thread. Just copy it out and see the problem for yourself.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Hello Arthur,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you click the Edit button in the Photos app, then click "Basic fixes" you'll see the Rotate button.&nbsp; Click it and it will rotate the image.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This looks to be caused by the file itself being set to 'read only'.&nbsp; That is, it is set so you can't make changes to it, thus the rotate button not working or not being available.</p>
<p>You can either use the Photos app Edit mode to rotate and save as a new copy, or you can remove the read-only attribute from the file.</p>
<p>To check for the read-only attribute, just right-click the file in Explorer and choose properties.&nbsp; You should see an Attributes section at the bottom.&nbsp; If 'read only' is checked, you can uncheck it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let us know how that goes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Gregg</p>

<h2>            magic 2013 deck packs missing</h2>
                    
<p>I bought magic 2013 a while back. When I saw it was the free game this month I looked and the deck pack expansions were free also so I downloaded them. The game says they're there and downloaded but nowhere in the campaign or deck manager can they be found.
 I did delete everything and redownloaded it all but still nothing. Am I missing something? How do I get these into my game?</p>

<p>Do you mean the multiplayer deck packs? Or you purchased the full versions of them a while ago? The free deck packs for multiplayer are there if you compete against someone else who has the deck. The full versions of them for campaign and multiplayer still
 cost $2.99.</p>

            <p>Hello Surajit, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Apology for I did not understand&nbsp;your query and I appreciate&nbsp;the time taken by you in getting back to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your query:</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no way to download Windows Update KBs manually and add them to Windows 10 ISO file so that all of them get installed with&nbsp;windows installation. However, once you have all&nbsp;Windows Update installed on your computer and everything&nbsp;is in order, you
 may take a system image. With that system Image you can restore your computer up to all those updates every time after you format your hard drive. Only newer updates will be required to be updated. (probably you already know that and wouldn't want to create
 a disk).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates KB numbers can also be downloaded and installed manually but they have to be downloaded individually. Considering&nbsp;the scenario of hard drive format and operating system reinstallation, downloading and installing each Windows Update manually and individually
 will be too much&nbsp;of a task and very time consuming. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this answers your query.&nbsp;For any further assistance with Windows, please&nbsp;write&nbsp;back to us. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            It is clear you do not understand the problem that developers have.&nbsp; They need an ISO with the latest updates integrated so they can build a machine from scratch for testing.&nbsp; There is no way to know whether or not the Windows 10 machine you are running

            <p>You are missing the point.&nbsp; With all previous versions of Windows it was possible to slipstream updates onto an ISO so when you built a system from scratch it would have all updates to that point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Microsoft going to make a new ISO image available after every update is pushed out with all of the current updates on it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have no way to manually apply updates after you do a from scratch install the updates have to be on the ISO used to do the build.</p>

            The ACCUMALTIVE updates are the most annoying because they will crash your programs as you are using them.&nbsp; It takes over the hard drive and any disk intensive operations are put in the background or just plain fail.&nbsp; Then after all that disk installation
 of all those files, then defender has to run, twice, once before SearchIndexer has its way with the hard drive taking over, then MRT and half a dozen others all get into the Hard drive, then defender comes on again then ... 6 hour later you might get to actually
 use your computer, but by then you have already taken a sledge hammer to it .... out of shear frustration ....

            <p>Of all my Windows issues, this too is my most frustrating.&nbsp; In the past MS would make periodic Service Packs that wrapped up the security and other updates, evidently only when they wanted to or felt they had to.&nbsp; There have been some methods to slipstream
 the updates together, I believe some companies or sites have built them.&nbsp; I tried one site for XP but it was awkward and never worked for me.&nbsp; I also heard Windows Update Service (WUS) could do it but never found out how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, their answer, make a backup of the system for future restores is the only workaround I've had.&nbsp; For a huge company one would think they'd help simplify this process.&nbsp; But they don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try internet searching for:&nbsp; "How to Slipstream Windows 10".&nbsp; One site to try is WinBuzzer.</p>
