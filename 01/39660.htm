<h2>            Missing my old desktop now that I&#39;ve got Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I updated to Windows 10 but seem to have lost my old desktop.&nbsp; The new tile screen isn't organized.&nbsp; I was able to find the shortcuts and programs on my old desktop quite easily, because I had grouped them into topics.&nbsp; Now, I can't seem to get my old desktop
 back.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Admittedly, I have used my old desktop on Windows 10, but it seems to be intermittent.&nbsp; Sometimes, I'm lucky and it's there, other times I get the Windows 10 tile screen.&nbsp; I like to be in control of my PC and not subject to the vagaries of the operating
 system.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know two things:</p>
<p>1. How can I go from the Windows 10 Tile Screen to the old desktop (Windows 8.1)?</p>
<p>2. How can I return to the Windows 10 Tile Screen when I want to?</p>

            <p>Hello Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description I understand that you want the Start Screen as it used to be in Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the below steps and see if it helps.</p>
<ul>
<li>Select Settings</li><li>Choose Personalization</li><li>Select Start from the left pane</li><li>Switch the toggle to on for <strong>Use Start Full Screen</strong></li></ul>
<p>In case if you want to revert to the Windows 10 Start Menu interface, you can switch the toggle back to off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above information was helpful. If you need further information, feel free to write to us and we would be happy to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Great! Now, I don't see a difference. Should I just restart Windows 10? My "old" desktop still doesn't show.

            <p>First thought is to turn off tablet mode.</p>
<p>Once you get back the desktop just click on the start icon which will open up the tile screen. To do so permanently turn on tablet mode.</p>

<h2>            Can a computer repair shop install windows on someones computer off a &#34;generic disc set&#34; if the computer is entitled to that windows type via a unique pin&#47;code&#47;serialnumber&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A few years back i took a computer to a repair shop and did not have the discs, the repair guy said they could legally restore the computer and load on a off a copy of a random/generic windows (the same one the computer was entitled to)&nbsp;

<strong>is this Legitimate?</strong> </p>
<p>Seems like it would be, i mean if the computer is entitled to such, however i dont know so you tell me.

            <p>Yes, it's legitimate - If you want to check your install, post an MGADiag report, and we'll be able to tell if he did the job properly, or 'cheated' and installed a counterfeit OS and Key.</p>

            If the Windows License is an OEM license (ie. the computer was purchased from a company like Dell, HP, etc with Windows pre-installed), then the license is tied to the machine.&nbsp; Every manufacturer has their own way of verifying that their OEM license is
 valid.&nbsp; One method is for the manufacturer to place a code in the motherboard's BIOS that validates the copy of XP when it is installed using an install disk from the same manufacturer.&nbsp; Therefore, restoring an OEM license to the original computer from an
 OEM install disk should be perfectly legitimate.<br />

<p><span>Hello Mead1234,</span></p>
<p><span>You should try to run the Digital Cable Advisor again.
</span></p>
<p><span>To run the Digital Cable Advisor and enable digital cable support</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click the Start button, click All Programs, and then click Windows Media Center.<br />
2. Do one of the following:<br />
<br />
If you've never used the Digital Cable Advisor before, scroll to Extras, click Extras gallery, click the Digital Cable Advisor tile, and then follow the instructions to install it.</span></p>
<p><span>If the Digital Cable Advisor is already installed on your computer, scroll to Extras, click Extras library, and then click the Digital Cable Advisor tile.<br />
3. Follow the instructions to run the Digital Cable Advisor.</span></p>
<p><span>â€¢If your system passes the test, click Update System Settings to enable digital cable support on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure that you run the Tuner setup during the process, it would automatically enter the activation code.</span></p>
<p><span>Check if you are still prompted for the for the activation code.
</span></p>
<p><span>If this does not work, I suggest that you contact your Cable service provider to get the product key.</span></p>

            Hello SF, my name is Irisdiel and I am an independent advisor.
<br />
<br />Open Computer Management By doing these steps.
<br />Click on the Start Button
<br />Click on Control Panel
<br />Click Administrative Tools
<br />Double click on Computer Management
<br />You are now in the Navigation panel of the Computer Management.
<br />When in Computer Management, you then have to allow the new drive to be recognized. 
<br />Double click on Storage
<br />Double click on Disk Management
<br />Now in the middle of your screen, there is the layout of the Disk Drives that you have. The drives that are partitioned will show by the drive lettering. The others will just show up as having nothing at all in them. Below that there will be the Disk drives that are installed into the computer. You'll see that the primary one will all ways read as "Disk 0". Then you will have Disk 1 and so on. Under the Disks, there will also see your CD-Rom drives.. If there is more then one, it will be labeled the same as Disk drives..
<br />
<br />On to the Partitioning of the drive in question. 
<br />Right Click on the drive
<br />Click to format the drive or Enable Volume. There will be a series of windows that open up. This is Vista's formatting. Just go through the windows, and make sure everything is the way you want it to happen.
<br />Once the formatting is done, will take some time depending on the drive size.
<br />Right click on the drive
<br />Click on Mark the Partition as Active
<br />After you have done those steps, The drive will be up and running threw Vista.
<br />
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!
<br />Thank you and good luck,
<br />Regards- Irisdiel H.

    <title>Windows 7 Base Filtering Engine is not running - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christoop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Base Filtering Engine is not running</h2>
                    <p>My laptop is running under Windows 7 Home Premium and has been for a long time. A couple of days ago I suddenly had a message via Norton Internet Security 2011 stating that the Base Filtering Engine was not running and that it was required by NIS in order
 to function correctly. So having read numerous similar problems via the internet and the way that people have tried to overcome this issue I typed services.msc and yes it is true the BFE service is not running.
</p>
<p>Ok I thought lets go and turn it on via the control panel. Result No joy "Windows Firewall can't change some of your settings. Error Code 0x80070433". So I tried using the MIcrosoft Mr FIXit application where it tells me there is a problem but it can not
 fix it. Oh Hum!!.</p>
<p>I have also followed the instructions (via this website)&nbsp;that tells you how to change the various registry permissions required&nbsp;through regedit. Still no joy</p>
<p>Help,&nbsp;how do you get it to turn on again??.</p>
<p>I am not aware of any changes that have taken place in the last week that could have attributed to this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated</p>

<p>Used my older laptop that runs Windows 7 Basic and found the BFE registry entry and exported it to&nbsp;the desktop. Copied this file to my laptop with the error and ran. Hey Presto it worked.</p>
<p>This reg file worked for me:-</p>

            For licensing issues the best answer will come from contacting Cyberlink, the maker of Power Director. You could also contact the maker of your computer since the program came with the computer<br />

If you own a previous version of CyberLink PowerDirector, you can upgrade the program to the latest version at a lower price. Please refer to the below suggestions to make the best choice.
<br />
If you already own the Ultra or Deluxe version of PowerDirector 8 or 9, selectâ€¦ <br />
Upgrade from v.8/9 Retail versions to upgrade to PowerDirector 10 Ultra or Deluxe.

<br />
<br />
If you purchased the upgrade version of CyberLink PowerDirector: <br />
To install an upgrade version of CyberLink PowerDirector, a previous version of the program must be installed. But if you have the Ultra or Deluxe version of PowerDirector 8, 9, you
<br />
will be asked to enter your original Ultra/Deluxe serial number (activation key) during installation if you donâ€™t have it installed.
<br />
<br />
If PDR8, 9 doesnâ€™t installed, when installing PDR10 upgrade version, the program will ask for PDR8, 9 Ultra/Deluxe CD-Key in the beginning

<h2>            Date Modified to show time with Seconds</h2>
                    I want to show the Date Modified with the Seconds listed. XP could do this now in Vista it is not there. Also if I go into some files it show the date modified with 2 hours ago why is this? This is not helpfull when you have many files created at the same
 hour but different seconds. I track files with seconds and need to display all that info.

            Hello Wesleyhe,<br />
<br />
<p>The only way I have found to see seconds included with date modified is in the Details pane which opens along the bottom of Windows Explorer when you view the files on your computer. The details pane
 includes all of the options you have selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The seconds does not show when viewing folders or files within Date Modified. However, if you hover the mouse pointer over a file or folder, the date modified will include seconds.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default, the Windows Explorer displays file's Name, Date Modified, Size and Type.
If you want to add more options or remove options, right click on any of the columns. Click on "More" to display a full list of options that you may want to select to display when you show details. You can check and select
 the details you want to display for the items in the folder.<br />
<br />
If you want to do a search on the internet there are 3rd party tools that might do what you are looking for.
<br />
<br />
Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Xbox Reputation from Enforcement Site</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a question concerning the reputation section of the <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Enforcement</a> website. I remember when the Xbox One was initially released, the reputation of one's Gamertag&nbsp;had an effect in the multiplayer matches they would be placed in.&nbsp;While I do not have any reports or negative feedback applied to me, is this
 reputation meter still being utilized at all? I'm just wondering what happened to this system as I remember it was quite a big deal back in the day. With being in the Xbox Preview Program (alpha ring), I do not see any option to provide positive feedback to
 players (like the Xbox 360).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>as far as I know the reputation system is still active and used. There isn't an option to provide positive feedback, but not receiving negative feedback for a while across different games should result in your reputation improving.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Microsoft Visual C&#43;&#43; 2017 x64 Minimum Runtime&#34; Error Message&#63;</h2>
                    I have an issue with Microsoft Visual C++. It says it cannot be accessed as it is on a "network resource that is unavailable". This error message pops up when I try to open my driver software and launch certain games so obviously it's an issue if I can't
 access it to update my drivers. When I try to re-install the visual studio application it doesn't work because a version already exists but when I find the other version I can't access it or "find" it to delete it. Essentially I can't access certain programs
 on my PC becasue there is an issue with Visual C++ on my PC, it effects certain games and prevents them from running and now is effecting my GeForce experience. I have very little knowledge of C++ of how to fix this issue. Please help me, I have exhausted
 my resources on fixing this and even my more techy friends are stumped by this issue and it has been going on for months.

            I skimmed the linked solution you had there, I have tried something similar but it says I cannot uninstall the old version which must be done before I can reinstall apparently.

<p>If one file is missing then you probably have other files missing too, the&nbsp;Visual C++ 2017 redistributable maybe just the&nbsp;tip of iceberg. Your MSI package cache is likely broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the fix tool at https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17588/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed . If the tool fails you can try install the exact same version of the component in another machine, copy it to your machine,
 then click the browse button to select the file when asked. You probably need to recruit a friend or setup a virtual machine for that as there is no telling how many files are missing from your MSI cache besides this one .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW MSDN is the wrong place to ask questions like this. MSDN address questions related to software development. Unless the user wants to write something like Microsoft's fix tool this isn't going to be a software development question.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have the exact same problem with the same C++ Runtime package on a brand new computer with a new install of Windows 10 Home Edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem started when I tried to install a program that needs the runtime package, in this case it was Adobe Lightroom CC</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uninstalling the package</li><li>Installing the new package&nbsp; (from:&nbsp;&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads&nbsp; )</li><li>Using the Install helper app (as per previous post)</li><li>Removing the registry keys for the app, rebooting and running the installer again</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I have left is to completely rebuild Windows and hope the problem goes away.<br />

            I did a complete reinstall of Windows and the problem was gone.&nbsp; A bit drastic, but it did the job.

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a native english speaker living in Brazil. I am trying to swicth my computer from portugese to US ENGLISH; howere, it will not let me. I have tried to follow the instructions on the support site: https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2910256?wa=wsignin1.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>After following the instructions and several reboots I am still not in english. I even tried removing all of the english from my comupter and then readding it as primary with no luck. Any help or solution would be more than appreciated.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a1e22e4d-60dc-41b5-ab04-e6c2c6a9a24a" /></p>

            <p>Hi Jeremiah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still do not get the interface in English, them you might need to refresh the system from Windows 8.1 installation disc and select the system language as 'English'. This will set 'English' as the primary language for using system files and Windows
 utilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have a Windows 8.1 installation disc, you might have to create one. Once after this, you can reinstall Windows 8.1 on the computer using the installation media. You need to use the Windows 8.1 product key to create the installation media. So,
 keep it ready before you start with this step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may create a Windows 8 installation disk using another computer having Windows 8.1&nbsp;or lower operating system. Please refer to this Microsoft Article to create an installation media:</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Create installation media for Windows 8.1</span></a></em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After creating Windows 8.1 installation media, you can reinstall Windows 8.1 on the computer using this media. Please refer to the following article to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to refresh, reset, or restore your PC</a></strong></em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><span>I highly recommend
<strong><em>backing up all of your important files and folders onto an external storage device</em></strong> before attempting any type of OS&nbsp;install or upgrade.</span></p>

<p>Can it be?! Yes, I am in Sweden right now, but the game was already purchased... And why does it start to download at all in this case?</p>
<p>If I change the location, will I have to wait 3 months before changing it back??</p>

<p>Some games are region locked. So in order to download them your account region has to match your physical location. Usually the game will start to download because the game is available in both regions, but once it checks your IP and notices you're not actually
 in the region your account is set for, it stops the download. </p>
<p>Yes. If you migrate your region, you will not be able to migrate back for 3 months. If you're only in Sweden for a short time, you should be able to finish the download once you return to Russia. If you're in Sweden permanently, it would be best to migrate
 your region so you don't run into those issues in the future.</p>

<h2>            New Xbox One controller pause button not working on PC </h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was given a new xbox one controller by my company today to take home to use with my PC as a game pad.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Everything appears to be working fine apart from the pause button being unresponsive.</p>
<p>I have tried rolling back drivers and older drivers and nothing seems to change.<br />
<br />
My system is running windows 10 but I have also tried it with a Windows 7 machine resulting in the same issue.<br />
<br />
I do hope that it is just a software issue and not hardware but thats life..<br />
<br />
thanks for your time.</p>

                    I was in an online game ... called Second Life with a viewer ... and the above title happened. I could only get the desktop / start screen back by shutting down and starting manually. The page I was on indicated that this viewer is not responding . I could

            The blue window with the problem listed (and the little frowny face) are the "new" BSOD in Win8.<br />
As ZigZag3143 states, we need the reports in order to figure out what's causing it.<br />
<br />
Start by zipping up the contents of C:\Windows\Minidump and upload them to a free file-hosting service.&nbsp; Then place a link to them here so we can download them.<br />
<br />
Continue to try the other reports also - as we'll need them if the memory dump files don't provide an answer.<br />

    <title>strange Account Unknown in my Documents and Settings folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> freeman2222  say:</h3>
<h2>            strange Account Unknown in my Documents and Settings folder</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
I recently discovered that my Documents and Settings folder shows a strange user account, ("account unknown", SID S-1-5-21-1229272821-...-1005) in the Security tab of its Properties page. There are no Allow or Deny entries listed there directly, just "Special
 permissions", so I clicked Advanced to see what is going on and there, it shows that this account has Full Control over the Documents and Settings directory.<br />
<br />
Some googling revealed to me that accounts like this can be created when<br />
<ol>
<li>a user (with that SID) had existed at some point and then has been deleted from the system and this user's SID is just a remaining ("dangling") reference to that user</li><li>the system has changed it's domain</li><li>another user accessed some shared folder through the network </li></ol>
Here is my thought about these possibilities with regards to my machine:<br />
<ol>
<li>This is not the case, I haven't created accounts on this machine for months and more than years since I deleted an account</li><li>That might be the case, although the PC never was part of a domain, I use it only in a workgroup for home networking. Maybe I changed the workgroup's name recently when I connected it to my new home network.</li><li>This actually is the case, although I think I created that user (with identical password) on my machine... this (from my experience) always enabled that user from another machine to access the files of that user and that user only. And I have never seen
 this leaving any "unknown accounts" on a machine.</li></ol>
As most sites I found about unknown accounts are questions on how to delete those ACL entries, I tried that - without success, for the same reason most of them fail initially: the permission is actually inherited from a folder on a higher level in the hierarchy.<br />
<br />
Since I have my Documents and Settings folder on the D: drive, this would mean to me that this strange ACL entry should be present at D:\ as well. Not so in my case:<br />
please see screenshot at...<br />
<a href="http://freeman2222.mywebcommunity.org/acctuk1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://freeman2222.mywebcommunity.org/acctuk1.html</a><br />
<br />
Looking at these two lists, it seems as if the Everyone entry corresponds to the S-1-5-21-12... entry, but then again, the Everyone entry only has Read &amp; Execute rights, while S-1-5-21-12... has Full Access. Therefore I don't think they're related. And at the
 same time, the S-1-5-21-12... account explicitly shows "Inherited From D:\"... which is incorrect, as S-1-5-21-12... doesn't appear in D:\ at all.<br />
<br />
What makes me even more suspicious is that I usually never give users (other than the one and only Admin) full access to any folders. So could this be a virus, trojan, backdoor or some other malware of that sort? If so, it's quite scary because I use updated
 antivirus software, firewall and am generally rather careful about the integrity of my system.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how to find out where this account came from, how to remove it (the ACL entries) and how to prevent this from happening again?<br />
<br />
Cheers!<br />

            <p>I understand that you did a nice googling. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What i can suggest you is to scan your computer using any online virus scanner.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>microsoft safety scanner</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know what happend when you tried to delete the account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also check for any deny permission entries in the advanced pernmission.</p>
<p>&gt;Right click on the folder</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp;click on properties and go to security tab</p>
<p>&gt; Click on Advanced.</p>
<p>&gt;Check for the deny entries</p>
<p>&gt; if you&nbsp;can see any deny entiers, click on edit and delete that.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I think this is STILL disgracefull of Microsoft,and IS one of the reasons why GFWL Failed!!Yet MS fail to even listen to users time and time again,they must enjoy being the "black sheep" of the Games world.MS get your act together and stop ripping us folk off.Ten&nbsp;years on and i still dont own now a single Game of yours.You can carry on doing things like deliberatly keeping Keyboards/mice away from consoles!Surprised you havnt gone totally bust yet i really am.Carry on like this and it will happen.Long live the PC,oh youve missed the Bus there havnt you.Consoles will Never outperform them,even todays Gen are switiching to PC's purely for the Modding capabilities,and good luck to them too.Just think the world of PC Gaming where does Microsoft come into this now?it doesn't.End of story.</p>

    <title>Surface Book Backspace key not working. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Book Backspace key not working.</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi, first timer here.</span></p>
<p><span>My backspace key is not responding on my surface book. I have the i5 dgpu with 8 GB and 256 GB configuration. I had noticed this problem when I was writing a document 1 week ago and couldnâ€™t delete
 any characters. The key would respond a few times then stop working. Now it completely doesn't work.</span></p>
<p><span>Thinking this was a software issue I restarted and rebooted multiple times and it didnâ€™t work. I checked the manual and I inserted an external keyboard and the backspace key worked on the external
 keyboard. </span></p>
<p><span>I currently am still under warranty. My question is, is it going to cost me to have the backspace key repaired from Microsoft?</span></p>
<p><span>If having to send my surface book how long will I have to wait for the repair to take place?</span></p>
<p><span>Is there anything I can do to repair that wouldnâ€™t void the warranty?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you in advance.</span></p>

            Chances are they will replace the whole thing. Your best option, if you are in the US, is to go to a physical retail Microsoft Store. Otherwise contact support
