    <title>Dual boot windows 8 and Ubuntu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aufa35  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual boot windows 8 and Ubuntu</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I need to install Ubuntu alongside to Windows 8.1, because in school we work with Linux application and I need use this applications also on my notebook (I don't want virtualbox). I tried to install Ubuntu on my notebook, but without any success (as I suppose
 main problem is somewhere between UEFI, and windows 8 boot requirements which wont allow me to boot ubuntu), therefore I would like to ask microsoft experts here for a help.<br />
<br />
Here are some details of my computer and description of my problem:<br />
<p>I have MSI GE60, windows 8.1(64bit) is running on mSATA SSD C drive. HDD is divided to two partitions for windows (applications, documents) and I left there 50GB for ubuntu. I downloaded ubuntu 12.04.3desktop-amd64(64bit), created bootable USB using Universal
 USB Installer (recommended on Ubuntu site). </p>
<p>I disabled USB legacy support (that Ubuntu could be installed in EFI mode- I was following instructions on Ubuntu site), and also Secure Boot (I read that Secure Boot can refuse boot ubuntu).</p>
<p>I inserted USB rebooted computer and chose install ubuntu, divided free 50GB space to swap(2000MB) and rest as ext4 main storage space for ubuntu. Installation passed normally, Ubuntu then asked me to reboot computer. After reboot windows 8 started. Now
 I can't start ubuntu. When I restart win8 to uefi there is possibility to boot ubuntu, but when I choose it, it crashes. When I choose try ubunfu from connected USB, nothing happend, still dark screed.
<br />
</p>
Windows is running normally.<br />
<br />
Please help me, why is windows8 making this multiboot problems? I am mainly using windows, but that doesn't meen that I don't want to use also different OS.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            Thanks, it's solved, I have not posted it here because I thought that nobody will help me...<br />
I don't know what was the problem I restarted BIOS settings, and live USB was working (although i hadn't changed any special settings in bios, so UEFI must have been doing some strange things..)<br />
Second problem was that my graphic card driver was not working so I tought that te instalation failed.

<h2>            New Windows 10 won&#39;t run Mozilla Apps</h2>
                    <p>This is my 4th attempt to upgrade to Windows10. The OS will not run Mozilla Firefox, nor, more importantly because I have hundreds of stored e-mail messages, will it run Mozilla Thunderbird. The Windows reinstall function does not work either. I continually
 get the error message "The instruction at 0x00000000777DBC10 referenced memory at 0x0000000000000000. The memory could not be read.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a solution to these problems, or must I go back, for the 4th time, to Windows 7?</p>

            <p>As I understand it, the "clean install" process involves abandoning everything that was previously there (Windows 7), I cannot possibly do this as I must have a recovery path. I have now, for the third time, reverted to W7 and, thank goodness, everything
 is working again.</p>
<p>One failed app produced an error message suggesting that the problem might be in Kernel32.DLL, which would explain why W10 would not run 32 bit apps. Unfortunately the download and reinstall processes in the new W10 would not work so I am unable to repair
 the file. I will try to reinstall it in W7 but I am reluctant to try another W10 upgrade - too much to lose.</p>

            <p>I asked if this was factory installed Windows 7, the worst install one can possibly have, larded with bloatware and duplicate utilties which interfere with better versions built into the OS. &nbsp;&nbsp; These kinds of problems can be expected if so, running an install

            <p>I am sorry to say that yet another attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 failed, in the same way as before. All seems well until one attempts to run the previously-installed Apps, especially 32-bit programmes. These all result in the same memory-error messages.
 There seems to be a problem with the Windows installer function, but because it does not work I cannot reinstall anything!</p>
<p>Once again I have gone back to a fully-working Windows 7 configuration.</p>
<p>The PC was not factory-prepared and has been carefully maintained, registry cleaned, defragged, etc. and has the latest Windows updates installed.</p>
<p>When W10 is operating, partly, I cannot access many of the usual admin functions, such as Control Panel, which rather limits what can be done to find and repair faults.</p>
<p>I am reluctant to try again because I have a lot of valuable material on the PC. I have back-ups, so I suppose that I could try a clean reinstall of W7 before attempting to upgrade to W10.</p>

<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The M3U is a computer file format that stores multimedia playlists. The Unicode version of "m3u" is "m3u8", which uses UTF-8 Unicode characters.
</p>
<p>You may try to open the M3U playlist in notepad and then try the following.</p>
<p>Click on
<b>File</b>&gt; <b>SaveAs</b>&gt; c<b>hange the encoding to Unicode or UTF-8</b> and then
<b>save the file</b>.</p>
<p>Check if this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you need further assistance, please reply and we will be happy to help you.</span></p>

            No, it didn't help at all. "Conversion" from UTF-8 to question marks appears to be done by WMP during saving the current play list into m3u file. They persist after saving by Notepad with another encoding.<br />

            <p>The battery and charger should be checked by a reputable repair shop if nothing else has changed on your computer between the time it was working and the time it is not working.&nbsp; If you have recently installed new software or driver updates try rolling back to before the software or driver changes.&nbsp; If you have recently purchased a new battery or charger it may not be working correctly or the proper type for your device.</p>

            <p>Thank you for replying. I am computer hardware technician looking for a better way to diagnose the&nbsp;battery problems. The voltage&nbsp;at the battery terminals show&nbsp;a full charge.&nbsp;I need to know&nbsp;the hardware values of&nbsp;the battery current and voltage&nbsp;variables&nbsp;are
 that used by Windows so I may determine whether there is a problem with the driver or some other problem within the OS.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people that are unhappy about this and I have seen nothing other than a simple edict that states it is not MS's problem. It is MS's problem is they are losing customers because of this and they are.&nbsp; From the reports I have read a Microsoft
 hardware engineer needs to write, test and distribute&nbsp;an app to examine the bios battery hardware&nbsp;to ascertain the values reported. The app then needs to compare the values reported&nbsp;to Windows and consequently to the user.&nbsp;&nbsp;So how can&nbsp;one find the battery
 voltage values&nbsp;to&nbsp;isolate the problem?&nbsp;&nbsp;With this by process of elimination&nbsp;we can&nbsp;know whether to repair the os or&nbsp;the charging circuit, or the power supply or the analog to digital measurement circuit or get the&nbsp;bios repaired.&nbsp;&nbsp;The battery may not be&nbsp;MS's
 problem but MS is making other operating systems more popular than their own by leaving the customers and technicians stuck.</p>
<p>Thank you once again.</p>

            Hi  DaveZCR
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally

                    <p>Original Title: Maps App favorites and notes</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 questions:</p>
<p>#1 - Does the windows 10 maps app information sync to Bing maps? &nbsp;Specifically, are the places that I save as favorites in the windows 10 App supposed to show up anywhere in Bing maps? If so, how do I get that to happen, because it is not doing so for me.</p>
<p>#2 - Where is the file/files located on my hard drive that contains the favorites that I save and notes data that I input into the windows 10 app? &nbsp;I would like to keep a backup of this data and restore it if I somehow corrupt my system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><div>Please be informed that the windows 10 maps app information syncs&nbsp;with the <br />
Bing maps as long as you are signed with a same Microsoft account. If you have <br />
added the places as favorites in Bing Maps they should show up on the Maps app <br />
as well as long as you're signed in to both with the same account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For further reference, please refer the below suggestion replied by&nbsp;<strong>Analy Microsoft forum moderator on April-21-2016.</strong></div>

            The only recordings Skype retains for 30 days in the cloud are the ones recorded using Skype's software. Since third party software does not upload recordings to the cloud, there would be no copy to retrieve. If you have a cloud recording using Skype's
 software and there was a microphone or input issue with the recording, no alternate recording would exist in that case either.

<p><strong>UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP (7f)</strong><br />
This means a <strong>trap occurred in kernel mode, and it's a trap of a kind</strong><br />
<strong>that the kernel isn't allowed to have/catch (bound trap) or that</strong><br />
<strong>is always instant death (double fault).&nbsp; The first number in th</strong>e<br />
bugcheck params is the number of the trap (8 = double fault, etc)<br />
Consult an Intel x86 family manual to learn more about what these<br />
traps are. Here is a *portion* of those codes:<br />
If kv shows a taskGate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; use .tss on the part before the colon, then kv.<br />
Else if kv shows a trapframe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; use .trap on that value<br />
Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .trap on the appropriate frame will show where the trap was taken<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (on x86, this will be the ebp that goes with the procedure KiTrap)<br />
Endif<br />
kb will then show the corrected stack.<br />
Arguments:<br />

<h2>            Xbox one chat pad</h2>
                    Okay, this is extremely stupid. And it's been a very long day for me. But I just got a chat pad for my Xbox one. And I swear it doesn't fit into either of my controllers. I physically cannot get it on. Is there some sort of trick I'm missing? Because I
 was not the only who tried. Thank you for the help in advance. I'm just at a loss.&nbsp;

            Hi Mirza, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />I'd recommend reinstalling the latest drivers software directly from the Lenovo website. You could try the Chipset drivers first, then perhaps the Diagnostic software which may be able to locate the missing driver.
<br />

<h2>            Task Switcher and Task View Not Working Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>The problem first appeared on one of my offices laptops when the user reported Alt+Tab not working. I verified that it was not a hardware problem. The Alt key and the Tab key both work fine. Other windows shortcuts such as Alt+F4 or Win+D work fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then also noticed that Task View button is not responsive and does nothing. It seems that Task Switcher and Task View are both unresponsive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

It is the responsibility of the company to make newer releases more enticing by adding further value through improved features and functionality. Microsoft Office has been one of the company's biggest successes. For more than 20 years, the company has released new revisions with unique features that make it an enticing upgrade. At the same time, there are users who fall in love with a revision and never decide to upgrade again, simply because that version is good enough. Since Microsoft announced the launch of Windows 10, a lot of persons are asking, if the license for the version of Microsoft Office they own will work on the new version of Windows.

</p><p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also download the Windows 10 Reservation App and use it to check your system readiness.

            There is a huge difference between "compatible" and "works", especially when dealing with Microsoft. According to their own personnel, Office 2010 will NOT work in Windows 10. In fact, in a recent press release, Microsoft states that to use Office in Windows
 10 will require a subscription to Office. Being that you're not a Microsoft employee, forgive me if I choose to believe the software publisher over a forum moderator like yourself when it comes to these things.

            <p>About a month ago, when the first "Critical Windows Update" appeared that allowed the user to "register" for Windows 10, I had allowed the update to install. Immediately after that update, my Outlook 2010, part of my genuine MS Office 2010 stopped working.
 While Outlook would open, it would not receive or send any email from any of the three accounts setup in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I verified with my three email providers that I had not inadvertently altered any of the login data and passwords. I hadn't. I struggled with this problem for several days and finally called MS Office Support. What was I told? "Oh, there's probably a problem
 with the update. If you want this version of Outlook to work, you'll have to delete the update."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked her if this was my only option. I had indeed wanted to register for the free upgrade to Windows 10, but in reviewing as much data as I could mine online, there was no mention of there being a conflict between this "critical update" and using Outlook
 2010. She said that indeed, a system restore was my only option. When I asked if she would at least, pass this information on to higher echelons, she replied that they probably knew of it already. Then, "Is there anything else I can help you with today?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed the system restore to the date before the update. Strangely enough, the little Windows icon still appears in my task tray. However, I have not installed this or any subsequent update on the three computers in our home (2 running 7 Home Premium
 and my Lenovo Edge E535 running 8.1) for fear of the update(s) damaging the Outlook 2010 installed on each one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What then, can we expect tomorrow when Windows 10 arrives? Will out computers work fine but some of our very own Microsoft programs will fail to work properly? As much as I want t bring all three computers into the second decade of the 21st century, I cannot
 and will not do so if it jeopardizes existing&nbsp;essential programs from the same company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

 them with Office 2010 manually. The installer ran fine and there weren't any compatibility messages. There are people on these workstations evaluating normal work usage (includes much usage of Excel, Outlook, Word and Lync)</p>
<p>
</p><p>All updates from Windows Update (we skipped our WSUS for these machines) applied, Office 2010 is still working.</p>

            Everyone must understand that there will be glitches.&nbsp; Compatibility is a complex issue that can be affected by a number of factors, including other software installed, drivers and a host of other things.&nbsp; When anyone says
<em>program x</em> is compatible with Windows 10, it doesn't mean that it will work under all circumstances, combinations and permutations.&nbsp; Especially with an in-place upgrade, things can happen.

<p>Jim - The only issue I was "ascribing" was that the first "critical update" for the public that, as one part of it,&nbsp;contained the first interconnection between an end-user's computer and Microsoft to confirm the end-user's intent to upgrade to Windows 10,
 which then placed some line or two on board to allow for the icon in the Task Bar. I did not blame, nor did I state, with any specificity, that Windows 10 would be problematic to Office 10. However, you can see by others' concerns here and on numerous other
 forums, that some folks are a bit timid about the upgrade, especially from a decent, stable platform as 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case it was coincidental. But when the tech support agent told me that this update was the cause of my then-problem with Outlook, why wouldn't I, or anyone else have the right to question certain compatibilities. I sincerely hope that the transition
 for everyone in the 7-8.1 range will be smooth, but honesty and history tell us it would not be the first time that it happened. Certainly not intentionally.
</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback. It is sincerely appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Downloads Randomly Stop for No reason</h2>
                    <p>Within the past week my downloads have stopped and cannot be completed.&nbsp; This happens no matter what site I am downloading from and it doesn't matter how large the file is.&nbsp; I had not had any problems previously and was able to download any size file from
 any site.&nbsp; I have cleaned the registry, checked for viruses and malware, defragged the hard drive and done everything else I could think of to fix the problem but nothing helps.&nbsp; The downloads just stop for no rhyme or reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried a download manager, JDownloader, and it didn't help.&nbsp; The downloads don't resume.&nbsp; Since they had worked previously I don't understand what could have changed.</p>

            Oh you're still having this problem? So when you say they stop, you mean that it ends before the download is fully completed and the file itself ends up corrupted in the downloads folder? I think it might be a problem with your internet. Did you try pulling
 out the power from the modem and the router for about ten seconds and then reinserting it? Try to download after you do that. If it still fails then you might have to give your Internet Service Provider a call and explain your problem.

    <title>Can&#39;t update Windows XP Pro SP3 x32 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chatrick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t update Windows XP Pro SP3 x32</h2>
                    When I try to update W XP Pro I now get a message asking 'do I want to install this program?' with two buttons, 'Install' &amp; 'Don't Install'. The program name given is 'Microsoft Update'. Clicking either button causes the button to appear depressed but
 it doesn't come back 'out' again and everything freezes for a while before another message saying there was a problem with the web page then the whole thing repeats again. Microsoft Fixit centre tells me it's fixed the problem but it still doesn't work. The
 first message box has only started appearing since last week, previously the update just went ahead with no problems ever since I've had XP (ever since it came out). I've tried numerous 'cures' but nothing seems to work. I would really appreciate some help
 with this as I like to keep everything up to date. Thank you for your help.
