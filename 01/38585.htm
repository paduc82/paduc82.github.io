<h2>            &#34;Wifi&#34; doesn&#39;t have a valid IP configuration.</h2>
                    I bought a dell Inspiron 15, 3000 series laptop in September and a few days ago, the wifi stop connecting to my laptop. I'm pretty sure it isn't anything with my modem or router because I'm using my iPad right now and my phone works with the wifi. I haven't
 been able to see if it's only my wifi though so I'm not sure. I did the troubleshooting thing and it said that "Wifi" doesn't have a valid ip configuration. I don't really know what that means but I'm running Windows 10 if that helps. A lot of the stuff I
 found online that apparently &nbsp;worked didn't work for me at all and it seemed that everyone who had this problem had Windows 8 and they said it worked but it didn't for me and I'm not sure if it's the OS. I also heared that it could be something with Microsoft
 and they could be doing some sort of update thing and that might help but that was a while ago. I also had a Dell update that I never installed if that also helps. But now that I can't connect I can't update so I won't kno

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Hold the SHIFT Key and Power OFF the computer using the normal method (Start - Power - Shut down)&nbsp;- hold the key down&nbsp;until it is completely off. Wait a few minutes then power it back on.
<br />
<br />
<strong>More troubleshooting if needed :</strong><br />
<br />
Let's do a hard reset of the modem and router - power off modem, router, and computer - wait 3+ minutes then power on the modem - when it is up an running power on the router - when it is up an running power on the computer.<br />
<br />
Check the cable to the modem from wall and cable to the router - check the cable from router to computer (best to unplug all of them and re-plug them in - do not just snug - a little corrosion on the connectors can cause havoc).<br />
<br />
<strong>After ALL the above if needed :</strong><br />
<br />
Right Click the Start Button - Command Prompt (Admin) - copy and paste these in one line at a time and hit ENTER after each (Ignore any errors) :
<p>ipconfig /flushdns</p>
<p>nbtstat -R</p>
<p>nbtstat -RR</p>
<p>netsh int reset all</p>
<p>netsh int ip reset</p>
<p>netsh winsock reset<br />
netsh winsock reset catalog </p>
<p><br />
Now Restart the computer</p>

&nbsp;<br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible solution?&nbsp;The router can be the issue even if other OS's are working fine. And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version -
<strong>click Update Driver (may not do</strong> <strong>anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi</strong>
<strong>Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.</strong><br />
<br />
Then check the System/Motherboard Maker's Site and that of the actual device maker (such as Intel,&nbsp;RealTek, Broadcom, or Atheros) for even newer drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />

            For one where I uninstall the network driver, how do I know which to choose? You said to write the name and I see Intel &nbsp;PROset and when I click it all that happens is it asked me to "Import wireless profiles." You also said to find it in Network but all
 that's there is Network and Internet if that's what you mean. If so, where do I find the name of the model of wifi and how do I uninstall?

<p>I had the same problem, I use a Netgear extender and couldn't get my wifi to stay connected so this is what I did and it seems to be working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click on the properties for your wifi connection.</p>
<p>2. Write down both the IPv4 DNS servers for your connection.</p>
<p>3.Go to Network and Internet Settings.</p>
<p>4. Change adapter options</p>
<p>5. Right click on your wifi and go to properties</p>
<p>6.Under Networking tab click on Internet Protocol Version 4</p>
<p>7. Click on properties</p>
<p>8. Under the General Tab select button&nbsp; Use the following DNS server addresses</p>
<p>9. Enter the IPv4 DNS servers that you wrote down in #2.</p>
<p>10. Click OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this works for you, so far it's worked for me.&nbsp; I tried all the other stuff like release, renew, yadayadayada, nothing worked so I thought I would try this and so far it's worked and I've stayed connected.</p>

<h2>            Did Xbox One get proper Color Space settings like Brightness and contrast etc&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Never could get Xbox 360 look fully to satisfaction.</p>
<p>The DVB-T box of TV-set really is what I set everything on TV - and expect to adjust Xbox settings to how display is set.</p>
<p>So I wanted the usuall custom settings that even simple DVD players have - brightness, contrast, color saturation, gamma and some have sharpness stuff.</p>
<p>This is vital for me to select Xbox One.</p>

<p>Thanks for any input on this.</p>

<p>I don't think it does, but the only setting that should be necessary is in-game gamma adjustment.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>All the other picture settings should be handled on the display end and the sending device should simply follow spec (such as Rec. 709 and so on). DVD players with built-in controls for contrast, saturation and so on only serve to impair the final output
 quality.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The Xbox 360 we know does not follow spec, hopefully the Xbox One does.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>But what good did it do so far saying that developers should have done this, Microsoft should have done that - nothing.</p>
<p>It just leaves us whining here, doesn't it.</p>
<p>Do people with DVD players say:</p>
<p>- No, you used the wrong color space for your machine, my films looks terrible.</p>
<p>No, they don't have to, since you can customize as well, if none of the fixed spaces work well for your display device.</p>
<p>You can always make your DVD films look good - whatever DVD player you buy.</p>
<p>I can do nothing to my DVB-T box, and what color space it creates from broadcasts. That sets my display device.</p>
<p>So anything external, HDMI or other need to adjust to a particular device - not the other way round.</p>
<p><strong>I think best chance is to create awareness to Microsoft before throwing money their way.</strong></p>
<p>Before we buy the machine, and the games and creating new income on Gold memberships.</p>
<p>I know I won't make the the same mistake twice.</p>
<p>I never anticipated, coming from PS3 and having no issues, that going Xbox would give me issues.</p>
<p>PS4 releases next week in sweden, and Xbox One not until next year - Q1 probably.</p>
<p><strong>So I won't wait for Xbone, if that is true what you said - no such settings to get the most out of third generation Xbox either.</strong></p>

                    My lexmark printer stopped working yesterday. &nbsp;I uninstalled it and now when I re-installed it, I get all the way through but it won't print, not even a test page. &nbsp;I get a box that says turn on "enable bidirectional communication". &nbsp;Can you please tell

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Step 01:</span></p>
<p>The spooler provides support for bidirectional ("BiDi") communication between an application or driver and a printer, so that the printer and computer can exchange data.<br />
This support enables the application or driver to send one or more requests to the printer, and the printer to respond to these requests. For more information visit the link below:<br />
<strong><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff544973.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff544973.aspx</a></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 02:</span></p>
<p>Follow these steps to enable Bidirectional communication to the printer.<br />
a. Click on <strong>Start </strong>button, and type <strong>Devices and Printer</strong>in search box, press enter to open it.
<br />
b. Select your <strong>printer</strong> and check it is selected as the default printer.<br />
c. Now, right-click on the printer and select "Properties"<br />
d. In <strong>ports</strong> tab, make sure<strong>enable bidirectional support</strong> is selected.<br />
e. If it is enabled, disable it and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to follow the link and check.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 anniversary ed. won&#39;t install on Lenovo g570</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying to get the Anniversary Edition update to install on my Lenovo G570. Windows10 works fine. It's all stock hardware except for the hard drive which I upgraded to a 2T drive ( 500 set aside for Windows system with about 75% free).</p>
<p>The install progresses to the first reboot, then either comes up with a blank black screen or a "Working on updates 0%" screen and halts. I've left it there for 3 days each time.</p>
<p>I've re-downloaded the ISO, completely removed antivirus, gone into System configuration and set it to diagnostic, run SFC, run chkdsk for disk errors, and removed and even hardware disabled the wireless lan ( there's a hard switch to do that not just software).
 The result - it's always the same : the black screen or working with 0%. Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>While I am guessing your reply was meant to be helpful it is nothing useful. I myself have been doing this professionally since '89 and while your statement is accurate about clean installs being better it is nothing but snobbery in regards to consumer level
 tech which has normally NOT come with a clean OS-only install medium since Windows 7, and I am unlucky enough to remember when that trend started with Windows 95.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case of this particular Lenovo model, there was no recovery/OS disk unless you made one (guess what the first thing I did was). Even when you did make it, it came with the bloatware that makes me sincerely hate all computer makers. Indeed, Dell, HP,
 and Lenovo business class systems now come with crapware pre-installed on the recovery images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So unless I go buy a copy Windows 10 there is no clean install for me to do.</p>

            My system should be ableto take this. My wife has the exact same model (with the exception of her still having the factory hard drive). Hers is currently sitting at 1607, which went in with none of the extra trouble shooting I have been going through.
 Mine on the other hand just sits at the first reboot at either a black screen or Working on updates 0% with no HDD activity for days.

            <p>Sorry for my short temper on this, but it has been very frustrating, seeing as how I've been trying to get this to install for two weeks now. Your comment that in place upgrades are inferior (yes yes) and a tech enthusiast would only do clean installs came
 across as condescending and not really helpful (see the ending of the paragraph below)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree that a clean install is *usually* the best, but that's something that should not need to be done in this case since the upgrade is going onto a relatively clean system - as in unlike my wife's machine this has only Windows 10, the needed (as in MS
 didn't supply) drivers, Bitdefender, and chrome as a second (not primary) browser as I was using it solely for getting familiar with Win10, browsing related to that (support.microsoft.com, etc), and email related to that (outlook.com). Since I have removed
 BD and Chrome, CCleaner comes up clean, SFC comes up clean, and the same drivers are in use on my wife's machine's successful install what can you suggest? Besides, if the next auto-installing "update" blows up (and this is really an upgrade despite MS labeling
 it as an update) I'd kind of like to know what the potential issues are so I don't have to deal with my wife chewing my **** over her machine not being usable while I fresh install it. It was a pain enough to get her to get off Windows 7 and that was just
 her not wanting to go to 10 rather than a tech issue.<br />
</p>
<p>BTW - I used the media creation tool to download an ISO 4 times so far - the first gave me an ISO that passed the verification phase but was in reality corrupted, and the other three times gave me an ISO that, while booting and starting, would eventually
 come to a point where it would not &nbsp;proceed with the install with a message saying the disc was an "upgrade" and therefore had to be started from inside Windows. I'm now downloading the ISO again (sigh) from the https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO/
 link on a different machine (Linux this time) and will try that but I'm not optimistic. All I have found so far is one person after another complaining about similar issues on other makes and models of machines with no real clue as to the cause or how to solve
 it.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's almost as though the installer doesn't have anything is place to handle a race or panic condition, or a driver that misbehaves, to be able to gracefully say "Oops - the upgrade fell down and went BOOM because ______". A nice log file to review would
 be helpful. If you know of one to look at I dig it out and post it.</p>

            <p>So here, in TLDR format, is the issue I'm running into.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. On a almost completely clean Windows download the ISO.</p>
<p>2. Run setup from within Windows</p>
<p>3. Install proceeds and does first reboot.</p>
<p>4. Reboot comes up to either a blank black screen or "Working on updates 0%". It stays there (I've let it sit for 3 days).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dirty companion system worked fine on the Windows Update install where this one did the black screen for a day and a half.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't mean the issue was with the media creation tool, the blank/0% screen is with the actual install.

<h2>            Tablet rings but I can&#39;t answer</h2>
                    <p>My Android tablet rings and Skype comes up, but the "telephone icon" won't let me interact with it. Nothing I do with anything on the screen--basically the phone number and the telephone icon--seems to matter.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Off in the distance, I can hear my computer ringing. I know that I can answer the phone there, but the goal was to be able to answer the phone on my tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the time, it rings until it goes to voicemail. On rare occasions, it will actually let me answer the phone by pressing a green icon as opposed to a red icon for hanging up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can place calls. The only problem there is that I cannot traverse phone trees because the tonee are not usually recognized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this so that I can answer on my Lenovo Tab 4 tablet? Being able to use phone trees would also be a big plus.</p>

<h2>            Brother Printer - InBox Driver</h2>
                    
<p>Brother MFC9600 problems printing with some programs, and will not print more than one copy.</p>
<p>Tried to uninstall and got 'log file "c:\brmflpro\delisli.isu" is not valid or has been corrupted. Uninstall will not continue.</p>
<p>Tried to reinstall from cd, and got; 'The MFL Pro software is already installed. To reinstall please uninstall first.</p>
<p>When i restart the computer I get a message that Brother is downlaoding configurinformation so you can set up your MFC. But then another error message comes on saying to "re-try" this job and check connections ect.. Next I get an error message that says
 'remote set up for ZL/FB (32bit) has encountered a problem and needs to close.</p>
<p>I called brother. We did a few things and they could not help. They told me to contact Microsoft. They said an "Inbox Driver" should fix the problem.</p>
<p>I know the basics of computers, but i am NOT good with all the real technical stuff. Can someone help me with this???</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Not surprisingly, Brother support is shining you on.&nbsp; What they mean by an "in box driver" is a driver that is built-in to Windows XP.&nbsp; Although Windows XP does have a large number of "in box" drivers, it doesn't have (an easily accessible) one for the Brother
 MFC 9600 (but see link below).&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the problems is that this is such an ancient printer that Brother doesn't offer a Windows XP driver for it.&nbsp; So, did Brother support tell you<strong>which&nbsp;
</strong>"in box driver" would work for you?</p>
<p>It's possible that if you instruct the Windows XP "Add Printer" wizard to look at Windows Update, it might find a driver ... but first see this thread:<a href="http://thedailyreviewer.com/windowsxp/view/brother-mfc9600-and-xp-11132350" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://thedailyreviewer.com/windowsxp/view/brother-mfc9600-and-xp-11132350</a></p>
<p>You should uninstall the old driver first:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Printers and Faxes, right click the icon for the MFC-9600 and delete it.</li><li>Go to the File menu of Printers and Faxes, click Server Properties, click the Drivers tab and remove the listed driver for the MFC-9600.</li><li>Reboot. </li></ol>
<p>Now connect the printer using a USB cable and -- hopefully -- windows will detect it as a Plug-n-Play device and install the proper driver.</p>
<p>Whether you will be able to use the other features of the device, or of the Brother software, is another story ... and I don't know the answer.</p>

<p>Is the printer connected directly to the computer you are trying to print from? Or is it connected to another computer that is networked to the one you are trying to print from? Or is it a directly networked printer? Is it hard wired, or is it a Wi-Fi&nbsp;connection?</p>

<p>The printer is both hardwired and wireless.&nbsp; I can scan and fax with no problems.&nbsp; No printing though. It worked fine until 2 days ago when Quickbooks was updated.&nbsp; It is a home business computer so not attached to any other PCs or laptops.&nbsp; All reports
 and fixing software I have run return a "no problem" report.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Could QuickBooks have affected it?</p>

<p>Yeah, Quickbooks would be the obvious&nbsp;cause of your problem. I can't say I've ever seen it cause that particular issue, but that is the circumstantial&nbsp;cause. See if you have a restore point previous to the installation of the Quickbooks program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have done any work with the new Quickbooks make sure you save it and back it up to off computer storage. The restore will wipe the Quickbooks install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to System, About (at bottom of the list&nbsp;on the left side), System info (under related settings header), System protection (in the list on left), click on the System Restore button. You will get a box that says Restore system files and settings. Click
 the "next" button. On the next system restore box tick the box that says show more restore points. If you have multiple restore points in the list highlight the point you want to return to (by clicking it). Click next. The "confirm your restore point" box
 will come up. Click finish and let it run. It can take a while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After it tells you that your system has been restored check your printer. Hopefully, it will be working properly again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all that works then you will need to investigate the Quickbooks you installed, to see if there are any known bugs that would cause your&nbsp;problem.</p>

            I'm sorry I just realized&nbsp;you said it was a Quickbooks update that ran just before your issue started. Just use a restore point to before the update time. You should still have Quickbooks, but without the update.

<p>If that doesn't do the trick check with HP for the entire&nbsp;software suite for that printer, not just the drivers. Multitudes of people have been having printer issues with each major Win10 update (the twice-yearly updates that get the new version numbers).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had to do complete uninstall of printers including the software suites on multiple printers to get them working again. Sometimes&nbsp;the manufacturers&nbsp;update their software suites. Depends on the age of the printer. But even without
 manufacturer&nbsp;updates, sometimes a clean install will get things working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try to clean install the printer in a compatibility mode for an older version of Windows. Some have reported that that method works. There are a few tutorials for installing in compatibility&nbsp;modes in the forums so I
 won't clog things up any&nbsp;more here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you get anywhere with the problem.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, we cannot restore files to Windows XP if the files are backed up via Backup and Restore Center in
 Windows Vista. </span></p>
<p><span>In addition, if you use the Complete PC Backup function and you would like to restore the files to another computer;
 this computer needs to have the exact same hardware in order for that system to boot. Since a Complete PC backup consists of an entire system, including the device drivers specific to that system, restoring that backup to a system with different hardware will
 result in many errors.</span></p>
<p><span>Currently, if you backed up files via Backup and Restore Center (not Complete PC Backup), you can restore the files
 to a computer running Windows Vista. If you have only a computer that is running Windows XP, you need to install Windows Vista on it first and then restore files to the Windows Vista. Within the Restore Files wizard, you have the ability select individual
 files to restore from your backup.</span></p>

<h2>            Anyone know how to save the game</h2>
                    
<p>Save points seem really infrequent and you have to back a fair bit when you play again.</p>
<p>If you choose the right hand menu button on controller and choose Return to Hud you are told you will loose all progress in the level and you do.&nbsp; Hit the button again after this and you get a "Save and Exit" option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How and where can you save the game when you want to?&nbsp; Very frustrating but other wise a great game for me to play along with my 8 year old.&nbsp; When he gets stuck I help himm when I am stuck he helps me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not nearlly finsihed and I've started playing on my own account see if I can find out anything else.&nbsp; Not sure my game even started in the right place</p>

<p>This is so frustrating and spoiling the game for me.</p>
<p>I'm still near startof game (Bricksville I think it's called) Last night I played for a couple of hours collected over 500,000 pieces as I went. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Went into the construction yard, built the porch, fixed the wrecking ball, got the piece of resistance met WildStyle, defeated the president guy (big guy) .</p>
<p>I then wanted to save.</p>
<p>The only option I have when I press the menu button is to "Exit to HUB" &nbsp;When I choose this it says I will loose all progress in the level. &nbsp;If I choose No then I can't save, If I choose Yes then I'm back when I started without WildStyle. &nbsp;I can then choose
 the menu buttom again and I get the option to Save and Exit.</p>
<p>I'm sure this is wrong and this Save and Exit option should be available when choosing to "Return to HUB"</p>
<p>Playing for 2 hours at a time and not getting any save points seems wrong</p>

<p>Okay I can now answer my own question.</p>
<p>You must play your way through a certain amout of the game before the "Save and Exit" option is available at the first time of asking. &nbsp;Not sure how much you have to play but at least the prelude.</p>
<p>Now to get those 2 Billion buttons.......</p>

<p>I played through until first seeing Wyldstyle - went to try and find where to save, this is after doing virtuvius level, and the construction level. Exited out of the game when the game crashed while falling to where the piece of resistance is, once I came
 back and went to load save game, there was nothing at all, not even to the construction area. Had to start right from the beginning again.</p>
<p>Tried again - exited out correctly and saved and exited, then still nothing - no save games even when doing it correctly.

            Hi JacquelineEllis1 .
<br />
<br />My name is Douglas and I am an Independent Advisor.
<br />I would like to help you.
<br />
<br />To change sounds, right-click the Start button, click Control Panel, Hardware, and Sound, and then click Change System Sounds (under the Sound heading).
<br />
<br />Here, you can click on the various sounds in the Events window of the program, then click on the test button below to hear the relevant noise that is playing. To get rid of a sound, click on the drop-down menu next to the Test button, scroll to the top of the list and select None.
<br />
<br />You can save the changes you make as a new sound profile (apart from the Windows default): use the Save as button in Sound scheme. You can also select No sounds as a scheme here if you prefer that Windows never make any noise.
<br />
<br /> the most recent versions of Windows 10 there is also an option for 'less sounds', which aims to find a balance between offering system sounds but without disturbing it.

            Hi Criss.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg, This is a fresh install of win10 pro with all the latest drivers installed.</p>
<p>The problem is not a performance issue, the start menu is buggy, the most used apps list keeps forgetting the apps after restarts, and sometimes it shows them back on its own.</p>
<p>I already reported this as a problem through the feed back hub, my question is: is there any thing i can do to fix this bug, any missing utilities, apps, tools, any thing to change?</p>
<p>Than you in advance.</p>

            The Install Integrity and Performance Checklist I gave you will usually find the problem and fix it.  But you actually have to do the steps.

<br />Compare the Install you did with the gold-standard  Install in this link which compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  The reason I suggest this is because no one of the several million consumers who have performed my Clean Install tutorials over the past ten years has ever come back to report an issue if they stick with the tools and methods given.

<p>This is how i installed the operating system already on a formatted ssd drive with most of the steps in the like taken in confederation.</p>
<p>This is seems like a misbehavior from the most used apps list, not sure what is causing it though, its a fresh OS could be a bug in win10 it self.&nbsp;

<p>Hello Kapil,</p>
<p>I tried that and still the issue remains, even thought this is a fresh copy of win10 pro, But i have experienced this problem before for a long time on my past windows 10 copy and i thought upon a fresh install it will vanish, yet is sustained. Any other
 ideas i could use ?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />The problem is because of registry keys that affect appearance of the list 
<br />
<br />You need a third party W10Privacy software, for most used apps list issue:
<br />
<br />1. Install W10Privacy  from 
<br /><a href="https://www.winprivacy.de/english-home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.winprivacy.de/english-home/</a>
<br />
<br />2. In .explorer tab, uncheck the option "Disable the collection of information about running programs and opened files".
<br />
<br />3. Disable "Do not show frequently used files" .
<br />
<br />4. Restart windows and check. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            How can I temporarily drop down the task bar at the bottom of the desktop&#63;</h2>
                    I was trying to downloan Skype, but the bottom task bar interferred with my being able to run the download because that bar was directly behind the task bar.

<h2>            New Surface Pro 2017 Overheats When Drawing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just started drawing and taking notes on my new surface pro 2017 i7 8 Gb model. and every time I try to draw on it with the sketchable app the whole things starts to heat up starting from the area my palm or pen is on. It gets quite unbearable to
 use and I will be taking a lot of notes in the future. The only reassuring thing is that once I stop drawing on it the surface cools down as quick as it heated up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a missing some sort of driver to prevent the surface from over heating? No other artist I saw who reviewed this model complained about this problem. I for saw this issues in the i5 models but I though that this won't be an issue with the i7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else encountered this and fixed it?</p>

<p>We appreciate your prompt response. Aside from keeping your device updated, have you checked Task Manager if there is an application or program that consumes a lot of CPU usage while you're using the Sketchable app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've determined that there is, if it is inappropriate, you might want to stop the application or program to see if the CPU usage drops and the heating up issue is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should the issue still persists, please let us know so we can help you further.</p>

<p>Hi </p>
<p>Sorry for my delayed responce, I had to test it out multiple times to make sure. No other programs are running while I am drawing. I did however learn some new things about the problem. It would seem that whenever my surface is running at near 80-90% CPU
 it get incredible hot and this happenes when mainly when I'm coloring for long periods of time. A quick 15min sketch won't heat it up too much(it just gets warm). Additionally, I ran an anti-virus scan to be safe and that to heated it up even more than just
 drawing on it. No other applications or windows where open.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Jamie, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since the issue remains the same after following all the troubleshooting steps provided on this thread, we suggest that you perform clean boot troubleshooting to prevent unwanted processes from starting. Please follow the steps provided below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <span><strong>Task Manager</strong></span></li><li>Click <strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab</li><li>Disable each item by&nbsp;clicking to highlight the item and then click&nbsp;<span>Disable</span></li><li>After disabling all items, restart the device</li><li>Test to see if issue is still occurring</li><li>If the issue is still occurring, re-enable the Startup items and restart the device to put it back into its original state</li><li>If the issue is not occurring after disabling all of the startup items, one or more of those items is likely causing the issue. Perform the following steps to methodically isolate the cause(s) of the problem:
<ol>
<li>Re-enable the first half of the items on the <strong>Startup </strong>tab.</li><li>Restart the device and test to see if the issue occurs.</li><li>If the issue is still not occurring, disable the first half of the items then re-enable the last half of the items.</li><li>Restart the device and test to see if the issue occurs. </li><li>Continue disabling and re-enabling by "halves" until you isolate the issue to one or more of the Startup items.</li></ol>
</li></ol>

            The suggested solution didn’t work. So i come up with a work around. If i draw on it in short bursts of time it takes a lot longer to heat up to the point it gets uncomfortable and when if it does get to that point i am usually almost done draw and then
 i let it cool. In lectures it doesnt get pdf versions of the lecture before hand and annotate them on onenote to reduce the time i spend writing on the screen. Short of driving 2hours to get to the nearest microsoft store to have my surface checked out this
 became the best solution. After all, when left alone the heat does dissipate fairly quick

<p>Yes I did. There's only windows defender, one note and one drive running.</p>

<h2>            Downloaded Windows Themes doesn&#39;t appear in Personalization</h2>
                    <p>I've checked all the forums, community questions regarding the same but I'm unable to solve this.</p>
<p>Windows Themes used to work normal (it does in other accounts on same computer) but not on mine. Themes get downloaded &amp; installed, even shows up in Start but absent from Personalization menu in Settings. Also, I tried to locate the same files from AppData
 but there're none. It is to be noted that Windows Themes downloaded from Microsoft website (from Windows 7 days) work but not from Microsoft Store. I have performed every possible step (sfc scan, DISM, WSRESET- even by signing out &amp; signing in again) but NOTHING
 works.</p>

Before I could do this, I have encountered this problem that Windows Defender's real time protection is turned off (I suspect this is because of McAfee) but it is showing that Controlled Folder Access is already off with that option grayed out because Defender
 is not monitoring.<br />

I performed this 4th time but nothing changed. I mentioned the already done steps for a reason so that I don't have to do them with no luck. Seems like I am wasting my time here. Would reinstall Windows in order to make things work. Thanks everyone for not
 providing any help.<br />

<p>Is there any way to fix this?</p>

            <p>Hi Sooraj,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Has the issue started to occur recently?</li><li>Do other&nbsp;Bluetooth devices work fine when connected to the system?</li><li>Does the Bluetooth audio adapter work when connected to another system?</li></ol>
<p>If there aren't any hardware issues with the Bluetooth audio device then the issue might arise if the Bluetooth drivers in the system are corrupt/unstable or need an update to a newer driver definition. I would suggest you to try the following methods to
 troubleshoot the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 1: Run the Hardware Troubleshooter</strong></span></span></p>

<p>Hi Glen_100,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no direct upgrade from 32 to 64bit. You would need to boot from the disc and perform "custom advanced" install. Data's will be saved later on the same partition inside the folder Windows.old.</p>

<p><strong>Is my computer 64 bit capable?</strong></p>
<p>Before you can start the process to migrate to 64 bit Windows, you need to find out if your system is 64 bit capable. If you are already running a 32 bit version of Windows 8 on you system, you can find out by doing the following:</p>
<p>Press Windows key + X on your keyboard</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb3.png%3fw%3d396%26amp%3bh%3d383" height="383" width="396" /></a></p>
<p>Click <strong>System</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image4.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb4.png%3fw%3d414%26amp%3bh%3d169" height="169" width="414" /></a></p>
<p>Look under <em>System</em> &gt; <strong>System type:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>There it will list whether the processor is <strong>x64 based processor</strong> or not. In my case I have 64 bit capable processor. Once you have confirmed this, you can move on to the next step.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>For Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7 users</em></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image5.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2013%2f02%2fimage_thumb5.png%3fw%3d419%26amp%3bh%3d398" height="398" width="419" /></a></p>
<p>You can determine if your processor is 64 bit capable by using a <a href="http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
free tool called CPU-Z</a>. You can download it here. Once you have it installed, double click it and it will scan your system. Click the CPU tab and look in the
<em>Instructions </em>field, look for the instruction set called <strong>AMD64</strong> or
<strong>EM64T</strong>. If you see them, then your processor is 64 bit capable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are running a 32 bit version of Windows, whether Windows 8 or Windows 7, you need to consider carefully the steps to migrate from it to 64 bit Windows 8. Regardless of the ubiquity of 64 bit computing, key factors such as hardware and application
 compatibility remain a issue, especially for legacy systems. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does your system meet all the requirements? Having just a 64 bit capable processor is not the main go ahead for 64 bit Windows. What about other hardware such as your video card, audio device, printer and any other critical device or application you are
 using? Also, if you have less than 4 GBs of RAM, I strongly suggest you stick with 32 bit Windows 8 or consider maxing out the installed RAM before you consider upgrading and when I say maxing out, I mean 4 GBs or more.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing to do is to create an inventory of both your hardware and software programs. After doing that, go to the manufacturers website and check if there are any 64 bit drivers available. The manufacturer might not have native 64 bit Windows 8 drivers,
 but they just might have 64 bit Windows 7 and Vista drivers which should work. The reason why is Windows 8, Windows 7 and Vista all share the same driver model. Application compatibility remains critical, for instance, if you are running applications designed
 for Windows XP or apps that are not fully 32 bit, you might want to reconsider your decision. Applications that are 32 bit but might contain 16 bit code will not work with 64 bit Windows. So, you need to carefully think this true. If it ain’t broke, don’t
 try fixing it might just apply in this case. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Backup, Backup, Backup</strong></p>
<p>Once you have gathered all the necessary prerequisites such as driver updates and have certified all your applications are compatible, you need to backup your personal data. There is no upgrade path from 32 bit versions of Windows to Windows 8 64 bit. Yes,
 that means you will have to reinstall all your drivers (64 bit native drivers) and applications. Some additional configuration might be required on your part.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to handle some of the migration chores is by using the built in Windows Easy Transfer utility (specifically) for Windows 7 users. If you are running Windows Vista or Windows XP, make sure you
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">download the free Windows Easy Transfer utility</a>, install it and create a backup of your personal files and settings. Lets take a look at doing that.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/image4.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f06%2fimage_thumb4.png%3fw%3d437%26amp%3bh%3d345%26amp%3bh%3d345" height="345" width="437" /></a>

</p>
<p>You have a few options to choose from, the best one would be an external hard disk which is excellent for storing large amounts of information. If you don’t have an external hard disk, you can save your backup to a network share if one is available.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/image6.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f06%2fimage_thumb6.png%3fw%3d436%26amp%3bh%3d344%26amp%3bh%3d344" height="344" width="436" /></a>

</p>
<p>Open the external hard disk and save the file there, you can give a unique file name if you wish.

</p>
<p>Wait while your items are backed up and saved. This can take some time depending on the amount of information you have stored.
</p>
<p>Once your files are backed up, its time to start the migration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you attempt to start the installation of a 64 bit version of Windows from within a 32 bit version of Windows, you will receive the following error message.</p>

<p>Which is understandable, since you are running a 32 bit version of Windows. To begin the installation, we will need to restart the computer and boot from the disc or USB thumbdrive which contains the installation files. So, click the close button.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart your computer then load your BIOS and set it to boot from your DVD drive or USB thumb drive. You might need to consult your computer manual for instructions how to do this. See the following article for additional instructions.</p>

<div>Hi sanjay 25 kumar sharma,</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>There could be a number of factors as to why you are experiencing cursor issue in Windows 10. I'd like to know more about your concern. Are you using a mouse or a touchpad? Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Meanwhile, I suggest that you run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <strong>Start menu</strong>, type <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> and then hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Under <strong>Find and fix other problems</strong>, click <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>, and then select
<strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>.</li></ol>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, you can consider disabling the <strong>Enhance pointer precision</strong> feature by following the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <strong>Start menu</strong>, type <strong>Mouse setting</strong> and then click the result.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>Additional mouse options</strong> on the left side of the Mouse settings page.<br />
</li><li>Under <strong>Mouse properties</strong> window, go to <strong>Power Options</strong> tab.<br />
</li><li>Uncheck <strong>Enhance pointer precision</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong> and then hit <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
</li><li><strong>Restart</strong> your computer to apply the changes.</li></ol>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes and we'll assist you further if needed</p>
