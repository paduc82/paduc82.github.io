<h2>            SCANNER WORK AROUND, for a Microtek ScanMaker v6USL Scanner, when converting from Windows XP, to Windows 7</h2>

</p><p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: center"><strong>WORK AROUND FOR: &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p class="contentHeader2" style="text-align: center"><strong>MICROTEK ScanMaker V6USL Scanner, &nbsp;converting from XP to Windows 7</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>With one of my computers I just switched from XP, 32 bit, to Windows-7, 32 bit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an older beautiful &nbsp;8-1/2" x 14" Microtek flatbed scanner called a&nbsp;<strong>ScanMaker model "V6usl"</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Took about 10 hours to finally figure out how to get the scanner software to work in Windows 7. &nbsp;(the software is called "Scanwizard 5")</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>FIRST: and this did not work, I wasted hours attempting to use the most recent software from Microtek's website, so try at your own peril -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first downloaded the most recent "scanwizard" software that Microtek makes available at their website that is supposed to work with Windows 7, file named: "SW5_6710_EU". (omit parentheses) &nbsp;aka: scanwizard ver: 5v6.710</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried for many hours with this software, to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I found someone here at Microsoft Communities, (with a different model ScanMaker scanner than mine, but I decided to give his solution a try). &nbsp;What he did was this, and it worked for me also:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I "uninstalled" the aforementioned scanwizard "SW5_671_EU" software once and for all, and went back to the "older" software that I used when running windows XP, filed named "scanwizard 5v6.32" &nbsp;This was software that I had downloaded from Microtek back in
 2009 for Windows XP, and it worked just fine all these years until my recent upgrade to windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>The first trick is to "disable" and "stop" the "Windows Image Acquisition" service aka: "WIA".</strong> &nbsp;To do this, I clicked the start menu, typed into the search box the word "services", once the services window opened, scroll to the line that's
 listed as: "Windows Image Acquisition WIA". &nbsp;Double click that line to open the dialog box; &nbsp;select "disable" from the "Startup type" pull down menu; &nbsp;press apply; &nbsp;then hit the "stop" button at "Service status"; and that effectively kills WIA from screwing
 up Scanwizard software for Microtek's scanner under the following install process. &nbsp;(you can always turn WIA back on to automatic if you want, and start it back up, I just couldn't get scanwizard to work with it on, so I killed it. &nbsp;No other side effects so
 far by keeping it off)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Next, what I had to do to get this "older" windows XP software to work in my new installation of Windows 7 is:&nbsp;<strong>BEFORE INSTALLING THE "OLDER" SOFTWARE</strong>, and with the scanner's USB cable and power supply "unplugged" from the scanner: &nbsp;find
 the older scanner programs Setup.exe file; &nbsp;right click on this older programs Setup.exe file; &nbsp;select Properties; &nbsp;then select the "Compatibility" tab; &nbsp;then select "Run this program in compatibility mode for: &nbsp;and I selected "Windows XP SP3" from the pull
 down menu; &nbsp;then pressed the Apply button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then; double-clicked this Setup.exe file to launch the installation process as you would normally. &nbsp;After the installation process had completed; &nbsp;I plugged-in the scanner's power supply; &nbsp;then connected the scanner's USB cable to the computer; &nbsp;then rebooted
 the computer. &nbsp;To my amazement, once rebooted, I double-clicked the programs icon shortcut that installed on my desktop, and the program opened perfectly.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>I quickly did a "restore point save" not to loose any settings, etc......took too long to get these results. Tested several times, unplugging the scanner, rebooting, etc etc. and it the software launches, and all is perfect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone out before they waste much time with Microtek's newest software that is supposed to work with Windows 7, but did not work for me, after wasting many hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>good luck,</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP all-in-one curved PC with infared camera.&nbsp; Windows Hello was working fine for months.&nbsp; After a Windows update Windows Hello quit working.&nbsp; I get a message "Sorry something went wrong.&nbsp; Couldn't turn on the camera.&nbsp; Make sure it's working properly."&nbsp;
 The camera works fine in all other apps.&nbsp; If I do a system restore to before the update it works, then the update and it quits working.&nbsp; I contacted HP first, they tried to fix it.&nbsp; They couldn't.&nbsp; They referred me to Microsoft, so hear I am.&nbsp; I am physically
 disabled and this feature saves me many headaches.&nbsp; I need it to work!</p>

            Hi Geoffrey.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Turn off Fast Startup:  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br />
<br />2) Reset Facial Recognition and/or Fingerprint Options
<br />
<br />  Go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign In Options
<br />    Locate Fingerprint or Facial Recognition options and click Remove under them.
<br />    After that, click Get Started and follow the on-screen instructions to reset Fingerprint and Facial Recognition.
<br />    Reboot your PC if needed.
<br />
<br />3)  Modify Group Policy Settings  (for Pro version only)
<br />
<br />Creators Update might have modified some of the crucial settings of Group Policy. Therefore, we would recommend to launch the Group Policy Editor and check/edit the settings related to Windows Hello functionality.
<br />
<br />    Pres Windows key, type gpedit, and press Enter.
<br />    Click on Computer Configuration and open Administrative Templates.
<br />    Select Windows Components and open Biometrics.
<br />    Click on Facial Features and right-click on Configure enhanced anti-spoofing option.
<br />    Select Edit and disable the Configure enhanced anti-spoofing feature.
<br />    Reboot your PC.
<br />
<br />4) Update drivers
<br />
<br />If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform. To fix that, try to update the corresponding drivers:
<br />
<br />    Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager.
<br />    Locate the Hello, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually and right-click on each of them.
<br />    Select Remove driver software and wait for the removal to be finished.
<br />    Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC.
<br />    Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />    The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers.
<br />
<br />5) Run Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />6)  If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If this was caused by April Version 1803 update (which you can check at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />7) If nothing else helps then run a Fresh Start:  <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-the-fresh-start-feature-in-windows-10-creators-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Surface Pro 3 vs MacBook Air - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dennis in wi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 vs MacBook Air</h2>
                    <p>I was all set to buy a Surface Pro 3 at the Miami MS store last night. When I handed the salesperson a thumb drive with the Windows 7 iso file on it and told him I would buy&nbsp;the Surface&nbsp;as soon as he created a VM using Hyper-V drive on the Surface&nbsp;and installed
 Win 7 on the VM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would have thought I was asking him for immediate transport to Mars. The conversation went from "Oh, you want me to take Windows 8 off the Surface&nbsp;and install Windows 7" to "We don't do that here but it is a very simple thing to do". Well I have tried
 to do it on both a desktop and a laptop with Win 8.1 Pro to no avail. Before I plunked down $1400.00 I wanted proof it could be done. So I searched the internet and this site today for some clear non-techie instructions on the "simple thing". No luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So tonight I am going to the Apple store with the same thumb drive. I am going to see if they can install Parallel and Win 7 on a MacBook Air. If they can, I will purchase that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My goal is a very light weight tablet/laptop that I can run some applications that are very important to my work. Unfortunately these apps only run on Windows 7 and IE 9. Hence the search for a solution that will allow me to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will keep everyone posted.</p>

            <p>The biggest problem you will have are what are called "motherboard resource drivers".&nbsp; I won't go any further than that but in this case, you should have listened to the salesperson!</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the MacBook Air, you may encounter the same issue within the VM Windows 7 installation.&nbsp; Macs are built with standard components, so it should work.&nbsp; A lot of other people have already done that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck and post what you find.</p>

            <p>Hal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the info. I have been able to install a VM. I cannot get the VM to recognize the USB thumb drive to load Win 7. Here is the file structure on the thumb drive.</p>

            <p>Network adapter.&nbsp; Now you can see what I mean about those drivers.&nbsp; You can install the system but does not mean you will get full function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also in Windows 7, you may not have use of the Pen either.&nbsp; BUT, you would get general use of the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MacBook Air has standard parts and all adapters have drivers in the Windows Update repository.&nbsp; People install Windows 7 in Macs all the time, especially businesses, and they work great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Pro 3 would have potential but the issues surrounding it is a question mark right now.&nbsp; Chances are, in a week or two, Microsoft might get a Firmware fix in place to get the tablets running 100%.&nbsp; The hardware works, it is the software that is the problem.&nbsp;
 Most likely, a simple utility within the system has a memory leak causing the problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had the Pro or Pro 2, the Windows Update repository does have the drivers available for those tablets, the Pro 3 is too new at the moment to have the complete set yet and relies on the onboard recovery system for those.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, from looking at some postings, Hyper V just may be the cause of the issues with the Pro 3 (power management, that is).&nbsp; That is only from a few postings and not across the board.&nbsp; But, who knows.&nbsp; If you got the Pro 3, it just might work 100% out of
 the box.&nbsp; The issues are not with all machines.</p>

            <p>In addition to what I posted, did you try the check box for "Enable virtual LAN detection"?&nbsp; I am getting to think that the driver "IS" in place for the adapter and it needs permission to access it through the firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A virtual machine is a "bubble within a bubble" and is a very secure system.&nbsp; But, it needs access to the devices in order to fully function.&nbsp; Bandwidth Management needs to be checked also.</p>

            <p>Quick Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went to the Apple store last night and looked at the MacBook Air. It was loaded with Parallels and was running both Apple stuff under the Apple OS and running Win 7 with Office. It is seamless between the two systems. I was impressed and the salesperson
 was very technically astute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will ponder this over the weekend but am leaning toward the Apple route now.</p>

            <p>Okay, now do take note: Apple does NOT ship Parallels with any of their computers.&nbsp; The unit you saw was demo model with it installed to demonstrate dual OS capability.&nbsp; You have to buy Parallels (not expensive) and want to make sure you know that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Soon after the 1st of August, I will be ordering the i3 model myself because I am starting to wonder if a lot of issues are actually "user generated" even though the user may not be aware of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some people are having no issues with the tablets and a bulk of others have the main problem of the WiFi adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your instance, you want to use it as a Windows 7 machine running IE 9.&nbsp; That is not a wise choice even though your company uses that.&nbsp; First of all, in Windows 8, Internet Explorer does have the compatibility mode for web sites and it does work pretty
 good.&nbsp; Also, Windows 8 will run just about every program that Windows 7 will run.&nbsp; In fact, Windows 8 is actually built from Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the MacBook Air is a good machine.&nbsp; It is quite capable of running all three main operating systems (OS/X, Windows, and Linux).&nbsp; It does not have a touchscreen if you are needing that capability and the use of a pen/stylus.&nbsp; It is plausible that an
 update coming across the MacBook could crash the virtual machine setup and you could lose both systems.&nbsp; Chances are extremely rare for that to happen but it has happened in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is totally up to you.&nbsp; The issues of the Pro 3 will eventually get worked out.&nbsp; The hardware itself DOES work.&nbsp; That is not the problem.&nbsp; It is the software drivers causing the problems and that is fixable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, before you plop down money for anything, rethink your options.&nbsp; The Mac is a good machine.&nbsp; But, the Pro 3 has the potential of being a good machine as well.</p>

            <p>James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for a well thought out&nbsp;reply. I always appreciate additional information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was aware that Apple does not sell, ship, or support Parallel. I would order the MacBook from MacMall and they will preinstall Parallel ($70).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The primary program I need is Oracle's UPK which does not run on Win 8 (although the just released version, 12.1, reportedly does). This weekend I will test UPK version 12.1 on my current Win 8.1 laptop to see if it works and if the output from that version
 is backward compatible with the version (11.2)&nbsp;we are using. In addition, IE10 and 11 have compatibilty problems with UPK in the Player mode. In fact our company auto updates my laptop with IE10 three or four times a week and I have to take time to uninstall
 it each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My win 8.1 desktop has a touch screen and I find I never use it. So the touch screen is not a big deal. My tablet also has a touch screen and that is what I use for reading, movies, etc. when I want entertainment. For work I am old fashioned and prefer a
 PC/laptop with a mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the issues with the Pro 3, I cannot get Hyper-V to work on my year old Win 8.1 laptop. So if they cannot get the software straightened out on my laptop in a year, how long will it take them to get around to the Pro 3? Also Hyper-V will not even install
 correctly on my desktop 8.1 machine. So I don't have a lot of confidence in ever seeing Hyper-V working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks again for your valuable insights,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dennis</p>

            <p>Now for VM, you don't exactly have to use Hyper V.&nbsp; Oracle does have "VirtualBox" and if you check with their web site, you can download it and they have documentation for it as well.&nbsp; May not be 'user friendly' in the setup but should work.&nbsp; You also have
 the commercial "VMWare" as well.</p>

<h2>            game ended when I had tiles left </h2>
                    I was notified that I lost a game after an opponent played a word that put him one point in the lead. I have one tile in my rack that is playable. Why, with playable tiles, would the game end?

<p>It's because the other player used up all their tiles first.</p>
<p>From the rules post pinned in this forum:</p>
<p>[quote]AlphaJax End Game</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The game ends when one player plays every tile in his rack, and there are no tiles remaining to draw from. Alternatively, the game ends in the event of three continuous passes from each player.[/quote]</p>

            From Skype
<br />We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018. As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://blogs.skype.com/news/2018/07/16/upgrade-to-the-latest-version-of-skype-for-desktop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.skype.com/news/2018/07/16/upgrade...</a>
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect is, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<h2>            Delay in function key response</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: function keys, drivers</p>
<p>Been working through lots of issues all of a sudden with a month old Asus K50IJ running Win 7 64-bit. Addressed some BSODs by updating drivers (specifically VGA) from the manufacturers website that seem to be helping. The interesting new development is that
 my function keys are now suffering from what seems to be a 30 second delay. When I hold the fn key and, say, try to raise the volume nothing happens... for half a minute... and then it responds. I haven't been able to find anyone else having trouble in this
 vein so any insight would be much appreciated!</p>

            Hi Altora.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Keep in mind Reset doesn't even wipe the drive so at any time you can do the vastly superior Clean Install following the illustrated steps in this link which include everything that works best in Windows 10:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To get the extra staging space needed for the Reset, I'd delete all of his files and then run Disk Cleanup, after it first scans choose to include System FIles, then run it and it should give you enough space.  But Reset depends on the quality of the present install, so don't be surprised if it fails.  Then you should just create the bootable media following steps in the first link to get an install that never has any return problems if you follow the steps exactly.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Altora
<br />
<br />What size internal storage is on that laptop, is that 32GB (29.1Gb usable) or is there more storage on that laptop?
<br />
<br />Windows 10 will need to create a large swap spce on your hard drive to reset the laptop, if that is a 32GB drive, you will never be able to get enough space to reset Windows . . .
<br />
<br />If that laptop has more space than 32GB, please let me know . . .
<br />
<br />If that has a 32GB SSD, you would be amazed how many users with 32GB of internal storage ask the exact same question here on Community each day . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer,  backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you 10GB more internal storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues

<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

    <title>How do I replace missing dll files in Windows 7. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I replace missing dll files in Windows 7.</h2>
                    I am missing some dll files that are preventing the program Evidence eliminator from working in Windows 7, Ultimate edition. I have no image backup or restore point that will recover these files. I tried doing an install of Windows 7, but as Windows 7
 is not having any startup issues, I'm not asked for the installation disk. Is there any way of reinstalling these files without doing a custom install???<br />

            Maybe I'm tired but I must be missing something in your question. The program that is NOT working is Evidence Eliminator and you do not have a copy of the program to reinstall?<br />
You should be able to extract the files from the 30 day trial version here: <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Security/Secure-cleaning/Evidence-Eliminator.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.softpedia.com/get/Security/Secure-cleaning/Evidence-Eliminator.shtml</a><br />
<br />
If you are missing some windows 7 systems files you could do a repair install of W7 to correct any system issues:<br />

<h2>            HP printer won&#39;t print after FRESH&#47;CLEAN reinstall of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My specs: </p>
<p>Gigabyte GA-990FXA-UD3 Motherboard</p>
<p>AMD 8150 BE Processor at stock speed (3.6 ghz/4.2 ghz turbo)</p>
<p>ASUS GTX 1070 STRIX-O8G Graphics Card</p>
<p>Creative SB X-fi PCI-Express 1x (Really old but WAY better than on-board audio)</p>
<p>16 gig (2 x 8 gig) Gskill Value Ram</p>
<p>HP Deskjet 1512 All-in-One Printer</p>
<p>
</p><p>My specs have been the same since Windows 10 launch. The only upgrade since then was the Graphics card and everything was fine for the last 7 months that I've had it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>YES!!! My drivers are up to date! I just reinstalled them!!! (NOT from the original disk!!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read a lot about how people can't get their printers to work after upgrading to Windows 10. That is NOT my problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had Windows 10 since launch. I've had my printer (see above) since Windows 7. The other day, I did a FRESH and CLEAN install of Windows 10, just like I do every 6 months or so, and then anti-virus and then the printer and my printer worked fine but
 only right after the install. I know this because I always print a test page. Then I installed graphics, sound, gaming controllers software, and other extra programs like Office. All of a sudden my printer wouldn't print.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The description of the problem goes like this:</p>
<p>Press the print button and Windows shows all the appropriate screens for me to modify my print and then press the actual print button and nothing happens. Ran "Print Doctor" and no issues came up. in fact, there were no prints in the que. The computer won't
 even send the print to que! Then I thought, "maybe system files are getting corrupted", so I brought up "Command Prompt" (As admin) and ran sfc/scannow. Nothing was missing or corrupted. I even tried the whole "unplug both ends of the power cord and hold down
 the power button for 30 sec." thing. That is probably the biggest joke for a fix ever. That's never worked for me EVER, on any peripheral! I got frustrated so I started playing Battlefield 1. I set all my in-game settings back to their original position (which
 doesn't take much since ORIGIN saves settings too) and tried to play. I used to run at 80+ FPS and now I run at a maximum of 55 FPS and am dipping into the low 40's sometimes. SO... I reinstalled the printer (Just the printer) and this time it wouldn't connect
 during that step of the installation process. I got frustrated and 2 days later, I did a FRESH/CLEAN reinstall of Windows 10, again, just to make sure that I really wasn't a &amp;!%#ing ID10T, and installed the printer first thing. Test page printed perfectly!
 I thought it was all over and then I reinstalled all of the rest of my computer (Which takes time!) and VOILA, printer won't print!!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't read any posts that deal with my specific problem but they are similar. Most can see their print in their que, it just won't print. Some can't connect their printer at all and some have a printer error that says the printer is not connected. These
 problems are not the problem that I'm experiencing. I suspect (not sure) that it is a later update to Windows 10 that's causing the issue. Just a guess though!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm gonna try and reinstall Windows, AGAIN, and this time I'm gonna print a test page after every driver I install. In the mean time, does anyone have any insight?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!!!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been a known issue between the manufacturer of your device and the previous releases of Windows 10, which has been resolved on the very launch of Windows 10 Creators Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please confirm if your computer is running the latest build (15063.447) of Windows 10. To check, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Press <em><strong>Windows key + R</strong></em>, then type in <em><strong>winver</strong></em>.</li><li>Click <em><strong>OK</strong></em>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In case your computer isn't running the latest build, we suggest downloading the latest Windows 10 ISO using the Media Creation Tool on this
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

                    Similar to another post I saw, after getting my new Surface Pro 4 and allowing it to do the upgrade to Windows 10, it now won't recognize my face or PIN and I can not get past the log in screen.&nbsp; the post I saw was from18 months ago--would have liked to
 think they had fixed this by now or at least warned me.&nbsp; Very frustrating! Beyond spending 12 hours doing a recovery USB drive, are there other options to fix this?&nbsp; thanks

<p>I have had this problem with my Surface Pro 4 for several months. After EVERY Windows update, it seems to break and I have had to RESET my System each time.&nbsp; When I go to [Settings]--&gt;[Accounts]--&gt;[Sign-in options], it states that "Windows Hello isn't available
 for this device". I have contacted Microsoft Technical Support several times (3 or 4) for this with only a temporary resolution (which includes RESETTING my system). After each windows update, it breaks again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look under [Device Manager] and [Surface Camera Windows Hello], the Device Status states "No drivers are installed for this device". This is despite the [Driver] tab shows the driver version 1.0.75.1.&nbsp; When I restart my system, the IR Camera does
 not turn on and Windows States that it "Couldn't turn on the camera". However, I ran the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit and the IR Camera (all cameras) seems to work through the Toolkit and the driver is enabled for the IR Camera. The Front and Rear Cameras also
 work in the Camera app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of note, the 2 problems I consistently find in the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit (ver 1.1.50.0; OS 10.0.15063) are (1) System Assessment Test fails and (2) Windows Update Check.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been very disappointed with Microsoft and Surface support so far. This is so frustrating. Also, the folks at MS Tech Support has not had any good resolution and I am constantly repeating myself. In fact, the Tech today just hung up on our service
 chat for no reason and without warning! This may be why Consumer Reports gave the Surface such scathing reviews.</p>

            <p>I checked out the referenced link and tried to use its suggestions, but nothing helped.</p>
<p>I spent several hours trying to fix the problem and apparently succeeded by doing this.&nbsp; Using Command Prompt and msconfig I rebooted windows in "Diagnostic Startup" mode, and waited an hour to see if it froze.&nbsp; It didn't, so I started adding "Services"
 back in, a few letters at a time, rebooting after each adjustment and waiting about an hour to see if the machine froze up.&nbsp; After doing this several times I narrowed the problem down to one service that caused the system to freeze each time it was enabled.&nbsp;
 The service causing the problem is SuperFetch.&nbsp; As long as that service is disabled, the machine performs as it should.&nbsp; I don't have any idea why SuperFetch would cause this issue.&nbsp;
<strong>Do</strong> <strong>You?</strong></p>
<p>My system is now configured by MSconfig as follows:</p>
<p>Selective Startup is checked as well as all three boxes below,</p>
<p>Every Service is enabled except SuperFetch</p>
<p>All Startup files are enabled.</p>
<p>I understand the purpose of SuperFetch but would like to know why it causes the freeze.&nbsp;&nbsp; Possibly the above procedure can be of assistance to someone else.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your clear response</p>
<p>You successfully set exactly what is&nbsp;needed to test if power is causing&nbsp;SuperFetch freeze</p>
<p>Next step is to re-enable SuperFetch to see if freezes or not after 15-20 minutes</p>
<p>If it still freezes then we can assume that power is not the cause of the problem,</p>
<p>and power settings can be reset back again, or to whatever you want.</p>
<p>If it does not freeze then&nbsp;we can assume power was indeed the cause of the problem,</p>
<p>and may want to keep it at Never.</p>

            <p>After validating my setting with your data, I turned on SuperFetch and rebooted my PC.&nbsp; I left it unattended for about 20 minutes and when I checked it, it had frozen up.&nbsp; I could only turn power off by the main power switch.&nbsp; I turned the PC&nbsp;back on and
 left the power settings the way I had set them, and disabled SuperFetch.&nbsp; It has worked fine since then.&nbsp; Power option had no effect.&nbsp; It has to associated with SuperFetch.</p>

            I've researched Superfetch a little bit. &nbsp;My understanding is that it is supposed to help speed up competer startup and load applications faster. How badly do I need it or should I just forget it.&nbsp;

            <p>Best to keep SuperFetch&nbsp;for better performance,&nbsp; but for now disable&nbsp;it until diagnosed and fixed.</p>
<p>SuperFetch uses directory \windows\prefetch\ to reduce the time to boot PC and to launch apps by storing a history of users previous&nbsp;activity to modify timings, stored as&nbsp;binary data into multiple files with the file extension name of _.pf Performance is
 slower without it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Test hardware:&nbsp;</p>
<p>SuperFetch&nbsp;depends on good RAM, good disk so I would&nbsp;run a memory RAM test and a chkdisk test. Search for Memory with Settings selected, then click "Diagnose your computer's memory problems"m and run it.</p>
<p>Find errors in logs:</p>
<p>Run, eventvwr to launch EventViewer, Windows Logs, System, left click on Level several times until Critical, or Error,or &nbsp;Warning&nbsp;(not just Info) &nbsp;shows at the top. Read each entry to view when PC crashed and maybe what caused it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Optional attempt to rebuild SuperFetch</p>
<p>Right click lower left Start corner to open&nbsp;QuickMenu,</p>
<p>then left click Command Prompt (Admin) to run&nbsp;Command Line CMD&nbsp;with elevated&nbsp;Administrator right,&nbsp;then&nbsp;very carefully type each line of Service Control parameters,&nbsp;then&nbsp;press the enter key after each line:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sc&nbsp; config&nbsp;&nbsp; SysMain&nbsp;&nbsp; start=auto <br />
</p>
<p>sc&nbsp; start&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SysMain</p>

            Yes, you can move it to another computer as long as it's only installed on one computer at a time. The previous Windows 7 installation must be formatted/deleted. You might have to call Microsoft and explain what happened to complete the activation. Activating
 it on the second computer will automatically deactivate the license for the first computer.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have trouble activating Windows 7:<br />
<br />
While installing Windows 7 at the enter your product key page, do not enter your key and uncheck When you have reached the desktop, click Start, type: CMD<br />
Right click CMD, click "Run as administrator"<br />
At the command prompt, type, regedit<br />
Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersionsetup/OOBE/mediabootinstall<br />
Change its value to 0<br />
Go back to the Command Prompt, type the following:<br />
slmgr /rearm<br />
Restart the computer and use the activate windows feature to re-enter your product key<br />
<br />
<br />
Or open the Windows Activation Wizard to use the automated telephone system and activate Windows:<br />
1. Click Start, then in the Search box type:&nbsp; slui.exe 4<br />
2. Press ENTER on your Keyboard<br />
3. Select your Country.<br />
4. Select the Phone Activation option, then hold for a real person.<br />

            <p>What I'd do is install <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Media Creation Tool</a> and either create the bootable media to have for Upgrade, repairs or reinstall, or choose Upgrade Now to directly Update to Creators Version 1703 instead of waiting for it via WIndows Update.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is solving many problems for users because it reinstalls the OS keeping all files, programs and settings in place,&nbsp; while at the same time moving you up to the latest version that has many fixes and improvements itself.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If any hurdles arise then optimize your install for the Upgrade before running it again following
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">

<h3> bmazak  say:</h3>
<h2>            task scheduler empty eventlog will not start and routing  remote has dependancy failed problems in windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I was trying to find a Windows crash problem and started to research why I could not connect to this Win 7 pro machine from my Android.&nbsp; First I saw that Routing and remote access would not start and checked all the dependencies and I found the HTTP and
 Netbios Interface were not listed as services.&nbsp; Then after reading some more stuff on the subject I found that event viewer was not starting and when I went to properties of event viewer the whole log in panel is dimmed.&nbsp; Every thing else in the registry looked
 OK.&nbsp; So then I happen to check Scheduler and and found that there are no schedules at all and I know I saw a bunch of them in there before.&nbsp; During my reading, one site suggested that the WMI database was corrupted.&nbsp; Another suggested that I run this hotfix
 for Event viewer and I did that called KB2499016 and still no fix.&nbsp; I think all these items are some how connected to the same problem. This machine keeps crashing with 0x00000001a and has no module associated in the error report.&nbsp; Any help out there?&nbsp; Should
 I do the WMI fix suggested in this post below doing the following between the double quotes:</p>

<div>Hi Chukwu,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please follow the steps and then test if the issue will re-occur.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Change the owner on the %windir%\System32\Logfiles folder to the Administrator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Start the computer in Safe Mode without networking.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. Open a command prompt as administrator</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>4. Type "net stop winmgmt" (without quotes) and press enter to make certain the WMI service is not running.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>5. Go to the %windir%\system32\WBEM\ and rename the Repository folder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>6. Restart the system to normal mode.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>7. Open a command prompt as administrator.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>8. Type "net stop winmgmt" without quotes and press enter to stop the wmi service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>9. Type "winmgmt /resetRepository" and restart the system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>10. If the Event Viewer still cannot be started, I am afraid that we need to re-install the problematic system since the WMI provider may be crashed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope it helps.</div>

            <p>Hi Bmazak,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue and sorry for delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If issue still persists, I would suggest you to boot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to the link to boot in safe mode.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Advanced startup options (including safe mode).</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If your computer works fine in safe mode, I would suggest you to perform clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Will I lose my license if I migrate to Bootcamp from Parallels&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft, I just bought a MacBook Pro Late 2011. And, for some reasons, I decided to install Windows 8.1 on it.</p>
<p>And I bought an original key of the Windows 8.1 by Microsoft itself. Otherwise, I use Parallels instead of Bootcamp, and my</p>
<p>Mac run so bad now in terms of CPU loading when both systems goes together. </p>
<p>So, now I wanna delete the Parallels and install Windows through of Bootcamp now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will I lose my original keys if I do that? Because is the same computer, but I really would uninstall it first for install again using the ISO file.</p>

<h2>            Store and unlocked golfer equipment question...</h2>
                    
<p>All I see for sale in the in game store are packs of random items at different levels... there are in game ads for specific items that are supposed to be for sale in the store, but I only see the packs...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for unlocked golfers... when playing against them they use very interesting clubs... when I unlock them they don't have their character-specific clubs as an option... it says they are available, but not sure where to look... not in Customize Golfer and
 Gear menus... just curious...</p>

<p>When it comes to the challenging AI I'm pretty sure they made them different to add more of a challenge to the game. &nbsp;All the clubs in the game, to my knowledge, may be unlocked through the store option if you get the loot. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as the store goes, I've run into the same problem. &nbsp;It may possibly be a feature to be implemented at a later time?</p>

<p>I think the loading screen adverts aren't meant to be taken seriously, just a bit off fun. &nbsp;Either that or originally the online storeqallowed you to buy what you wanted, but got changed to the current system, but the adverts got forgotten about.</p>

<p>Relentless: The unlockable golfers come with the default Greenwood clubs. When you unlock the golfer, you also unlock their unique clubs as a possibility for the packs. So, to my understanding, you will never get their clubs in a pack until you unlock them
 in Career.</p>

<p>If you check the items you buy in the packs, you will see they have brand names on them. Usually that means a boost in a certain category. Example: I own an Extreme TNT club that has decent power, but it sacrifices accuracy.

<p>Each golfer in the game has a Driver, iron, wedge, putter and ball that are optimized for their skill set. While they MAY show up in the elite packs of items for 15K, they are more likely to show in the Extreme packs for 60K. Once the golfer is unlocked
 then the clubs and balls should start showing up in either of those 2 packs when purchased. I have all 6 of the golfers unlocked but have no more than 3 of any golfers items, so far. Remember a complete set grants additional skill power-ups.

<p>I have now acquired all the unlockable equipment for every golfer and the Extreme pack for 60K has been replaced by an Extreme (Boosts Only) icon for 15K. No reason now to buy the Elite packs since they only have the chance of 3 Extreme Boosts per buy, unless
 you only have need for 3 caddie or golfer skill increases.</p>

<p>When you purchase every piece of gear available from a pack (Pro, Elite, Extreme ect) they change to boosters only and get a reduced price. Hopefully more gear will be added soon, I'm just piling up credits now.</p>

<p>How many packs did you have to buy to unlock everything? &nbsp; I have 4 golfers and after buying 4x Extreme and 10x elite pack purchases - I have 10/20 of the specialized items for the 4 golfers. &nbsp;I did get 5 extreme boosters , 2 outfits and 8 other mostly not

<p>Not really sure how many packs as I just bought them when I had the funds. There are 6 golfers and until you have the other 2 unlocked from beating the career events, you won't have all the items unlocked in the store to buy.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Remember the pips at the bottom of the equipment card show which pack you need to buy to complete the player set. To complete Frank, I think it takes 3 Elite pieces and 2 Extreme pieces.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I think the appearance of the items is somewhat scripted, with certain clubs and balls unlocking only as your level increases, but you always have a small chance of them showing up randomly.

            Hi Linda
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />First of all, if you have any non-essential hardware attached to your computer apart from mouse and keyboard, disconnect them.
<br />
<br />See if the system boots successfully, if it does not, carry out the following steps
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />
<br />How do you do that?
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off
<br />
<br />Power on, it will then your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />
<br />You might be asked to sign in with your Microsoft Account or Local Account password. 
<br />
<br />**********************************************
<br />
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click System Restore, see if you can go back to an earlier time.
<br />
<br />If not, boot into the recovery environment again, then try performing a startup repair.
<br />
<br />Perform the startup repair a couple more times then restart again to see if you are able to boot to the desktop successfully. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, boot into the recovery environment, then click 'Go back to previous version of Windows' - choose this option if you recently upgraded to a new Windows 10 Feature Update. If this option is not available, you can skip this step. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work.
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Reset this PC
<br />Click Keep my files
<br />Choose your account
<br />Enter your password
<br />Click Continue
<br />Click Reset
<br />
<br />If that does not work.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>Try repairing boot records, using these steps:</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>1. Start your Windows 10 machine, and quickly shut it down before it reaches or if it is at boot screen. Do this two times repeatedly.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>2. On the third time, Windows 10 will automatically display 'Your PC couldn't start properly' message. Now press Esc key for recovery options.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>3. Then under Choose an option screen, click Troubleshoot option and now click Advanced options option.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>4. Under Advanced options screen, click Command Prompt.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>5. Type following commands one-by-one and press Enter key after each:</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>BOOTREC /SCANOS</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>BOOTREC /FIXMBR</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>BOOTREC /FIXBOOT</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>BOOTREC /REBUILDBCD</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>6. Close Command Prompt and see if issue is resolved now.</p>

<p>Sumit, I have been able to get to the BIOS.&nbsp; This is an ASUS x200M.&nbsp; No peripherals, or anything attached.&nbsp; I disabled Secure Boot, enabled Launch CSM, changed boot order as you describe.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Created USB.&nbsp; Selected to boot from USB.&nbsp; Let laptop shut down/restart on exiting BIOS.&nbsp; It tries to start and shows ASUS logo, then blank screen (black).&nbsp; It never gets to the Windows recovery options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Created DVD.&nbsp; Selected CD_Rom in boot list.&nbsp; Keyboard stops working.&nbsp; It shows BSOD that something went wrong and we will restart your computer for you.&nbsp; Restarts, goes to black screen and locks up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updated to latest ASUS BIOS, no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have worked on this for 3 days.&nbsp; IT shows the ASUS logo and "Preparing Automatic Recovery", goes to black blank screen and locks.&nbsp; I can get to the BIOS only, cannot get it Windows recovery/repair screen.&nbsp; The video and keyboard are working; it is not
 a totally black/dead screen, it is just a black screen without any activity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both laptops were compact/light machines used by men to download a lot of pictures from their trail camera SD cards in the field.&nbsp; It will be a shame if we cannot recover their wildlife photos.</p>

            The symptoms point to a hardware issue, most probably RAM. In that case, a friend or a relative proficient in computers can have a look at it and try swapping RAM Sticks, if you are not comfortable.

<p>Sumit, thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I have A+ certs (5 yrs old).&nbsp; I have retired and not longer have equipment around (and feel I have forgotten more than I learned.)&nbsp; I know Windows, I don't know ASUS.&nbsp; As you suggest, I will locate a friend who can help.&nbsp;
 My priority after 3 days is to get drive out and recover photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for my brother's ACER, it is only 2 yrs old and he has a door stop.&nbsp; He is understandably disgusted with his loss that is no fault of his own.&nbsp; I watched him boot normally, and a update start to install.&nbsp; It shut down immediately and restarted with a
 black screen.&nbsp; Figuring video card went bad, we hooked to external monitor.&nbsp; No device was detected and his laptop began to melt.&nbsp; At this point we removed it from the house and wrapped it in bags of ice.&nbsp; It won't power up now.&nbsp; Maybe his tech son can get
 the drive out to recover his photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Linda</p>

            I have this problem with windows updates and have had it for quite a while now. This is not a hardware problem as I have it both on my desktop and laptop. there is a definite problem with windows 10. After installing update to windows 10, a reboot or shutdown&nbsp;
 the system does not do a proper disc shutdown and causes a system lockup. It then requires a power off and on to try to get the disc repaired. The last time this happened (last weekend) the disc got so damaged that I had to install an image backup to get it
 fixed. I know with next update it will happen again. Microsoft will not admit there is a problem in the operating system!

            <p>Hi Ali Bertarian,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft Community. Were here to help with your queries regarding Remote Desktop Connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As stated by <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/083c9ada-567f-4b1e-ba21-8a0585616bee" title="ZigZag3143 (MS -MVP)">
ZigZag3143 (MS -MVP)</a>, Windows Home Premium can only receive, but not serve as a Remote Desktop Host (as shown on the table below) unlike Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate.</p>

</p><p>Regarding the Lenovo laptop running Windows 10, can you also specify the Edition that you are using?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you happen to be running Windows 10 Home on the said laptop, then it normally would not have Remote Desktop capability (as shown on the table below).</p>

            Hi Ralph
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />You have to use a third party tool such as Piriforms Recuva to try and recover it
<br />
<br />Download Recuva | Recover deleted files, free! - CCleaner

            Ok, unfortunately, it looks like that file is likely permanently deleted and you will have to restore from a backup.
