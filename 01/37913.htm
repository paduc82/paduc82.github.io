<h3> dan1129  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Involuntary Forced Upgrade - EULA Declined - Auto Restore of Windows 7 Failed - Laptop is Now a Boat Anchor.</h2>
                    I've never posted to a blog before this, but I'm hoping that sharing the negative experience I'm in the midst of will save someone else from having to go through it - although I don't know how you can protect yourself.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The title pretty much says it all, but the details are: I went to my computer yesterday morning and found that, overnight, Windows 10 had unilaterally and without my permission installed itself. I clicked "Not the Owner", the EULA came up and I declined
 it. At that point, the system reinstalled my original, trusty Windows 7 Pro. This was all with the aid of Microsoft "Up and Running" customer support, and all tolled took about 5 hours. The customer support person also took me into the area of Windows Auto
 Updates where I unchecked the Windows 10 box, theoretically preventing it from auto updating. I also selected five optional updates to run, not having anything to do with Windows 10.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Today, a prompt came up, saying that I had updates to install. Thinking that it was the five Windows 7 optional security updates I'd checked, I went ahead and ran the updates by allowing the computer to reboot. When the computer came up, it immediately
 started installing Windows 10 again. I immediately called Microsoft Support, and they instructed me to wait for the installation to complete, then again decline the EULA, and the system would again restore Windows 7. However, this time the restoration failed,
 and the laptop is now completely locked up.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After another 3 or 4 frustrating hours with Microsoft Support in India, they said they couldn't fix it and instructed me to take the laptop to a Microsoft store. I have now done so and will be without the computer until at least next week, but the galling
 part of this is that not only will I lose all of my apps and software, a number of which are proprietary and will be difficult to replace, but I'll also likely lose all of my data and files - at a minimum. Fortunately, I run a raid array at home, so I should
 be okay - eventually.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Like a terrorist attack, this entire experience was completely unnecessary and will ultimately prove fruitless for Microsoft. What do they hope to gain with this type of sneak attack? If I wanted to upgrade to Windows 10, I would have done so. &nbsp;For them
 to unilaterally decide to modify my computer, with complete disregard and in defiance of my express wishes, and to destroy a very solid, dependable, deeply personalized platform and put me out of business for what I'm sure will turn out to be a week to two
 weeks, makes Windows 10 the single most malicious malware I've ever encountered. I'll be seeking the advice of counsel here in Seattle tomorrow and likely buying a Mac, something many friends and associates have advised me to do for decades.</div>

            <p>Fuchsia...Are you running 10 or is it still on W7? - I suspect 10 probably will have wiped them.</p>
<p>Many&nbsp;wallpaper pictures you should be able to recover from the MS website. There's loads of decent wallpaper pictures you can download there. I 've got a problem with copying links at the moment but if you copy and paste the details below in your browser
 search&nbsp;that will take you to wallpapers.</p>
<p>As for music to try out your speakers how about something like e.g. Spotify? You can choose any music you like there and listen to it for free if you are prepared to put up with adverts from time to time - or there's plenty on 'youtube'.</p>
<p>Here's the MS wallpaper site address...</p>
<p>&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows/wallpaper </p>
<p>ps - Just remembered that you have to open the image you wish to download and then click 'save as' otherwise you'll just get the tiny 'thumbnail' version. - R.</p>

<h2>            Keyboard causes screen to flash and beep when adjusting volume.  How do I fix this&#63;</h2>
                    Since updating to Windows 10, my logitech g510 keyboard makes both my monitors flash and makes a loud beep every time I use the keyboard to adjust the volume. &nbsp;It doesn't do that when I use the slider from the task bar. &nbsp;I already updated the latest display
 drivers on my machine and it still does the same thing. &nbsp;I also removed my keyboard in devices and re-installed it with the same problem. &nbsp;I have an AMD FX6200 six core processor with&nbsp;AMD Radeon HD 7500 Series graphics. &nbsp;Please let me know if its just a bug
 of Windows 10 or compatibility issues with my computer (or keyboard).

            Yeah it really is annoying having to adjust the volume and having your screen flash like crazy. &nbsp;I don't know if it's specifically an issue with the keyboard because it works fine with Windows 8.1. &nbsp;Microsoft probably made a change that breaks part of
 the functionality of the keyboard. &nbsp;Either that or just a bug that needs work. &nbsp;Needs a fix ASAP.

            <p>It seems to work for the most part, it did stop blinking after a while for me but occasionally still blinks a couple of times. &nbsp;It's probably not going to be &nbsp;a permanent fix, but that will have to do for now.</p>

<h2>            External Display Port - Resolution Issues</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I purchased the following combination in an effort to utilize the display port output on my 128gb Surface Pro:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HU629E/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L1ZYYM/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, I purchased the mini display port to HDMI along with an HDMI cable. &nbsp;When I try to utilize this attached to my Samsung SyncMaster PX2370 I am finding that it will not line up with the proper 1080p resolution that the monitor supports. &nbsp;The display
 is output but in a way where it is stretched so the taskbar is just barely visible. &nbsp;Wondering if anyone has seen these issues before.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Another interesting factoid is that I installed Air Parrot - which is a software application that allows wireless display streaming to Apple TV from a windows machine. &nbsp;Anyway I set this up in our conference room as it functions properly on my Dell M6500
 laptop but when I run the software on my Surface Pro I notice that the resolution is coming up in the same way. &nbsp;Stretched to a point where you can not actually see in any good fashion what is on the screen unless it is in that area of the screen that is being
 magnified.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas how to adjust this for proper funtionality?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for reading...</div>
                </div>

            If you install the Intel HD Graphics 4000 driver package, are you able to use the Intel Graphics and Media Control Panel application to alter the under/overscan or scaling issues? You can get that
<a href="http://thingsthatmightinterestnerds.com/surfacepro_drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.<br />
<br />
If you alter the resolution on the external monitor using the Screen Resolution/Display Control Panel applet, does it correct itself at all?<br />

There have been a few other posts that pointed to that same adapter you are using that stated they had trouble. If you have another cable or want to try another one, many have stated

this one</a> works but they were using TVs and not a Samsung SyncMaster.<br />

            thanks buddy, but sfc.exe /scannow didn't work and i faced to another error! (windows resource protection could not start the repair service).
<div><span>finally i found the solution:</span></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>
<div>1) If you are receiving the "Low Registry Space" error, set the Registry Size Limit to "unlimited":&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control&nbsp;</div>
<div>Key: RegistrySizeLimit&nbsp;</div>
<div>Type: REG_DWORD&nbsp;</div>
<div>Value: 0xffffff (4294967295)&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>2) Reboot&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>3) As a Administrator open a Command Prompt and run "SFC /SCANNOW". The command should complete successfully and if any errors were found, they should be corrected.</div>
<div><br />
<div>follow the steps and enjoy!</div>

    <title>Indigo Prophecy Full Game DLC Xbox 360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phillip2272  say:</h3>
<h2>            Indigo Prophecy Full Game DLC Xbox 360</h2>
                    I downloaded the full game as I remember playing it on my old xbox and wanted to play it again. I got To the point in the game where you have to decide to save the boy from drowning or run away. If I save him, the screen goes to blank and it says "there's
 a problem with the disc it may be scratched or damaged" which of course is stupid cause there ISNT a disc! Anyways, I decided to continue playing I have to run away and let the kid drown which pissed me off. A little while later, I'm at the point where my
 ex girlfriend wants her stuff back and she is ringing the doorbell. I answer, offer her a drink and make small talk, then tell her I will get her stuff. After she tells me it's in 2 boxes with her initials on them, the same message pops up. I'm stuck here
 as I can't get her damn stuff for her and I can't move on in the story. Does anyone know why it does this for a downloaded title and how I can fix if? Thanks in advance.

<p>Hi there, philip2272.</p>
<p>Sorry for the inconvenience you are having with this.</p>
<p>As Sir Odie123 has said, and explained how to delete the content and re download it again, I shall guide you on how to clear your cache, simply follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. Press your guide button on your controller (middle circular button)</p>
<p>2. Scroll across twice, to settings.</p>
<p>3. Then choose the 4th option down 'System Settings' </p>
<p>4. Now, you are on the available options and settings to your console. Select the 3rd option down 'Storage'
</p>
<p>5. You will be given the options of 'All devices' 'Hard Drive' and 'Cloud Saved Games' (if you have Cloud) Highlight, 'Hard Drive'</p>
<p>6. Press the 'Y' button, on your controller. Now, you will be given 4 options, select the 3rd option 'Clear System Cache' and then select 'Yes'</p>
<p>After you have done this and deleted the game, turn off your Xbox360 console, and then sign on to re download it. (Shown by the link given by Sir Odie)</p>
<p>If this problem still occurs, try taking out your hard drive and putting it back in. (Whilst your console is turned off)
</p>
<p>If by then you still have problems, contact XboxSupport. You can either tweet @XboxSupport which I advise as they are fast at responding, and are so helpful ! However, if you prefer to call them here are the contact numbers for UK and US.</p>

<p>Hey there, phillip2272. Thanks for bringing your question to the forums. Let's see what we can do to get this sorted out.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start, can you check your game saves to make sure they aren't corrupt? If you've verified that they aren't corrupt, try moving your saved game over to a USB drive configured for use with your console. Then, load them up and let us know if the issue persists.
 Thanks in advance! Standing by for your response.</p>

<p>Hi Phillip 2272, I have also downloaded this same game for the same reason as you, but I do not even get to play the game. &nbsp;It will let me go through the tutorial and then when I go to play the actual game it tells me that there is a problem with my disc
 just like yours. I called support and after sitting on hold forever they hung up on me. &nbsp;I think we both got screwed....</p>

    <title>How to completely remove shared printers from the &#34;add a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gentlespoon  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to completely remove shared printers from the &#34;add a device&#34; list&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So basically when I am trying to add printers, a whole bunch of past shared printers show up in the "add a device" list.</p>
<p>Neither those shared host computer nor those shared printers are available anymore - they have been removed for years. And I have no access to those share hosts or the printers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, one printer shown in the list is a printer shared by my roommate in 2009, when I was using Windows 7 on my old laptop. I have changed for two computers after my roommate moved out and removed his printer in 2010. I bought a new computer in 2014
 which comes with Windows 8, and I bought another laptop in 2016 which comes with Windows 10. Apparently my roommate was not living with me when I switch to the two new computers, and his computer/printer were not in my network either. I have been moved to
 a new living place with a new local network, and I joined a new family group. But I can still see that printer "[printerName] on [myRoommatesComputer]" in the "add a device" list in ALL my computers. Yes they show up on those computers I bought after saying
 bye with my previous roommates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These shared printers are not visible to my new roommate, they just show up in my new device list. Currently I don't belong to any domain, workgroup, or familygroup.</p>
<p>If I try to connect to these shared printers, Windows says "We can't connect to the print server. This can happen if the printer server was renamed, deleted, or moved to a different network. Error: #1722".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to reinstall Windows for many times.</p>
<p>Before I connect the newly installed system to my local network, everything is good.</p>
<p>As soon as I connected to the local network, those "ghost" printers show up in the list of the newly installed Windows again.</p>
<p>And they will keep show up in the add device list even when I am completely offline - Wi-Fi off, ethernet unplugged.</p>
<p><br />
I have checked the Active Directory on all the computers I can access. Nothing was in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I remove them from the "add a device" candidate list? They are really annoying.</p>

    <title>Downloading Fable Legends Beta - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xavius  say:</h3>
<h2>            Downloading Fable Legends Beta</h2>
                    <p>I got accepted for Fable Legends beta. I redeemed my code for Windows 10 no problem, started the download. Left it alone for several hours. When I returned it was at 3.5GB (where it was last I'd checked about 10 hours earlier). It then promptly shut down
 the Windows store, and now I can't find anything to do with Fable Legends beta on the Windows store. I attempted to re-redeem my code thinking it'd simply say it'd already been done for the account and give me a link to start downloading again. But no. It
 didn't. So I have zero clue on how to get my download back and working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

</p><p>There see the following:</p>
<p>However, there must be something else too because I have never had to use that and I do get a 24 hour clock format on my Lock Screen.</p>

<div>avast has never had a hit.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>powershell will not launch. when i click the pinned shortcut, the desktop shortcut, launch cmd and type pwoershell.exe, or click either the 64 bit version or the plain from start&gt; all programs&gt; accessories&gt; widows powershell folder..... i get a quick pop
 up of the powershell console with a message about powerhsell not being able to launch and error code 80070002.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>i have ran the sfc /scannow. first time it came up with stuff and required a re-start. second time it was clean.&nbsp;</div>

<p>Have been getting this error code for the past 24hrs unable to find any solutions to this anywhere on here battle.net or google and even tried chatting to one of the technical guys at Battle.net and he was clueless. Getting quite angry now as my son having
 saved up for months to buy this game managed an hour on it yesterday before it crashed and since then have been unable to connect at least and just constantly getting this error message. He managed to play the beta with no issue at all. &nbsp;Somebody at Blizzard
 or Microsoft needs to sort his problem out as a matter of urgency</p>

<p>This seems to be a recurring problem, as I get it every now and again, too. </p>
<p>Try unplugging your router/modem and Xbox One for 30 seconds, then reconnect and try again. If it persists, try it for 5 minutes. This is called a power cycle, and it helps to cool down and refresh misbehaving hardware.</p>
<p>If all else fails, try looking on one of the networking problem forums. Otherwise Overwatch and battle.net could be having issues.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Migrate system partition to a new disk</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I just bought a new SSD 30GB "disk", and to benefit from it I want to move my system partition to it. Besides system partition,&nbsp;<span><strong>I have two more partitions on my magnetic disk (linux and data partition). My
 data partition is 400GB large, and I don't want any risk for it.</strong></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><strong><span><strong>I have done so far:</strong></span></strong></span></strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shrank the size of the system partition to below 30GB (to 24GB in my case, only 20 GB were actually used)</strong>
</li><li><strong>Copied this partition to the new disk (with resizing to 29.8GB)</strong>
</li><li><strong>Marked this partition as active (the partition is primary)</strong> </li><li><strong>Changed bios settings to boot from SSD</strong> </li></ul>
<strong>But, the SSD has drive letter F:, and all the paths are still pointing to C: (which is a partition on magnetic disk), and everything is being run from there (there is no speed improvement so far from the new SSD "disk"), in spite disk management's claim
 that "F: is system partition".</strong>

<p><strong>My question is: how can I swap drive letters for partitions C: and F:, or more precisely, how can I make F: partition become C: (the current C: partition is not important any more)?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>

            Well, after 3 hours of hassle with it, I managed to make computer accept that SSD partition is both system and boot (and I removed drive letters from the magnetic partition). I do not remember the order of the steps, but it involved 20-30 steps (including
 running some boot fixing using install disk).

<h2>            Windows 10 Photos will not show pictures in subfolders..........</h2>
                    No matter what I do, and I have done everything imaginable to get it to work, Windows 10 Photos App will not show pictures in subfolders. If you search for a specific file name, it will find it. I have checked permissions, I have indexed, I have reset
 the app and even removed it and re-installed to no avail. It just does not work. Why can this not be fixed? I am running version 1803 (OS Build 17134.48) This is not just my issue, this has been posted dozens and dozens of times by multiple users that have
 the same issue. Why has MS not fixed this? The app has great features.........if they would just work. Please fix this. I have gone back to my old faithful for now, Picasa by Google. It is no longer supported by Google but at least it does what it's supposed
 to.

<p>Did exactly as you suggested and still cannot see pictures in folders. The screenshot below is when I click Import from inside the Photos App. As you can see, only Folders show up. The screenshot below that shows what the Pictures folder looks like when
 opened in Explorer. I am ready to throw in the towel.<br />

    <title>Connecting an external hard drive to xbox one console - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hastycircle64  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connecting an external hard drive to xbox one console</h2>
                    
<p>Not sure if this is the right place to post this but I didn't really see any where this fit.&nbsp; My problem:&nbsp; I bought a new external hard drive for my PC and was trying to use the older one for my xbox one.&nbsp; The xbox one recognizes the external but does not
 give me an option to format it for use with the xbox one, allowing only media such as movies, pictures etc., making it useless.&nbsp; I would really like to know how to fix this as my internal drive is 91.9% full and I will not be able to add more games in the
 future if I can not access the external.&nbsp; Buying another drive isn't an option in the present and near future</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>Hi, the hard drive has to meet certain requirements, it has to be at least 256GB in size and USB 3.0 compatible. If the drive doesn't meet those requirements it can only be used as media storage not as Xbox storage.</p>

<p>My external should meet those requirements as it is a 2TB external and is USB 3.0 compatible...but its ok...I just decided to use it for my 3d rendering and not use an external after all on my xbox. &nbsp;Means I probably won't be buying any more games but I
 mostly play PC games anyways.</p>

<p>No worries, you could try formatting the hard drive on your PC before connecting it to the Xbox though.</p>

            <p>Hey Zurkon53,</p>
<p>What happened when you went into booted into clean boot?</p>
<p>Is your Anti-virus up to date, what about drivers and processes?</p>
<p>If it is Isass, that should be recognized by an anti-virus program, if it is Lsass, that is related to a Java program so please verify the correct title just to be sure.
</p>
<p>Let me know how it worked, thanks!</p>

            There is no triangle. &nbsp;I found this in the troubleshoot report. Maybe this will help give a better detail.&nbsp;
<pre>Root cause:
Windows cannot connect to "mynetworkname"
The wireless network security key is not correct.
Detailed root cause:
Layer 2 security key exchange using user-supplied key did not generate unicast keys before timeout
Repair option:
Verify the network security key for "mynetworkname"
View the security settings. You can then type the correct security key.

            Hi there&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/2be79c27-9a68-46d5-9a26-6339142fa52a" title="RayyanMir">RayyanMir</a>,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I would check with your bank institution to ensure they have not put a fraud block on your card as its the bank who authorises transactions, furthermore tell them that your going to make a purchase with microsoft so they can add it to your profile of spending
 their end.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kind Regards<br />

            <p><span><strong>Hi cvaoops,</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>1) When do you get this
</span><span><strong>error message</strong></span><span>?<br />
2) What is the </span><span><strong>name</strong></span><span>
 of the </span><span><strong>program</strong></span><span>?<br />
3) Have you made </span><span><strong>any changes</strong></span><span>
 on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>I would like more information regarding the issue.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1-</span></strong></p>
<p><span><br />
You need to </span><span><strong>Run a System File Checker (SFC) scan</strong></span><span>
 to repair damaged </span><span><strong>System</strong></span><span>
</span><span><strong>Files</strong></span><span>
 and check for integrity violations.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the article–</span></p>

 to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</strong></span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span><strong>Method 2-</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br />
I would recommend you to perform </span><span><strong>Clean Boot</strong></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in
</span><span><strong>Clean Boot state</strong></span><span>
 helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>

<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong></span><span>:
 You need to follow </span><span><strong>Step 7</strong></span><span>
 from the article to get the computer back to </span><span><strong>Normal Startup</strong></span><span>
 after you follow all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
