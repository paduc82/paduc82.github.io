<h2>            Windows 10 keeps removing some programs from startup</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I have a problem with windows 10:<br />
<br />
Some programs ( like Realtek audio manager and Intel Rapid Storage Technology ) stopped running at windows startup, and they disappeared from the startup list in Task Manager.</p>
<p>I reinstalled those programs and they reappeared in that list, and they launched at startup for the first time.<br />
But after the second restart, the problem reappeared : they didn't launch at startup and once again disappeared from the list in Task Manager.<br />
And the problem seems to keep happening over and over again every time I try to reinstall those programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how to resolve this issue ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            xbox 360 external HDD not working. Possibly hacked&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>yesterday in the morning it was working perfectly but not in the evening. Yesterday (6/11/2015) at about 8pm CEST(UTC +2) i got a update to xbox 360 &nbsp;of which there is no evidence that it exists i went to the system info and it says version 2.0.17349.0 which
 is supposed to be the latest one and released in april.</p>
<p>After i installed the update which took much more time than usually (more than 30 min. usually takes about 10) I click my pins and press the game to play and i get to "download again" button. then i go check the storage in settings and i see only the 8GB
 Internal one. Then I rage a little bit(quite a lot) and turn off my xbox and put the 500 GB HDD out start xbox again, and turn it off, put it back in and restart again (as it instructs here:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/system/add-remove-hard-drive#77322f213d5743ed87743d7fd32a3e3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/system/add-remove-hard-drive#77322f213d5743ed87743d7fd32a3e3f</a>).
 But still it wasnt detected. I noticed that if i pull it out while its turned on xbox shuts down &nbsp;which means it is connected to it somehow. Now i tried today again and its still not detecting it in storage.</p>
<p>Help Me please!!</p>
<p>What should i do??</p>

<p>Unfortunately we cannot help you here and the only option you have at the moment is to purchase an official Xbox hard drive.</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. I understand you're having issues with your headphones sound no longer playing. If you were to plug the headset into say another device (smartphone, PC, etc...) do the headphones work
 there?&nbsp;Have you tried the headphones on another controller at all? Is it all audio that is not playing from the headset or just the game sound or party chat sounds? Let us know a few more&nbsp;details&nbsp;to determine how to best assist you with this situation. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, thank you for the response. Yes, the headset and mic work with another controller with an older firmware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The headset, once plugged into the controller with newer firmware, there is absolutely no audio from anything and the mic does not work. The controller does not recognize the headset at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note, the controller in question is a customized controller from Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Denial of access to external drive &#40;FAT32&#41; to an Administrator - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diana van dyke  say:</h3>
<h2>            Denial of access to external drive &#40;FAT32&#41; to an Administrator &#40;Win7, NTFS, x64&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Background Details:</p>
<p>New HP EliteBook<br />
OS - Windows 7 Pro SP1 x64</p>
<p>Full Administrator</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been completely and miserably unable to access various thumb drives and micro SD cards via two different card readers.&nbsp; Each external drive that has appeared but not allowed me access has been on FAT32-formatted media.<br />
<br />
The external drives appear in Windows Explorer as Drive F:\</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I double click the drive icon to view the files therein, I receive the following message:<br />
"You don't currently have permission to access this folder. Click Continue to permanently get access to this folder."</p>
<p>When I click "Continue," I receive the following message: "You have been denied permission to access this folder. To gain access to this folder you will need to use the security tab."</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I right click the drive's icon, there is NO SECURITY TAB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also attempted these same steps and received these same results after setting my UAC settings tab all the way down to "Never Notify me when"<br />
<br />
I have also attempted to gain access to the drive and give myself the permissions that I should already have as Administrator via a Command Prompt.</p>
<p>After running via Accessories, the Command Prompt program as an Administrator, I attempted to utilize the "TAKEOWN /F" command.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Here is what I typed and what I received back in response:<br />
<br />
1) TAKEOWN /F F:\</p>
<p>Response - "ERROR: File ownership cannot be applied on insecure file systems; there is no support for ACLs"<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) cd /d f:\</p>
<p>Response - "Access denied"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any and all help will be very much appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Whether you configure both NTFS and SHARE permissions ? I believe you configured only the SHARE permissions using Share and Storage Management console.</p>
<p><strong>NTFS permissions</strong></p>
<p>You can configure the local NTFS permissions for a shared folder or volume using Share and Storage Management in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New shared resources.</strong> In the Provision a Shared Folder Wizard, before you select a network sharing protocol, you can change the NTFS permissions for the folder or volume you will be sharing. These NTFS permissions will apply both locally
 and when accessing the resource over the network. To change the NTFS permissions, on the<strong>NTFS Permissions</strong> page, select
<strong>Yes, change NTFS permissions</strong>, and then click<strong>Edit Permissions</strong>.</li><li><strong>Existing shared resources.</strong> You can change the NTFS permissions of a shared folder or volume listed on the<strong>Shares</strong> tab. To change the NTFS permissions, select the folder or volume, in the<strong>Actions</strong> pane click
<strong>Properties</strong>, and on the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab, click <strong>
NTFS Permissions</strong>. </li></ul>

            Plug the drive into a Linux Mint machine, copy all of the files onto another medium, then reformat the drive in FAT32 format using Disk Utility, when you plug the drive in again Windows will fail to recognize the formatting and will allow you to reformat
 it at that point in Windows.

            <p>Phil, thank you for your time.&nbsp; I wonder if you might help me further.<br />
<br />
1) The advice you give seems to be focused on NTFS permissions.&nbsp; The thumb drives and micro SD cards I am attempting to access seem to all be formatted FAT32.&nbsp; Does that make a difference to your advice?</p>

</p><p>Your answer raises another for me.&nbsp; When you suggest that I reformat the drive, are you suggesting that I reformat it into FAT32 or NTFS?&nbsp;

<p>Hello Panda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with contacting support. They have a new system in place where you need to request a call back.</p>
<p>When you go to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://support.xbox.com/contact-us">
Contact Us</a> to get it to request a callback follow these steps:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1 ----select Xbox One</li><li>Step 2 ----select see more options then subscription changes</li><li>Step 3-----select show contact options<br />
</li><li>Step 4 ----select request a call from support</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Once they call explain the issue and they will be able to help you. Note that these options regularly change so just keep selecting something that gives request a call from support as a contact option.<br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps.<br />
</p>

            Xbox Live Support now works on a callback system. You can <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
sign in at the Support site</a> and request a callback for your issue, or you can chat in real-time with a Microsoft employee online. Just select the subject of your problem from the menu ... if you're asked to speak with a virtual agent, you can decline that.

<h2>            Someone I blocked just added me as a friend</h2>
                    
<p>What is the point of blocking someone if they can just add me as a friend without problem? Someone recently added me to their followers list, due to the fact I have never met this person before in multiplayer or in real life, I immediately blocked them,
 after I did, I noticed they were still following me, just a few minutes ago I received a notification that they had added me as a friend, I have had no further contact with this individual between when they followed me and now, why are they able to add me
 as a friend? Is there no point in blocking them? Please help me find a way to get rid of this person as soon as possible, thank you</p>

<p>Are you sure that person used the same account <strong>?</strong> maybe there is a little difference in name like (space) or dot.</p>
<p>or that person is just your<strong> friend or family</strong> member and knows your account<strong> login</strong> , and its
<strong>pranking</strong> you :) . try <strong>changing the password</strong> . entering the website on
<strong>console</strong> so you get sure , if there is a <strong>phishing scam</strong> program on your PC
<strong>block</strong> again that person and check if he can add you.</p>

<p>The xbox one friends system is diferent to the xbox 360 system. If you both add eachover you will see friend only information. But if only one has added the other as a friend they will only show as a follower to the other, unless they have also added them.</p>

<p>10th April, was playing Quantum Break at the final fight (I think) console crashed now I have no save to load. It keeps asking me to start a new game. My logic is that I didn't stop the fracture in time forcing my console to spaz out and send me through
 an endless loop of disappointment.</p>

<p>I have this same problem, really getting to me. I was on the final act and was nearing the finish (from what i know of) and couldn't load the file after. Prompts to start new game but waiting to see if it will be patched. Not in the mood to find every single

<p>@PouncinWeasel85, same as me mate. As soon as I saw just the new game option appear I was devastated. I just couldn't believe it. Now i'm going to have to go through all that again on hard and collect everything all over.
</p>
<p>Xbox support agent thinks my local hard drive save got corrupted, a new save was created and the Xbox cloud sync just synced it anyway overriding my cloud backup, brilliant!</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Are you referring to Windows image file when you say, "open an image file"?</li><li>What is the format of the files?</li><li>Is the issue happening with a particular file or set of files?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>To diagnose the issue, I suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Save the file to different location</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try saving the file to different location on your computer and check if the issue occurs while accessing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Run </strong><span><strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the Microsoft Windows Resource Checker tool, also know as "System File Checker" or "sfc".
<br />
This tool scans and verifies the integrity of all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct versions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press<strong> Windows key + X</strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admi</strong><strong>n).</strong><br />
2. In the Command Prompt, type the following command, <strong>sfc /scannow </strong>
and then press Enter. <br />
3. Wait until the process completes. This usually doesn’t take longer than 20 minutes with a regular hard disk and takes much shorter when you have a fast SSD drive.
<br />
4. Restart your computer and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Win 10 Touch zoom and scroll stops working...</h2>
                    <p>After updating my desktop to Windows 10, My touch zoom and scroll functions stop working with Edge and Chrome. It usually happens after the PC has sat and gone to sleep. Then when it resumes, not always, I loose touch function in the browsers. A restart
 fixes it but it's annoying.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 64 bit Ultimate Boot Manager error 0xc000000f</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Hi there all,</p>
<p>I'm quite a newbie in programing and stuff like that. So I could use some help resolving this issue that occured just couple of days ago.</p>
<p>My notebook details are: MSI CX620, 4gb ram, one HDD drive and one OS(Windows 7 64 bit Ultimate)</p>
<p>I've read quite alot of threads about boot manager error 0xc000000f with no luck&nbsp;finding an answer.</p>
<p>My problem is that got the black screen which recommends me to insert windows 7 installation disk and run repair, but when I get to the part to click repair my computer the background becomes empty and mouse cursor is loading for an hour... couldn't wait
 longer so I've shuted it down. Repair didn't work.</p>
<p>Instead, I tried to Install windows on top... and the same thing happend saying "Setup is starting" and mouse cursor is loading.... forever....</p>
<p>Tried to do recovery, gave the same screes with error 0xc000000f.</p>
<p>Tried to change BIOS booting devices in every possible way, nothing... same.</p>
<p>The only options I've got are:</p>
<p>DEL: BIOS</p>
<p>F11: Quick boot menu(from there I can choose boot devices without bothering to go in to BIOS.</p>
<p>F3: Recovery</p>
<p>I also tried all F's and F1 gave me 2 options to start Windows 7&nbsp;or pressing TAB to swich between options to do Memory scan... which did the scan with no success.</p>
<p>With F1 when the "Start Windows 7" is highlighted ONLY THEN I can press F8 which should give me more options, but then it goes back to the Boot Manager error screen....</p>
<p>I don't want to take my notebook to repair centre being afraid that they will charge enourmus<span>enormous amount.</span></p>
<p><span>I've got my girlfriends notebook to download anything what is <span>necessary.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Any advice would be <span>appreciated.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Sry for my spelling, I'm not english :) Lithuanian</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Thankyou.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>so it looks like you're getting to the options to select which operating system to boot
</p>
<p>With out getting to safe mode I can't think of anything that is going to help because in safe mode you can run the sfc /scannow utility and run check disk utility chkdsk /r c:
</p>
<p>If you're selecting which operating system to start when you boot ther is something wrong with the boot sector of your hard drive / files; which in a cmd, chkdsk /r c: would help with and also a repair disk would actually fix that literaly too if you can
 boot from a repair disk </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can't get into safe mode and you can't boot from the repair CD then </p>

    <title>Windows 10 Settings won&#39;t open and taskbar not working properly. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leobreaker66  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Settings won&#39;t open and taskbar not working properly.</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">I went on my computer this morning and found that my taskbar wasn't working properly, my first thought was to restart my computer so I tried that. Once I was logged in again, I still had the problem, so I decided to look it up online
 and found that a lot of people had this problem. The problem was that when I tried going on the start menu, my cursor would turn into the loading one which means it was definitely loading but then it just closed, I also couldn't search anything in cortana,
 Can't do anything with date and time or view messages. I found that a lot of people were saying restarting windows explorer would work so I tried that, but I still had the problem. I've tried running sfc /scannow on Powershell, but it said that everything
 was fine (I can't remember the actual message) I then restarted my computer, but the problem was still there. I tried launching windows in safe mode to check if it was still there like that and it was, I was going to look in settings to see if I had changed
 some settings but then it just closed as soon as it loaded. I tried a few more times with other types of settings things and it still didn't work. I restarted my computer to see if the settings would work after that, but they still didn't so I looked it up
 online and the only thing that I hadn't already tried doing to fix the start menu was uninstalling all windows apps including the store and I didn't want to do this because apparently it's nearly impossible to get it back. I thought that these problems may
 have been cause by a windows update failing so I went online and found some troubleshooting things. I got the start menu &nbsp;troubleshooting program and it found a problem: Required applications are not installed correctly. Not fixed so I checked the details
 and found that the missing / corrupted applications were: "Microsoft.Windows.ShellExperinceHost" and "Microsoft.Windows.Cortana" and underneath it said Install the applications and it said that was completed. I've also ran the Windows update troubleshooting
 a few times and every time it says that it has fixed the problem: Service registration is missing or corrupt. I've also tried creating another user but had the same problem there. Does anyone know a way to fix this or will I have to reinstall windows?</p>

<p>Okay, so would I just be able to copy and paste the good file from one computer onto a memory stick and then replace it (after I've run the commands) or would I have to take away the system files from another computer so that they will no longer be on that
 computer.</p>

            <p>Also, I only know 2 of the corrupt files, but I know there are more as settings won't open, but /sfc scannow is saying that&nbsp;<span>Windows
 Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.&nbsp;</span>Also, I was wandering if after I've tried this, if it doesn't work properly if it would be possible to change my PC back to windows 7 and then windows 10 again and not lose my files? I don't
 know if I would lose files from changing back to windows 7 or if I'd be able to change to windows 10 after going back to windows 7.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response. We would suggest backing up your files first before making any changes or reverting to your previous Windows version. Reverting back to Windows 7 does not guarantee that the files you have on your computer will be retained.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the files that you need to change, transferring it to a thumb drive will work as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had a very similar problem. My computer is quite old and has had various issues, one of them is that if i let it run without any program on, it will lag very intensively, so if I want to leave it on, I'll have VLC run with a movie, for example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then, whenever windows update it will lag again, no matter what I do. With windows 10 it is really hard to stop the auto update, the only way I've found is to set my wifi as limited. I didn't do this at home though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week my computer updated (I know because it was lagging), I then had a blue screen, restarted and then another one after 10 minutes. I gave up and restarted it yesterday, the taskbar is not working properly, all startup programs don't start and don't
 show in the notification corner (Google Drive, Dropbox, Skype, etc.). I have 2 screens and can't change the screen settings with windows + P. I can start windows but they don't show on the taskbar, only if i press alt + tab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I think this has to do with the last update. I did the scan now thing, but it said everything was fine. What else could I do ?&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Thanks ;)</p>

<p>Hello Valentin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is possibly caused by a corrupted system file. Since you've already run the SFC tool as recommended by
<em>Josef Bri</em>, we suggest running the <strong>Deployment Image Servicing and Management</strong> (<strong>DISM</strong>) command-line tool. The
<strong>DISM</strong> command-line tool is another utility in Windows that restores corrupted files. For the steps on how to run the
<strong>DISM</strong> command-line tool, please refer to <em>ZigZag3143</em>'s <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">
<strong>thread</strong></a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also run the <strong>Start menu Troubleshooter</strong> to diagnose and fix your PC for any Start menu issues found. You can access the troubleshooter from this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12385/windows-10-troubleshoot-problems-opening-start-menu-cortana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>link</strong></a>. Be sure to temporarily disable your security software to avoid software conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

            Thanks for your reply. After a day or two my computer simply updated again and the problem was solved ;)

            <p>I apologise,original error code should have been 800700C1 AND not 800700IC...... dont think any other software or hardware changes were made prior to receiving error message. I have run the microsoft fix-it tool but&nbsp;updates still wont install. Where do I
 go from here? Will Windows Vista have to be re-installed again?...........What is your recommendation?</p>
<p>Many Thanks</p>
