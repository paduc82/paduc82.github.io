<li>How are you connecting your computer to your TV using wireless connection? Please provide us the step-by-step process on you do it.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A). I usually click on <strong>action center &gt; connect &gt; &amp; then select &gt; LG webOS TV UH6030</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B). Second method I use sometimes is I presds <strong>Windows key + P &gt; connect to wireless display
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;select&nbsp; &gt;<strong>LG webOS TV UH6030</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I have no issue connecting using HDMI cable. But this does not serve the purpose.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps I have taken to resolve the issue are:</p>
<p>1. I tried re-installing video drivers&nbsp;for Video card:&nbsp;Intel(R) HD Graphics 620</p>
<p>2. I reset my <strong>TV</strong> <strong>LG&nbsp;&nbsp;UH6030</strong></p>
<p>3. Event viewer log I mentioned above didn't really tell what might be the resolution?</p>

<h2>            Sound&#47;audio not working on windows 10</h2>
                    After the windows 10 update, I have had problems playing sound and audio. I have tried using Spotify and YouTube, but no sound comes out. My speakers are definitely&nbsp;not on mute, so I can't figure out what the problem is. I have tried reinstalling windows
 Audio and Windows Audio endpoint but that still hasn't worked. Any help would be appreciated.

            <p>Hi Kimberly,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to connect a earphone or headphone and check if you are able to hear through them. If not, then run the built in Audio troubleshooter which should be able to detect and fix most of the audio issues. Open the control panel, click on the
 'View by' option on the top and right and select 'large icons'. Click on 'troubleshooting' and then select the 'View all' option in the left pane, click on the 'Playing Audio' troubleshooter and run it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, then I would suggest you to visit the PC manufacturer's website to download and install the drivers available for the latest operating system and check if the issue persists. Let us know the results for further assistance.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it worked with the headphones, then it means that audio function is working properly in the PC and the issue might be with the speakers. If you are using a desktop, then try connecting a different speaker and check. If you are using a laptop, then right
 click on the start button, click on 'Device manager' and check if there is any exclamation mark shown on the speakers icon. If yes, right click on the device, click on 'properties' and check the device status in the 'General'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest you to right click on the "volume' icon and click on the playback devices. Check if the 'Speaker' is set as the default device, if not, right click and select 'Set as default'. Try these steps and let us know the results.</p>

            <p>Hello both, </p>
<p>Upon installing Windows 10 with my system, I had the same issues with no sound coming from programs such as Firefox and Groove Music. When I did my solution (below), it worked and now audio works for all my programs. Try it for yourself, if it's not a device
 error or driver error, it could be how you have your audio set up, which this solution should fix, it definitely can't hurt anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(From thread: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/mp3-sound-not-working-right-after-windows-10/cda05b5e-ab1b-4728-a77a-e854f84099f8">
Sound Not Working Right</a>)</p>
<p>Solution :</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Solution that worked for me:</em></p>
<p><strong>Windows&nbsp;+ x </strong>&gt;<strong> Control Panel &gt;</strong><strong> Hardware and Sound &gt;</strong><strong> Sound</strong></p>
<p>- Set the current speakers you are using to "<strong>Default Device</strong>"</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> Disable all other audio devices.</p>
<p><strong>- </strong>If possible, re-configure the speakers you are using (using the "Configure" button).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, when I tried to reverse this solution to verify if this was the problem, I could not duplicate the initial issue. It may be possible that Windows 10 just hiccups upon install with sound devices and once it's corrected it's corrected for good? (insert
 "I Don't Know" emoji here).</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, there's a very specific 'audio' issue. So far, everything appears to function wonderfully with Windows 10 in the audio domain, but I can't hear the start up sound when,&nbsp;after putting on&nbsp;the computer, Windows 10&nbsp;finishes loading up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>After trying many solutions to obtaining sound on my computer, I tried this option:</p>
<p>Go to<strong> Settings</strong>: Click on: "<strong>Devices</strong>" -&nbsp;Under Devices click on
<strong>"Auto Play"</strong>, "Turn on Auto Play",</p>
<p>Under<strong> Removable Drive</strong>,&nbsp;I chose - "Configure this drive for backup file history. Under
<strong>Memory Card</strong>, I&nbsp;chose "Play Windows Media Player."&nbsp; This worked for me. &nbsp;I am new to this. I thought since the sound was created by Windows 10, it was necessary to enable windows media player as my main&nbsp;media player.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, there&nbsp;were&nbsp;no other
 options available on my computer.&nbsp;Hope this works for you.</p>

            Both my audio and video are toasted by Windows 10.&nbsp; Audio: no sound from speakers or phones&nbsp;when using&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;Media&nbsp;Player, or iTunes, or online&nbsp;sources.&nbsp; Video: no video at all from Windows Media Player, halting and messed up video with no audio&nbsp;using
 the VLC player,&nbsp;and halting and messed up video with no audio through the browser.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus far, nothing noted in this forum has worked.&nbsp; Lovely.&nbsp; &nbsp;

            <p>Just after I downloaded Windows 10 things were fine. Then I tried watching a video on Facebook from YouTube. It wouldn't download at all. Acted like it wanted too, but never did, so I gave up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then this morning I was happily listening to my music on the computer for about an hour. Came home 8 hours later and THAT doesn't work. I have tried all trouble shooting techniques, I've rebooted and have had my brother who is a computer tech make sure that
 everything is cool with plugs etc. All is good. He believes that the OS's get more&nbsp;"bloated" with all the new apps etc (he hasn't gotten this&nbsp;program at work to "play with " yet so couldn't tell me anything more about 10) but I want my computer to work :(&nbsp;
 When is this going to be fixed? Anyone hear anything?&nbsp;Help from anyone I'd appreciate it. Thank you :)</p>

</p><p>When you receive the Windows Update error code 800F020B, it means that the update you are trying to install applies to a device that is not connected to your Windows 7 computer. Make sure all of your devices are connected to your computer and they are turned
 on, and then you can install the updates again.</p>

<h3> ewickenberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t the standard account set the metered option when the administrator account has it set</h2>
                    The Standard account is unable to set a metered connection for a metered wireless wi-fi &nbsp;network using Windows 10 anniversary update home edition. The administrator account however is able to. The posts regarding this issue involve registry hacks or use
 of a command I never heard of called "netsh." I am uncomfortable with doing registry hacks or using commands I know nothing about. One post suggested that the standard user account setting for a metered connection set to off when the administrator setting
 is on, is erroneous. My experience using a standard account dictates otherwise. I caught Windows 10 downloading updates on the metered wi-fi connection when it was set to on by the administrator account while using the standard account with the metered setting
 set to an unchangeable off. Does MS have any insight on this issue?&nbsp;

<p>It seems obvious to me you failed to address the issue because the administrator account has the metered connection set&nbsp;but the standard account is not set to metered.&nbsp;I could agree that the setting should be set by the administrator account but to not reflecting
 the setting of the administrator account, I cannot agree with. &nbsp;</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            can windows 10 be the cause of overheating &#63;</h2>
                    <p>ok since I installed windows 10&nbsp;<br />
bad things begin to happen<br />
1) my fan controller die<br />
2) my computer overheat (obviously)<br />
3) I spend days to stabilize my computer temp&nbsp;</p>
<p>currently around 43c idle - 57c load</p>
<p>4) now I'm working to optimize my PC case airflow<br />
<br />
I have 4 - 120 mm fans,3-92 mm fans<br />
and I'm about to order a new fan controller<br />
my question is;<br />
can windows 10 installation be the cause of overheating issue in a desktop system?<br />
and if is yes!?!&nbsp;<br />
going back to windows 7 will fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>oh btw before you say to dust off my computer</p>
<p>you better know that all fans are new</p>
<p>and my computer is clean like new</p>

            Sorry guys, but no I did not find this information helpful.&nbsp; I thought windows10 was going to help but instead it takes 15 minutes to get going and then, even when i'm only playing a game, my pc overheats and shuts down....&nbsp; I am not a tecci and your instructions
 are just mumbo jumbo to me - how do I find out how to revert to windows 7?&nbsp; I also hate having to 'sign in' to everything on my pc - whats the point in that?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really really really wish we were still able to use windows 3.1 - where I felt in control of
 my pc, the programmes didn't use ridiculous amounts of memory and didn't keep freaking out in really unhelpful and disturbing ways.....

<p>Restart your computer with the Windows 7 DVD in the CD/DVD drive. wait for Windows to start (this may take a while if you have a multi-boot computers), Change your language, Time/Keyboard if necessary otherwise click 'Next'. At the 'Install Now' prompt (Do
 not pick the Install Now option) instead choose the 'Repair your computer' option located in the lower left of the display.</p>
<p>Next select the 'Use recovery tool' option and click 'Next'.<br />
Use the 'Startup Repair' option.</p>
<p>Note: you may need to run Startup Repair more than once. If this does not work I have a more complex proceedure you can try.</p>

<h2>            Supreme Commander patches won&#39;t install</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I am trying to update my new copy of Supreme Commander (the original one) which I purchased just the other day, with the patches available online at<a href="http://support.thq.com/thq/consumer/kbdetail.asp?kbid=232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.thq.com/thq/consumer/kbdetail.asp?kbid=232</a>&nbsp;No
 matter whether I use the all in one patch or try all the induvidual patches, the same error comes up stating:</p>
<p>MissingMethodException Method no found: 'System.text.RegularExpression...</p>
<p>An Error has occured, the file</p>
<p>"supcom_patch_1.03189_to_1.1.3280.12.35.29.log" has been generated.</p>
<p>I have copied and pasted the contents of the log file here:</p>
<p>MissingMethodException Method not found: 'System.Text.RegularExpressions.CaptureCollection System.Text.RegularExpressions.Group.get_Captures()'.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; at GPG.Globalization.LocalizeString.SetLoc(ResourceManager resourceMan, String language)<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; at GPG.Patch.Test.PatchForm..ctor(Boolean autoStart, Boolean autoClose)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; at GPG.Patch.Test.Program.Main(String[] args)</p>
<p>I haven't had a problem installing or running the game itself, but would love to get the patches so its fully up to date.&nbsp; I installed it on a friend's machine that runs Windows XP and all those patches installed fine, so I am guessing its a Windows 7 specific
 problem.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p><span>Hi skiwithsean,<br />
<br />
- Have you tried installing the patches in administrator mode? <br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span><br />
<br />
Firstly, I‚Äôd recommend you to try and install the patches in administrator mode and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To install in administrator mode, locate the executable file, right-click and select ‚ÄúRun as administrator‚Äù. This should do it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Uninstall</span></a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Install-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>reinstall</span></a>
 the game in administrator mode and then try applying the patches and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To install the game in administrator mode,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Locate the program icon, right-click and select ‚ÄúRun as administrator‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><span>b. When the UAC message is displayed, do one of the following:</span></p>
<p><span><span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If you
 are logged on as a standard user, or if UAC is configured to always require credentials, enter the appropriate administrative credentials, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span><span>ii.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If you
 are logged on as an administrator and UAC is not configured to always require credentials, click Yes to start the application.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Proceed with the installation and check if that solves the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above steps do not help in fixing the issue, I‚Äôd recommend you to get in touch with Supreme Commander Support:</span></p>

<p><span>Hope this information helps.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Subscription cancelled</h2>
                    <p>Hello -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have received notification again that my subscription has been cancelled without my knowledge or authorization. I talked to Skype earlier this week (Case number 1409394699) and my subscription was restored. I thought the misunderstanding was resolved and
 closed. Could you please advise?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

Your subscription Unlimited World 1 month will terminate at the end of the current billing period, which is on Dec 28, 2017.<br />
<br />
Possible reasons why your subscription will be cancelled are:<br />
1. You cancelled the subscription yourself.<br />
2. You are using PayPal for your subscription payments, and either the credit card linked with your PayPal account is no longer valid (for example, it has expired), or you have cancelled your billing agreement with Skype on the PayPal website.<br />
No further payments for the service will be charged until you pay for a new order.

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I checked your account and it shows that the agent assisted you have manually reactivate your subscription and they set an expectation that you need to wait within 24 hours to renew your plan.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the&nbsp;renewal&nbsp;did not kicked-in and&nbsp;this is the reason your order&nbsp;has been cancelled. Option to&nbsp;renew&nbsp;is no longer possible. With that being said,&nbsp;we highly suggest for you to purchase a new&nbsp;subscription. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Should you have further questions, do not hesitate to contact us back. </p>

<p>Thank you Marites for your reply. I tried but I am not able to purchase a new subscription for the US package either. It is also cancelled. I talked to my bank twice. They do not see any attempt by Skype to charge to my credit card. Normally that happens
 on the 20th of the month but not for December.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could there be a problem with Skype's credit card link?</p>

    <title>.dll files missing after windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephenmartin1  say:</h3>
<h2>            .dll files missing after windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Hi to the forum,</p>
<p>
</p><p>about a month back, after the latest update, when I opened my pc,&nbsp; when I went to open different programs - Sibelius 7.5, Cubase,&nbsp; and others, [I didn't try any others as I these are my main files that I use as a musician / composer], it said .dll files
 were missing, and from what I remember, it said to reinstall the programs. Some of these programs I have would need to be reinstalled from dvd discs and then updates from quite a while back would have to be installed.
</p>
<p>I had never encountered this before, and I "went back to an earlier build of Windwos10." A Windows support person sent me links to a windows 10 download that would not intefere with my apps. I tried this a few days ago, but I had the same problem. A few
 days before this, I let the Win.10 automatic update bring my pc to the latest build, and then on opening it, the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure how to fix this. An East-West Sound support person gave me a link to some kind ofCC+ file to download, that he said would fix the problem, he added that this sometimes happens after a windows update. I tried this - didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any solutions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve Martin</p>

            It seems like a recent update or feature update might have broken your audio apps. The option is to reinstall from the original setup files or discs to repair them.  There really isn't much that can be done otherwise without the original installation files.

            What is the make and model of your PC?
<br />What version are you currently at?  Go to search and type winver.
<br />Do you have all the installation software for all your programs?
<br />
<br />I think the best route would be to do a fresh clean installation.
<br />But before we do that need to know the make and model of your PC.
<br />Also if you could get a screenshot of the error when you open those programs and post it on a cloud drive that you can share, that would be awesome.

</p><p>thank you for answering, I appreciate your time :-) . I'm not sure, though, what you mean by "audio" apps.&nbsp; Sibelius is a software notation program for musicians, and I'm not sure if you would call this an audio app, but maybe it is one -I'm just not sure
 about that. However, I'm perplexed as to what&nbsp; would&nbsp; cause the .dll files be missing for different programs? Would the update have destroyed these somehow?&nbsp; The last update, when opened, there were messages all over the screen. Some of them piled over each
 other. Lots of programs were not working by the looks of things. Maybe what I have to do, is to reinstall the updates, let things happen again, and get a technician from microsoft to have a&nbsp; look at the messages I'm getting. The other solution is to get a
 different antivirus program, rely on that for safety, and block any updates happening. It's not a good solution for the problem though.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstalling programs is a lot of work. I not only have discs, but also would have to go and re-download the latest updates, etc, and I'm in the middle of a large and very time consuming project, so to uninstall and then reinstall, is a bit of an anxiety
 developer! I'm not wanting to tempt fate, and have something go wrong. So I'm very anxious about what is happening to my pc with these updates, and what it means for me in the way of time to have to possibly reinstall things.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other way to do this without having to reinstall these?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you kindly if you have some ideas here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>best,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve :-)</p>

            Hi Stephen, this can probably be resolved without having to re-install all your software from scratch!

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>wow, so many replies, that is really great. It is past my bedtime down here in Australia, and I need to go beddy bys. Tomorrow, it takes about an hour or more to install the new windows 10, so I'll try that, and give as many screen shots as I can, and then
 I'll just go back to a previous build so I can continue working on my projects. Hopefully someone may see some kind of pattern in the problems I'm having with my programs after a windows 10 update and all can be solved. That would be fantastic!</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you all with your willingness to help me out here.</p>

            It seems like you have a mission critical workstation where no form of updates should have been applied or upgrades at all. Honestly, these are about the best recommendations I can recommend:
<br />
<br />Try these first to see if they work:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system

</p><p>I read about Windows 10 not including the Media Center........my question is will it include the Windows Media PLAYER?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If not, I do not understand what Microsoft may be thinking, as that program not being available, as the fellow said above, will be devastating

</p><p>My PC is the ONLY TV I use and I specifically picked up the version of Windows that I did for TV reception! I will NOT be switching to Windows 10 to actually use, but rather claiming my free "upgrade", zipping my current Windows 7 Professional installation

            <p>Now this is ridiculous! We have 4 Windows 7 desktops/laptops with built in TV cards, and 1 Windows 8.1 with external USB TV tuner. We all share TV across the network and watch TV on our schedule and not "theirs"</p>
<p>Is there any hope that we will be able to watch/record <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
ANY&nbsp;TV content </span>with win 10??</p>
<p>Where do these guys come up with progressive O.S's... and to think we had to&nbsp;pay for WMC for Windows 8.1...twice!</p>
<p>Is MS contributing to the demise of OTA TV?</p>
<p>Off the subject... We do not have the icon for Windows 10 in the right taskbar...just read 18 pages here&nbsp;and now not interested...</p>
<p>Isn't progress wonderful?</p>
<p>Upgrading to Window 7 was made so easy by MS with a downloadable program...&nbsp;"Advisor". Told you what would work, what to update after installation...for Windows 10 we&nbsp;have to mess&nbsp;with the command prompt...just to see an icon...like I said... Ridiculous!</p>

            I agree!! This is exasperating and ridiculous. I was in I.T.&nbsp;Project Management, Systems Development and Application&nbsp;Development for 28 years. I&nbsp;appreciate the&nbsp;enormity and complexity associated with software development and deployment&nbsp;but it is unreasonable
 to ask people to commit to a product like WMC, maybe even&nbsp;the WMC Extender, and&nbsp;then discontinue it unless they pay extra for&nbsp;it. I'm on 8.1 and&nbsp;paid for&nbsp;the WMC update after moving from&nbsp;previous versions of Windows. I use WMC in my daily work for informational
 purposes and no support for WMC will delay my ability to move to Win 10 and cause further expense and&nbsp;hassle to replace this information source. I'm not sure what Microsoft is thinking but not everything that is done on a computer is&nbsp;"fun and games".&nbsp;Actual
 work is performed using some of the previously supported software/(hardware) and it should always be supported unless&nbsp;technically obsolete.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs

            Why is Microsoft killing off Media Center?&nbsp; As with the other people on this thread, I have been using it for years.&nbsp; This is a deal breaker for me.&nbsp; If Microsoft abandons Media Center completely, I guess&nbsp;I will be heading to Linux.

            Yes, as others committed, I am unhappy with MS for not including Media Center in Windows 10. When MS announced it was no longer supporting MS Money it sent me a message and let me know that MS had worked with Quicken to provide a migration path. Is MS
 going to provide a similar recommendation for its Media Center users?

 one of the people who had the Zune. &nbsp;That is where my dislike of MS started because after the Zune ended I had no choice to go to the I pod. &nbsp;I excepted it and moved on. &nbsp;But this latest change is a slap in the face from MS to consumers. &nbsp;You fooled me once
 with the Zune and now twice with Media Center. &nbsp;You are not getting me a third time with Windows 10. &nbsp;I was a first day Windows XP, 7, 8, 8.1, tablet, and phone user but Windows 10 can stick it. &nbsp;I have already lost so much of productivity because of the lack
 of phone apps and including my bank stop supporting the Windows Phone app. &nbsp;I am starting my migration to Apple because I can at least count on Apple to support their products for the life of the product. &nbsp;I even regret getting Office 365 now. &nbsp;I thought MS
 would finally get it together like apple in the end but it seems MS has no interest in that. &nbsp;They just want to keep everything jacked up. &nbsp;I have not been much a blogger in the past but will start one to night about the migration to Apple on the heels of
 Windows 10. &nbsp;I hope Windows 10 is a huge fail and I will start with telling everyone not to even bother with 10 because it will suck just like XP, 7, 8, and 8.1. &nbsp;Way to go MS for ruining a loyal consumer base because you think you know what the public wants.
 &nbsp;I will preach to everyone I know not to switch or upgrade because it will not make a difference anymore. &nbsp;Apple is the wave of the future and MS is seeing to it. &nbsp;This is like apple saying that it is discontinuing the I pod because not too many people bought
 the latest model because they already had one of the older one already and it works fine. &nbsp;I am pissed and MS better change it mind and soon because there is still a two months for all of us smart users to get the word out that MS 10 is not worth it and not
 to do it. &nbsp;Maybe the people in China will fall for it but not us here in the US. &nbsp;Bye forever MS it was a great ride but I am getting off at this stop. &nbsp;Try pulling on without us.</span>

            Try simplifying your configuration by keeping only your mouse and keyboard attached, that means:
<br />
<br />    Disconnecting multiple display monitors.
<br />    Remove discrete video cards, use the on-board graphics if your motherboard supports it.
<br />    Swap out memory modules - a RAM module might be corrupt - you can also ensure RAM sticks are installed slots 1 and 3. Your RAM modules might be corrupt, try scanning them for errors.  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/use-the-memory-diagnostics-tool-to-check-for-errors-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/use-the-memory...</a>
<br />
<br />    If you have more than one hard disk installed, disconnect all except the target disk where Windows 10 will be installed.
<br />
<br />    Reset your BIOS Defaults. <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />    Disconnect all external devices, since connected devices can sometimes confuse setup. 
<br />
<br />See if you continue to experience BSODs or not then let us know.

<br />There were no offending drivers named so let us try finding one.

            Hi Jesse, that mini dump names usbaudio.sys as the culprit
<br />
<br />Uninstall NVIDIA Virtual Audio Device drivers and confirm deletion of the driver files
<br />
<br />Then restart your PC and Windows will load its default HD Audio drivers
<br />
<br />See if this resolves the issue
<br />
<br />If it does, you can either use those drivers, or find an update form the nVidia website

            No direct reference was there to any driver but there were two findings.One is the web camera, the other one being USB Audio driver.

            Dave is correct. I too found USB Audio device as a culprit.
<br />As a side note, Please also reinstall camera drivers to rule out if they are not the culprit.
<br />If the crashes happen again let me know.

<h3> kfcgodsword  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC Keeps Crashing While Gaming</h2>
                    <p>So I just recently upgraded my GPU in my old rig to a 1080ti, and for the first few weeks everything was going great. I've been playing Star Wars Battlefront 2 on max settings with over 100fps, and everything was going good for a little bit, but now almost
 every time I play, it will randomly freeze mid game and my speaker omit this loud buzzing noise. The first couple times it did this, it would give me a BSOD with an error code that had WARTHOG in it(I can't remember what the full code was, and now I don't
 get the BSOD). I thought it was just Star Wars doing this, but now it happened to me today when I was playing GTA 5. When I check the Event Viewer, the only events I seem to get are the four 10016 events, and after researching it a little bit, that seems to
 be a harmless event. And after my computer restarts, i get a couple of BugCheck events. I really don't know what could have caused this to randomly start happening, my best guess is that some of the older parts in my PC are failing, as it is getting old minus
 the new GPU. Here's my setup:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nvidia GTX 1080ti</p>
<p>Intel i5-4670k</p>
<p>16GB RAM</p>
<p>ASROCK B85 Pro Motherboard</p>
<p>CX750M PSU</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if there is anything else i need to provide to help, just looking to stop my PC from freezing up while gaming. Any help is appreciated!</p>

            The BSOD issue, in general, is caused by graphics driver particularly nVidia drivers.

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />Run the Blue Screen troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Try running with one stick of RAM, then swap it for the other, then change slots and try the same again.  Test your RAM overnight to stress it following this tutorial for testing sticks as well as slots:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram-test-memtest86.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram...</a>
<br />
<br />Test the hard drive with bootable diagnostics:  <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello,
<br />Do you have the dump files?
<br />We need log files(called dump files) that tell us what lead to crash.
<br />Please share them with us for a better analysis of the problem. Instructions can be found here:

            Hi,
<br />
<br />I would try completely removing all graphics drivers from your machine and installing the latest from NVIDIA. You can use Display Driver Uninstaller to remove the drivers:

                    I started using the newest version of Skype a few weeks ago and the microphone has never picked up my voice clearly since, the classic version never posed this problem.....I;ve been into Control Panel to adjust levels but still no joy.......I can't see
 any settings on the Skype home screen to play with and the sound test that used to be there is no longer......does anyone have a solution to what must be a common problem?&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your help all........
