<h2>            XBOX 1&#58; FINAL FANTASY XV FINALLY HAS A RELEASE DATE.</h2>
                    
<p>It's Saturday morning for New Zealand &amp; Australians. I'm on my Xbox 1 and I went to check out the store and woke up to this surprise:</p>
<p>Release date :30/09/2016</p>
<p>Developer: SQUARE ENIX CO. LTD</p>
<p>Players: 1-1/Xbox One</p>
<p>This has got to be like the longest game ever in development. It was first announced in
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; 2006 &lt;&lt;</p>
<p>As Final Fantasy XIII Versus for PS3 only. But Square changed the name to XV and that it will be on XBOX 1 and PS4 8th gen consoles. And no I'm not talking about the Demo. Final Fantasy XV Pre-order Bonus Pack.
</p>
<p>Some good news to start off the weekend. </p>

<p>I just watched YouTube videos Square Enix has rolled out some new trailers too and PS4 has a new demo for the game (not sure if Xbox has it since Square seems to prefer PS rather than Xbox, they are Japanese). Originally called XIII Versus, it was meant
 to be for PS3 but I guess Square wanted to make this game awesome and what I've seen it looks like it will be.</p>
<p>My first Xbox game was Final Fantasy XIII. I never played a Final Fantasy game before that. It was in 2010 where I was deciding whether to get PS3 or Xbox 360. But someone said Xbox has richer online features which PS doesn't like Xbox Live Party Chat and
 better software than Sony which I believe is true since Microsoft makes Windows OS for most PC's. (Sony copied Xbox 360's Party Chat idea and put this onto their 8th gen console -.-).
</p>
<p>More Good news I'm on my X1 Dash right now and I see it</p>
<p>Platinum Demo Final Fantasy XV</p>
<p>Size: 4.5GB</p>
<p>Release date: 31/03/2016</p>
<p>Developer: Square Enix Co LTD. </p>
<p>SURPRISE I'm getting it and the demo is free. Release date confirmed and guaranteed: After 10 years they finally have a release date. wooooooo</p>
<p>full game 30/09/2016</p>
<p>WELL DONE SQUARE ENIX. </p>
<p>I read in the early stages of this game I think Square and Microsoft were collaborating to try to get the game on Xbox. Years later Square changed their mind and it will be a good game. Square realized PS3 and Xbox 360 hardware may be too weak to run the
 game since they only have 512MB RAM, so they releasing it to Xbox 1 and PS4 since these consoles have 8GB RAM and an 8 core AMD Jaguar processor.
</p>
<p>I love Final Fantasy actually. Have only played XIII, XIII-2 and XIII Lightning Returns and XV the first demo on Xbox 1. I'm off to download and try this demo. I might do a YouTube video of it actually I will but may have to edit it since Square can be strict
 with music and some cutscenes etc. It looks like Microsoft's attempts to get this game were successful.
</p>
<p>This is the best news I've had this week. Thanks Square and Microsoft. </p>

<p>The first year of having Xbox I probably spent at least 200 hours on Final Fantasy. One thing the game is praised for is it's good graphics and battle system. I like the characters too. One Youtuber said "awww look at the graphics awww look at the graphics
 forget about gameplay". Final Fantasy is also known for having lots of cutscenes too in their games. Some say they should make it a movie rather than a game. I'm putting the release date on my calendar! I'll let you know how the Platinum Demo goes it's installing
 14% I have 100mb/s down and 10mb/s upload speed. </p>

<p>I spent 35 minutes on the demo start to finish. The controls just take some getting use to. The tutorial in the first demo was poor but the tutorials were easy in this demo, it just brought up a list of commands. As for the music I had it muted because I
 was doing a lets play video just prepping it now for YouTube. I'll play through the demo again tomorrow with the music on as I've finished my recording with the demo.

            This seems to be a common issue with current versions of Windows 10. Many users have found relief through the following steps.
<br />
<br />On your Key Board press Windows key + X 
<br />press M to open Device Manager 
<br />expand Display adapters 
<br />right click on the current display adapter 
<br />click Properties 
<br />click on the Driver tab 
<br />click on Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If this does not work please try the following
<br />
<br />right click on the current display adapter 
<br />click Uninstall 
<br />check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />exit Device Manager 
<br />restart your PC 
<br />
<br />
<br />On your Key Board press Windows key + X 
<br />press M to open Device Manager 
<br />click on "Action" at the top of the window
<br />click on "Scan for Hardware changes"
<br />
<br />Windows should automatically detect your display adapter and guide you through installing the most appropriate driver for your device.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Please let me know if you need any further assistance.

            If the above does not help you may wish to Rollback to your previous version of Windows until Microsoft is able to rollout patches to address the bugs
<br />
<br />To do this please follow these steps
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />
<br />or 
<br />
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete 
<br />Click Sign out 
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen 
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart 
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears 
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot 
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options 
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows 
<br />
<br />This information was obtained from the following official Microsoft Help document

<br />
<br />NOTE: when using recovery options be sure to watch for and select options to "keep your personal files and folders" that way you will preserve your important data

<br />Navigate to Display devices and right click ATI Radeon HD or Similar device you have. Choose Properties. 
<br />On the Driver tab, hit rollback Driver to go back to the previous version. 
<br />Option 2. Remove drivers completely and Install the the newest ones available from the OEM or the maker.
<br />What you need to do:

<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.
<br />4. Download the driver from the OEM or the maker like AMD
<br />5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.

    <title>Windows 7 Disk check at start - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Disk check at start</h2>
                    I decided to install Windows 10 and dual boot, installed it on a separate drive and overwriting an unfinished Win 10 install that had become unusable. Windows 10 doesn't show the boot menu as it should and Windows 7 will always check the disks with some
 appearing as \?\\Volume-(some string). There have been three Win 10 installs at this point, the first, second that got corrupted and the current and through out the checking happened with all three.

<p>If it is Windows 7 that is running a chkdsk on every startup (and you did not schedule it) this might be of help:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When Windows starts it checks all volumes (hard drives) for consistency and if any volume is found to be "dirty" a chkdsk with error correction will run automatically on the volume to attempt to fix any problems before things get worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The amount of time it takes for that to complete depends on the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume, the speed of your system and what the chkdsk finds to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is best to not interrupt the chkdsk and to let it complete and that could take a long time...&nbsp; many to several hours.&nbsp; It will finish sooner or later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A volume can be marked dirty from things like an aborted restart, improper shutdown, power interruption, using the reset or power button, battery pulling, etc.&nbsp; Have any of those events occurred?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can query the dirty bit on a volume from the command prompt window with Administrator privileges.<br />
<br />
Click the Start orb/button and in the box enter the following:<br />
<br />
cmd.exe<br />
<br />
Right click cmd.exe and choose to Run as Administrator:</p>
<p><br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=20382857-f809-49f2-8783-1488b77717f7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed050d98-e946-4103-acd4-0cdafc9898f9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To query the dirty bit on drive C, in the Command Prompt window enter the following command:<br />
<br />
fsutil&nbsp; dirty&nbsp; query&nbsp; C:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=f67c5518-76e1-4579-9c31-45983f113f09" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cd14ffe9-cbe0-4d5f-b4ff-553b413894f4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sample output should be one or the other of:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Volume C: is dirty<br />
Volume C is NOT dirty<br />
<br />
You should check each of your volumes or each of your hard drives (C, D, E, etc.).</p>
<p><br />
Enter 'exit' to close the Command Prompt window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a volume is dirty the only thing that can clear it is a chkdsk with error correction and you might need to run it more than one time.&nbsp; If the drive is failing, you might not ever be able to clear the dirty bit so chkdsk will always run on a restart.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the dirty bit will never clear you should consider replacing the drive but in the meantime you can tell Windows to NOT check the dirty bit on a volume by issuing a command like this example for the C drive:</p>
<p>
</p><p>chkntfs &nbsp; /x&nbsp;&nbsp; c:</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would tell Windows to never check the dirty bit on volume C but that is risky behavior because if the dirty bit will not clear, something is wrong with that drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can undo that command and reset the automatic error checking back to the default value with this command:</p>
<p>
</p><p>chkntfs &nbsp; /d</p>
<p>
</p>

            Make sure in your Windows 10 that Turn on fast startup is UNCHECKED.&nbsp; That has always caused problems with my dual boot systems when it is enabled.&nbsp; Creating the appearance of corrupt disks.

<h2>            New Skype for Mac keeps crashing when I try to make a call</h2>
                    <p>Hi, since the new version of Skype appeared on my Macbook I can no longer make any calls - first it looks like it's trying to make a connection for a few seconds, then the rainbow wheel appears for another few seconds, and then it systematically crashes.
 Never had that problem before. I've already tried out all of the solutions detailed on this page:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10916/why-does-skype-for-mac-os-x-crash-my-computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing has worked. I currently no longer have a "Skype" folder under Library&gt;Application Support (only "Skype Helper"). I've even tried uninstalling and reinstalling Skype, but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alex</p>

<h2>            How can I play DVD&#39;s on my ASUS Transformer Book Flip&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The CD/DVD drive is working fine, and I decided just now to try and play a movie on my laptop with a store bought disk. It pulled up my document folder, and it showed up under the DVD RW Drive. Of course, I didn't know what this folder was and once I clicked
 on it, it showed me two separate folders, one labeled VIDEO_TS, the other AUDIO_TS. Naturally, I clicked on the video one, but all it did was pull up these. (Picture is below, and yes it is very sideways. Bear with me.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, I clicked on a few of them to see what they'd do, and they would pull up in some media app for a split second, and then disappear. I even tried downloading a separate media app to see if I could play it there, but it was no use. I'm seriously just
 trying to play a movie here, I don't think it should be this hard. </p>
<p>
</p><p>(And no, I'm not willing to spend $15.00 on the actual Windows DVD player app.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>

 it doesn't get "lost" like soooooo many of my service tickets before mysteriously have in the past 3 years (which I kept screenshots of). Let me not get this refund.....boi.....

<h2>            Windows 10 painfully slow</h2>
                    My old HP laptop running Windows 7 Pro crashed on me so I'm using my backup laptop a Dell Inspiron 15 5000 series running Windows 10. It is ridiculously slow &amp; beyond frustrating! I don't understand how a practically "new" computer (hardly ever used) is
 running so much slower than my older laptop. I've done all the updates, virus scans, etc. It seems like there are hundreds of programs running in the background. This has been so frustrating, it's making me seriously consider switching to a Mac.

            Hi Eric.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The primary key to best performance is that NOTHING starts with Windows except Windows.  If you need a sync or to scan from printer top then those would be an exception, but all the rest are freeloaders on your system resources and should be disabled in three separate places I'll show you.  
<br />
<br />Next is to run only built-in Defender which always offers best Windows performance with least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>It takes only a few seconds to mess up a brand new computer. Trust me, I've done that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from user configuration mistakes, the other main reason for slow performance is: too many programs running at the same time. Open Task Manager [ CTRL+SHIFT+ESC ] and look at the Startup tab. All that stuff starts with Windows and runs in the background.
 Do you really need all that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not the mere number of programs that matters ... it's how much of your computer's resources they use up. To see that, still in Task Manager but on the Processes tab, look at the CPU and Disk columns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If one of the programs running in the background is a botnet or a torrent or some other kind of exploit, you can bet the mortgage that your computer will be running very slowly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, there are legitimate activities that run in the background that can slow your performance, like indexing, virus scans, file syncing, etc. But those are supposed to stop running when you are actively using your computer, i.e., hitting keys and
 moving your mouse.</p>

            It sounds like what you need to do is perform a clean install.
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

<p>kkk eu já vi esses cara, eles estão abusando de problemas do jogo, quando é assim você pode denunciar pelo próprio GTA por aproveitamento de erro do jogo ou algo assim, é provável que se esse cara levar várias denúncias em sua conta ele será levado para
 uma sala de mal perdedores ou será banido do GTA Online dependendo da situação.</p>
<p>Uma pergunta eles morrem? se eles podem morrer então o estrago que vai ocorrer pra ele não será tão grande, o máximo que pode acontecer é dele ser jogado pra sala dos mal perdedores, como eu falei. Agora se ele não morrerem e ainda estiverem invisíveis o
 problema será maior pra ele</p>

<p>Quanto a sumir do radar isso é possível se você ligar para o Lester, custa $500,00 e você fica "invisível" no radar por apenas 1 minuto; agora ficar invisível completamente é possível com 2 amigos na Oficina. Tem um vídeo no You Tube ensinando e logicamente
 eu já imaginei que daria problemas.</p>

                    I have a MacPro Intel Core I5 CPU 2.4 GHZ with 4G of RAM on which I installed Windows 8.1 using BOOTCAMP. Of course, at the start, I have a choice between using the Mac partition Yosemite bones or Windows 8.1. Regarding Windows 8.1, all existing fixed
 are applied regularly, including to move from 8.1 to Windows 10 (KB3035583 installed, tested using the win10fix_bat.com script. As I see no icon, I executed the other 3 options for this utility, without success: should activate something other thanking you

                    How do I fix this error with some applications. &nbsp;A google search indicated the problem was that the drive assigned letter C was a removable drive but this is not the problem with my system as my drive C is a SSD and is the boot drive.

            Hi, thanks for the reply. &nbsp;This issue started with one game and happened whenever I clicked play on the launcher. &nbsp;It's now happening on 2 games, one of which I installed this week, and Mozilla thunderbird has now started to show this message since yesterday.
 &nbsp;Today I was reinstalling world of warcraft and it happened 3 times during the basic install (not even the full game).
<div>
<div><br />
<div>i haven't changed anything other than installing a new internal drive (drive letter E) and then installed games onto that drive. &nbsp;Thunderbird is still on drive C, where it has always been.<br />
&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>My C drive isn't a removable disk - it's a solid state drive and is my boot disk. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If there is an option to attach screenshots I will attach a screenie of my disk management page so you can see what it looks like.</div>

            No because it didn't apply - the drive with the letter C is NOT a removable drive.

<div>I have fixed the issue now though - it was happening with every program install and getting on my nerves so I did a fresh install of windows 7.</div>

<blockquote>what is the easiest way to find the correct drivers for my on board ethernet driver. I have an HP d220 mt machine</blockquote>
<p><br />
I also seem to have a SIMILAR problem. But I can not figure out who made my motherboard. I made his computer myself, but I have also made many others for other people. Last night *Shame on me* I got a virus and had to reformat my HDD, and now do not have drivers
 for my ethernet (on-board) network card. =~(</p>
<p>I do NOT see ANY S/N's, or anythigg that could even help me figure out what kind of mobo I have. ALL I KNOW, is I have an A32GV11C mobo.&nbsp; When I went to look up the info for that mobo, it gave THIS computer a virus. but I went back in time before it effected
 it =~(.</p>
<p>Need desperate help on this. My machine (not this one I am using right now, this one is my wifes computer), is the main one with TONS of files on the backup drive, and keeping the server running also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ALSO know I have an SiS 965L Chipset. Other than that, I could not tell you anything else. if you coudl possibly help, I would appreciate it. PLEASE HELP in dire straights here.</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 Slim 320GB Hard Drive is mysteriously Unformatted.</h2>
                    
<p>Instead of the Dashboard loading, I see 'Create New Profile', 'Recover Profile' Screen.</p>
<p>360 can apparently detect the installed 320GB Hard Drive (Purchased from Walmart back in Feb 2012)&nbsp;. However it is reading as Unformatted.</p>
<p>I am having the same issues as toher had in the post&nbsp;&nbsp; "&nbsp;Xbox 360 Slim 250GB Hard Drive is mysteriously Unformatted."</p>
<p>I have been able to find a new thread and I still have a hard drive that wont format or when data is saved from the market palce or transferred to it I get error was encountered.</p>

<p>If taking the hard drive out and re-inserting it back in (instructions <strong>
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/add-remove-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>) does not work then that means that there is some sort of problem with the hard drive itself and it would need to be replaced.
<br />
<br />
It's also possible that there might be an issue with your console not reformatting the hard drive but there would really be no way to check that unless you actually had a friend or a store you could go into where they could test reformatting the hard drive
 in one of their XBOX 360 consoles (it would need to be one of the XBOX 360 S consoles). If it turns out that their console can also not reformat the hard drive then that means that it's definitely an issue with the hard drive and it would need to be replaced.<br />
<br />
If you purchased this separately from Walmart then it would only have a 90 day warranty on it from Microsoft. So, if it is out of warranty, then you'd need to purchase a new hard drive.</p>

<p>Remove the HDD and if you have the old one, put it back in. &nbsp;Make sure you have the latest updates for your Xbox.
</p>
<p>Then put the HDD back in and see if this resolves the issue.</p>

<p>Asus does not provide an EXE for driver installation. Only a zip file with INF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's located in the "Others" section in the URL below:</p>
<p>http://www.asus.com/support/Download/13/34/0/2/hj4Bczgud2bYy51f/41/</p>

<p>When I try to manually setup the monitor I'm presented with a message "The third-party INF does not contain digital signature information".</p>

            So, I was able to use the SHIFT + Restart button, then option 7 to allow me to install the unsigned driver. However after an additional reboot, the unsigned driver is removed. ****.

<h2>            Video chat isn&#39;t working on my Mac</h2>
                    I accidentally hit "Don't Allow" when it was asking for access to my camera, and now even when I tried to fix it, it still won't let me video chat. I tried to look up how to fix it but all they have is how to change it on the iPhone and not on&nbsp;the laptop.

Cancel the Seagate install, open "Computer", find the Seagate drive letter and start using it like any other drive in your system.<br />

<h2>            Front-facing Camera not working on the web</h2>
                    I have a Microsoft Surface 3 and I have noticed that when I try to use my webcam on the internet it goes to the rear-facing camera. On the camera app it works just fine. It says that my driver is up to date as well and that it is in working order, if that
 has anything to do with it.

            <p>Hey there!<br /><br />Sorry to see the trouble. To start out troubleshooting, please uninstall the game completely, and once it's uninstalled perform a restart on your PC. Once your PC boots back up, redownload the game and try playing again. If you're still having issues after that, try disconnecting your Microsoft account from Windows 10 under Account Settings, restart pc, and then add your account back.&nbsp;<br /><br />Be sure to keep us looped in with how it goes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Maree,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Shaking screen and blurry display are usually caused by an app or display driver. To find out whether an app or driver is causing the issue, see if the Task Manager flickers.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Task Manager by pressing the <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Esc</strong> keys on the keyboard at the same time. If that doesn't work, right-click the Start&nbsp; button in the lower-left corner of your screen and then select Task Manager.<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>If Task Manager doesn't flicker, an app is probably causing the problem.</li><li>If Task Manager does flicker, a display driver is probably causing the problem.<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Three apps were previously known to cause screen flickering in Windows 10: Norton AV, iCloud, and IDT Audio. In most cases, updating the app or contacting the app manufacturer for an update will resolve the issue.<br />
</p>
<p>Try to uninstall Duet Display. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to <strong>Start </strong>, and select <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>
System </strong>&gt; <strong>Apps &amp; Features</strong>, and check to see if Duet Display is listed under installed software. If Duet Display is in the apps list, uninstall it.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To update your display driver, you'll need to start your PC in safe mode, uninstall your current display adapter, and then check for driver updates.<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Start your PC in safe mode</a>, then right-click the

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sleep mode <span>uses very little power, your PC starts up faster, and you’re instantly back to where you left off. You don’t have to worry that you'll lose your work because of your battery draining, because Windows automatically saves all your
 work and turns off the PC if the battery is too low. Use sleep when you’re going to be away from your PC for just a little while—like when you’re taking a coffee break.</span></p>
