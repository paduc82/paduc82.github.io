    <title>How do you tell if you are talking to Microsoft or a scammer&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do you tell if you are talking to Microsoft or a scammer&#63;</h2>
                    <div>I know there have been numerous scams going around where they tell you there is an issue with your computer and want to connect to it and once they do they cause real problems so there is always some skepticism when someone wants to connect to your computer
 I had an issue with my computer and called the answer desk and the rep I talked to stepped me through the process and when we were finished there was no charge and everything seemed to be working fine again.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>My sister had a similar problem so gave her the link to contact Microsoft which she did and the rep has connected to her&nbsp;computer. This rep however has tried to sell her something called Assure Software Support Plan program for $149.00 a year and also
 she wanted&nbsp;her to get a different antivirus program called Trend Micro Antivirus and Security for $39.95 a year and she would give&nbsp;her free installation now.</div>
<div>&nbsp;
<p>The URL is not Microsoft.com but rather partner.support.services.microsoft.com</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I found it odd that a Microsoft rep would try to sell someone a third party antivirus when Microsoft has their own antivirus plus she was going to install it, so now I am concerned as to whether the call she is on is actually with Microsoft and not some
 scam, and I would also like to know how to know&nbsp;you are actually talking to Microsoft and not some con artist or someone that is scamming a person?<br />
<br />
Thank you</div>

            I am amazed that&nbsp;Microsoft either can't&nbsp;answer this or these questions or simply doesn't care that there are scammers out there imitating them. I had a few very&nbsp;basic questions in my original post above&nbsp;and someone provided a link that doesn't answer the

            WOW, two and a half months and no reply from Microsoft on how one is to know whether&nbsp;one is actually dealing with Microsoft or a scammer. I would have expected someone from Microsoft could answer this and not only could but would really want to given the
 number of scammers representing themselves as Microsoft employees or representatives when in fact that have no association with Microsoft whatsoever. If Microsoft can't tell us how is an individual supposed to know?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think there's a difference between walking you through the steps to fix the problem and for the Microsoft to fix the problem for you through a remote session. This is the&nbsp;<strong>Assure Software Support Plan</strong>&nbsp;from the Microsoft website:&nbsp;</p>

<br />
This error shows up when ever I try to open my Lenovo all in one PC I got in 2012. It has the simple error message and then a black background. When I try to delete the error by clicking the x, it just pops back up again. If you keep pressing x for maybe 20-30
 times, the message goes away but the black backdrop stays and I can't use my PC. I just need to extract some old files from it, so I don't mind if it isn't a perfect fix. Please help.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
P.S. The "file" in the error is my wacom pen display tablet driver.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer had an issue maybe a week before where it was stuck in a loop of "your computer did not start up correctly." It would show me three choices, to reset, refresh, or go to desktop. If you clicked go to desktop it would return to the same screen
 so I ended up just refreshing the computer to keep my files. After that, I upgraded to windows ten. The computer was buggy and laggy ever since the refresh, and a while later, the error occurred. It was running fine before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took a look at the answer, and it seems like the user only encountered the error when they try to reboot a cd or something. But I have no way to use my PC at all, so I can't follow the steps. Also, my computer didn't give me an error code like they did
 for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p />

            <p>Is the computer totally inaccessible right now, or do you have a black window with circling dots? If it's the former, let's try to do a drain flea on your computer and try booting it up again.</p>
<br />
<p>1.<strong> Power off </strong>the device.<br />
<br />
2. <strong>Unplug</strong> the power cord<br />
<br />
3.<strong> Press</strong> the power button for 30 seconds to remove any residual power.<br />
<br />
4. <strong>Plug the PC back in </strong>and&nbsp;<strong> power it back on.</strong><br />
<br />
Let us know the outcome.<br />

</p><p>I have tried rebooting the computer several times and it hasn't worked. When my computer starts, all I see is the error message on a black background.&nbsp;When I try to close the message window, it just pops back up again. After retrying this for 20-30 times,
 the message goes away but the black backdrop stays. It's just solid black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            That's not something you can fix.&nbsp; 503 means the web site received your request, but it had an internal failure on their server and it couldn't respond to you or load what you wanted.&nbsp; Only the owner of the website can fix it by looking at their private
 system logs and fixing the broken system.

</p><p>If it came from the store, it would be a digital download (no ISO/ZIP) otherwise it would be on disc.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista, and just serves
 as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft to make this
 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it:</span><br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>The input method menu appears (to choose between, Hiragana, Katakana, etc.) but I cannot select any of the options on the menu. When I click for the Hiragana option, nothing happens, and the input method stays on Romaji (or the default English letters).&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Make sure that your computer's input mode is set to Japanese IME, then follow the keyboard shortcuts provided by Shinmila H in this

<p>The same situation occures on my System. I've been using Japanese input in different form for two decades and Windows 10 Japanese IME on two different machines for over a year now. I know what I am doing. The IME is definitely broken. Hiragana input has
 become completely impossible. Switching from Romaji input to Kana input is nowhere possible inside Windows - not in Word, Outlook, Edge, Opera, Firefox, Windows Store apps or the Cortana search bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really, please don't put us off with a link to some description how to use IME for beginners. Im am using Japanese and Chinese input every day for work (I am a foreign correspondent based in Beijing), and yes, I also use keyboard shortcuts. This is no problem
 with shortcuts or not knowing how to use IME. It is a bug. Please help us make it work again. I need to input Asian characters. As I've just refreshed my PC I have no motivation to reinstall the OS again so soon.

            Thanks for the input, but this is besides the point. The problem has nothing to do with using keyboard shortcuts vs. navigating the input menu with a mouse. The IME is stuck in Romaji mode. I tried removing and re-activating it several times; to no avail.<br />

<h2>            Startup repair on embedded system.</h2>
                    
<p>My company uses windows in an sealed, waterproof, embedded application (similar to a kiosk mode). Since XP is no longer available, we have moved to Windows 7, which runs quite well, however, if our system loses power, Windows 7 will reboot into startup repair.
 After W7 has analyzed and done it's repair, it will stop at a prompt waiting for user input to continue, however since our system has no keyboard, the system becomes hung and cannot be used until it is shipped to our headquarters, disassembled and connected
 to a keyboard.</p>
<p>We never had this problem with XP since it will run scandisk and then simply complete the boot process.</p>
<p>Is there some setting in Windows 7 to bypass the user prompt in a case where there is no keyboard present?</p>

</p><p>I tried installing NVIDIA setup by running troubleshoot compatibility to windows 8. but I cant install it because of something not compatible with my computer, now I installed them through settings(check for updates installed 353). Finished updating it to
 latest and now it gets worse. checked by restarting and restarting in clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AGAIN I used Display Driver uninstaller and clean re install my NVIDIA to fix it.

            <p>hi there :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>i think i know how to solve it.</p>
<p>first go to power option put your system in high preformance.</p>
<p>after that right click on your screen and go to nvidia control panel in there you will find and option that says what driver is in use you can change it to nvidia for all apps. or customize it manually choose what app use what driver.</p>
<p>and one more thing update your drivers to the last patch.</p>

<h3> dori_  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Taskbar doubled in size&#33; Help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So I was reading an online comic when all the sudden my task-bar switch to the right. I knew that could happen and that's not the problem. The problem is, that when I went to switch it back to the bottom, my task-bar had doubled in size! It's now taking
 up double the space. As if my taskbar was full and instead of doing the slidey thingy on the side of screens, mine just decided to double it's size. But the thing is, again, that's not the case. My taskbar is actually really empty with only 9 icons and plenty
 of room. What happened and how to fix this, please!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what I don't get is that the icons that were already on the task-bar, like the windows button, Cortana, and date/time button, have all adjusted to this change and are in the middle of the bar while the icons I pinned are at the top of the bar. That I
 don't get. Can you change the size of a task-bar? .......<em>why</em> Microsoft would you need something like that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, hope you can help, I don't want to have to deal with this for long!</p>

            Hi Dori,
<br />
<br />Strange thing to have the taskbar switch to the right. But rest assured, you can resize the taskbar by right-clicking a blank area on the taskbar, then click "Lock the taskbar" in the context menu, when checked. The taskbar should now be unlocked. Hover over to the top edge of the taskbar, and hold the left mouse button, then drag it downward until you get it back to the right size. You can then relock the taskbar by right-clicking a blank space on the taskbar again, then click "Lock the taskbar".
<br />
<br />Let me know how this goes, or if you have any additional concerns, feel free to shoot a reply and I will do my best to get back to you. Good luck!

<h2>            wireless keyboard and mouse periodically lose connection</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes my wireless keyboard and mouse lose their connection momentarily. This started about a month ago. Usually they reconnect in about 10 seconds. But lately there have been times when they haven't reconnected. Restarting fixes.</p>

<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Solution that fixes the problem:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">&gt; netsh wlan set autoconfig enabled=no interface=WLAN</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Problems with the solution:</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px">The WLAN AutoConfig service needs to be reenabled after Windows restart or when you want to connect to another WLAN.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Conclusion:</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px">There is a feature in the WLAN AutoConfig service that periodically does something that causes the hiccups in the connection.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Other solutions tested:</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px">Alot, from disabling many optional services like network discovery to using programs like "WLAN Optimizer". All of them did not work.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Other observations:</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px">- When changing drivers of the WLAN Adapter the regular ping increases from ~21ms to ~26ms and the ping spikes increase to over 1000ms. Restarting the router fixes this and I am back to ~21ms with 400ms+
 spikes.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px">- The same problems occurs using the 2.4GHz band, but effects are increased.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Question:</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px">Is there a better solution, than to disable and reenable the WLAN AutoConfig every time, like disabling the specific part of the WLAN AutoConfig service that causes the problems?</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Edit:</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px">The problem started ~7 days ago, before that I used the same networking hardware and the connection was completely stable. I recently upgraded alot of my software and firmware and bought a new headset and
 bluetooth adapter.</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px">I upgraded:</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 60px">- Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 (~2 days ago)</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 60px">- Router Firmware Update</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 60px">- BT adapter is disabled in the device manager</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px">The problem started under Windows 7 already, but I didnt put that much effort in diagnosing the problem with the hope that a Windows 10 upgrade would fix it.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>*The issue happens when I'm trying to install all the update apps that my pc need (I'm attaching you a screenshot of a failed update of other app)</p>
<p>
</p><p>*The troubleshooting steps that I follow are the next ones:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a)I already did method 1 &amp; 2 (the ones you suggested me)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;b)I Ran the "sfc /scannow" command Result= windows REsource&nbsp; Protection did not find any integrity violation</p>
<p>&nbsp; c)I also ran the Run "DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth" command.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all these steps I still got the same code error while trying to download and install the app that I bought (Minecraft)</p>
<p>
</p><p>*I haven't made any changes to my computer since I bought last summer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please I need assistance so I can install Minecraft for my son, it was a gift for him, and we still having this issues.</p>

            <p>Hi James, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Are you unable to boot the computer to normal mode? </p>
<p>2. What is the make and model of the computer? </p>
<p>3. What is the complete/exact error message? </p>
<p>4. Do you have Windows 7 installation DVD with you? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue normally occurs when the hard drive is failing to boot. Let's perform the steps provided and check. If you are able to boot, you may let&nbsp;us know.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may run chkdsk from WINRE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to troubleshoot this issue will run chkdsk from WinRE(Windows Recovery Environment )mode and check for the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Chkdsk (Chkdsk.exe)</b> is a command-line tool that checks volumes for problems. It runs automatically only if you have any problems. The tool then tries to repair any that it finds. For example, Chkdsk can repair problems related to bad sectors, lost
 clusters, cross-linked files, and directory errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To run check disk, you have to have Windows Vista DVD, boot the computer to Win RE from the elevated command prompt, and try to do a CHKDSK. You can follow these steps to run CHKDSK :</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span> </span></span></span>Use the Windows 7 DVD to start the computer in Windows Recovery (WinRE).</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span> </span></span></span>In WinRE, open a command prompt. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span> </span></span></span>On the Install Windows screen, select the appropriate Language to install, Time and currency format, and Keyboard or input method options, and then click Next.</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span> </span></span></span>Click Repair your computer.</p>
<p><span><span>e.<span> </span></span></span>Click the Windows 7 installation that you want to repair, and then click Next.</p>
<p><span><span>f.<span> </span></span></span>Click Command Prompt.</p>
<p>At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>chkdsk drive: /p</b></p>
<p><b>chkdsk drive: /r</b></p>
<p><b>Chkdsk disclaimer</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Reply with the status so that we could help you further.

<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Also, I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I would suggest you to boot into Last known good configuration and check whether you are able to boot to the desktop normally. Follow
 the steps mentioned below.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Restart
 the system and keep tapping F8 till you reach the boot menu.</span></span></span></span></p>

 Last Known Good configuration from the list and then press Enter.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I would suggest you to check whether the Drive is detected in the BIOS.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span><span>Method 3:</span></span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Is
 there an additional Hard Drive to present install Windows?</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>If yes, then I would suggest you to install windows XP and check whether you are able to boot from there.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span><span>Method 4:</span></span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I would suggest you to check the Boot sequence in BIOS and change it to CD/DVD drive to boot first instead of Hard Disk and check whether

<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>If you are able to boot using the CD then access Recovery console as mentioned in my previous suggestion and then run the following commands.</span></span></span></span></p>

            Thank you. I had to use all of the reference links and use the /p /r parameters but it worked. It happened right after an uninstall and I would have sworn that it was software but it turned out to be a bad sector on the hard drive that chose that moment
 to fail.&nbsp; I would suggest that having examples would make it a little easier for the general user. It takes us true children of W95 awhile to remember our command lines.

            <p>No.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those ideas are either impossible to work, unlikely to work, might work sometimes maybe and could break your system in other ways.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That error indicates a problem with your NT File System (NTFS) on your system of unspecified make and model is.&nbsp; The file system can get corrupted from things like a power failure, aborted restart, ungraceful shutdown, etc.&nbsp; Have any of those events occurred?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you need to do is run a chkdsk with error correction (chkdsk&nbsp; /r) and to do that you are going to have to boot your system on something - either the Windows Recovery Console or the best idea is to boot on a Hiren's Boot CD and run the chkdsk from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since we don't know anything about your system here are some instructions about how to create a Hiren's Boot CD and run the chkdsk with error correction assuming your system is running XP and you have a working CD/DVD drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is not the case, you need to provide more information about your system.</p>
<p>
Here's how:<br />
<br />
Make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD which you can download from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a><br />
<br />
The ZIP file is large, so the download will probably take a little while to complete bit it is worth it.&nbsp; Then unzip the download to extract the Hirens.BootCD.ISO file that will be used to create your new bootable CD.<br />
<br />
Creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file is not the same as just copying the .ISO file to a blank CD.&nbsp; You have to use software that understands how to burn a .ISO file to a CD to create a bootable CD.<br />
<br />
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it, but I have never used it and prefer to use ImgBurn.<br />
<br />
If you need a free and easy CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a><br />
<br />
Like many third party programs you might install, the ImgBurn installation defaults to installing things you probably don't want installed on your system in the form of extra Internet browser toolbars or may make other adjustments to your browser.&nbsp; You don't
 want to install any of that so you have to pay attention during the installation.<br />
<br />
When clicking through the installation screens be sure to pay attention to the screens and always choose a Custom install and UNcheck the following (or any other things like it):<br />
<br />
UNcheck:<br />
<br />
Install the AVG toolbar and set AVG Secure Search as my default search provider<br />
Set AVG Secure Search as my homepage and newly opened tabs<br />
<br />
Choose custom installation again and UNcheck the following:<br />
<br />
Uncheck:<br />
Install QuickShare<br />
<br />
There could be other things too.<br />
<br />
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:<br />

<br />
It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
These adjustments are&nbsp; made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.<br />
<br />
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options.&nbsp; Choose the Mini XP option.&nbsp; Then it will appear that Windows is being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are already
 used to using.<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop.<br />
<br />
One way to check the disk for errors is to open My Computer and right click your afflicted drive and choose Properties, Tools, Error-checking, Check Now... put a check mark in both the boxes and then Start.<br />
<br />
Sometimes that doesn't work, so you can also click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<strong>cmd</strong><br />
<br />
Click OK to open a Command Prompt window and enter the following command (assuming XP is installed on your C drive)<br />
<br />
<strong>chkdsk&nbsp; c:&nbsp; /r</strong><br />
<br />
This disk checking can take a long time (perhaps several to many hours) depending on the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what the disk checking finds to do.
</p><p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on the the speed of your system, the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what chkdsk finds to do, it may take a long time for chkdsk with error correction to complete (several to many hours) or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'.&nbsp;
 Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something so don't interrupt it.&nbsp; It will finish eventually one way or the other.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards
 sometimes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have to run the chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; it more than once.</p>
<br />
When the chkdsk runs clean, remove the CD and restart your system.

            <p>I had the same problem (probably my own mistake-too hasty) and got the unmountable boot volume message.</p>
<p>I tried booting in safe mode-no luck.</p>
<p>Then I tried with my original WinXP installation dvd, it got to where you can choose between installation and repair, so I did R, and then it tried to find its files or something, but couldn't do it (multiboot system)</p>
<p>So I downloaded Hiren's bootable CD,wrote it to disk and booted with that.</p>
<p>It went great! I got to mini winXP and the did run cmd</p>
<p>and chkdsk c: /r</p>
<p>It took about 2 hours, then I rebooted win in normal mode and...up it went!</p>
<p>Great stuff.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for helping me out.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When exactly you get the error message and what is the exact error message or error code?<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have any yellow question or exclamation mark against any devices listed in device manager?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You may receive the error message for multiple devices on the computer, so let’s first check in the device manager if any device has a yellow question or exclamation mark against any device.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you find any device with any mark right on the device and click on properties to get the error message details and post back here. As a workaround you may try uninstalling the drivers for such devices and restart the computer. Restarting the computer might
 install the proper drivers for it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Step to uninstall the drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on&nbsp;<strong><span>start
</span></strong>button.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the search box type <strong><span>devmgmt.msc</span></strong> and then press enter.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the video card device and right click on it<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now select <strong><span>properties</span></strong>.<br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the properties window, under <strong><span>Driver&nbsp;</span></strong>tab, click on
<strong><span>Uninstall&nbsp;</span></strong>button.<br />
f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the uninstalling the drivers restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>You may also download and install the latest driver for it from manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
