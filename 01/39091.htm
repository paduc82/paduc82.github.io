<h2>            No Administrator Account on my laptop</h2>
                    <p>After I was changing some settings in user accounts I somehow accidentally disabled my administrator account. I now cannot change my account type because you need admin to do so. I am out of luck and I was wondering if anyone of you had suggestions on how
 to fix this. </p>

    <title>Windows 10 Temporary Profile - How do I regain full access to my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cj_825  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Temporary Profile - How do I regain full access to my computer and personal files</h2>
                    This afternoon my computer locked up. There was an error message indicating that windows had stopped working. As I couldn't do anything I switched the computer off. When it restarted I received a message indicating that my computer was being repaired.&nbsp;
 This took quite a while and when I was finally able to access my computer I found that all of my personal files as well as my settings had disappeared.<br />
<br />
I have tried restoring my computer to a restore point. However I get an error message to say that it was unsuccessful.<br />
<br />
As I had years of data on my computer and it still seems to be in working order is there any way that I can locate these files without resorting to a backup.
<br />
<br />
I tried the Microsoft contact centre for help but it won't let me type in my telephone number to book a call and the service is now closed for the night.<br />
<br />
Any help or ideas would be appreciated.

            It seems that the problem that I am having is because windows has created a temporary profile and I need to know how I can recover my actual profile.
<br />
<br />
When I start up my computer after a while there is a message that comes up in notifications about my Microsoft account but it disappears before I can read it.

            I have been using Windows 10 for quite a while now so this issue came up out of the blue. I was using Microsoft Outlook (Office 365) to send and receive emails. The send operation worked well. At the same time as receiving I opened an email containing
 an attachment (Google Chrome) .&nbsp; It was not spam and it was an email that I was expecting. Windows suddenly stopped while I was looking at the attachment.
<br />
<br />
At this point I switched the computer off because it had locked up completely and when I restarted the computer it said it needed to repair. When it finally restarted I had a temporary profile.<br />
<br />
It was suggested to me that I needed to restore to a previous restore point which I did but the operation failed.<br />
<br />
As I could not print to my printer or create permanent files I do not have any record of why the restore did not work.<br />
<br />
I was wondering whether this could have been due to programmes that were running in the background so I need to know how and what to kill before attempting this operation again.<br />
<br />
From what I understand possibly my personal folders still exist somewhere but I won't know this until I can recover my profile.<br />

<h2>            New laptop with Windows 10 pre installed</h2>
                    <p>Well, having upgraded my 5 year old HP laptop from Windows 7 to Windows 10 I got fed up of black screens... So I decided it was time for a new one! I have just purchased another HP laptop with Windows 10 pre installed rather than an upgrade so hopefully
 that will be better... I suspect, or should I say hope that most issues were due to upgrading an old laptop...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, 2 questions.....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I downloaded Windows 10 to a USB from the old laptop, will that be current for the new one or do I need to re-download again? both are Windows 10 home.. ??&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nice to see also that when I attempted to roll back the old laptop to windows 7 it screwed it up and now will not boot, just starts windows then a flash of blue screen and reboot... Start up repair fails.. any ideas on that one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good job I replaced it and intended to use it as a 2nd PC in the bedroom...&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Depends what build the new laptop is and when you downloaded the USB image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the new laptop go to Settings &gt; System and select About. What is the Version and OS Build. (there's no guarantee the laptop is up to date yet)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insert the USB media (don't run it) but right click on the setup.exe and select properties look at the Details tab and see what the Product/File version is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Product version matches the OS Build then you have the same level on both USB and new laptop. (10586 for instance)</p>

            <p>Yes they are the same. Your USB is the base build of your laptop at 10586. The level after the . (10586.545) shows you have all the latest updates (cumulative and otherwise) and is completely up to date for that build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were to download the most recent ISO image (anniversary&nbsp;update)&nbsp;for example you would have 14393. That will be the next level for your laptop. Just as a side note I am still waiting for that via windows update so don't worry that you haven't seen
 it yet.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I did notice when I went onto the media creation tool download website it came up with a message that I was not running the latest version, so I presume that is the Anniversary update, which like you I have not had yet :)&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I have a feeling that all my issues, and a lot that I have read are all related to people that have updates from Windows 7/8 to Windows 10, I have seen very few related to brand new Windows 10 "out of the box" note books..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to reinstall my old one now as rolling back seemed to have failed big style... although I may do a clean install of Windows 10 to see if that works better... I really do like Windows 10 :)&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Yes the anniversary update will be the latest media creation tool. You could go mad and clean install that if you have a spare USB to use. As you say most of the problems have been due to upgrades and not clean installs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you clean install remember all data will be lost so you should have a backup of your personal data. (but that may be too late now if you can't start-up the old laptop) You could try a repair with the USB you have if you need to get data off the old device
 first. Depends what state it is in if it failed a recovery.</p>

            <p>I do have a back up which I used to restore the new laptop I purchased yesterday to replace the old one, so loss of data is not really a problem now, the new one has all the stuff I need on it the old one is just going to be a 2nd "bedroom" machine that
 gets little use...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It stated it was restoring the old WIndows 7 then came to "restart" then came up with the error, so I suspect it may be too far gone to use the USB to restart Windows 10, but I am tempted to do a clean install now and see how it coped with Windows 10, if
 all fails there is the recovery partition from the original purchase date so I could use that..&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Think that is what I will try first, nothing to lose now, I have a new one which will hopefully work OK, i.e no black screens, after all this was installed from day one with Windows 10.. Maybe the upgrade causes the issues in most cases as it has to change
 a Windows 7 PC rather than install from a blank canvas..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another question... When I was in the PC store I tried this HP laptop about 3 times to make sure it went to sleep and woke up when the lid was opened and it did, and this one, so far, tried 3 times and been OK... so "fingers crossed"...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did notice is non of the notebooks in the store had "hibernate" in the power menu regardless of manufacturer.. Have they removed it now from new builds? not that I ever use it...&nbsp;</p>

            <p>There is a function in Windows 10 called Fast Start-up. As I understand it this utilises hibernation to start faster from a cold start. Certainly on my desktop with Fast Start enabled the bios shows Resuming from Hibernation when I start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look at the setting for Power Options in Control Panel and select Choose what the power button do on the left. You should see there Shut-down Settings (at the bottom) and there is Turn on Fast Start-up (recommended) and should be enabled.</p>
<p>Given the statement Restart isn't affected if you do a restart it would suggest that is slower.</p>
<p>

            Just checked, fast start up is ticked but hibernate is in the menu but not ticked... seems like default is not to show it in the menu.. I looked at an ASUS laptop and that was the same as well as another HP&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 account problems and Windows firewall problems  get the error code 0x800706D9</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 10 account problems</p>
<p>Recently been having problems signing into the xbox app. I only play the Solitaire collection and do the daily challenges but it won't sign me in via the app. I can access the account via the internet. I am signed onto my microsoft account. I have searched
 for answers to this problem and tried everything. I get the code 0x800706D9 which i understand means i need to activate my windows firewall. When I try to do this via system and security the page becomes unresponsive. I have Avast and Malwarebytes. I have
 run scans on both and have no issues. I ran the account trouble shooter and it said i have issues with the sync sevice but as far as i'm aware i have no devices to sync (i don't have a mobile phone or any wireless headphones etc.) Is there anything i can do
 to get this problem fixed bearing in mind i'm not very good with the technical side of things?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error “0x800706D9” will result when the Windows Firewall/ICS service is in a stopped state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are facing issues with the Xbox app and the Windows Firewall I suggest you to follow the below methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to download and run the <strong>app troubleshooter</strong> from the below link and check.</p>
<p>The <strong>app troubleshooter</strong> will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, or if you're unable to open the Store, try running the
<p>
</p><p>This tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>This error is by design. Most users who want to disable the Windows Firewall will use the Windows Firewall wizard and set the firewall to "Off" rather than disabling the Firewall/ICS service directly. When the Windows Firewall/ICS service is stopped you
 cannot even launch the Windows Firewall wizard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the below steps and check if it helps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows Key + R</strong> for <strong>Run.</strong></li><li>Type <strong>devmgmt.msc </strong>and then <strong>Enter.</strong></li><li>Right click on the <strong>Windows firewall</strong> and then set it to <strong>
Automatic.</strong></li></ol>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. If you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you</p>

<p>Using the other keys under&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\... might have been the correct way to disable and enable defender, but it did not help after I changed the value under HKLM\System...\Services.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In the end I was happy to have Windows 10 Home Edition only and update to the Creators Update. After the Update I was able to enable defender again and windows update too.</span></p>

<h2>            Samsung YP-S3 not recognized by laptop</h2>
                    
<p>A friend gave this Samsung YP-S3JAWY/XAA mp4 player to me but the computer does not recognize it.&nbsp; His laptop found it with ease.&nbsp; I have the latest updates on Vista and also have an iPod shuffle that works with my computer.&nbsp; The driver has been updated
 and I've done all the troubleshooting tips on the Samsung website.&nbsp; Their site said to go to the run command and type in "cmd".&nbsp; On their site, it had C:\Documents and Settings while my computer has C:\{name}\user:&nbsp; Any ideas on how to get this thing to work?</p>

<p>Hi, I'm pretty sure that game is an online only game and as stated on the game case does require a Gold sub in order to play.

</p><p>Garden Warfare 2 has a single player option that doesn't require a Gold sub I believe.</p>

            Hi Mxmxm, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />When your PC first begins powering on, you should be able to press either F12 or F2 or F8, which will bring you into the boot menu or BIOS. From here you can set which device to boot from, and you can choose USB to boot directly to your installation media.
<br />
<br />If you need further assistance, let me know what model your PC or motherboard is and I'll see what other steps I can provide! Thanks!       
        </p>

            Hi MX.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />With the new UEFI BIOS we don't set the bootable media to boot in Setup, because WIndows Boot Manager must always remain set first to boot.  
<br />
<br />Instead while powering up press the BIOS Boot menu key for your PC brand or motherboard here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Then look for the UEFI version of the bootable media you made first for a UEFI BIOS.  If none then use the normal name of the bootable media.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated steps here for doing the best possible Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />
<br />If you receive a popup asking if this solved your problem please ignore it, as it will remove my ability to help you and others may also not help.  Please wait until after the issue is resolved to answer the popup or mark your question answered to help others.

            If you have the modern UEFI BIOS then set it to defaults and then make sure UEFI is enabled, Legacy or CSM is disabled, Secure Boot and Fast Boot are disabled during install if necessary and WIndows Boot Manager is always set first to boot.  
<br />
<br />If you have an older Legacy BIOS then just set it to defaults.
<br />
<br /> Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            Hi Mxmxm~,
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

<h2>            My Windows 10 System has been hijacked - now what&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This past week I was using my system with Excel, Word and Edge.&nbsp; Suddenly a pop-up dialog box said my Adobe Flash was out of date.&nbsp; I figure what the heck I should update it, so I clicked within the box to update my system.&nbsp; One of the biggest mistakes of
 my life!&nbsp; The result is that programs were downloaded I didn't want, ask for and know I was getting including some dangerous software.&nbsp; The following was downloaded at the least:</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1.&nbsp; When I attempted to enter this info, the formatting became all screwed up.&nbsp; In fact, I had the info in an Excel file in my system which I attempted to copy and paste piece by piece and it became so
 messed up I had to delete it and start new in a new form.&nbsp; WHY?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2.&nbsp; How can I possibly find one place where the disastrous download and install occurred?&nbsp; Can I undo all the issues where this happened, or</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">3.&nbsp; Must I somehow remove all this software one by one and how?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">4.&nbsp; since this "hijacking" took place, I have had all kinds of "permission" errors especially when I attempt to save an image or a file in Excel or Word - why</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">5.&nbsp; How can I avoid this happening in the future as the dialog box that began this all looked 100% authentic and I had no idea there were other programs involved in the download and install.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">6.&nbsp; When I finally get my system cleaned out, I want to then download and install the SpeedDial from the authentic location so I do not get hijacked again, or is this a bad idea. I didn't really use it
 but it looked useful.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">7.&nbsp; Does anyone know of any issues with ByteFence?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">8.&nbsp; Why didn't Defender stop this?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">9.&nbsp; I also intend to install WinZip from the official site.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">10.&nbsp; OF all this, have I missed anything?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">11.&nbsp; Can anyone recommend a GREAT anti-virus, anti-malware combined program that works extremely well?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I do believe this is all.&nbsp; However, I do not understand why Adobe has not caught this and stopped it, either manually or legally and further, if there are legitimate programs.&nbsp; I would like to stress, I
 have basically been unable to use my system since this all happened due to all the issues and errors and problems and concerns so I desperately need help and appreciate all who attempt to do so.</p>

            Hi, TemporaryUser0101
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />I recommend you to completely repair Windows, before you have to make a copy of your personal files

<p>Completely repairing Windows, as you suggest, will not identify the hijacking software downloaded this past week, will it?&nbsp; I do not believe it will.&nbsp; Secondly, even if it does, will this completely remove all the software involved in this hijacking? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know about for everyone else but looking at this on my screen, it is all screwed up!!!!&nbsp; More from the hijacking?</p>

<p>Since you have a list of the programs installed by the installer you clicked on then you could first try to uninstall them one by one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can, right click Start and select Apps and Features. Look down the list of installed apps and see if the one you don't want are in the list, remembering there will be ones installed by the manufacturer so you may not recognise them all.</p>
<p>Select the entry to remove and then Uninstall. Although it may be long winded I would suggest a restart after each uninstall.</p>
<p>Start &gt; Power &gt; Restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once all the programs/apps are removed (if indeed they are) then download, install and run Malwarebytes Home:</p>

<p>Hopefully, I am about to attempt to correct these issues before I go completely wacky.&nbsp; I am getting a LOT of "permission" errors.&nbsp; I had several new files in both Excel and Word and when I attempted to put a name on them and save them (FILE / SAVE AS /
 BROWSE to correct location) I get an error that I had do not have permission to do that although every file was saved.&nbsp; To ensure they were saved, I would then go to the file and click on the SAVE icon on the top left but then would get "Do you want to replace
 the existing file" and would click on YES.&nbsp; Do you believe this is all again part of the mess created last week, or something new?</p>

<p>I couldn't really say what has caused the save permission errors, it may well be the software installed last week. If it wasn't happening previously then it would point to that.</p>
<p>You could run Malwarebytes first and then try to uninstall the programs/apps but you should still run it at the end when you have uninstalled what you can.</p>

            Peoples will give differing answers based on their experiences. Personally I have had minor issues with Winxp and none with Vista, Win7 &amp; Win8 on systems that run 24/7, current win7 systems have run this way for 3 years

            <p>All of the recent Windows operating&nbsp;systems can be pretty reliable. The problems tend to arise with particular drivers and software and how he computer is used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are planning to go for a new computer then I would go for Windows 7 or 8 to give you more future proofing.</p>

            <p>They were all the best in their day.. well maybe not ME. Windows Millennium was the only OS which could crash without any user intervention. Having said that, if it was run on a Windows 2000 spec machine, it was OK..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XP didn't come good until the SP2 update in 2004, but it was&nbsp;way better than its Windows 9.x cousins. Looking back, it was fast and furious, but a little sloppy compared to what followed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vista was great on a machine with enough power to run it, and it forms the base of Windows 7 and 8. Vista's strength was that it checked and double checked everything that it did. It's weakness was that it took forever to do it, hence the need for top flight
 hardware.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 7, the last of the 'desktop only' operating systems is probably the best to date, but then again, it has had longer to prove itself than Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8 makes for a really good desktop OS, but I think that the Modern UI needs work doing on the apps and general app reliability. It is still early days.</p>

            <p>I would agree with Windows 7, my current system has been running for 3 years used every day and has been extremely stable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should say it does depend a little on the software. I don't run suspicious software and if I want a utility to fix a particular problem I will install it, run it then uninstall to leave my system as clean as possible.</p>

            Windows operating system is always&nbsp;reliable&nbsp;and best if used with the respective hardware requirements and if upgraded a little higher than that. As such, Windows is reliable and best in operation as mentioned by most of the people, but in most cases this
 reliability is affected mostly by hardware components and some software components - hard disk failure, RAM failure,&nbsp;overheat, security breach, etc. If these issues are solved with suitable tools, any version of Windows is reliable.

<p><span>Please follow the method given below and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><u><span>Please follow the method given below and check if that fixes the issue.</span></u></strong></p>
<span>
<p><br />
</p></span><span>Note: Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly.
 Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the
 following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base: <br />

<br />
How to back up and restore the registry in Windows<br />
Method:<br />
1. Type regedit in RUN or startmenu search box and press Enter. It'll open Registry Editor.<br />
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2. Now go to:<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>3. In right-side pane, create a new DWORD value AltTabSettings and set its value to 1</span></p>
<div>
<p><span>Post back with the result<br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. That's it. Now whenever you'll press "Alt+Tab" keys together, it'll show Windows XP styled classic "Alt+Tab" Switcher screen instead
 of the new screen.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>5. To restore default Aero enabled "Alt+Tab" Switcher screen, simply delete the AltTabSettings DWORD value created in step 3. Log off
 and login again to take effect.</span></p>

    <title>Delete Available Update in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ktstov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Delete Available Update in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an update that Windows 10 keeps notifying me that it failed. It's a samsung type driver (which is for a phone, my laptop is not a samsung brand) that I do not want to install, however, there is no way for me to delete it from the list. This popped
 up when one of my friends connected their phone to charge through my laptop and it has not been removed since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot find any means to remove it from the list and the icon shortcut in the control panel no longer exists for Windows Update. So how am I suppose to "choose" the updates (Windows 7 Updater setup for example) I want rather than have Windows update every
 single thing that connects to my computer or programs that I install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.<br />
</p>

<p>
</p><p>With the Mail app, you can have all your email—from Outlook.com, Gmail, Yahoo!, and other accounts—in one single app. So there's no need to go to different websites or apps for your email. And there are no ads, so you get to focus on what’s important to
 you.</p>

            <p>I'm an "older" user and I frankly get a little ticked when people use age as an excuse.&nbsp; One would think that "older" people would have had more exposure to computer use than younger ones.&nbsp; Of course, there are times when age creates cognitive difficulties,
 but many "older" people just use age as an excuse for their own lack of effort in learning about what they're doing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your present difficulties, you don't explain the problem(s) well enough for anyone to be able to help.&nbsp; Go to the top of this page and click on "Ask the community" and start a new thread with the details of your problem, especially what you mean by
 "tool bar."&nbsp; I think you might mean "<em>task</em> bar," but can't be sure.</p>

    <title>External USB DVD Stopped working with Surface Pro 3 USB driver update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ken verb  say:</h3>
<h2>            External USB DVD Stopped working with Surface Pro 3 USB driver update</h2>
                    <p>I have a SAMSUNG external USB DVD drive reader/burner, model SE-208GB, that has stopped working on my Microsoft Surface Pro 3 i7, running Windows 10. &nbsp;It is a single cable USB DVD player/burner. &nbsp;It worked before the most recent Microsoft USB driver updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the USB driver updates, I lost all use of my USB port function and had to uninstall all the USB drivers and restart. &nbsp;After restart and reinstall, my USB port works normal on all my external drives to include USB 2 and 3 except my SAMSUNG DVD drive.
 &nbsp;The external DVD drive works with all other computers I have tried, to include my All-in-One desktop computer running Windows 10, so it isn't the external DVD player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Surface Pro 3, the drive will start up, open up the drawer, and spin up the disk in low speed. &nbsp;The computer will recognize the drive and when the disk goes into high speed, the drive stops, and the USB connection is lost and the drive is no longer
 recognized as if I had unplugged it. &nbsp;If I unplug it and reconnect it will continue the same pattern. &nbsp;It did not do this before the recent USB driver updates. &nbsp;I suspect the power use changes that were causing problems with battery drain for the Surface Pro,
 that were supposedly fixed with the recent USB driver changes, have restricted the amount of power the USB port will provide. &nbsp;So now the USB port will not power my "one-cable" external USB player under high demand. &nbsp;It does require more power than most USB
 devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again...it was working normally before the USB driver updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help Please?</p>

            <p>Hi Mirza,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any external devices connected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may disconnect any non-essential external devices and see if the installation continues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Place the computer in a clean boot state to check if it helps.</p>

            <p>I had the same problem "couldn't update system reserved partition". &nbsp;It appears that when Windows 7 was installed, Windows allocated 100MB for the system reserved partition. &nbsp;It is almost full, and has no space for what Windows 10 wants to put into it. &nbsp;BTW,
 this error also showed up when people tried to upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 8 a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>Windows 10 will likely allocate 450 MB if installed clean.</p>
<p>There are some options that I have read about around the interwebs, but I have not done any of them:</p>
<p>1. Backup all your data, install Windows 10 clean from the self-booting disk. I do not know that anyone has done this successfully.</p>
<p>2. Buy one of the data partition management software on the market and do the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;prep: &nbsp;backup all your data and have a system recovery disk to reinstall Windows 7 if necessary</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;step 1: shrink disk D:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;step 2: move D partiton rightwards where there is spare unallocated space</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;step 3: move C partition &nbsp;rightwards</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;step 4: there will now be unallocated space to the right of the system reserved partition. Theoretically, you can now extend the size to 450 MB.</p>
<p>3. Turn C: active, so that you can combine the MBR and C: into one partition, and reboot clean three times. &nbsp;This procedure is unclear to me, and I need to read more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any other methods, please reply. If anyone has successfully done any of the above, please reply in detail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>rick</p>

            Minitool Partition Wizard does the trick. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Resize the System Reserved Partition, giving it more space.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows RT 8.1 Unable To Connect To Hidden SSID Using WPA2-Enterprise</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have been unable to connect to our corporate network using the WPA2-Enterprise authentication on my new Surface 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I check the available wireless networks the SSID is not listed (it's not broadcast) so I went through the "Manually connect to a wireless network" option. &nbsp;I've added the SSID and selected WPA2-Enterprise as the security type. &nbsp;The Encryption type reads
 AES and both it and the Security are grayed out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After having added the network in this way, it still is not listed in the available networks and if I attempt to add the network again, I receive the message that a network already exists. &nbsp;So somewhere it's remembered the network I've added, but it's not
 providing any way for me to connect. As a side-note I am currently connected to this same WiFi network using iOS devices and have not had any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on where I can find the network that I added so that I can attempt to connect by authenticating with my credentials?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p />

    <title>Remove Microsoft Account from windows 8 account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Remove Microsoft Account from windows 8 account</h2>
                    For the first 2 months of running 8.1 pro, I had an account with a password for the lock screen. Then today after accidentally opening "Calendar" my windows 8 account was replaced with my microsoft account and now requires my microsoft password at the
 lock screen. How do I go back to how it was (i.e. remove the microsoft account from the windows account)?<br />
