    <title>CPU overheat DURING updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thebestusernamever  say:</h3>
<h2>            CPU overheat DURING updates</h2>
                    Last night the new windows update was forced on my machine. During the update My CPU overheated 4 times, leaving me at the bios screen each time. I had to turn the computer off for 20 minutes at a time just so it could finish the update. Today&nbsp;while I
 was running a defrag it canceled me out of doing that&nbsp;so it could&nbsp;run another update which also overheated my CPU.
<br />
<br />
I've never had this issue before. I put my CPU through many stressful tasks like video editing, rendering, and gaming every single day. It's never overheated until these updates starting running. It only overheats DURING the updating.&nbsp;I'm also not&nbsp;happy that
 we as users have completely lost control on when to run the updates. The active hours settings isn't much of a help either.
<br />
<br />
Question is what can I do about this issue? The vents are free of dust, new thermal paste, and like I said my CPU is constantly under stress yet it can't handle operating system updates? Something is wrong on the windows end.

            <p>Assuming you're happy with your cpu installation (check 1. thermal paste correctly applied, 2. fan cooler correctly seated and working), I find it hard to believe that its just windows updates which increases CPU heat.&nbsp; That just doesn't make sense.&nbsp; However,
 here's an interesting guide to CPU issues as a result of the recent Windows updates...</p>

            The thermal paste is applied correctly and the fan is installed correctly. I video edit and render video every day. I also use Prepar3D which is a flight simulator that uses a lot of CPU. It should overheat on these tasks too if there is an actual problem
 with the CPU. I also wonder if it's a false positive. I've had CPUs overheat before and when that happens you can feel the heat coming out of the vent. Every time it was saying the CPU overheated I felt inside the case and outside the vent and there was no
 heat what so over. So I wonder if it's not actually overheating but it thinks it is. My CPU runs at 55-58 regularly during stress tests.

            <p>Ok, I've seen 2 similar experiences to yours. Last weekend a laptop was overheating - confirmed by temperature and fan noise.&nbsp; I'm sure this was a thermal issue (paste needed reapplying or heat sink has come off etc.)</p>
<p>The other was my own HP laptop. 6 months ago I upgraded to 10 and fan noise increased.&nbsp; My first thought was bugged temp settings as a result of the upgrade and I installed "Notebook fancontrol" which easily provides a facility to override the default fan
 control settings.&nbsp; This solved my problem.&nbsp; I suggest you give it a go.</p>

<p>PS. at the time I didn't look too much at the actual temp values but my laptop varies between 50degC normal use and it goes upto 70 when stressed.</p>

                    I honestly need assistance. My work is online for a computer class. The commons page was asking me to clear caches and cookies so the site would run optimally for me now and in the future. How do I do that on Windows 8.1? Is it through Control panel or
 the delete history page? When I tried to get to delete history page, it would not go there. I have a toshiba laptop computer with Windows 8.1 on it. Please assist soon!!

    <title>Install Windows on multiple partitions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brandon taylor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Install Windows on multiple partitions</h2>
                    <p>Since the earliest days of Windows, everything has been deposited to one C: drive ad infinitum. This was all well and good at first, but technology has advanced so far in over 30 years that this concept has become obsolete. As more and more
<em>junk</em> gets piled onto the C: drive, Windows gets slower and slower and slower, until it reaches the point (as far as users are concerned) that computing just becomes impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, what the Windows developers need to do is to take a page out of the Linux book, and give users the option to install Windows on more than one partition -- that is to say, reserve the OS itself for the C: partition, but store everything else on different
 partitions. For instance, there could be a dedicated partition for drivers (which currently reside in C:\Windows\WinSxS), one for "Program Files," one for "Users," and one to hold the page file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>What resides on C:</strong></td>
<td><strong>Should reside in</strong></td>
<td><strong>Ideal size of partition</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C:\, C:\Windows, C:\Windows\System32, C:\Windows\SysWOW64</td>
<td>C:</td>
<td>35-40 GB</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C:\Windows\WinSXS</td>
<td>D:</td>
<td>At least 20 GB</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C:\Program Files, C:\Program Files (x86)</td>
<td>E:</td>
<td>At least 20 GB</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C:\pagefile.sys</td>
<td>F:</td>
<td>At least as much physical RAM on your device</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C:\Users</td>
<td>G:</td>
<td>Rest of drive</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Surely everyone has by now heard of Microsoft's growing relationship with Linux. I for one certainly hope that Microsoft will one day implement the Linux way of doing things, at least when it comes to disk partitioning.<br />

<h2>            I changed my screen resolution, then reverted, and it messed everything up</h2>
                    <p>I had to change my resolution because of an in-game issue, I then reverted it because everything was tiny, and now the borders are off screen and because of that I cant even see the minimize or exit button on chrome or anything. I tried the "recommended"
 but it has adds massive black bars on the side of my screen</p>

<p>What is the game ? What is the native resolution of your monitor, and what graphics processor does your machine use ?</p>
<p>- Have you restarted your machine after changing the desktop resolution back to 'recommended' (native) resolution ?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You changed your monitor resolution to match the resolution you are running an old game at ?</p>
<p>It sounds like the first attempt had scaled back from a 4:3 aspect ratio to the wide screen 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080 ? )</p>
<p>on the Desktop successfully, but the resolution has stuck at 1024x960 or similar low resolution the game ran in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current issue with black borders would occur if you are still set to a resolution that is native to 4:3 aspect ratio on a</p>
<p>wide screen monitor. This creates black borders to retain the original perspective when watching video or running a game</p>
<p>that does not have wide screen resolution options to select from.</p>
<p>1440x900 &amp;1920x1440 are examples of a high res 4:3 aspect ratio which would have black borders on a 16:9 screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">You can&nbsp; <strong>force fullscreen</strong> when using this type of resolution in your graphics processors control panel.</span><br />
Note that some video, games or other graphics may not scale correctly to wide screen.</p>
<p>When this happens the image often gets stretched sideways and distorted.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Those who do a lot of things that use a resolution native to 4:3 would be inclined to select '<em>Aspect Ratio'
</em>(Nvidia), </span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>'Maintain Aspect Ratio'</em> (Intel HD) in the gpu control panel scaling settings.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This allows the game, etc, to run with the black borders while the Desktop is fullscreen and set to a wide screen resolution.</span></p>

            Hi..
<br />Resolution you set is not capable for the screen. It is not a major problem. Reason is screen not understand the resolution.
<br />

            Hi Andrew
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop, do you see a control panel for your graphics (Intel HD . . etc.)
<br />
<br />If so, open that, then look for an Aspect Ration setting
<br />
<br />Try the different Aspect Rations (Automatic, 16:9 . . etc) to see if that fits your picture to your display . . .

<h2>            HP Laserjet 4200 not working since installing N300 wireless router</h2>
                    
<p>I set up a new computer with Windows 7 and connected it to existing router.&nbsp; There was a HP LaserJet 4200 connected to the router as well.&nbsp; This configuration worked.&nbsp; I installed a new Netgear N300 wireless router connecting both the computer and printer

<p>I am able to get out to the internet using the router with Cat5 cables on 3 computers and wireless on 1 computer so the router is working.</p>

<p>This probably is a mixup between the IP address and/or subnet assigned by your previous router and the new router.&nbsp; Print a network configuration page from the printer's front panel controls to see how it is set up.</p>

<p>Now take a look at the network configuration of your computers.</p>
<p>start &gt; cmd (run as admin) &gt; OK<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ipconfig /all {Enter}</p>
<p>The IP address of your printer must be in the same subnet as your computers.&nbsp; For most home routers, this means that the first 3 octets have to be identical.&nbsp; The Netgear N300 uses 192.168.1.xxx, so your printer's IP address MUST be 192.168.1.x, where x
 can not be 1 (the address of the router itself) or a number assigned to one of your computers.&nbsp; If you have the printer configured to "obtain an IP address automatically" the router will pick an appropriate IP address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, printers are often configured to use static IP addresses.&nbsp; Although this is preferable, if your printer was set up to use a static IP address with your previous network setup, it may no longer be compatible with your current network.</p>
<p>You also should check to see what the computers are looking for.&nbsp; My Windows 7 box is unavailable at the moment, but I think the procedure is similar to XP:</p>
<p>Open Printers and Faxes and right click on the networked printer.&nbsp; Select Properties.&nbsp; Click the Ports tab.&nbsp; The port that the printer is using should already be highlighted, so click Configure Port.&nbsp; Look in the box for "Printer name or IP address."&nbsp; If
 it shows an actual IP address, this means that the printer will only look for the printer at that address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the address has changed (see discussion above), the computer won't find the printer.&nbsp; If there is a "printer name" in the box, the computer "should" find the printer ... but may not be able to do so for a variety of misconfiguration.&nbsp; That's why it's
 preferable to use static IP addresses for printers ... but you have to be careful that both that the printer is set to a static IP address proper for your network and that the computer knows to use that address to find the printer.</p>

            Is it a Desktop or a Laptop? For the time, a CMOS battery is used in a Motherboard which is responsible for running time even when the computer is off. When that wears out, the time starts to misbehave.
<br />You might also get a warning that CMOS checksum bad or something similar when you turn on the computer.

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Right click the clock in System Tray at right end of task bar, choose Adjust Date &amp; Time, then Additional Date &amp; Time Settings, choose Set the Date and Time, then in popup choose Internet Time tab, choose Change Settings, from drop down menu another Sync server from drop down menu, choose Update Now and then OK.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then go into BIOS to check BIOS clock for accuracy.  If not then replace the CMOS battery which holds the time current in BIOS and Windows when it's not running.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            This sounds like your CMOS CR-2032 chip is no longer working and needs to be replaced. Its a small chip that stores basic information about your computer and keeps the time when its off. Its a small silver coin on the motherboard. You can get replacements where ever computers products and electronics are sold.
<br />
<br />You might need someone to help you get it installed.

            <p>Ok. I'll stick with the Netgear driver. It's dated&nbsp;21/04/2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found a later one (http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/30067/~/a6210-software-version-1.0.0.34) but it looks like it's incompatible with usb 3.0 on my motherboard. Installing this driver makes windows think the adapter is being quickly plugged
 in and unplugged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's just an external USB adapter not built-in to the motherboard. I've also tried multiple usb ports with no luck. I'd like to avoid usb 2.0 not only because of performance but because it's a largish adapter and my only usb 2.0 port is on the front of my
 case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way my home is set up doesn't really allow for me to use ethernet so I can't check that. But I'm assuming that step would only be to troubleshoot on board anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the compatibility mode and it gets to a point where it just hangs. It doesn't freeze, just continually thinks it's installing a driver but really doing nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile I've received a different bsod (SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED) and uploaded the dump here&nbsp;http://1drv.ms/1Lm6fca is this related or a seperate issue?</p>

<h2>            Fix for Windows 7&#63; Workstation service causes crash, but I need the service</h2>
                    I've installed Windows 7 Pro 64 on 2 different machines. Both exhibited problems after a few days; one would occasionally slow or crash, the other would only run in safe or diagnostic mode.<br />
<br />
The first machine is a Gigabyte MB, AMD 5400 Dual core with 4 GB and the second is an ASUS MB, AMD 9600 quad core with 8GB.<br />
<br />
I removed, updated and reinstalled NVIDIA drivers, BIOS, ran Windows update. I checked every service using msconfig and found that when I deactivated Workstation, both machines ran beautifully. However, they can no longer access each other's folders/drives
 over the network. (They do still appear as 'Media Devices'.)<br />
<br />
I reinstalled wkssvc.dll from the repository by removing it and running sfc /scannow, then I enabled the service again. The machines are a little more stable, but crash when I launch applications such as Firefox or Photoshop. Again, disabling the workstation
 service made these symptoms go away.<br />
<br />
In the Event Log, I see Service Control Manager Error 7001 (Server Service Failed to Start), Distributed COM Error 10005 (error 1084), and occasionally error 7000 (Cannot find MCSTRM), Service Control Manager Error 7026, and Error 41 (Kernel-Power).<br />
<br />
These machines ran Windows Pro 32 and Windows Pro 64 without issues. The upgrade to Windows 7 was a custom install (not the upgrade from Vista).<br />
<br />
If anyone has information that could help me fix the workstation service issue, I would be grateful.<br />

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am moving from macbook pro to surface book 2 and i am utterly disappointed because the text on surface book2 is too thin and hurting my eyes.</p>
<p>i have tried cleartext and mactype and still i am not satisfied with text thickness.</p>
<p>
</p><p>higher screen resolution to the fixed pixel size of windows is a big problem that Microsoft isn't fixing.</p>
<p>can microsoft fix this please. my eyes are hurting.</p>

            zoom zoom, with great displays comes great eye strain.  Uma if you go to your  display settings and zoom it in to roughly about 150-175% everything should be clear and large.  I have horrible vision and I had headaches from time to time from trying to read small text, so one day i took the suggestion from someone else to zoom in and I haven't looked back I take out my contacts and I can easily see everything without straining my eyes. Also if you lower your screens brightness a little it helps as well.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7dbeaa06-ef6f-4366-9645-89df30085102?upload=true" />

<h2>            KB2760411, KB2760588 but now &#34;CANNOT CONNECT TO&#34; SQL Server&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Today, I've been coping with the same Windows Update problems as many people -- with KB2760411 and KB2760588 endlessly reinstalling -- and attempting to resolve that included multiple system restarts --
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ((((a example link to THAT issue is here:&nbsp; http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update/updates-trying-to-install-over-and-over-again/2a624908-f4b1-46d8-87ed-caa09674ff4f?page=8&amp;tm=1378919114747 ))))<br />
<br />
BUT NOW........ a serious problem on one of those machines:&nbsp; cannot access SQL Server!
<br />
Luckily, I have not run these updates on any *production* machines (I do updates on development machines, first) -- this is a development machine -- but I still need to get this machine's SQL Server working!
<br />
<br />
I've tried using a Windows login to connect, and tried using a SQL Server user to connect, and either way, looks like the same message:&nbsp;
<br />
"Cannot connect to &lt;servername&gt;." <br />
A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections. (provider:
 Named Pipes Provider, error: 40 - Could not open a connection to SQL Server) (Microsoft SQL Server, Error: 2)<br />
<br />
<br />
Note that, for windows, this server is running Server 2003 (which is why I selected the "windows xp" drop-down value, below),
<br />
and for sql server, it's running SQL Server 2005. <br />
<br />
HELP???!<br />
<br />
ALSO NOTE:&nbsp; I KNOW THIS IS NOT A "NETWORK-RELATED" ERROR, <br />
because I get the same message when I remote desktop into the server, and try it there.
<br />
I did try looking in the windows event viewer for Server 2003, but saw nothing pertinent under Application, System, or Security.
<br />
<br />
When I attempted it with a sql server login, I clicked "Show technical details", and got the below (blank lines removed, and the servername replaced with &lt;servername&gt;):&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<br />
===================================<br />
Cannot connect to &lt;servername&gt;.<br />

            Thanks, Nirmal, for the acknowledgement. <br />
<br />
As you can see, we ended up finding the answer ourselves.&nbsp; <br />
(BOL doesn't even document how to grant "Log on as a service", under Server 2008 R2, WHEN ON THE DOMAIN CONTROLLER.&nbsp; BOL documents that fully for Server 2003, but only partially for Server 2008 R2.)&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
But we aren't given the option to "mark as answer" on our own solution. <br />
If YOU think the INFORMATION we posted had value, YOU could mark as answer. <br />
<br />

    <title>Problem with Microsoft store - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael ...  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Microsoft store</h2>
                    <p>For quite a long time I have a problem with Micorosoft Store, using it from a local account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The store app works OK as long as I don't sign in.&nbsp; I can see the list of installed apps,</p>
<p>also&nbsp; can search for an app and see the app pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to download an app, the app asks to select Store account. As soon as I sign in, I get a message:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try that again</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something happened at our end. Waiting a bit might help.</strong></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Error code 1</strong>
<p>
</p><p>As long as I am signed in, I cannot see see any app pages. The message appears all the time. Once I sign out, everything works again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Reinstalling Microsoft.WindowsStore&nbsp; and Microsoft.StorePurchaseApp (with Add-AppxPackage from PewerShell) doesn't help. &nbsp; Running wsreset&nbsp; doesn't help either.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I even deleted&nbsp; 'Microsoft.WindowsStore'&nbsp; 'Microsoft.StorePurchaseApp' folders from
<em>AppData\Local\Packages. </em>After wsreset&nbsp; the folders were recreated.&nbsp; The problem persisted though!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am out of any ideas. The only thing I am certain is that my Windows Store account is OK, since everything&nbsp; works from another Windows account&nbsp; of the same Windows installation, as well as from another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully resetting the system can fix the problem. But quite obviously I would prefer to it in an easier way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read (rather weird) suggestions about settings system locale to en-US or even modifying XBox parameters.&nbsp; That doesn't make sense given that another&nbsp; computer works all right using same locale and same Xbox configuration.</p>
<p>

            Have you tried creating another local account as your user profile? As you've mentioned that you have another PC with the same setup and there seems to be no issue with it; the current local account that you're using might be corrupted, reason for the
 issue to occur.<br />
<br />
We suggest <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/instantanswers/5de907f1-f8ba-4fd9-a89d-efd23fee918c/create-a-local-user-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
creating a new local account</a> and check if you'd still get the same issue. <br />
<br />
Update us with the outcome.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for asking the Question!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It was disheartening to know that you face issues with Mouse Cursor. As I get it right you want to get rid of the blue circle which appears around the cursor.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I need to ask you a few questions in order to assist you in a better way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When does the blue circle appear around the cursor?</p>
<p>2. <span>Were there any changes (hardware or software) made to the computer prior to the issue?
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Have a nice day!</span></p>

<h3> mickmouse  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 weather app</h2>
                    <p>As of yesterday my windows 10 weather app is only showing a daily Forecast when up until now it has also shown the hourly forecast as well.</p>
<p>The hourly forecast has been very useful to plan my days so why has it&nbsp;disappeared all of a sudden.</p>
<p>There is nothing on the net to remedy this.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled it but still no hourly forecast.</p>
<p>This is very annoying when Microsoft change something for the worse that was working perfectly well.</p>
<p>So why has this been changed and how can I get it back to how it was please.....</p>

            The area I live is not on the 'Data from Foreca'&nbsp; link and you cannot put in your postcode as it does not recognise it. The nearest location it has to me is Nottingham a good 15 miles away so not an accurate forcast for me. With the app before some idiot
 messed with it you only had to input your postcode as it still does to find your area but as of now no hourly forecast. Whoever is responsible for this may he be painfully constipated without relief for the next year!!!!!!!

    <title>Missing Logon&#47;Logoff Events in Security Log - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Missing Logon&#47;Logoff Events in Security Log</h2>
                    Hi Everyone,
<div>I will preface this question by stating that I'm a Linux user, so I'm by no means a Windows expert. &nbsp;I apologize if this question is trivial, but I haven't been able to find a similar problem or solution out there.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Basically, we have several instrument computers in our department for which we use the Security Events log to tabulate usage on the instrument for billing individual faculty. &nbsp;I've written some custom BASH scripts in Linux that take the logs, parse out
 the relevant information, calculate the hourly charges based on the time of day and then spit out a csv report with the charges for the month. &nbsp;This works very well on two of the instruments. &nbsp;However, on the third instrument computer, there are at least 5-10
 logons per month in which either the logon or logoff is missing from the events log. &nbsp;I've written the script to removing these hanging logons, but it's obviously a problem as we're missing multiple sessions per month and undercharging the users (it does warn
 for beginning and end open logins so that we can check the previous or subsequent months for sessions that span the end of one month and the beginning of the next). &nbsp;Has anyone else run into this issue before? &nbsp;It seems weird that the other two computers don't
 have a problem at all. &nbsp;Any help would be greatly appreciated!</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
<div>Rob</div>

            Hi nath921,
<br />
<br />The new Skype app it is being updated constantly to bring it up to the functionality of Skype 7, Microsoft are working very hard in the background at the moment. . . 
<br />
<br />In order to improve Skype, please provide feedback to Microsoft regarding any shortcomings or bugs you have found in the new Skype app on this thread
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-128c-40eb-a99b-f3985c925176">https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/28c3578a-1...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are unhappy with the new Skype app, Microsoft have decided to extend the period for which Skype Classic (version 7) will be available, the September deadline, no longer exists
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic:
<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program is compatible with Windows 8 operating system. As you are having trouble installing the program, follow these methods:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p>I would suggest you to install the program in a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>clean boot</b></a> mode and disable startup items to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: After troubleshooting, refer to the section “<b>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</b>” to return the computer to a
<b>Normal startup</b> mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p>The .NET Framework 4.5 is included with Windows 8 and installed on your computer with the operating system. However, the .NET Framework 3.5 is not automatically installed with Windows 8. To run applications that require the .NET Framework
 3.5 on Windows 8, you must enable version 3.5 on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to the articles for additional information:</p>

<h2>            &#34;Access Denied&#34; message in Device Manager</h2>
                    I can't update the driver software in any of my installed hardware on my computer via right-clicking on them in Device Manager. It gets to the "Installing Driver Software" progress bar before stopping and giving me an "Access Denied" message. Why does
 it do this? I'm the only one who touches my computer, much less uses it. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, how do I work around the "Access Denied" message and give myself permission to do stuff like that?<br />

<p>Hello KenSalerno1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand that you're used to having Skype separated with Microsoft. However, Skype is now a program being owned by Microsoft and the main reason why you are unable to unlink the separate Skype account to Microsoft is to align Skype's usages and policy
 with Microsoft as a part of our One Microsoft Program. And the good thing about this one is that you can use just one password across all Microsoft products and Services like Xbox and Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the status issue while in Outlook.com you can set your status to <strong>
Available</strong> or <strong>Invisible</strong> by clicking your name and selecting the status from the options displayed. Click
<strong>Invisible </strong>if you don't want to appear in the Skype Directory. You need to manually change your status every time you log-in to Skype using Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this answer your query. Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>

<p><span>I also have this exact same problem. I was about to post my own seperate question, but spotted this first.</span></p>
<p><span>As </span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/9f99dafd-9a82-438f-9479-eedff6e4f0a0" title="KenSalerno1"><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">KenSalerno1</span></a> said, "I would prefer not to have to be signed into Skype every time I check
 my email on Outlook.com. Not only that, the Online Status like "Appear Away" or "Appear Invisible" never gets saved, and I have to manually change this- again every time I check my email with Outlook."</p>
<p><span>Why hasn't anyone done anything to address this issue when so many people have requested to&nbsp;bring back the option to unlink your Microsoft and Skype accounts!?</span></p>
<p><span>Personally, the sole reason I had linked them in the first place was because about 2 years ago, an overseas friend asked me to create a skype account during a phone call conversation so we wouldn’t have to pay to speak anymore, and I needed a MS account
 to log in. I already had a MS account, and being pressured by my friend and new to the platform, linked the two together quickly to try out the service. I was not aware that a Skype account could only be linked once to a Microsoft account and vice versa, as
 there was no provided warning of this while signing up and had no clue that I would eventually be stuck with the two together. This was also before the option to unlink accounts was removed, and had I known this would happen, I would have created a separate
 MS account just for chatting with a few key people, keeping my main account, which I use to log into my email and PC, on its own.</span></p>
<p><span>This leads me into my proposal, which was brought about by learning that I could no longer unlink my accounts, (a change which happened in early 2017 without my knowledge or being warned), and the annoyance of Microsoft signing me into Skype whenever
 I use any other MS service!</span></p>
<p><span>As such, if the option to unlink accounts will truly not be restored at the very least create the option to permanently set your status on a linked skype account to an invisible default. It is vexing to be bombarded by people wanting to chat each time
 I log into my outlook account to get work done. Skype at the moment only temporarily keeps the invisible status when set manually after logging in, and is frequently reverted back to "available" with the next time I login to my email; a problem that many users
 I’ve found, including myself and now KenSalerno1, have run into. As a customer of Microsoft, I ought to be given the control to manage my "presence" online or lack thereof as needed to suit my daily needs. Announcing to the world that I am checking my email
 while scrambling to check the correct status, and hoping that no one had noticed so that I can continue to work in peace should not be a hassle that I need to be deal with.</span></p>
<p><span>If I could, I would delete my skype account and create a new one, but right now that would also delete my Microsoft account which I wish to retain. So in short, either create the option to unlink the two accounts again, create an option to go invisible
 that doesn't remove the status when signing into any other MS service, or to independently delete a skype account without destroying the attached MS account. Send the ideas up to whatever group or area in the company deals with these issues, but have them
 dealt with! Simply repeating how to click a temporary button does not fix the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Sincerely,</span></p>
<p><span>LC83</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 8 buggy again after many problems and refreshes.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, this has been my third refresh during the last 2 weeks. Windows 8 has&nbsp;always worked fine for me, until about 2 weeks ago, when it got in an automatic repair loop after a restart.&nbsp; I tried everything to fix it and eventually I had to refresh Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I finally managed to install most of my lost programs and began enjoying my PC again, suddenly Windows explorer crashed and started shutting down and restarting all the time. When I tried automatic repair then, it got stuck in another loop, this time&nbsp;with
 a nice BSOD at the end. I searched a lot on the internet and tried everything I could to fix it, but at last I had to refresh again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that refresh Windows seemed to work perfectly and better than ever before, I could even install some updates I haven't been able to install before because of some kind of bug. So after a certain update the upgrade to Windows 8.1 appeared in the app
 store. My first attenpt to install it has failed, so I searched the error code up and ran the update again while in a clean boot with updated graphical drivers. The update failed again, but this time my internet connection broke completely. After some research
 i discovered the WLAN AutoConfig service couldn't start up because of Error 193: 0xc1. I tried all the possible ways to fix it I found on the internet, but nothing worked. At last I did a third refresh out of despair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since that refresh, I can't sem to be able to install the half of the updates and all the click-on boxes of the metro interface miss all text. When I tried to contact Microsoft support, I discovered my product-id is "unavailable" and everything is just very
 buggy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what should I do now?&nbsp;Might yet&nbsp;another Windows refresh help? Does it have sense to perform a clean install? Is it necessary?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd also like to finally have windows 8.1.</p>

<p><strong>Does a clean install fix all possible hard drive problems? </strong></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hello, I've had a lot of trouble with my PC for the last 3 weeks, including BSOD's and other kinds of bugs and crashes. I described most of it in this question:
<div><br />
</div>
<div><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-system/windows-8-buggy-again-after-many-problems-and/7618aacf-7503-44ed-a3ff-ebe0d6823832"><font color="#0072c6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-system/windows-8-buggy-again-after-many-problems-and/7618aacf-7503-44ed-a3ff-ebe0d6823832</font></a></div>
<div><font color="#0072c6"><br />
</font></div>
<div>Now everything seems to work fine again, but I keep getting several kinds of problems. When I was trying to install video card drivers my computer kept freezing, most Metro apps shut down after opening, some programs won't start sometimes and I'm getting
 a lot of other errors. My computer needs to fix hard drive errors several times a day.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Everything points at hard drive failure. However, I'm using an SSD. I have no idea if that changes anything though.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, my final question was, would a clean install stop all this trouble for good? And if not, what would possibly help?</div>
</div>
                </div>

            I just wanted to let you know I finally discovered the cause of the crashes. Because those made Windows completely inaccessible, I couldn't get the dump files. But after each clean install Windows crashed after I installed a bunch of software. But I wasn't
 sure which software it was, so I made a false bet and my computer crashed again.
<div>
<div><br />
<div>So, after the 2nd clean install, I searched for crashes with the program I suspected the most, Deamon Tools. Every crash came when I restarted the computer after a session I installed or used Daemon Tools in. And indeed, it turned out to be known for causing
 BSODs. However, that sounded weird to me, because I have been using it for many months and it never caused problems.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After my 3rd clean install, I decided to restart my computer after every program I installed, in case of another false bet, but to not install Daemon tools. And now, while I'm typing on my beloved PC, it's working fine with all my software, except Daemon
 Tools.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've also red there are also issues with pretty much every other ISO mounting program on Windows 8. Any idea how to mount ISOs anyway? (Edit: oh, it seems Windows 8 has a built-in ISO mounter.)</div>
