            Mine has been working fine until I tried duplex printing today. It stops after side one in an error condition and no window opens to tell it to continue to side 2. I have not tried any driver reloads yet, but will now. Good luck. Again.<br />

<p>I have noticed alot of issues on Black ops as well, i was reading something a while back about the Black Ops servers not really being dealt with like they should, because of the release of the New COD game this November, i dont know how much truth, if any
 there is to this but that may be something to look at :) </p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Did you make any changes to your computer prior to the issue occurring?<br />
<br />
Seems like Java is corrupted. I'd suggest you uninstall and reinstall Java and check if the issue persists. Follow the steps from this article.<b><br />

<h2>            Skype Contact Not In &#34;Contact List&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I was going through my contact list because I got the email notification that someone I know added me (which is true, although already in my list).</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT I found a name in Skype's "All Contacts" that I've never seen before and don't recognize the name or picture. I went ahead and blocked them and looked in my Address Book (which I assume is Microsoft's "People") and the name did NOT come up!</p>
<p>Skype literally says " &lt;name&gt; is an address book contact, but needs you to connect first before chatting."</p>
<p>Again, NOT in my "address book" (whatever that is supposed to be)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wait a second... "...needs you to connect before..."? So, I never added them? What address book? This is a request?</p>
<p>Don't you think there should be SOME notable visual cue that a request to be added as been made rather than just adding every moe, larry, curley?</p>
<p>Shouldn't there be a "view" specifically for all requests, rather than just adding the user to "All Contacts". Perhaps "All Contacts&nbsp; &nbsp;Online&nbsp; &nbsp;Bots&nbsp; &nbsp;Requests"? Is this REALLY something that has to be suggested? How unbelievably stupid. The Skype of old
 did things just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say (or maybe needed), I've been keeping my eye on Ring.cx and Tox but they have their own problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gawd, seeing another "contact" that I'll be blocking. Just random numbers and letters.... aaaand another one. I've NEVER been notified of these "requests"... not even an e-mail request like what prompted me to look to begin with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How could microsoft royally screw up something that worked just fine before?!</p>

<p>Just lovely...</p>
<p>I was looking at Skype Preview as well as Skype Web and I'm seeing different contacts in the Preview.</p>
<p>One that I don't recognize in the Preview isn't even listed in the Web one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wasn't the Linux Skype supposed to be an Electron container of the Web skype?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unbelievable, the "contact" says we have "1 Mutual Contact" but doesn't even say who the mutual contact is. God, I don't even know anyone overseas.</p>
<p>There's a group chat that somehow I was in, even though I wasn't in it. There's nothing even in the chat. I do at least recognize the other person in the group chat. The group chat also says "2 others" but doesn't even say who they are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another one to block, also looks foreign.</p>
<p>WTF! The entire display just changed. When I blocked that contact, it still shows along with the option to block yet the user shows in the block list.</p>
<p>Deleting the chat took care of that one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Great, now someone with my username plus numbers appended... absolute garbage.</p>
<p>Yup, that contact still shows even though blocked. I gather it's just chat history on the left side and blocking doesn't remove the chat history (even though there is NO chat history with those people. "You haven't chatted on Skype yet". along with no date).</p>
<p>
</p><p>God are these summer highschool interns working on this? It's absolute garbage and not what I've know of microsoft from years ago (before switching to linux).</p>

<p><span>Hello Nathan-Vindicator, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for all the feedback. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please be advised that the address book being referred to is the <strong>
list of contacts in one’s device or the local address book</strong>. This happens when your device’s address book is synced. They may not have been added to your Skype contact list that is why it is sending a request.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>With the new Skype, anyone can contact you. </strong>If someone sent you a message, his name will show on your 'chats' list, even though he is not yet added to your contacts list. Please refer to this link:
</span><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34785/why-can-anyone-contact-me-in-the-new-skype-on-desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Why can anyone contact me in the new Skype on desktop?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Some Skype names may be identical but probably owned by a different person. That is why, it is recommended to countercheck the account (using an email address or other information) before adding them to your list.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are not seeing the same set of contacts on Skype Preview and Skype for Web, it is probable that you are signed in to a different account. Also, the contact list on the left side is the recent contacts you had conversations with. It does not
 show all your contacts. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Again, we appreciate your observations and suggestions. This will be forwarded to our developers.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Regards, </span></p>

<p>Desktop:<br />
Linux KDE</p>
<p>NO address book<br />
Skype 8.22.76.6 (upgraded over night)<br />
</p>
<p>(OMG, this freaking forum! I delete a line between lines and a NEW LINE is appended after the deleted line (even backspace a blank line). God microsoft fell a looooong way. How does this not even get noticed?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Smartphone:<br />
Android 4.4.2</p>
<p>1 Contact in address book (me)</p>
<p>Skype 8.15.0.195</p>
<p>Sync phone: Off</p>
<p>
</p><p>Web:</p>
<p>Skype on web</p>
<p>1 Google account</p>
<p>1 Microsoft account</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contacts that I ended up blocking were NEVER found in either of Google Contacts nor Microsoft People.</p>
<p>Those people I blocked WERE in the chat list with NO chat history (not even a date). There was no "Block/Accept" for any of them.</p>
<p>In previous versions, I had "Contacts Only" set for who could find me and in the latest, had to turn off "Appear in search results and suggestions. I only want people who knew my email address to be able to contact me.</p>
<p>Again, there was NEVER any notification of any kind of those "people" I blocked. I will give a 100% guarantee that those that I blocked are not known to me AT ALL (unknown names, random numbers/letters, random numbers appended to username matching mine).</p>
<p>New contacts MUST ALWAYS be put in a quarantined bin like Contact Requests like before rather than just put in the Contacts list. Absolute garbage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only have one account I use for skype unless I'm specifically doing some testing, which I would use my test account that only has my normal account as a contact. This does not get confused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Microsoft Agent"... is this title similar to the "Community Specialist" in the Google forums, where I was contacted to become one of them?</p>
<p>It gave me some insight to who the "helpers" were (eg: random moe larry curley). I use the word "helpers" VERY loosely, only because their intent is to help, but the vast majority I've interacted with were clueless.</p>
<p>You can bet I wasn't going to be part of a group that had no influence (direct access to developers), not to mention I have no idea why I would have been contacted when my persona, on display in the forums, can be rather harsh/intolerant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a side note, I went ahead and used the support bot which is a nice feature. I also gave Skype a 1-star rating for this garbage. It used to be fine, but then the changes came over the past year (or 2?) and microsoft pissed it all away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me also say that the contact profile needs to contain the email address of the skype contact rather than the "live" id.</p>
<p>One person is my contact and was having issues with skype and used a different account and their live id for each account was "&lt;username&gt;" and "&lt;username&gt;_2". I don't know if the *_2 id corresponds to which email address they signed up with. I want to keep
 only ONE of their accounts and could only do that by having them log in with one account and chatting with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll restate it yet again, microsoft screwed up royally with this garbage and the forum and god knows what else.</p>

<p><span>Hello Nathan-Vindicator, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>As explained in the <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34785/why-can-anyone-contact-me-in-the-new-skype-on-desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<span>You only have the option to block or accept their messages. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Community Specialists&nbsp;are dedicated Skype users who share their knowledge and help others by replying to&nbsp;posts. They&nbsp;may or may not be&nbsp;employed with&nbsp;Microsoft.

<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Email&nbsp;addresses are classified as Personally Identifiable information (PII). Since Skype takes its customers' security and privacy a top priority, email addresses are&nbsp;not readily made available on accounts; unless the account owner makes

            <p>There does not appear to be a /RestoreHealth option in dism.exe - see below.</p>
<p>By the way - using snippingtool.exe would make your screen shots a lot more readable.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><em>Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool</em><br />
<em>Version: 6.1.7600.16385</em><br />
<br />

            Just for the record.Radialpoint is a pc security company.If you are with Bell it is installed with your security.But in my experience.It is not a great program for what it's supposed to do.

<p>Hi Teleph0ne,</p>
<p>Depending on the make and model of the laptop and projector, the types of outputs and inputs will vary. For example, some laptops have DVI and analog, while newer laptops may have HDMI. You will need a matching connection to plug into your laptop, or some
 kind of adapter to make the output of the laptop match up to the input on the projector.</p>
<p>First make sure the projector is looking at the right connection. Projectors (like TVs) have a number of different input options. You need to turn on the projector and select the connection the laptop is plugged in to using the input or source button on
 the remote or projector itself.<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows 7 taskbar thumbnail preview - not working correctly for Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> irongate  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 taskbar thumbnail preview - not working correctly for Word</h2>
                    Until last week, Aero Peek preview thumbnails for multiple Word documents worked fine.&nbsp; Now, if I open more than one document, the only preview available is the last document I opened.&nbsp; It's as if I closed the other documents which I haven't. The problem
 only happens on Word.&nbsp; (Multiple previews work fine for all my other Office applications.)&nbsp; I use W7 Home Premium.&nbsp; Any clues?

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>You may use the below provided steps and check –</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Open Microsoft word application and open the</span></strong><strong><span>Word</span></strong><span><strong><span>
 Options</span></strong><span> (click the Office "orb" and find Word Options at the bottom of that box).</span></span></li><li><strong><span>Now in the window that opens go to the</span></strong><strong><span>advanced</span></strong><strong><span>
 option and under the display section you may uncheck the box “show all windows in the taskbar” and click OK. Now check if the issue resolves.</span></strong></li></ol>

<h2>            Please show me a keyboard shortcut to open &#38; close Task Manager in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I would like to learn and assimilate more features for my computer.<br />
<br />
I note this information is not available on the first Task Manager Help Page one is shown.<br />
<br />
I am sure it is available elsewhere but I have short term memory problems and need to be better able to quickly locate information.<br />
<br />
Thank you if you can assist

            Thank you very much although I made the mistake of presuming that Alt +F4 uniquely closed the Task Manager whereas it (as I perhaps might have remembered) actually closes any open active programme that is currently being used.<br />
<br />
It was a useful and prompt response - I presume there is not such a unique way of closing Task Manager, so that one cannot accidentally close a different Open Programme?<br />
<br />
It would be even more Helpful if Microsoft - and other Software providers - actually visually &amp; prominently advised of such shortcuts as part of the actual Programme (Program - please excuse my English spelling)

            Alt+F4 is a universal key combination to close any application. There is no specific shortcut for the Task Manager. Alt+F4 has been around for a few decades and is widely published. The Google query "Windows keyboard shortcuts" will point you to many lists.<br />

            <p>Do microsoft intend to resolve this problem with cortana there are enough questions being asked to warrant something being done sooner rather than latter. Now I would discribe myself as a computer illiterate.</p>
<p>But it has to be said should win 10 have been released when it is clearly not fit for purpose. As it does not do what it states on the box.</p>
<p>I have also tried the 2 fixes suggested and neither. works for me either</p>

</p><p>On the next screen there are Language options - I discovered Speech had not been installed.</p>
<p>Installed the Speech add-in and I could then select the new Speech language.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/b6256480-56ab-4c47-8b7c-b0d5b124e3f3" title="Stephan12121212">
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most common reason why this happens is when you have multiple Skype accounts. Please check all of the accounts which you have created&nbsp;with Skype if there is any purchase showing on its purchase history.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, you may want to make sure any subscription has been cancelled at least three days&nbsp;before it renews because by default, all Skype subscriptions are set to automatically renew on the payment term you chose when you first ordered a subscription.
 Please refer to this link for the steps on how you can cancel automatically renewing subscription:

    <title>Asus computer stuck in reboot cycle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jocelynshoemake  say:</h3>
<h2>            Asus computer stuck in reboot cycle</h2>
                    hi my asus computer has been stuck in a reboot cycle for over a week now. I have tried every reboot, refresh, and advanced option available. Nothing seems to work. It takes about 1-5 hours for my computer to cycle back through when an option doesn't work.
 I noticed other posts saying to bring up the command prompt, but my computer won't even do that. I also don't have a back up disc to try and reboot it with. Any ideas on what I can try next?&nbsp;

            Thank you for your suggestions. I think I'm going to just give in and get a new computer. I'm not able to get a clean download of windows 8.1. I can't hold off any longer hoping that I can fix this. I also don't live close enough to a location where I
 can acces someone to help me. It's hard to give up, but I have been defeated.&nbsp;

<h2>            Error &#34;couldn&#39;t connect to Microsoft server. If problem persists please search for &#34;network problems&#34; on the Start page&#34;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Actual Title: Can't get the apps to work, and now I can't even log in. SMH</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can no longer sign into Windows 8 with my Microsoft account. This happened after I switched to "local account" in an attempt to trouble shoot a different problem (apps not working from the Modern UI which I still have not fixed yet). Now I can't switch
 back to the Live account either. This is ridiculous. I keep getting the message "couldn't connect to Microsoft server. If problem persists please search for "network problems" on the Start page." I didn't change my network setting, and I sure don't see a way
 to search for network problems from the start page.And as you can see by reading this, I can get online. I've tried uninstalling my AV/FW and am only running BitDefender. I've tried clean boots, both trouble shooters (account log in and UI app). I've uninstalled
 my photo editing SW. And I've tried the third party SW elimination fix. All to no avail. I am skeptical about Refreshing my computer because at this point I doubt that will work either. Plus I have too much software to lose like that. Any other solutions for
 both of these problems. So far not impressed. W8 makes Windows ME look good. <br />

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking for a driver of the sound card emi 62m. The only ones I can find are for apple or linux, but I need that runs on windows 7. The links in forums that I found always direct me to apple pages that don´t exist.

    <title>Skype screenshots location - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrick&#38;karina madden  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype screenshots location</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I made a Skype to Skype call. I was using my Mac's screenshot feature (CMD-Shift-3) just fine but then noticed that Skype has its own screenshot function (the "dotted box" button on the bottom of the Skype screen). So I began to use that sometimes,
 as it gives a split screen image (half me, half them). I figured this would save the pictures somewhere that I could access later. But when I finished the call, I could only find two of the pictures, both of which were sent as chat messages to the person I
 was calling. The rest are nowhere to be found. I've done some Googling and some searching on my hard drive, plus poking around the Skype app (on my MacBook Pro running 10.13.6), but no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are the other in-Skype screenshots available somewhere? Or was I supposed to click on something to save them? Are they gone forever?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help you can give.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Normally the screenshots should be saved on the Skype app Gallery. Just select the Gallery above the name of the Skype contact and it should show you the screenshots you have taken while you were on the video call. Let me know if that works.</p>

            Thank you for that advice. I can see the two pictures I mentioned (which somehow got sent in a chat to my interlocutor), but none of the others. I suspect that I was supposed to click on something in the moment the image was taken, and that I did so accidentally
 with the two saved pictures. None of the others appear in the "Gallery." Thanks, though.

<p>In most cases a pin number is not required. When I ported my number form another provider, in the past, they requested a number for the port. In my case the would not accept just the base number 555-555-5555, but the number with the country code&nbsp; 1-555-555-5555,
 allowed the port to go through. Everything was handled by the new provider after giving them that 10 digit number and my name and address.&nbsp; The only providers requiring actual pin numbers (those in France and Mexico) are covered in this Skype FAQ:</p>
