            Hi colinruffell 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Most likely you are using a different ID to login. You need to use your Skype ID not mail ID to login to Skype. Microsoft has been moving all to a single Microsoft Account based services including Skype. Hence, a new Skype ID seems to have been given to you on the basis of your Microsoft Account. So, when you use your mail ID to login, it gets into new Skype ID. Your Microsoft account, in this case, gets 2 Skype IDs attached - this new ID which is default now and your old Skype ID. 
<br />
<br />Just use your old Skype as user name.

            That is a Text encoding error on the website . . .
<br />
<br />This might be a workaround:
<br />Open Notepad (click your Start Button type notepad and hit enter
<br />
<br />Then copying the text from Word into a Notepad document and then copy from Notepad into the website

<h2>            Xbox 360 and Xbox one external storage.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p><span>- My old 360 stores only 20 GB and has been full for quite a while now so I bought a 2TB external hard drive for my 360 console as I was thinking this will be heaps to put all future free for gold games etc on in the one place instead of having several
 USB sticks, as I have now, and trying to revisit/find which game is on which stick but when I look at the 360 hard drive storage, after connecting and configuring on the 360, it shows only 29 GB free.
</span></p>
<p><span>Does anyone there know why? I hope you can help thanks.</span></p>
<p><span>Another question does anyone there know if you can store xbox one and xbox 3<span>60 games on the same USB 3 external hard drive?&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Sorry but the Xbox 360 is limited to up to two USB devices at a time at a max of 32GB of storage per device. &nbsp;You should consider purchasing an official Xbox 360 hard drive at a larger size for your games and downloads.</p>
<p>As for the storage device, you cannot store games from both systems on the same device. &nbsp;You can, however, use the 2TB drive (so long as it is USB 3.0 compatible) on your Xbox One for storage.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a microsoft surface laptop. When setting up I used the hello login face recognition as my primary login. Usually when that doesn't recognize my face I use my microsoft account password to login, but it also gives me the option to login with a pin
 (but i don't have a pin setup). Today when I tried to login in wouldn't recognize my face. Then it only gave me the option to sign in with a pin, which I don't have. I connected to wifi, but it didn't give&nbsp; the option to login with my Microsoft account password.
 I've tried restarting it and shutting it down, but keeps giving me the only login option of signing in with a pin, and it won't recognize my face anymore. I really need help, I'm pretty much locked out of my computer!</p>

<p>Hello Eva,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us help you sort the issue with Windows Hello facial recognition problem on your Surface Laptop.&nbsp;<span>The problem can occur if you wear glasses and did not set up the face recognition for whether you are wearing them
 or not. This could also occur if the device has moved and the lighting conditions are dramatically different in the new location. However, if none of the things stated applies to your situation, there are several steps we can provide for you to be able to
 get back into Surface Laptop.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The first thing we recommend that you try is to force a shutdown and restart your Surface Laptop by holding to the power button for at least 20 seconds. The Surface screen may turn off immediately, just keep holding
 down the button for the full 20 seconds before releasing it. After this, press release the power button again to turn it back on. IF the issue persist, proceed to the next step.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The second thing you can do is to start your Surface Laptop in safe mode. Here's how:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Restart your PC. When you get to the sign-in screen, hold the&nbsp;<span><strong>Shift</strong></span>&nbsp;key down while you select&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><strong>Power&nbsp;</strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fmsegceporticoprodassets.blob.core.windows.net%2fasset-blobs%2f11995_en-us_2" width="16" /></span><br />
&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span><strong>Restart</strong></span>.</span></li><li><span>After your PC restarts to the&nbsp;<span>Choose an option</span>&nbsp;screen, select&nbsp;<span><strong>Troubleshoot</strong></span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span><strong>Advanced options</strong></span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span><strong>Startup Settings</strong></span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span><strong>Restart</strong></span>.</span></li><li><span>After your PC restarts, you'll see a list of options. Select&nbsp;<span>4</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span>F4</span>&nbsp;to start your PC in&nbsp;<span>Safe Mode</span>. Or if you'll need to use the Internet, select&nbsp;<span>5</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span>F5</span>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<span><strong>Safe Mode</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;with&nbsp;</strong><span><strong>Networking</strong></span>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>At this point you can log in with your Microsoft account. However, if the network driver can't get out of airplane mode and you can't get it to connect to WiFi, your only options are either to hard wire the internet cable using a docking station / a USB
 to ethernet cable or enable the built-in Administrator account and restart the Surface in normal mode. To do this, open an elevated command prompt by typing "cmd" in the search box and right-click
<strong>Command Prompt</strong> under <em>Best matches</em> and choose <em>Run as administrator</em>. Inside the prompt, type "<strong><em>net user administrator /active:ye</em></strong><strong>s</strong>" You should see a message that the command completed
 successfully. Restart the Surface, and you'll now see the Administrator account as a choice and it doesn't require a password and WiFi is allowed in this account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: For your security, we highly recommend that you disable the built-in Administrator account once you're able to log in to your Microsoft account.&nbsp;To do this, open an elevated command prompt the same way you did earlier and inside the prompt, type "<strong><em>net
 user administrator /active:no</em></strong>" You should see a message that the command completed successfully then log out or restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run and download the <em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a></strong></em>. This toolkit comes
 in two versions, <strong>Windows 10 </strong>/ <strong>Windows 10 Pro </strong>and
<strong>Windows 10 in S mode</strong>. Choose which toolkit would apply to your Surface. To find out which version your device have, type "<em>winver"
</em>in the search box and hit <strong>Enter</strong>. </p>
<p>After the toolkit is finished, restart your device and try to sign in with the facial recognition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also recommend that you set a PIN for your Surface Laptop as an alternative for the facial recognition to avoid future inconvenience. There are also several reasons as to

            I Think that The network profile was set to Public instead of Private. Under Private, with FW enabled, you can enable the RDP service without any issue. But when the profile is set for Public and with FW enabled, the RDP service isn't allowed to start by default it seems. Unless manual configurations are done.

            Well, now we get the problem.
<br />I'm sad to tell you that I only have bad news. Unfortunately, you have a VOLUME license, that is for business use only. It is illegal to use VOLUME license for home use. In addiction, VOLUME license will expire, if not activated from a KMS server (that's a key generator and activator for business PC).
<br />I'm sorry, but the OEM license is a Home one, and that's the only one you have at the moment. The Pro license was installed by someone (probably your dealer) on your PC, but it expired, because you don't have the KMS.
<br />The only way for you to get a proper Windows 10 Pro license is to buy one at the Microsoft Store (the upgrade is 99$ usually on the Store) that's the safest way to obtain a valid product key for Windows 10.
<br />
<br />P.s: Please, if the answer solved your doubts click on Yes. Thanks.

<h2>            Gamerscore wird nicht korrekt angezeigt</h2>
                    
<p>Ich habe seit gestern ein ähnliches Problem. Mein Gamescore war bis zum Abend bei 93910G. Nachdem ich dann einen Erfolg mit 100G freigeschaltet hatte, zeigte mir meine XBox One nur noch 93490G an. Ich bin dann zu meiner XBox 360, hatte da an meinem Profil
 die 93910G und, nachdem ich mich eingeloggt und die XBox den Gamescore synchronisiert hatte, auch nur noch 93490G. Das gleiche hab ich noch an meiner zweiten XBox One in meinem Büro/Spielzimmer probiert mit dem selben Effekt. Auch SmartGlass und xbox.de zeigen
 93490G an, bzw. Inzwischen 93530 da ich danach noch einen Erfolg geholt habe. Warum verschwinden auf einmal 520G?</p>

<p>Hallo zusammen ich habe ein Problem mit meinem gamesscore und zwar werden mir die punkte nicht genau angezeigt.</p>
<p>Ich hatte bis gestern einen gameescore punktestand von 47031 habe dann fifa 15 auf meiner xbox one gezockt und dort 2 erfolge im wert von je 5 punkten erspielt. Dies müsste ja einen gesamt gamesscore von 47041 punkten ergeben.
</p>
<p>Nun kommen wir aber zu meinem Problem und zwar zeigt es mir auf beiden xbox Konsolen einen gs von 46920 an. Habe dann mein gamertag Profil auf meiner 360 gelöscht und neu heruntergeladen da ich mir dachte, dass mein gs im Profil somit aktualisiert wird.
 Das war aber leider nicht der Fall im Gegenteil mir wurden noch mehr Punkte abgezogen sodas mein gs nun auf 46511 punkten ist (Stand auf der Konsole). Der Stand auf der Xbox live Website beträgt immer noch 46920.</p>
<p>Die Erfolge welche ich bei Fifa 15 freigespielt habe wuren zum gs des spiels hinzugefügt jedoch nicht zu meinem gesamt gs. Ich habe auch keine gehackte Konsole oder gemodette ich habe die 10 gs auf ganz normale und faire weise erspielt.</p>
<p>Danke schon jetzt für eure Hilfe.</p>

<p>Genau wie bei mir. Hatte heute Abend auch einen GS von 93390 auf der One, also ebenfalls noch weniger. Nach einer halben Stunde war er wieder auf den 93530, aber meine 94050 wären mir lieber

<p>Das gleiche bei mir! Hatte sontag 31570 und hab jetzt beim skull sammeln in halo 120 gs gemacht. Müsste ich also 31690 haben. Blick nach links und man sieht 31675 also 15 zu wenig. Was ist da passiert und wie bekommen wir den richtigen score wieder.</p>

<p>Wie man sieht habt ihr euren score wieder. Nur ich nicht. Habt ihr irgendwas besonderes gemacht? Z.b. neue erfolge frei gespielt? Oder ging das wirklich von allein? Ich werde mal schauen ob sich der score normalisiert wenn ich einfach weiter punkte mache.
 Melde mich danach noch mal.</p>

<p>Also ich hab gestern die 10 gs gemacht und die One hat mir immer noch falsch angezeigt. Dann bin ich auf Xbox One SmartGlass und auch da wars falsch. Dann bin ich auf die Spiele App und da wars dann richtig, danach dann auch bei SmartGlass. Komisch ist aber
 das ich hier im Forum wieder einen gs von 31675 sehe. O.o auf Xbox.com steht der richtige von 31700. Ich bin mir nicht sicher ob das Thema schon durch ist.</p>

</p><p>I uploaded Windows 10 and have all kinds of changes to my normal applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uploaded Windows 10 and the only thing it lets me use is "Wordpad" to write documents. &nbsp; Wordpad is very limited. &nbsp;How do I make Microsoft Word my default document application like it was before Windows 10? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My canon printer now defaults to the "Windows Reviewer" and that screws up all my normal printing specifications (paper size, margins, etc.). &nbsp;How do I get my printer back to normal and stop getting dumped into the "Reviewer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very exasperating. &nbsp;Why does Microsoft do stuff like this? &nbsp; &nbsp;Do Microsoft people think this is a smart way to provide service to its customers? &nbsp;</p>

<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">The aspect ratio was fine until the VGA outlet in my PC stopped working, and moving it to the other VGA outlet seems to have reset the aspect ratio to 4:3.</span><br />

<p>Hi Rachel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the aspect ratio can be done from your graphics card control panel or from your monitor's own control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to your graphics card control panel by right-clicking on your computer screen and selecting the graphics settings (example: Intel Graphics Settings).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also contact the device manufacturer for assistance with changing the aspect ratio of your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the outcome so we can provide further assistance. </p>

    <title>Metro Exodus install problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rondor71  say:</h3>
<h2>            Metro Exodus install problem</h2>
                    <p>I tried to install Metro Exodus, and came across a bunch of problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First try ended in an error before the download even started. Error Code:&nbsp;0x80070005</p>
<p>
</p><p>After following some suggestions, it was possibly a missing patch that had to be applied. I had just updated to version 1903 and after checking for updates again, a few patches were installed. One was for the .NET framework.<br />
</p>
<p>Well, after a restart I was able to start the installation but at 100% it stopped with an error. Error Code: 0x80070780</p>
<p>I tried to follow the next suggestion, that it might be related to the C++ Redistributable 2015 that cannot be installed, because a newer version is already on the system and is blocking the installation.</p>
<p>I deleted the 2017 version and tried to install again, which did not work, I tried to install the version myself, but that did not help to get the installation to finish either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I thought maybe a system reboot will do the trick. But now the installation is gone. At least for the App. I have the feeling that the 50GB of data is still there. I wanted to delete the folder. I tried to search for it, but I could only find a junction,
 I cannot access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>06/15/2019&nbsp; 11:49 PM&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;JUNCTION&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DECK13.CrossCodePC_1.0.1.0_x86__rn1dn9jh54zft [...]<br />
06/15/2019&nbsp; 03:30 PM&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;JUNCTION&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;DeepSilver.ProjectWindfall_1.0.10.0_x64__hmv7qcest37me [...]<br />
</p>
<p>J:\WindowsApps&gt;cd DeepSilver.ProjectWindfall_1.0.10.0_x64__hmv7qcest37me<br />
The file cannot be accessed by the system.<br />
</p>
<p>I though it would be much easier to try a game that is a lot smaller first. So I installed CrossCode. The installation went through just fine in this case, but the game does not start, no error, nothing happens. Looks like I cannot get any game to work,
 that asks for Windows 10 version 18362.0 or higher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: FIles are stored in WindowsApps\MSIXVC</p>
<p>
</p><p>A23B7721-871B-4AD0-805D-C50F8EAA5363 is Metro</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find the Keys in the registry: \HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Store\ContentId&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT2: Well I was back to the good old 0x80070005 when I found the following&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/all/fix-for-game-pass-for-pc-admin-error-0x80070005/84dab93d-3297-43e8-ba6f-2eec05e63b31">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/all/fix-for-game-pass-for-pc-admin-error-0x80070005/84dab93d-3297-43e8-ba6f-2eec05e63b31</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It did not only fix the 0x80070005 error, but also let's me start games. Thought to share it here as well. Thanks go to Blocklad!</p>

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I have a Crystal Report that prints out of my ERP Software. It requires the use of an SAP Crystal Reports viewer (Runtime engine for .NET framework 32-bit). The report works fine in Windows 7 and 8 but not in 10. Report is supposed
 to print landscape but it prints portrait on 3 different machines to 3 different printers. All machines are Windows 10, ver 1709, build 16299.251.&nbsp; I suspect it has something to do with .NET version 4.7.1.&nbsp; Can I roll back to 4.7?&nbsp; I am using the most recent
 version of Vicinity Manufacturing so I cannot update any more there.</span></p>
<p>

<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;**First, Unplug Printer, and disconnect any possible wireless connections from other PC's or devices to the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall the software in control panel&gt;&gt;programs and features</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart PC. &gt;&gt;&gt;All of them</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** I would first go to OEM and put in model# of printer in Support or drivers and downloads and download the drivers and software&nbsp;for the latest OS they have them for. Probably 7 or 8. then follow instructions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your OS&nbsp;is 64bit, get 64bit download. If 32bit get 32bit download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You take the installer file or CD and &gt;&gt;&gt;"RIGHT CLICK" &nbsp;on the installer EXE file and select in menu &gt;&gt; troubleshoot compatibility.
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; I would download them and&nbsp;use those installers and not CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OR USE the Windows 10 drivers &gt;"if available"&lt; and do normal install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you select this ran on a previous version of windows.</p>
<p>Now what ever that software is for such as , 7 or 8, then select that OS as it ran on before. Install, follow printer install instructions and be sure to share printer for others in your home. Select save install settings in Wizard after install completes.</p>
<p>Restart PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Connect all PC's to printer and then reboot modem, unplug power 30 seconds, plug power in, when connected to internet again, restart all pc's one more time.</p>

            Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I did eliminate the idea of a printer issue by trying this on 4 different computers with 3 different printers all with the correct, up-to-date drivers.&nbsp; The printers all function fine with all of the other programs.&nbsp; The only
 thing that has changed on these computers is the Fall Creators Update was applied.&nbsp; As I mentioned before, the software functioned fine using .NET 4.7, not with .NET 4.7.1.

<p>Well there gas been known USB issues, Microsoft released 2 new updates in March 12th and 13th. Try installing those 2 and see what happens. If after updates and no success, I would disconnect the printers from PC's USB or wireless and uninstall, restart
 PC.s and re install the printer software and drivers for the version&nbsp;of windows that they were created for such as possibly windows 7 or 8 using Compatibility Mode during install for that windows version.</p>

<p>WIRED ????</p>

<p>
</p><p>And if you think it is the&nbsp; .NET 4.7.1. causing this, I am not too sure about that. It could be something other than that from the whole Creators Update. I would uninstall the printers and software on each PC., do a complete disk clean up and try re installing
 them fresh on each.</p>

</p><p>Other than that, I can not help you from here without being there myself to check things out.</p>

<h2>            Lenovo W530 --&#62; Random failures to boot after upgrading to Microsoft Windows &#91;Version 10.0.14393&#93;</h2>
                    <p>To: Microsoft Support Community</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Lenovo W530 laptop regularly fails to boot into Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.14393] with rotating spinning dots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to hard power off my laptop several times to get it to boot into Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think something in Windows does not like Intel Rapid Storage Technology RAID arrays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my laptop set up as a RAID1 Mirror.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have laptops older than this one that work without issues on Windows 10 Anniversary Update and this problem is making me extremely angry.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have contacted Intel and they have magically stopped support for Intel Rapid Storage technology when I contacted them about the bug and which is typical in the Wintel world, pass the buck to Lenovo.</li><li>I have contacted Lenovo support and performed troubleshooting steps that did not work.&nbsp; I contacted them again and they do not seem to care.</li><li><strong>Why is it that every time I upgrade a Windows machine things get broken that do not need fixing?&nbsp; Is Windows 10 Anniversary Edition some sick joke like Windows Millennium Edition or Windows Vista?&nbsp; Is anyone made accountable?<br />
</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help me I would be grateful because <em><strong>I have had enough of the buck passing.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here are the steps I was told to follow by Lenovo and they do not work:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You recently requested personal assistance from our on-line Support Centre. Below is a summary of your request and our response.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused, I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, do let us know if you made any changes to the system prior to the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try performing a startup repair using an installation media and check if it helps. Startup Repair is a Windows recovery tool that can fix certain system problems that might prevent Windows from starting. Startup Repair scans your computer
 for the problem and then tries to fix it so your computer can start correctly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps given below:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On a working PC, go to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=616447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>
<p>Download the media creation tool and then run it. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Select <span>Create installation media for another PC</span>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Choose a language, edition, and architecture (64-bit or 32-bit). </p>
</li><li>
<p>Follow the steps to create installation media, and then select <span>Finish</span>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Connect the installation media you created to your nonfunctional PC, and then turn it on.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the initial setup screen, enter your language and other preferences, and then select
<span>Next</span>. If you're not seeing the setup screen, your PC might not be set up to boot from a drive. Check your PC manufacturer's website for info on how to change your PC's boot order, and then try again.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select <span>Repair your computer</span>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <span>Choose an option</span> screen, select <span>Troubleshoot &gt;</span><span>Advanced options</span> &gt;<span>Startup repair</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know the result, we will be glad to help if you need further assistance.</span></p>

            <p>Not sure, I've not noticed this code myself, but some people who have seemed to think turning 'Data Sense' off (particularly the "Restrict background data usage" option) sometimes helps -

    <title>Cannot create a new administrator user account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot create a new administrator user account</h2>
                    Hi, I have a bit of a&nbsp;dilemma. I have a laptop that has Microsoft&nbsp;Vista and I wanted to create a new administrator account, but i don't have a access to the old&nbsp;administrator account. I know you cannot help me with&nbsp;retrieving lost password for the old
 account, but is there a way to still create a new administrator account without having restore my computer? &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Hi Chuckter,</p>
<p>Without an existing adminstrator account, you will not be able to create another one.<br />
<br />
There is 3rd party software that claims to be able to reset the password on administrator accounts or create a new account from a boot cd.&nbsp; Looking in your favorite search engine for "vista forgot password" should yeild interesting results.&nbsp; Please scan any
 tools you may download for virus infections.<br />
<br />
Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be
 solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk..<br />
