<h2>            Printer problem not printing number of copies indicated</h2>
                    I have been using an HP LaserJet 1160 for 4 years with no problems to speak of. I had a computer crash of my last XP computer system and bought this new Vista system 3 months ago. Ever since installing my printer on this new Vista system no matter how
 many copies i choose to print from a printing window it will only give me 1 copy.&nbsp; Very simple problem you would think. I have had my Lightspeed System Support team remotely access my computer and they have checked the drivers and tested the problem. When
 i go to print something, i enter number of copies i want and then hit print. I can put in 5 copies and it will only give me 1. Doesn't matter how many copies i ask for it will only give me one. Does anyone know how to fix this seemingly simple problem? I've
 reinstalled the printer. I've reinstalled the drivers. I've gone from Vista Home Premium to Vista Ultimate, still have this problem.

                    <p>Frustrated by my SB2 failing to detect my external display connected to USB-C to DP (display port) cable.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(60, 60, 60, 1)">This is a recently purchased Philips 27" curved
</span>display<span style="color: rgba(60, 60, 60, 1)">, model&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(60, 60, 60, 1)">278E8QJAB.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(60, 60, 60, 1)">First time I tried it consistently
 refused to detect the display, so then tried a different display and eventually after running some Windows updates that display worked. Then back to the first, and it worked too - so I thought everything was fine. Then, when connecting the display again a
 couple of weeks later - same problem! And now it totally refuses to detect the display.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(60, 60, 60, 1)">The frustrating part here is that
 it *did* work - and now doesn't. Device Manager shows an unrecognized USB-device (under Universal Serial BUS controllers) plus under USB devices it shows something called "USB 2.0 Billboard".</span></p>
<p>I have tried various troubleshooting,
 such as right clicking "generic usb hub" and updating driver, uninstalling the device flagged with an error, etc. to no avail.</p>

<p>Thanks for responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started to suspect that the cable could be the problem and went back to the dealer and asked for a replacement. The replacement seems to work fine, both video and sound coming through OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to keep all bases covered I also bought a USB-C -&gt; HDMI adapter. This also works fine, sort of: video output is good, but no sound - even though PC says sound is routed to the monitor. Tried this with two different monitors, an LG in the shop and my
 own Philips.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update</strong>: as I'm writing this, I had HDMI connected, and changed sound output to PC, and then back to display - and suddenly sound started working! Strange ...</p>

    <title>Quickly Losing Patience - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> audiopro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Quickly Losing Patience</h2>
                    <p>I am quickly losing patience with Windows 8 and I haven't even&nbsp;had it for 24 hours yet. Getting used to a new interface always takes time but the biggest and most serious issue is with it's email capabilities. I have a large number of email addresses which
 are linked to 4 domains and up to now have been administered without problems using Outlook Express. It seems that, while I have been enjoying a trouble free computer life creating complex web apps on a machine running XP, the 'experts' at MS have been developing
 the most ridiculous GUI it is possible to imagine. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make matters worse, it seems that the so called experts at MS have decided that nobody uses POP3 emails any more as they think everyone&nbsp;now uses portable IMAP ready devices. That is all very well for the hordes of Twittering Facebook freaks who only have
 a couple of Hotmail email addresses&nbsp;but for those of us who use computers for more than Tweeting and finding out what our 20,000 friends had for dinner, this oversight is causing us real headaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of&nbsp;dismissing this as a rant from an out of touch Luddite, please tell me that I am wrong and point me in the direction of a workable solution to my problem.</p>

            <p>Having spent a few days setting up 2 new WIN 8&nbsp; computers I know a lot more about the whole thing than I did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Windows Live Mail up and running but how do I make it run on start up. In the Iron Age,&nbsp;when technology was simple, you dragged an icon into the start menu. The modern way is to open the command window, run some sort of app and enter more parameters
 than you can shake a stick at. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an operating system, yes Windows 8 works and up to now I have not seen any sign of the blue 'screen of death'. I do have some major gripes about the whole thing though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The apps supplied and viewable on the Mickey Mouse Metro Screen are not apps at all, they are links to commercial websites cunningly disguised as catalogue pages by removing the menu and status bars. I fail to see a use for the Metro screen on a desktop
 machine but the whole thing seems to be aimed at the mind numbing operations the technogeeks carry out on their phones while avoiding doing work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Networking seems to be a bit of a hit and miss affair, I have 1 x Vista, 1 x WIN8 and 2 x XP machines and they find and drop connections for fun between the WIN8 machine and the others. The others are in fairly constant use and are as stable as a - well
 a stable thing. It really is annoying and just proves to me that technology has not moved along as far as the technophobes would have us believe. We might have very high speed programs available in millions of colours but many of them are simply not intuitive.&nbsp;
 A picture may well replace a thousand words but on a computer screen menu,&nbsp;a list of words is&nbsp;far easier to work with than their pictorial equivalents.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure I will find much more to grumble about before I have finished setting my new machines up but for now I have enough to get on my nerves.</p>

            <p>Just when I thought it could not get any worse - I went in search of some object games for my daughter. I went to this site
<a href="http://www.widows8downloads.com/win8-hidden-object-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.widows8downloads.com/win8-hidden-object-game</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .html and have managed to get a virus - web cake 3.0, or something like that.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not a happy bunny, as you can imagine, but I am not sure who I am most disappointed in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>McAffe for warning me about it but still letting it through., the tossers at windows8downloads for sending it or the designers of WIN8 for allowing the situation to occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can bet your bottom dollar that&nbsp;there ain't an app to fix this, that would be too useful.</p>

<p>You can bet your bottom dollar that&nbsp;there ain't an app to fix this, that would be too useful.</p>
</blockquote>
It would say yourself for ignoring the warning of McAfee. After all, you're the one who clicked yes to the install.
<br />
<br />
And there is someting you can do. Try a Refresh of the computer, which will remove all Desktop apps and a lot of viruses, but keeping your personal files intact.

            McAfee already dumped.
<div>I have a multi machine subscription with F Secure so I am using that on all my boxes.</div>
<div>I am back using my XP box at the moment as I need to get some work done rather than dedicate my time to faffing around with naff software.</div>
<div>I think the accolade of worst software ever has to be levelled at some of the apps which come bundled with Windows 8. Netflix, Ebay and LoveFilm are not even programs but simple web links which take ages to load. The Photo and Video apps are worse than
 ones we used to use 20 years ago.</div>

I have been working on another box (XP) for past few days but today I decided to delve further into the workings on Windows 8. On start up, I was met by a screen telling me that Windows was updating. This update went on for some 15 minutes and then all **** broke loose. My Homegroup has been reset and file sharing turned off, so no access to either the network or internet until I  reconfigured it.  



What moron thought that once I had configured my computer, I would want to spend time setting it all up again the next time I used it. Very strange that the updates got downloaded before the box went mammaries up. 



This is like internet streaming, have you noticed how the adverts never freeze or glitch?

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that it is highly recommended that you download the Skype app through the Google Play Store. This is to ensure that every updates are downloaded directly to your app. There is an alternative in which you may download an APK file
 for Skype by searching through the internet or by Bing. However, we cannot ensure that the downloads made through any other methods are safe or doesn't have any malwares connected to it. A workaround would be trying out to connect to a VPN just to download
 the Skype app through&nbsp;this link:&nbsp; </p>

<p>
</p><p>and disconnect&nbsp;from the&nbsp;VPN&nbsp;immediately once you have installed the app&nbsp;on your device.

<span>I would suggest trying a Cleanboot to see if the problem happens. If it doesn't happen when you are in a cleanboot then you can use the steps in the article to narrow down the cause of the problem,

<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Step 1: Perform a clean boot<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Note</span><span> If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following
 these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.
</span></li></ul>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.
</span></li><li>
<span>Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start
<br />
, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.<br />

If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.

<br />
Note Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this
 if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.

<h2>            Is there any way at all to get LifeCam Studio 5000 to work with Windows 10 or not&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new Microsoft LifeCam 5000. It says ON THE BACK OF THE BOX that it works with Windows 10. There is absolutely no way to get it to do this. There are no drivers anywhere for Windows 10. I spent hours searching, on the phone with Microsoft,
 transferred to literally 10 different people, hung up on, etc. The one piece of information I could find said that someone had gotten the Lifecam to work by downloading the drivers for Windows 7. I tried that, and it didn't even allow the download. Is there
 any way to get this thing to work with Windows 10, AS THE PRINT ON THE BACK OF THE BOX SAYS IT SHOULD, or not? Can someone please, PLEASE answer this one simple question???</p>
<p>
</p><p>And in case anybody thinks I'm kidding about the box literally saying in print that it's compatible with Windows 10...

            I really have my doubts about this but I may try it. This is a Microsoft product and should simply work with Windows 10 when it LITERALLY SAYS on the box that it does. ETA: I don't see how to install this. There is no exe file. I'm just returning this
 webcam. Microsoft should be ashamed of itself and this terrible product design WILL catch up with it one day.

<p>It shows USB 2.0. So I would use a 2.0 Port.</p>

            <p>1. If you are unable to install Windows Updates, first clear up your&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/temporary-files-folder-location-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Temporary Files">Temporary Files</a>&nbsp;and Internet Cache, reboot
 and try again. See if this helps resolve the issue. Best and easy to use the built-in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/disk-cleanup-utility-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="disk cleanup utility">Disk Cleanup utility&nbsp;</a>or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/remove-pc-junk-clear-disk-space-with-ccleaner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="ccleaner download">CCleaner</a>.</p>
<p>2. Disable your Firewall and Anti-virus software and try again.</p>
<p>3. As mentioned earlier, many a times, an update may fail to install in the first instance, but for some inexplicable reason, succeeds in the 2nd or 3rd try. So try a couple of times.</p>
<p>4. Search on&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft</a>, for the patch using the Update KB number, and download its stand-alone installer. Now apply the patch manually. Search for just the number; don’t include
 KB ! Also, go here to see the&nbsp;<a href="http://forum.thewindowsclub.com/windows-tips-tutorials-articles/33185-complete-master-list-windows-update-error-codes.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="windows update error codes">Complete Master List of Windows Update
 Error Codes</a>.</p>
<p>5. Use the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-update-troubleshooter-from-microsoft-fixes-windows-updates-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Windows Update Troubleshooter">Windows Update Troubleshooter&nbsp;</a>from Microsoft. It&nbsp;resets&nbsp;Windows
 Updates settings to defaults.</p>
<p>6. Use our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/repair-fix-windows-updates-with-fix-wu-utility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="fix windows updates tool">Fix WU</a><span>&nbsp;tool and see if it helps. It re-registers all the&nbsp;<span>dll</span><span>,&nbsp;<span>ocx</span>&nbsp;and
 ax files required for the proper functioning of Windows Updates.</span></span></p>
<p>7. Run&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/checksur-system-update-readiness-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="System Update Readiness Tool">System Update Readiness Tool</a>. It can help fix problems that might prevent Windows Updates and
 Service Packs from installing.</p>
<p>8. Right-click Computer &gt; Manage &gt; Services &gt; Stop the “Cryptographic Service” and rename the “Catroot2″ folder situated in&nbsp;C:\Windows\System32\Catroot to something else like say Catroot2X.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.winvistaclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/cryptographic-services.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.winvistaclub.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2009%2f03%2fcryptographic-services.png" height="306" width="600" /></a></p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>Now run the update or the installers again. This action will re-generate a new Catroot2&nbsp;folder and the updates or hotfixes, should hopefully install.</p>
<p>9. If still you have a problem then, go to&nbsp;<em>C:\Windows\WindowsUpdate.log</em><span>&nbsp;and look for the most recent entry. This will be present towards the end of the log. Any failed updates will have error&nbsp;<span>code/s</span><span>&nbsp;written
 next to them. Note them down. If you find just too many entries too confusing delete this WindowsUpdate.log and try&nbsp;<span>installing</span>&nbsp;the problematic updates again</span></span></p>
<p>w open the newly re-created WindowsUpdate log file and have a look at its contents.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.winvistaclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Windows-update.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.winvistaclub.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2009%2f03%2fWindows-update.png" height="341" width="600" /></a></p>
<p>The warnings will probably appear as -:&nbsp;<strong>WARNING: Failed to find updates with error code XXXXXXXX.</strong></p>
<p>Now Right-click Computer &gt; Manage &gt; Event Viewer &gt; Applications and Service Logs &gt; Microsoft &gt; Windows &gt; WindowsUpdateClient &gt; Operational . Check out for any Critical Message or Warning.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.winvistaclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/computer-management.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.winvistaclub.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2009%2f03%2fcomputer-management.png" height="429" width="598" /></a></p>
<p>Next refer the&nbsp;<a href="http://inetexplorer.mvps.org/archive/wuc.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update Error Codes</a>&nbsp;. This will give you the direction in which you may have to look for the solution.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp;<strong>Flush the Software Distribution Folder</strong>. Run Command Prompt as administrator. In the CMD box that appears on the computer screen, enter the following strings of text, one at a time, and hit Enter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span>net stop&nbsp;<span>wuauserv</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>net stop bits</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now browse to the<strong>&nbsp;C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution&nbsp;</strong>folder and delete all the files and folders inside.</p>
<p>If the files are in use, restart your device. After rebooting, run the commands above again. Your Windows Store App needs to be closed by the way, so do not start it.</p>
<p>Now you will be able to delete the files from the mentioned&nbsp;<strong>Software Distribution&nbsp;</strong>folder. Now in the Command Prompt windows, type the following commands one at a time, and hit Enter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span>net start&nbsp;<span>wuauserv</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong>net start bits</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reboot. If you are using Windows Update try using Microsoft Updates&nbsp;or vice versa.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade Ended Up with Error code&#58; 0xc000000f</h2>
                    <p>I was trying to upgrade my Samsung Ativ 9 laptop from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. I got a blue screen with white writing that says:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>My computer does not have a CD or DVD drive and did not come with a disk. It does have a partition on the hard drive with recovery information. I cannot access the hard drive. I have tried creating a Windows 8 (it may have been 8.1) USB recovery stick and
 that did not help at all. I tried creating a Windows 10 USB recovery stick. That did nothing to help either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have very limited options at this point. I tried to reset Windows and that got me nowhere. I tried to repair Windows and that did nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried F9 to start with a different operating system and I get the message "Diagnosing System" followed by "Attempting repairs" but then it says, "Automatic Repair couldn't fix your PC". From there I have tried all the options but one and I cannot get out
 of the blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one thing I have not pursued is to go to "Troubleshoot", "Advanced options", "Command Prompt". I can get the command prompt, but I have no idea what to do when I get there.</p>

            <p>Going through the 10 setup fails.</p>
<p>1. I downloaded my Windows 10 recovery file from&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10. The hash value appears to be 92cb749ac277fb60c889f9907c203. I cannot seem to find an expected hash value on the windows download page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. There was nothing connected to my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I currently cannot get to the anti-virus. I can get to the BIOS and I can get to a DOS prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I cannot physically get to the RAM on the Samsung Ative 9. It has 4G of RAM and is not upgradeable. The computer worked great before the attempted upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. The computer only has 1 SS hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. I am pretty sure I had enough disk space. I keep the laptop cleaned off as I only use it when I am in the field. Also I move files from the laptop to my NAS when I get back to the office for data preservation reasons. The hard drive on the PC should have
 had at least 100G free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. The install never got this far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Too late for this now. I do not have access any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. The only other partition I am aware of on the hard drive was for the Windows 8 recovery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10. I have a Samsung Ativ9 laptop. It has the Intel Core i7 processor, 4G RAM, and a 256G SSD. Not sure about the Graphics card, but it seemed pretty high end for a laptop. Again, I cannot currently access that information on the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in to this for about 6 hours so far and my high end laptop is now a paperweight. I run a small business and this is the sort of thing that can destroy a small business. If my time is worth anything, it would be cheaper to just go buy a new laptop. That,
 however, seems a high price to pay for trying to do perform a Microsoft sanctioned "free upgrade". This has been anything but free.&nbsp;</p>

            I have two Samsung Laptops, np900x4d and np q330js04 and experienced the same problem With the Upgrade to Windows 10 pro. Presently I am unable to reinstall Windows 8.1 pro on either one of them. I have tried every possible solution including sending them
 to a repair shop for no avail. I Guess they are trash now. I have noticed that the problem 0xc000000f is frequently posted in different fora, the response from Microsoft so far has been some irrelevant mumbo-jumbo that has not helped a lot.

<p>
</p><p>Also tried recovery file from usb drive, additional options available but still none would complete successfully. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could get to dos prompt but windows recovery folder blank, tried fix boot and similar dos commands. &nbsp;No luck. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under warranty from asus so us so sent it back to them. &nbsp;I am hoping they will just put a new SSD drive in and do a re install of win 8.1 or a fresh win10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, stupid of me not to create my own recovery image file. &nbsp;Shame on MS though for an apparently crappy upgrade process. &nbsp; This error is an epic fail. &nbsp;</p>

            This is an indeed challenge. In the end, i needed my laptop for m business and took it to an IT person I know. It cost me $200, but he got it working again. It was basically back to original state when I bought it, but at lest it worked again. I hesitate
 to post what he did to fix it here, because it cost me $200 and my computer is still running Windows 8. If Microsoft were willing to reimburse me for the $200 in the absence of providing a solution and update my PC to W10, I would be happy to share what I
 know about the solution. I think it is right for Microsoft to expect me to pay to solve their issues. They have basically created a monopoly and now they think they can do whatever they want.&nbsp;

            <p>I updated my Windows to Windows 10. Worked okay, but then it downloaded some new updates and prompted me to restart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I faced the same error msg, and had to do a recovery to default using the disk provided by my laptop manufacturer. I lost my files and data. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get it that software updates often come with bugs and errors, but something this major is unacceptable! More robust tests on your updates should be carried out before pushing them out to consumers without given them a choice. As if there aren't enough
 agonies in this world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I did NOT perform this reset of Windows Update components because of the apparent complexity of the registry changes but I had planned on doing it eventually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lo &amp; Behold, yesterday (6/19) a popup informed me that a large update had been downloaded and a restart was needed. I complied and upon successful completion, I was judged to be "Up to Date". This is the desired resolution to my original problem. If I had
 known this was going to happen, I would not been as concerned about this hang.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being on a metered connection (HughesNet dish), I am very sensitive about my bandwidth usage. When Microsoft moved from asking permission for downloading updates to doing it automatically I feel like they don't respect my circumstances and situations as
 a Microsoft customer. Why do we have this "Big Brother" attitude in a 21st Century community??</p>

            After 10 days I tried manual updates again. It hung as before at 4% downloaded. I don't know if it can tell that updates are available or if they are even allowed during active hours. Who knows?? Since I can't control automatic updates and I can't get
 updates on demand , then I have no control over updates in W10 and I will stop being concerned about them. I'm not a power user nor does my business depend on Windows for its efficiency. I'm only trying to be proactive about my own security. The answer is
 that my problem is not solved and I will stop trying to resolve it.

<p>Are you referring to sound controls?</p>

<h2>            You do not have permission to access this folder</h2>
                    <p>I have recently installed Ubandu 18.10 on a rack server, and have a 400Gb+ntfs partion which I have files on, and shared that folder using samba.&nbsp; (I have even included a guest share in the samba setting).</p>
<p>
</p><p>On both of my windows 10 machines (desktop and laptop), I can see the machine and the folder I am sharing under networking.&nbsp; But once I try and click on the shared folder, I get the message that "You do not have permission to access this folder".&nbsp; &nbsp;I have
 tried going in to the properties and changing the security setting to include "everyone", but it wont let me apply the changed security settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the odd time, I get a login screen, which I have tried entering the username and password for the linux login, but it doesn't accept it.&nbsp; my login for both of my windows machines is a 4 digit code, and this is option is not displayed on the login screen.&nbsp;
 I feel that I am going around in circles, and getting no where.</p>

<h2>            xbox one elite controller error code 10.</h2>
                    
<p>I just got the new elite controller and wanted to start playing but I can't use it on my PC. When I connect it with the cable the controller vibrates and when I press the xbox button the light turns on. When I check the device manager, it tells me the device
 can't start (code 10), the energy status of the device doesnt allow that operation. I've tried switching USB ports,&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'd like to see my steam games in the windows app. It'd be really cool if there was some integration within the app for steam or in steam for the xbox app. As it is, I can't put any steam games into the xbox app and use it as my one source for launching
 games.</p>

<p>As long as the Steam game has a shortcut on your PC, you can add it to your Xbox app by clicking ''+ Add a game from your PC" in the top right corner of your games list.</p>
<p>Of course it's not ideal, as it will then launch Steam in order to launch the game - but if all you want is your games listed together in one place, that will do the trick :)</p>
<p>It's very unlikely that Valve will ever allow another application take over the launching of Steam-purchased games, so Steam will always be the middle-man in this situation.</p>

            <p>Hi Wilmot,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can sync items to a device automatically or manually. When you connect a device to your PC for the first time, Windows Media Player selects the sync method&nbsp; that works best for your device, depending on its storage capacity and the size of your Player
 Library. I would suggest you to refer to the following Microsoft Help article and check if it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/set-up-device-sync-media-player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/set-up-device-sync-media-player</a></p>
<p>This Microsoft Help article will help you sync your devices with Windows Media Player.

<p>You can do it manually and the Widows Phone does it automatically: music, and photos and podcasts?</p>
<p>Even though the PC Windows Media Player does not recognise the podcasts as being 'media on the PC?</p>
<p>Hence the part about a version of the Windows Media Player that recognises podcasts as 'other media'?</p>
<p>Or settings one can adjust to enable the Windows Media Player to reognise podcasts on the PC as such?</p>
<p>Downloadable podcasts from BBC Radio currently exist in Zune, My Yahoo and iTunes, not Windows yet?</p>

<p>In regard syncing 'media': photos, music and podcasts from a Widows 8 PC to a Windows 8 phone?</p>
<p>I can do that by way of a Windowsphone app, and a version of Windows phone app for desktop I have?</p>
<p>I can also do it manually, transfer 'media' folders from the Windows 8 PC to the Windows 8 phone?</p>
<p>After I have done so and disconnect the Windows 8 phone from the Windows PC, reconnect it via USB?</p>
<p>The Windows Media Player recognises the 'media' on the Windows 8 phone, including 'podcasts'?</p>
<p>The thing is, I transferred the 'podcast' from the Windows 8 PC to the W8 phone, along with other media.</p>
<p>Windows Media Player did not recognise the 'podcasts' on the PC, it did on the phone?</p>
<p>That is a 'problem' that can be dealt with later, the current 'sync' problem concerns 'streaming'?</p>
<p>It is 'do able',to 'stream' subscribed audio podcasts to a Window 7/8 PC / Windows Phone via Zune?</p>
<p>With Windows 8 PC/ Windows Phone, one can not yet do so</p>
<p>Zune is one of three 'popular' media routes to do so, the other two being iTunes and, My Yahoo?</p>
<p>These three are on the BBC Radio Podcasts 'Help' page, Windows 8 PC/Phone is not yet listed on it?</p>
<p>Zune could have come up with a W8 version that could do such, till a specific W8 product could do it?</p>

            <p>My earlier reply e mail mentioned a 'problem' with Windows Media Player and Podcasts?</p>
<p>Windows Media Player recognised 'podcasts' on a Windows 8 phone, but not on a Windows 8 PC,</p>
<p>The 'podcasts' originated from the Windows 8 PC,: transferred via USB, to the phone, from the PC?</p>
<p>Some Windows Media Player Settings adjustment, re where it got its media info on the PC from?</p>
<p>Enabled it to recognise the 'podcasts' that were on the PC, and those on other devices: simple.</p>

            Hello Cowpatch,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your post. &nbsp;To clarify, is your computer not recognizing the CD or is it now allowing the installation? &nbsp;Are you able to use other CD's on your computer or is this the only one that you're having problems with? &nbsp;It's possible that the CD
 has become damaged or scratched. &nbsp;You can verify the CD's quality is good by testing it on another computer. &nbsp;Please let us know, we look forward to hearing back from you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Cheers</div>

    <title>Windows could not find backup devices on this computer. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j_reins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows could not find backup devices on this computer.</h2>
                    <p>Due to a failure of a SSD cache that corrupted my&nbsp;boot drive, I was forced to perform a clean restore of windows 8 pro/64. I have a backup on an attached drive (backup scheduled nightly, with an image bi-weekly), but when I double click the&nbsp;backup file&nbsp;I
 get the message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows could not find backup devices on this computer. The following information may explain why this problem occurred:</p>
<p>The parameter is incorrect. (0x80070057)</p>
<p>Close Windows Backup and try again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I re-installed W8 I disconnected the SSD cache. I have since read that if the drive configuration changed restore may not work. So I re-installed the SSD as a drive, reformatted it, and gave it a drive letter. No change.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>

            <div>A system image should not be scheduled bi weekly. In fact it should not be scheduled at all. You only make new image when you make major changes to a system that is running perfectly. The image is overwritten each time you use it, which makes it useless
 when you need it. The last image will have the corrupted version of your system. The image is used to replace a corrupted file with the clean image so should not be overwritten regularly. Then you use the backups to add more recent items. The System Image
 is accessed by using PC Settings, General, Advanced. But since you have reinstalled and reformatted the drive, this might not be available. You also do a clean install there, but the files that the installation uses might be gone after reformatting.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Thanks Mary. I understand your point about the system image file not needing regular update, and I will modify my backup routine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, I wasn't really trying to perform an image restore... just a file retrieval. And I think the latest image was pre-corruption (not positive, though...).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question: IF the image was corrupted, is a file retrieval from the backup data set not possible? I still see the GlobalCatalog.wbcat file, and all the zip files within the backup sets are still there.</p>

            <p>Hello Pedro,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that the Map App in Windows 10 is not working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the below suggested methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to run the Windows in built troubleshooter: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>in the search box and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>
tab<strong>. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>view all</strong> option on the upper left corner.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Store apps&nbsp;</strong>option from the list.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Next to run the<strong> </strong>Troubleshooter.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, also refer to the below link to deploy the <span><span><strong>Troubleshooter for Windows 10 apps</strong></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If the cache (locally downloaded and stored files) is empty, as in first use, or corrupted, Maps may not display the streets and roads correctly.</li><li>If new (empty cache), it may take a minute or more for a download to fetch the map data.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, if the cache is corrupted, you may get gaps in the display or Aerial maps not displaying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; Offline Maps to select your region, download the maps, set update options and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, you may also refer to the below Microsoft Link which discusses on
</span>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-win_maps/windows-10-maps-app-sometimes-does-not-show-the/7183916a-9567-4d49-ab92-297eec8737ab">Windows 10 Maps App sometimes does not show the streets or roads on the Map
</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong></p>
If the above still does not help,&nbsp;I suggest you&nbsp;to follow the below steps&nbsp;which will help you to uninstall the native&nbsp;Map App in Windows 10.
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key</strong> and type<strong> Powershell
</strong>in search, right click on it and Open as administrator<strong>.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Type the following command in Powershell and hit enter:<br />
<br />
</span><span><strong>get-appxpackage *Microsoft.WindowsMaps* | remove-appxpackage
</strong></span></p>
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You can reinstall the app in future, if you want to, from the below link:</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9WZDNCRDTBVB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><strong>Windows Maps</strong>

            <p>I have managed to make my maps app show the roads by changing the graphics adapter to the standard version, I also have a Surface Pro 4 with the Intel HD graphics 520. It is easy to change the adapter type by going into Device Manager click on Display Adapter
 then double click the Intel HD 520 and this will bring up the properties page where you then click on Driver at the top and then click on update driver. You then have a choice, click the lower one that browses your computer for an update. This brings up a
 new input box, click the lower one that says,&nbsp;let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer. This will bring up a list of several drivers for the 520 since the original launch of the surface, mine shows the latest as 20th November 2015 which is
 my current driver. below these versions there is a driver called the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter, if I change to this the roads appear on my Maps App, if you decide to try this you may find that it affects other apps but I did not notice this, the only
 thing I noticed is that my Pen would no longer work when I tried to use it but that was about it. I have changed back and forward several times without any problems so if the roads are important then this may help you. As usual best to back up any important
 stuff before experimenting.</p>
