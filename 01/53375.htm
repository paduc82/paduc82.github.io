                    <p>I have recorded from my digital radio to an SD card and used to be able to play on Windows Media.&nbsp; I have previously been able to play, &nbsp;but now cannot play.&nbsp; The files are .aac.&nbsp; A window comes up with the following -</p>

            That is correct. If it installed correctly it simply opens up a WMP plug in when you open a file.
<div><br />
<div>You'll need to do one of the following :</div>
<div><br />
<div>- open up an individual file in WMP file &gt; Open then navigate to your SD card and select the file</div>
<div><br />
<div>- go into Windows Explorer (right click n my computer then select Open) and your SD card should shownup as a memory storage device. Navigate to it and double click on one of the files, which should then open WMP.</div>

            <p>This is useless, sloppy advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First... it is a CD/DVD Drive we are trying to fix, not a network adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, Method 2 doesn't display the menus etc in the order you set out ... so I'm unsure whether it has worked properly</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly ... going to the manufacturer doesn't help, when it is a mass-produced drive that worked perfectly well under Win 7 and is still quite plainly there in the BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to do much better than this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get it sorted.</p>

            To clarify. 10 recognizes the player, all looks good in Device Mgr. It does not recognize any media in file explorer, known CD's DVD's that worked before. The icon for the DVD RW Drive (D:) shows up in File Explorer but does not recognize any media. clicking
 on the DVD icon pops open the DVD tray and a pop up widow opens that says insert DVD this was already with trying several DVD's or CD's. The "player" is recognized but the media or software&nbsp;is not.

                    <p>All of the network adapter type titled,&nbsp;Wan Miniport, as indicated in the title field of this message, drivers could not be updated when attempted via online. The identical error message read, ' File could not be found ' in the copy of Windows 7, x64 on
 my recently purchased laptop. Initially, I went to the dealer. The dealer could only advise me to go to the manufacturer of these adapters (Microsoft) and pose my question there. Please advise me of this situation. I want to go wireless but my router can not
 be installed. Perhaps the reason why has been stated here? Thank you. DKY</p>

            You need to install the correct WLAN drivers for the wireless adapter.&nbsp; You should find the wireless adapter driver directly off the laptop's manufacturer's tech support web site.&nbsp; Once you install / re-install the drivers, the other drivers should then
 install be themselves.<br />

<h2>            Tech issues&#58; Xbox One bandwidth usage page showing I&#39;ve used 1.5 million TB last month...</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
So the past 3 months I've gone over my 1 TB data allowance with Comcast, and I've been going through all of my devices to figure out why, since historically my monthly usage average was ~600 GB.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Well I went into my Xbox One settings and went to the Bandwidth Usage screen.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
For the month of August, it says I used "11,409.15 TB" of bandwidth and then in September it says I used&nbsp;<span>"1,551,860.35 TB"</span>&nbsp;of data. Obviously this is incorrect as that amount of data is ridiculous,
 but regardless, the spikes in my usage history on the Xbox itself coincide with the spikes I'm seeing with Comcast.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
My Xbox was averaging around 125 GB per month up until August. Would anyone know why this could be happening or what else I can do to figure out what's going on?</p>

<p>Hello JF!</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing this issue to our forums. I understand that you're having unusual readings regarding your data usage on Xbox One. It sounds like you have had this problem with your internet service provider and its now coming out from your Xbox One bandwidth
 reports. Have you contacted Comcast themselves to see if it may be some type of error on their end or just a false reading? The amount of data displayed has to be a mistake as&nbsp;there is no possible way that amount of data could have been used by a gaming console
 in that amount of time. Please give a few more details regarding the situation in order to be able to best assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply </p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out</p>

<p>Hey George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not contacted Comcast yet but I will be doing that soon if I can't get this data usage under control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In August and September, I saw my usage increase and get me close to the 1TB limit I have with Comcast. This month I went over, and I've been trying to figure out why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My router traffic statistics show that the Xbox isn't the main culprit, but when I went into the "Bandwidth usage" menu in the settings, that's where I saw those crazy numbers. I don't understand why the Xbox would show such high numbers but the router itself
 is showing completely different numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just now done a hard reset (factory reset but I chose the "keep my games and apps" option, and since I've done that about 15 minutes ago, the bandwidth usage on the xbox says I've already used 287 TB</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole thing is very strange and I'm just confused as to what's going on.</p>

</p><p>You are right there. In order to be in the insider program you would have had to have been invited by someone else that is already in the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also double check your Operating system version. Console in the preview program will have a different version than everyone else. The current OS version that

<p>...have you started a new multiplayer game never used before August? are you using too much streaming from console? Like Netflix or Mixer or Twitch....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that the amount of data displayed on the console is a bit bugged, BUT you really goes over the 1TB limit of your provider, so something is wrong on the average data usage.</p>

<h2>            Windows resettting</h2>
                    <p>Hello ..</p>
<p>i have a problem in my laptop windows (using windows 10) which upgraded from windows 8 and activated through digital license. windows was not working properly so i decided to hit the reset button but it says there is a problem resetting (0x80071395 -0x90017
 ) &nbsp;it. i tried each and every way i tried every hack which google or every other user told me . Now i came to realize that updates are also not installing from the date problem started.when this problem started my windows defender was turned off on its own
 and then i turned it on by following different steps now its working but not that effectively . In my opinion i am surrounded by a strong virus because in the start a software uc Chinese browser was in my laptop i tried to remove it scan it delete it but it
 didn't work.</p>
<p>i don't know what to do i am a architecture student and i have a lot of work to do but my laptop is not cooperating . i hope someone will cooperate and tell me how to get rid of this scary virus.</p>

            <p>Hi Muhammad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be an issue with the system files that the <strong>System File Checker</strong> and
<span><strong>Deployment Image Servicing and Management</strong> cannot detect that is why you're not able to perform a reset. You can address this concern by performing a repair upgrade to replace the system files. To perform a repair upgrade, you need to

    <title>Xbox 360 controller driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> turabjafri  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 controller driver</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have looked all over the internet for a solution to this strange problem,but it seems as if I am the only one facing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I used to play mulyiplayer games on my pc using 2 xbox 360 wired controllers which worked fine. Due to some reason i had to change my hardrive and start all over with installing the windows,and so on.On my pc with the new hardrive,I only installed one
 of my controllers to play single player ganes and later on,when i got the need to play a multiplayer game, I found out that connecting the second controller was just impossible . The second controller is detected on my pc and also blinks its 4 LED's but it
 wont work. Updating the driver gives an error"Acces Denied". i have tried disabling ,unistalling and what not to make it work but every single time ,this one particular controller wont work. To make sure if the controller is not damaged,i connected the controller
 to another pc,and it connected perfectly.I looked over the internet to find a silution to"Access Denied" error and on some forum i was told to get permission through regedit,but I couldn't get the permission. So I am sure that the controllers work fine,but
 the problem is with my system and i really need it fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking forward for a quick reply with a working solution</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S: I also installed the driver manually from the Microsoft website,but again that one particular controller didnt work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Turab Jafri</p>

            So I found a solution on my own. For those facing the same problem, simply go into "SAFE MODE With Networking" and update your driver from there. Worked for me :D

<h2>            Banned for a typo</h2>
                    i was sending a message to my friend trying to get his attention and i sent the word&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed Profanity]</strong>&nbsp;instead kf “nug”. Thats just what we have always called him. Just a name that stuck. He says he didnt report me and he had no
 reason to. But now i have a 14 day communication ban all because of a typo.

<p>The Enforcement Team only reacts on reports. So if your friend really didn't report you, the Enforcement Team wouldn't have done anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still think that this suspension was issued in error, then you need to go to
<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://enforcement.xbox.com</a> and sign in with your suspended account. There click on the yellow tile with the hammer icon, and find the currently active suspension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 24 hours have passed since the begin of the suspension, and since it's a suspension that lasts for more than 24 hours, you should see a link to file a Case Review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on the link and correctly fill out a questionnaire that proves your knowledge of the Code of Conduct (if you need help, you'll find a Code of Concuct "cheat sheet" here:
<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/codeofconduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/codeofconduct</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After passing the Code of Conduct questionnaire, you can then explain why they should review that suspension.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But again: Be aware that someone HAS reported you, otherwise the enforcement team wouldn't have issued a suspension, and along with that report, the console collected data and telemetry and sent that along with the report (for example your message), and
 based on that evidence the Enforcement team decided on your suspension. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You only get ONE attempt at that case review, so don't waste it by just saying something along the lines of "But I didn't do anything".</p>

            Are you sure that in the past month you have not written any message or through the mic have insulted anyone? Maybe you remember maybe you dont. But if the friend did not report you, you should not be banned for this. But I think that somebody else have
 reported you. And thats why you are banned.&nbsp;

            Positive. I already got a case review and thats how i kmow ots about that particar message due to it being called racially charged. But apparently theirs literally nothing i can do about it now.&nbsp;

            Most of the situations I've seen like this, the person reported their friend because they thought it would be funny.&nbsp; Until they found out they got a suspension because of it.&nbsp; Then they either deny it or try to remedy the situation (which they really
 can't).

<p>Hello BTCGreasyGranny,</p>

</p><p>As already mentioned, Bans can happen weeks after the fact, Xbox Enforcement investigates everything thoroughly before hand, A ban would never happen for no reason, The system logs each report and keeps a record of it, You can check your enforcement history

<h3> marieke1988  say:</h3>
<h2>            Repair screen Surface Pro 4 in China</h2>
                    <p>I' bought my Surface Pro in Holland a few months ago. Now I moved to China for work and I'll be here for the coming 2 years. My screen got cracked here and I need to fix this. I heard there is no service centre of Microsoft in China (or anywhere near Guangzhou
 where I live). What to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I have two options:</p>
<p>1. Fix at a local repair store (capabilities may not be high). Is it difficult to change the screen? Does Microsoft give any instructions for new screen placement in these cases?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When I visit my family I get the screen fixed in Holland. Mostly I'm there one week or so, is it possible to fix in one week?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other options with low risk let me know! Hope someone can help me out!!<br />

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See if the fixes here help:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows/3-quick-fixes-for-your-windows-store-problems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset.  After it resets, restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that fails then Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset.  After it resets, restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that fails then reinstall Store.  Type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Administrator, copy the following code and paste it into the box using the Edit tools from Box's top left dropdown menu, press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage *WindowsStore*).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</code>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />If these all fail then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

 can then follow the online tutorials to add mods to your game. Happy modding :)</p>

<h2>            Having Difficulty With &#34;Sudden&#34; Windows Vista Screen Size Enlargements</h2>
                    
<p>Good Afternoon, Vista Community -</p>
<p>I need assistance with my problem. I have an E-machines Pentium 4 desktop processor featurning Hyper-Threading. Starting approximately 3-4 months ago, I began seeing 200% screen icon enlargement, either when turning the computer on, or re-starting after
 a prolonged absence. This problem was usually fixed by simply re-booting the system, which worked until yesterday. From yesterday until 12:08pm today, the enlargement persisted, also extending into the Yahoo! email program. Both the computer monitor and Yahoo!
 are showing the are set to their normal defaults, 96% DPI for the monitor and "Medium" for the email. There is no right-clicking within the Vista software that specifically addresses this&nbsp;enlargement problem, it seems. Now&nbsp;the Monitor&nbsp;displays are&nbsp;displaying
 the original functionality as it did when purchased in November 2007; however I would still like to hear from anyone out their who might have an idea or theory as to what is occurring.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;Now&nbsp;the Monitor&nbsp;displays are&nbsp;displaying the original functionality as it did when purchased in November 2007; however I would still like to hear from anyone out their who might have an idea or theory as to what is occurring.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Does that mean <strong>it is ok now</strong>. No more screen enlargement problem ?<br />
If answer is " no ", then a reply has already been given to you. Ignore mine.<br />
<br />
<strong>If the answer is " yes ", it is ok now, then I would suggest that you create a restore point now. And " religiously ", every few days, create another restore point, almost like a schedule. That way, if the same problem arises, you have a restore point
 to fall back to.<br />
</strong><br />
No, I don't have a theory nor a clue why that happened.<br />
Hope I have not wasted your time reading this.</p>

<p><span><span>It could be software or drivers, or it could be the hardware - it's hard to tell without more information.&nbsp; I suspect a driver or possibly some file corruption, but we'll
 have to test for that.&nbsp; We'll&nbsp; try to rule out the software and driver problems first.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began (this recent one)?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began (and maybe give it an extra
 day or two).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<span>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps made on a different computer or perhaps in safe mode with networking if that is working).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp;
 It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;video settings (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event
 Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer: </span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></p>
<span><span>
<p><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers, firmware, and/or software.&nbsp;</span><span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type device manager and enter
 and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting
 tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should<strong>do the video card and the monitor at least</strong> and any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT
 from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span>.</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install,
 and run the following two programs:</span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;and</span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span>
 and Avast at:</span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span>. &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want
 to try the free OneCare at </span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm</span></a><span> and let it run all the
 options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, 
<span>try a clean boot&nbsp; </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></span></a><span><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></p>
<span>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; To do this
 you have to also be able to boot normally.<span>&nbsp; </span>Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a><span><span>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Please
 reply before doing the next step as it is a radical option and I’d like to make sure we’ve ruled out all other options before taking that step.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work (or you don’t have the disk), then I'm afraid the only option is a clean install.&nbsp; You can use Knoppix</span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with a blank CD.&nbsp; This should give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way) to backup your important data.&nbsp; Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or the Recovery Disk or the
 Recovery Partition (whatever process is dictated by your computer manufacturer – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps to get recovery disks).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted
 as necessary by the procedures of your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly
 150 updates pending,...</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

    <title>How to increase dedicated video memory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bman630  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to increase dedicated video memory</h2>
                    <p>I have just recently purchased Zoo Tycoon Ultimate Edition for Windows 10, and the System Requirements did not show up for me until after purchasing, which I realized I do not have enough dedicated video memory to actually run the game. I try to install
 the game, but all it gives me is an error, or says downloading, but no progress is made The system requirements did not show up for me before or as I was purchasing the game, only when I had already purchased the game, and as I am technically unable to get
 a refund, I would like to know how to increase or upgrade my dedicated video memory. These are my current specs</p>
<p>Processor<span> </span>AMD A8-5500 APU with Radeon(tm) HD Graphics, 3200 Mhz, 2 Core(s), 4 Logical Processor(s)<br />
</p>
<p>Installed Ram&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 8.00 GB (7.40 GB Usable)</p>
<p>Display Adapter&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;AMD Radeon HD 7560D</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those are all the ones that I think will help, although I will say that my current dedicated video ram is 512 MB, and the required is 1 GB. What I am looking for is some kind of suggestion as to what I need to get to fix the problem, if I can fix the problem
 now, and if it is a suggestion of what I need to get, the cheapest, yet good quality, so my computer doesn't blow up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advanced. If you need any other computer specs, I would be happy to give them to you if it means you can help me</p>

<p>As far as I know, the only way would be to replace the Radeon HD 7560D with another graphics adapter that has more actual RAM. The actual recommended Video Memory for Zoo Tycoon is 2GB, so you can see why 512MB would not run right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you actually can get a refund. Did you try contacting Microsoft to ask for a refund?</p>

<p>Which edition of W-10 are you running and what is the build number?&nbsp; Go here and read this about your CPU/Graphics,</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-2540171/increase-dedicated-memory-amd-radeon-7560d.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will see at first the helper misunderstands that the graphics this user sought to upgrade was a dedicated card.&nbsp; It wasn't, he, like you have the graphics built into the APU.&nbsp; There is no VRAM dedicated to the onboard graphics in the APU.&nbsp; It shares
 system RAM which needs to be DDR3 1866Mhz. to make it gaming capable (and that is the maximum speed memory the A8-5500 will handle), but the APU's onboard graphics is not set up to vary how much RAM it sees or can use beyond the 512 MB that the system sets
 aside for it that I know of, unless they included an adjustment for it in their AMD Catalyst software or their AMD Overdrive software. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming this is a laptop?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If not and it's a desktop, all the above still applies, but you just got a few options.&nbsp; What motherboard is this?&nbsp; Make, model, etc.?&nbsp; Until I hear back,&nbsp; I'll just say if it's a desktop, start saving up for a dedicated PCIe graphics card.&nbsp; A good PCIe
 3.0 x 16 card with 4GB of dedicated 128 bit GDDR5 memory, a Radeon RX 460, runs about $155.00 + tax.&nbsp; It has it's onboard memory, but will still use some of your main RAM for the shader cache, etc.&nbsp; You may want some more RAM in your future as well.&nbsp; If you're
 a Gamer I recommend 16GB DDR3 1866Mhz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do remember, the Insider Previews are beta software.&nbsp; Bad things can and do happen.&nbsp; For every airplane flying today, there were a lot of lawn darts first, if you get my drift.&nbsp; So, backups are a must of anything important to you. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The computer that I am using is a desktop, and while I am a gamer, I actually use my laptop to play games, although my siblings use the desktop, but as well as my parents. My mother was actually the one who said to post this question. The computer that I
 am using is running W-10 v. 1607, or 10.0.14393, with the build number of 14393.447. The motherboard manufacturer is Hewlett-Packard, and the model number is p7-1534. I would also like to know what the Insider Preview is, as I am not certain</p>

<p>Okay.&nbsp; Your P7-1534 has an MSI MS-7778 motherboard, HP name 'Jasmine'.&nbsp; It has an AMD A75 chipset for socket FM2 processors.&nbsp; Right now it has a factory installed A8-5500 AMD with the Radeon HD-7560D graphics embedded in the CPU.&nbsp; We already established
 512MB of shared main memory is how it is limited.&nbsp; The motherboard can take up to an AMD A10-5800K processor with Radeon HD-7660D graphics built in.&nbsp; It still pulls from the main memory, and the highest memory you can take is 1866 Mhz, up to 16GB and 1600
 Mhz up to 32GB.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>For video purposes the graphics processor sees it as 933 Mhz memory.&nbsp; Pretty good for 2013.&nbsp; A tad slow today, and bottlenecked at 512 MB of usable memory and DirectX 11 capable.&nbsp; W10 is capable of DX 12..&nbsp; To upgrade the processot to get a better onboard
 graphics processor built in is the least bang for the buck and bigger money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make that machine shine better would require a total of 16MB of DDR3 memory and pulling the video duties off it by adding a discreet video card with it's own memory.&nbsp; The PCIe card bus on that motherboard is PCIe 2.0 x 16.&nbsp; You'll need a card with 4GB
 of it's own graphics memory, preferably GDDR5, so you'd have more and faster memory than the motherboard has.&nbsp; It will still use some motherboard memory, but for menial tasks, like a shader cache, etc.&nbsp; Since you're using AMD now, for simplicity we'll stay
 with AMD.&nbsp; A good Radeon RX-560 video card with 4GB of GDDR5 graphics memory running at 1176 Mhz and double the bandwidth of 128 bits instead of the 64 bits the motherboard memory runs at will easily handle DirectX 12 and game.&nbsp; The monitor will need to have
 a DVI-D or HMDI port to plug into and a cable to match.&nbsp; It'd run about $129.00 these days.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the main memory you have four DDR3 slots.&nbsp; HP doesn't say how they configured the memory or the speed of the memory they installed...it could be 4 2GB sticks or 2 4GB sticks of DDR3.&nbsp; In the first case you'd replace the sticks in slots 2 &amp; 4 with 4GB
 of identical speed memory.&nbsp; They all need to be DDR3-1333, 1600, or 1866 Mhz to match.&nbsp; Speed here isn't as big an issue as it would be if it still had to handle video.&nbsp; The good news is that would add up to 12GB of memory.&nbsp; Quite doable.&nbsp; The second option
 is that if HP used 2 4GB sticks, you'd add 2 more, again identical speed and end up with 16GB.&nbsp; Respectable and quite doable.&nbsp; It won't be Alienware, but it'll work mainstream.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost forgot, 2 4GB sticks of DDR3 in matching speed will run about $80.00.&nbsp; Any of the major memory makers will help you match them.</p>

<p>Now I understand the machine is running the 14393 version of W-10.&nbsp; Any reason you folks didn't upgrade to Public release versions 15063 or 16299?&nbsp; The machine is capable of handling either, and the drivers for the motherboard hardware are available on Windows
 Update for either version of W-10.&nbsp; My rebuilt and hot rodded m9357c HP from 2007 is running the latest Insider Preview version right now.&nbsp; That is the machine in my signature at the bottom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Insider Preview requires a fair amount of computer knowledge and skills.&nbsp; Support is NOT provided by Microsoft directly.&nbsp; You found our Inside Forum where we share knowledge and support one another running these Previews.&nbsp; Because it is an experimental
 version of Windows that we test, bad things can and do happen, stuff that'd make you rip your hair out, trash your data, break the Windows system, and can even crash and cause your computer to not boot, etc.&nbsp; All the nightmares.&nbsp; We never, ever run these far
 ahead experimental versions on our machines that must be reliable for normal use.&nbsp; Never.&nbsp; We either cobble together a second machine, buy a cheap spare off E-Bay, or the more knowledgeable add a second hard drive to put it on so they can boot to either the
 normal Windows or the test version.&nbsp; Some run Virtual Machines to install the software in and keep it isolated from the real operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For learning and support of the normal Windows 10, you would be best served in the Windows 10 section.&nbsp; Here we help mostly, the other Microsoft Insiders, but rarely turn away anyone in need.&nbsp; Just isn't our style.&nbsp; I flit back and forth between both sections
 because I run both the Public Release and the Insider Preview. &nbsp;</p>

<p>No problem.&nbsp; you would get 2 more 4GB sticks of memory matching those as closely as possible and put them in the 2 empty spots, cost about $80.00 total.&nbsp; Any reputable store or manufacturer will help you do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Don said, and I recommend too, you'd get a video card and insert it in the slot for it on the motherboard.&nbsp; A Radeon RX-560 card with it's own 4 GB of fast graphics dedicated memory would do nicely, cost about $129.00 average.&nbsp; The cord from the video
 card to the monitor would also have to match the connectors at both ends.&nbsp; Again, any reputable store or video card maker will help you do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize, sometimes we forget not everyone is a geek....yet&nbsp; 😁That'll run your game...and more!</p>
<p>

<h2>            Failure configuring Windows Updates, Reverting changes. Error code&#58; 8007003</h2>
                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I installed Windows 8 pro during December 2012. Since then:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>all updates labelled "Update for Windows 8 for x64-based systems (KB27*****)" have failed.</li><li>Upon restarting my computer I get the a blue screen with stating "Failure configuring Windows Updates, Reverting changes.".</li><li>Upon checking my update history I am able to find the error code 8007003 for all the failed updates.</li></ul>
<div>I have repeatedly tried to troubleshoot the situation using Windows help and support as well as by researching forums. Things I have tried include all steps in the following articles:</div>

<div>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2787757 - This involves disabling the NLS (which I don't have on my PC)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As you might think, attempting the solve the issue myself has been frustrating and time consuming. I consider myself more competent than the average PC user so please when offering me a solution, DO NOT tell me to reboot, restore etc. because this does
 not work!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since I have not had any errors with my previous copy of windows 7, not to mention that installing Windows 8 degraded my SSD&nbsp;substantially&nbsp;and also gives me many problems, I am very upset that Microsoft have launched a&nbsp;product&nbsp;with a known bug that many
 people are experiencing and cannot be fixed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would like to request one of the following:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>A known fix!</li><li>If not, A technical consultant to remotely access my PC and find the issue</li><li>If he/she cannot solve the issue, A brand new Windows 8 Pro installation disc</li><li>If this does not solve the problem, A full refund + Damage costs to my hardware for running a defective OS (i.e. a replacement SSD)</li></ul>
<div>I look forward to your response</div>

            Hi Cj du Sart,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community and giving an opportunity to assist you on this issue.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>As per the issue description, you are unable to install updates offered from Windows updates on the computer as you get an error message prompting “F<strong>ailure configuring Windows Updates, Reverting changes</strong>” with an error code “<strong>8007003</strong>”.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>We appreciate the patience and efforts with which you have tried different steps and methods to resolve the issue.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>We will work together and resolve this issue further.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since, it is unable to install the updates and its reverting back; perhaps, there might be some inconsistencies on the computer leading to this issue.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can follow the methods accordingly:</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>To check for inconsistencies, let’s run system update readiness tool. You can refer to the link:</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> System Update Readiness Tool fixes Windows Update errors in Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2008.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the section “<strong>For Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2008 R2</strong>”</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the section “<strong>For Windows 8</strong>”:</div>

<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For
 added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, you can refer to the following steps to back the registry files on the
 computer:</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Press <strong>Windows and r</strong> key to open the run box.<br />
b) Type ‘<strong>regedit</strong>’ without quotes and press Enter from the keyboard.<br />
c) Open the <strong>File</strong> option on the menu bar.<br />
d) Click on <strong>Export</strong> and save the file with a name on the desktop.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you want to backup the file, you can do so by double clicking the file that you have saved on the desktop.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to temporarily disable the security software on the computer and then try installing the updates on the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><b><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Important Note:</span></b><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Security software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have
 to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></font></p>
