<h2>            Windows 10 Pro 64 Bit - Lots of 6035 Events from the System ID</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 10 Pro 64 bit system that the System event log is showing a Event ID 6035 message every 10 seconds.&nbsp; The SID associated with the message is SYSTEM.&nbsp; The suggested action is to reduce Global or local groups, but I don't see how I Can do this
 for the SYSTEM ID.&nbsp; This is a&nbsp;standalone system not linked to any AD domain or policy servers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how to resolve this?</p>

            <p>My message to microsoft, added to the petition :</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I don't accept forced upgrades that install an OS with only a few months experience without my consentment
<br />
- I don't accept upgrades that are meant to forward personal undefined information to microsoft<br />
- I don't accept that the same upgrade (KB3035583) reinstalled itself 3 times since september without my consentment, although I "masked" it (last forced trial : 2015-12-18)<br />
- I am a Windows 7 user with a real, purchased windows 7 license ; I do not intend to be neither a Windows 8 user nor a Windows 10 user.&nbsp; Unless I decided it.<br />
- My Windows 7 platform is a software development platform. I don't accept that microsoft compromises my work and my configuration by forcing me to install an OS I don't want with a high probability of putting a big mess on my system and introducing big delays
 in my work<br />
- Since the beginning of september, I have spent more than 24 hours of my personal time to solve issues caused by those forced windows 10 upgrades, including one at the beginning of december that temporarily said that my windows 7 version was not genuine (ah,
 one more 6-hours process to get the situation back to a safe state)</p>
<p>Microsoft, please note that I don't want windows 10, and that there are great chances that I'll never install it, due to your lamentable and unethical way of proceeding.</p>

            <p>Hello SuRyunJ,</p><p><br /></p><p>We cannot complete a deposit into your account because your US&nbsp;Rewards Account cannot complete a deposit of USD&nbsp;into your Canadian Microsoft Account. That account will only accept deposits made with the CAD currency.&nbsp;This means that in order to resolve this issue, you have two options. You need to either adjust your Microsoft Account to match your Rewards Account, or create a new Rewards Account to match your new Microsoft Account region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) You can adjust your Microsoft Account region to match your Rewards region from your commerce page at (<a href="https://billing.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://commerce.microsoft.com</a>). This will cause your regions to match and allow your currency to be deposited.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) The second option of Creating a brand new account has some pros and cons. The benefit of creating a new Rewards Account is that your new account will be set to track and Reward purchases made in your Microsoft Account's regional currency. The drawback is that you will lose the previous progress you have made on your account, as you will be creating a brand new Rewards Account.&nbsp;While we will be able to transfer any pending (un-deposited) Credits from your old Rewards Account, we will not be able to transfer any other progress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to continue with Rewards in your current Microsoft Account region and create a new account, you must first close your current account by opting out of the program at (<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/optout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/optout</a>/). You will have to wait 48 hours for us to receive and process your request, after which your account should show up as completely clean of progress and have a join by date of "???". At that point, you can create a new Rewards Account by signing back up again, which can also take 48 hours. To confirm that you have re-registered correctly, you can check your join date from the&nbsp;MyRewards&nbsp;page at (<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/</a>). If your join by date still shows "???", and not your recent registration date, then your account has not yet been successfully re-registered. If you open a new post after being able

<h2>            HP 8600 WIll not scan</h2>
                    <p>I've been operating PC's since the days of Tandys with a program drive and a data drive.&nbsp; I've now got a new Toshiba laptop running Windows 10.&nbsp; I purchased the computer about two weeks ago.&nbsp; After a setup it was perking along.&nbsp; Yesterday it received a Windows
 update.&nbsp; (GROAN!!!!!)&nbsp; The update blew the printer driver for the HP 8600 all-in-one printer.&nbsp; After spending my time (5 hours) and my money with a native Tagolog speaker trying to work it out (his fix crashed the internet and my phone). I finally got it back
 up and running on my own.&nbsp; Part of his fix had me disable my anti virus.&nbsp; After I got the printer working again I tried to re enable the antivirus.&nbsp; Couldn't do it.&nbsp; Guess what - back to a native Tagolog speaker.&nbsp; Another hitch:&nbsp; He asked me to go into CONTROL
 PANEL in order to check the version of the software.&nbsp; I knew where CP was in Versions 3.0 through 7.&nbsp; Why the **** did MS see the need to obscure it in 10??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on, you guys, you can do better than this!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, you frustrated HP 8600 users, completely remove the shattered driver and all of it's remnants (if you can find the Control Panel) and anything related to it and, if you're lucky, it'll reinstall successfully and work - that is -until you get
 another Windows 10 2-hour long update. And, then, dear friends, all bets are off.</p>

<h2>            How Do I Connect My Xbox Live Bluetooth Headset to Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I am trying to connect my Xbox Live Bluetooth Headset to Windows 7. It connects but can't be used because there are no drivers. Anyone know a fix for this? The broadcom software won't work because the headset disconnects after failing to look for drivers.
 How does a Microsoft Product not work!?

            What's the make and model of your computer?&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>When you say it connects, what exactly do you mean. Does the device show up in Device Manager? If so, is it under the&nbsp;appropriate&nbsp;name, or is it an 'unknown device'?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do you have any other Bluetooth enabled devices connected to the PC?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The issue here is that you've got a device designed with one purpose in mind, to be used on the XBOX 360. In fact, I can't even find the device listed in the Windows 7 Compatibility Center.&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;s=Xbox%20360%20Call%20of%20Duty%3a%20Modern%20Warfare%203%20Wireless%20Headset%20with%20Bluetooth&amp;type=Hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;s=Xbox%20360%20Call%20of%20Duty%3a%20Modern%20Warfare%203%20Wireless%20Headset%20with%20Bluetooth&amp;type=Hardware</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Since you actually have the device in hand, you might want to try searching again though because the&nbsp;compatibility&nbsp;center does have pretty helpful resources for hardware trouble.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, if you can't find it and it's just not listed, you can try this solution I found.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>'Windows Mobile Device Center'</b><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/downloads/microsoft/device-center-download.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/en-us/downloads/microsoft/device-center-download.mspx</u></a><br />
<div><br />
<div>You'll want to download the Windows Mobile Device Center from the link above and install it on your computer.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then in Device Manager, you'll see your device listed, my guess as 'Unknown Device'</div>
<div>Right click it and click Update Driver Software</div>
<div>Click browse my computer for software&nbsp;</div>
<div>Click "let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer"&nbsp;</div>
<div>Select 'Bluetooth Radio' from the list.&nbsp;</div>
<div>In the next window, you'll want to choose the one listed by "Microsoft&nbsp;Cooperation"&nbsp;</div>
<div>From the list of drivers, select the most recent one labeled &nbsp;<span>'Windows Mobile-based device
 support'</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>Follow any prompts on screen, and keep in mind you may have to restart the computer once all of this is done. And if still no luck, you may try
 removing the device first from Device Manager and trying again.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

<p>Original Title:&nbsp;<strong>"Windows password "</strong></p>
<p>I recently changed my windows password, because I had a trojon virus on my computer, once the password was changed I can no longer even log into windows.&nbsp; How can this be fixed?&nbsp; I know the password was changed because the hint question/answer is correct,
 it just tells me the password is incorrect.&nbsp; If I can't access my computer I can't fix the problem.&nbsp; Any one out there know what I can do?&nbsp; This is my best friends computer I am on now, she will get the information to me.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Partitioning primary partition &#58; Dell Inspiron 15r 5520</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Dell Inspiron 15r 5520 laptop with 500GB of Hard Disk size and 6gb of RAM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got the laptop with windows 7 Home Basic pre-installed and a single drive c: where the OS is installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I create partitions on that particular drive so that I could get extra drives in My Computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way of creating the partions from windows 7 itself, or do I have to use a third party software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can the primary partition be extended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please suggest......................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

            <p>Good question from Palcouk, many of the classic reason for having additional partitions on older O/S&nbsp;are not so significant with Windows 7</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press the Windows Key (next to Alt key) and R to bring up the Run box. Replace anything in there with
<strong>diskmgmt.msc</strong>&nbsp; click OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a few seconds a Window will open with a list of the drives in the top and the drives as a Bar Graph in the bottom. Your HDD will probably have 3 partitions as Mike has said, a System Reserved, the Boot Partition (C:) and Recovery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right click on the Boot partition in the Bar graph display&nbsp;and the menu should include Shrink Volume as an option so select that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A message box will display for a short while as it analyses the disk then a dialogue will open with 4 boxes one of which is settable. The default will be the maximum you can shrink but as it is the O/S drive this would be too much. Type in the value you
 need for your additional partition, it is in MB so 102400 would be 100GB. You should find a link to the Help file entry for shrinking a volume, you have made no changes at this stage so click on that and have a read.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are happy click on Shrink and it should start the process. How long it takes will depend on how much space you are leaving in the C drive and how fragmented the disk is. Eventually you will end up with unallocated space on the disk in which you create
 your new drive. As a 4th partition it is a 2 stage process. 1st you create an Extended partition with the space then create logical drives in that partition.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Nothing displays correct sense Windows 10 update WHY&#63;</h2>
                    Hi sense Windows 10 update nothing is displaying correct. Thought it was my monitor but went out and bought a newer monitor. it's just not right. I had no problems before upgrade but now having a hard time with the whole thing. It is like a setting or
 something is not correct. It is that round things are oval shaped and web pages just don't display correct. Now I know it is not my monitor but something to do with Windows 10 update. The reason I know this is because I hooked my Laptop (which is Windows 8.1)
 to this monitor and it was just fine, then I hooked up another PC that I have that is not Windows 10 and it was just fine. I have played with all the settings and can not get it correct. There is numerous other things I have posted in&nbsp;here&nbsp;sense I have installed
 Windows 10 and I am trying real hard to over look all these things...........................but it is leaving a real bad taste in my mouth with your product. I have been a long time user of your product but to the point of saying screw it and go with a MAC.
 Here is a screen shot of how distorted it is and this is the best I can get my settings. I can under stand that your trying to get so your Windows 10 can go across many different products like phones and tablets and that is a good thing but
<strong>PLEASE HELP ME</strong> with this problem<br />

            Problem solved.............................Not even a week changed back to windows 7. I enjoyed a lot of the features but there was to much on Windows 10 that did not work correct. Windows 10 is like Windows VISTA and it had a lot of nice features but
 just did not work right. I can understand that you want to be able to try and keep the same format across many different devices like phone and tablets. I make my living off my computer and if things are not working correct then I am not making MONEY but spending
 more time trying to get the thing to work correct. As soon as I went back to Windows 7 everything started working correct. This experience gave me a bad taste in my mouth and I am 95% sure the next computer I buy will be a MAC.

<h2>            No status indicator for contacts&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So after upgrading to macOS Mojave I had to upgrade Skype from Skype Classic to recent monstrosity (electron-web-based) because classic version hanged after starting the call and only voice worked (most likely problems with permissions).</p>
<p>Setting aside abysmal performance, there is a huge problem - there is aboslutely no status indication for contacts! I can go to each contact and check when they were last seen, but this is utterly stupid! How can I easily see who's online and who's not???</p>

<p>Skype for Web works just fine, but it has same UI as Classic Skype so that's comparing apples to oranges (it worked just fine for me with Classic Skype for mac!!!)</p>

<h2>            Windows 10, ver 1511, build 10586 upgrade stuck at 79&#37;</h2>
                    The version 1511, build 10586, major upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, released in mid November 2015, has now (on 26 Nov 2015) been stuck at 79% of copying files (23% of the overall update) for a lengthy period of time. &nbsp;However, there is still HDD activity showing.
 &nbsp;This is occurring on a Lenovo X201 (64-bit) which I had already in August 2015 upgraded from the original OS, which was Windows 7 Ultimate. &nbsp;I fear adverse consequences if I tinker with the situation without guidance. &nbsp;What can I do?

            <p>Hello Mohammed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having the same issue and nothing you've indicated above, or I've done so far has had any impact on the upgrade being stuck at 79%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I've tried:</p>
<p>- Wiping the SoftwareDistribution folder and Catroot2 folder (after stopping services) and restarting</p>
<p>- Using Windows Disk Cleanup to wipe partially downloaded files</p>
<p>- Stopping all services as you recommended above and retrying the update</p>
<p>- Stopping the virus scanner and retrying the update</p>
<p>- Running the Windows update Troubleshooter and retrying the update</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little information about the system:</p>
<p>- This is a non secure boot Windows 10 Pro Installation that was upgraded from Windows 7. It is currently at Build 10240</p>
<p>- The BIOS are as updated as they can be, but it's a Asus P5GC-MX with a Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E4500&nbsp; @ 2.20GHz, 2200 Mhz, 2 Core(s), 2 Logical Processor(s)</p>
<p>- The computer is connected to a domain, and Windows Update settings are set to share updates only with PCs in the local network. There is 1 other computer in the local network that has the newer build on it, and it's also been wiped and cleaned with steps
 mentioned above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide further troubleshooting information above what is considered the first level as you've mentioned above.</p>

<p>This is a widely reported issue.... I and many other users get very blurry, low quality video via Xbox One neyflix app on all videos. I have Verizon FIOS with a 80mbps download speed and my One is connected with a wired connection. I can get consistent crisp/clear
 Super HD video via my Apple TV so I know this isn't my ISP. &nbsp;Please provide some support on this issue Microsoft. I want my One to be an all in one device and I'd like to get rid of my Apple TV.

<p>Yeah i have this issue. It seems the One can't handle full HD video, full-screen. The still picture is fine, but it blurs on movement and any fast action sequences are virtually unwatchable. The framerate noticeably drops in HD.</p>
<p>This happens to me across all video apps and needless to say, my 360 on the same (wired) connection works flawlessly in HD. This IS a One issue and I can understand why Microsoft are reluctant to publicly acknowledge it but they are running out of time for
 a discreet fix. Over two months since release and unable to stream HD? Ouch. </p>

            Hi Tobias
<br />
<br />BSOD's are generally caused by a corrupt or incompatible device driver, and while WhoCrashed indicates your Nvidia video driver, to diagnose any underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Hi Tobias
<br />
<br />Analysis of your Minidump file confirms it is indeed your Nvidia graphics card device driver that is causing your system crashes . . .
<br />
<br />Windows update may have installed a driver on that device that is incompatible with your system. your best option is to try a slightly older version of that driver to see if your system stabilizes . .. 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running

<p>the BSODs are very random... they mostly happen, when i'm not at the PC...</p>
<p><br />
i think will wait a few days and watch, if there are no BSODs with the old driver, if there is another BSOD, i will try the newest DCH driver.

                    The touch screen on my Surface RT would work for about 5 minutes then it would freeze. I have to turn the power swith so that it is on sleep mode then when I wake it up, the touch screen would work again for a short time.

            HI Anna. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can try.   What happens exactly when you try to install the game normaliy?
<br />
<br />If it fails try in Compatibility Mode.  Right click the installer's .exe file before installing, and then the program .exe once installed, choose Troubleshoot Compatibility, follow the prompts to test a different Windows Mode and then set the app to install or always run in that mode.  
<br />
<br />Illustrated tutorial:

<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>If I restore my OS, will I lose all my files&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cfenske  say:</h3>
<h2>            If I restore my OS, will I lose all my files&#63;</h2>
                    Somewhere along the line I lost access to my Windows Vista Aero theme, and I can't use it, and my computer is stuck in Windows Classic.<br />
I've tried it all, going to msconfig and making sure themes is checked, going to advanced properties and setting my computer for best appearance and the other obvious fixes.<br />
When I right click the desktop and go to themes and appearance, I can click on Windows Vista theme, etc, but the taskbar and everything else stays at Windows Classic.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I've read that a fix to this would be to re-install/fix the OS using the original disk.&nbsp; However, I don't want to have to lose all my files.&nbsp; I've had to go through too many reformatings in the past few years.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So my question is, will I lose my files if I restore my OS?&nbsp; Or is there a different solution to restoring my Windows Vista theme?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Extra info: I've used theme editing programs like Vista Glazz and changed my theme before, and I'm certain this is the cause of the problem as it probably altered some important files.<br />

            The application you used ("VistaGlazz") patches certain theme DLLs so as to enable users to apply custom themes. See if running the System File Checker restores the original DLLs.

            <p>Hello Pluton,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the frustration when things don't go the way they supposed to. Let me help to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, since you have already performed the basic troubleshooting steps, which we really appreciate. Let's try to repair the existing installation of Windows operating system and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the below methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
Perform a Reset of the operating system and check if it helps to resolve the issue.
<p>
</p><p>Resetting lets you choose whether to keep your files or remove them, and then reinstalls Windows. To get started, go to
<span>Settings</span> &gt; <span>Update &amp; security</span> &gt; <span>Reset this PC</span> &gt;<span>Get started</span> and choose an option.

            <p>Dear Sayan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried any of the methods suggested. My husband googled in French and found an explanation: (Monday evening) he went in to the task manager (Ctrl + Alt + Del) as that was the only thing working on my machine. Through "files" he managed to sign
 in as an administrator and he undid the latest updates using "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Powershell".</span></p>
<pre>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</pre>
<p>My computer worked again for two days. Yesterday Cortana self-installed on my laptop and my computer crashed. Impossible to re-start. I unplugged, removed the battery, put it back and waited until just now to see if it would re-start. It did and seems to
 function. Not sure why Cortana is installed and it only seems to create problems. So for now am waiting to see for how long my computer will work ..........</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will keep you posted.</p>
<p>

            You have to follow a specific process to make the SDD a "bootable" drive. Here are some articles

            Hi Ravi,
<br />
<br />Check that the cloning process completed correctly
<br />
<br />Remove the HDD from your PC
<br />
<br />Plug the SSD into the SATA port on your motherboard that the HDD was plugged into
<br />
<br />Try booting your system with just the SSD plugged in
<br />
<br />Does your system boot from the SSD?
<br />
<br />If it still does not boot form the SSD, I would guess that the Cloning process may need to be performed again
<br />
<br />If it does, then I would put the HDD into another PC and Format it before putting it into that PC

<h2>            Surface Dial Web APIs</h2>
                    I manage a development team and we build web applications. We have what we believe to be a solid usecase to build around the surface dial for our customers, but we only seem to find dev tools for local / desktop applications. We've done some cursory searching
 and haven't found anything for web, but was hoping the community could point us in the correct direction.

            <p>Hi Elmo, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would request you to clear the browsing information from edge and then check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>
Look on the address bar for the <strong>... </strong>symbol ( for More actions ) at the top right corner. Click it.<br />
Press Settings ( at the bottom of the drop-down-list).<br />
Look for "Clear browsing data" with the "<em><strong>Choose what to clear</strong></em>". Press the button.
</p><p>Review the list of what to clear.&nbsp; Make selections.&nbsp;Press <strong>Clear</strong> button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please revert if you face any issues with edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>
<p />
