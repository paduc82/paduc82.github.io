<h2>            SOS&#33;&#33;&#33; After a Windows 10 Auto Update&#58; My computer was reset ALL FILES GONE</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Dear Microsoft Experts:<br />
<br />
I worked on my laptop in the morning. I shut it down. I came home that evening, rebooted and noticed an update had occurred. Cortana was all of the sudden in my task bar along with the "e" for explorer I guess. I hid them as I don't use them. My window's START
 button was functioning again (it had not worked for months so I just ignored it). As I began navigating my machine to do my usual work (this is my business computer) I noticed: NO EMAIL ACCOUNT-NO PICTURES IN PICS FOLDER-MY DOCUMENTS FOLDER EMPTY.
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Following the suggestions in the community this is what I have done so far--with ZERO LUCK:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">1) Attempted to run in safe mode to search for files. I swiped the upper right hand part of the screen to "search" but there is no "search"&nbsp; up there.
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">1a) Opened File Explorer, searched, no files.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">2) Attempted to Restore to an earlier date. Navigated to Restore (in Control Panel) Clicked on "Restore" nothing happens.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">3) Attempted to Switch Users thinking I was in a new generic user. Nope, I was indeed logged in as myself (I don't not have other users on this laptop.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">4) I ran a Full Scan using my Kaspersky 3.0 and everything appears fine.<br />
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">My machine is a newer Lenovo running Windows 10. When I restart it DID ask for my screen password. It DID show my name and my user photo.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Also, I still have a handful of files in the Trash. I still have my applications, but if I open any app such as Excel it acts as though I am opening for the first time. Outlook said "welcome" now let's set up an email account for
 you...</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Please advise!&nbsp; Help! SOS!!!</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Thank you,</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I would be happy to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I regret the inconvenience you are facing with Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you have lost all the files and folders on your computer, I suggest you to perform a System Restore using installation media to an earlier point by following the steps below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Go to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=615943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Insert the installation&nbsp;media you created, and then restart your PC.</p>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
On the Install Windows screen, select <strong>Repair&nbsp;your computer</strong>. (If you‚Äôre not seeing this screen, your PC&nbsp;might not be set up to boot from a drive. Check your PC manufacturer's&nbsp;website for info on how to boot from media, and then try again.)
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
On the Choose an option&nbsp;<strong>screen</strong>, select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.&nbsp;From there, you can use Safe Mode. Select
<strong>Advanced Options &gt; System Restore</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: Though it is said that System Restore does not affect your personal information such as email, documents, photos, videos, etc., but there is highly possible that
 some of your personal files are deleted while system restoring. During System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss.
 Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead to loss of important files as well.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Its better keep a backup of all the files and folders for safety. Check the link below which would help you to keep a backup of files manually:

            <p>Goodnews/Badnews~My files are all in tact, they were there, but I had to take the laptop to my PC Fix-it guy at a cost of $85 to have him return everything back to normal (i.e.: the way it was before the MS update). Details below:<br />
</p>
<p>System restore did not function. I literally followed the directions below and when I got to the "system restore" button, it was dead. Nothing happened when it was clicked. So I took it in for repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turned out that the major <strong>Microsoft Auto Update on August 17th</strong> caused my computer to "forget" my administrator account and turn my machine into a generic new user account--without files or folders. My profile picture was still up, my
 screen password still functioned, my apps were still visible (although when I opened any of them the machine thought it was for the first time, so opening Excel it said, "Welcome let's get started...") But the folders and files were hidden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new update DID fix the problem with the start menu button (a well known documented problem) but it wiped my user account from being visible--except to a trained IT person--so
<strong>not </strong>helpful.&nbsp; After my IT repair guy reset my laptop back to previous, the start menu button AGAIN does not work.&nbsp; I gave up on using that a LOOOOOOOONG time ago, so no loss there. It is stupid the way it is set up anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just glad to have my machine back to normal. The only good to come out of this was the extreme reminder to back up my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>

I need to advise a few things:<br />
1) For both computers, I use Windows 10.0.17134 Build 17134 ‚Äì ‚Äú1803‚Äù April 2018 Creative Update</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(16, 72, 34, 1)">2) This is a 64-Bit version of Windows.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(16, 72, 34, 1)">5) Both have the same problems - NO 5-CHANNEL SOUND, and NO ACCESS TO THESE PARAMETERS</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(16, 72, 34, 1)">I have tried to run the setup in the extras directory as Creative (the manufacturers) have described in several e-mail messages (now we have been back and forth about five times).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(16, 72, 34, 1)">This
 did not work.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(16, 72, 34, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(16, 72, 34, 1)">Please solve.&nbsp; Does Creative need to make a new driver?</span></p>

            by the way recon and sb z are same chip sets same core but only difference is the id and sb z has a built in amplifier while recon dose not sb z is better built.but buggy on windows u need to make sure playing videos that stereo 2.0 is not checked to only
 use original source never use 2.0 stereo it will make you sound choppy this card dose not support stereo 2.0 but is still a powerful card

<p>Hi thanks for your replies. I have contacted with polish creative support and they told me that I should try install drivers in windows 10 safe mode. It worked with no problem.</p>
<p>If anyone has same problem go and install drivers in safe mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First find how to enable safe mode in win 10.&nbsp;</p>

            not every one knows about windows adm u have to enable adm to go to safe mode,but just stick with updateing your audio controler via control panel hardware and update one of the unknown device i forgot which one but do it on both if u must till it finds
 soundblaster z with a recon driver manuly then run the soundblaster z software it will install with no problem

<p>I have had this problem with EVERY featute update. I am never buying a Sound Blaster card again as long as I live. That being said, i also have a fix. The problem is windows instals the latest driver which just isnt launched properly within windows. The
 only way to get sound back is to restart your machine after ever cold boot... forget that.</p>

</p><p>Go to the 3 page of replies and find Kuniyosh‚Äôs post. I recomend reading the other responses to my post as others have had issues when doing a full instal which has been resolve by doing a custom instal and then instaling the driver and control centre ONLY.

<h3> lindsay s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Invisible Cursor</h2>
                    <p>My touchpad and my wireless mouse are both working. The problem is that the cursor is invisible. When i hit the control button, it shows me where the cursor is with a circle. When i move my mouse around it will highlight whatever it is hovering over so long
 as its selectable. I can even click what I'm hovering over, but i have no arrow! I've tried updating my drivers and playing with the advanced mouse settings. What am i not thinking of!?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10</p>
<p>I didnt upgrade from 8.</p>
<p>Asus laptop.</p>
<p>Touchpad is enabled.</p>
<p>The cursor works in every way its supposed to except visibility.</p>
<p>Restarting didnt help.</p>
<p>started when i brought the laptop out of sleep mode.</p>

    <title>Problem getting two Standard TCP&#47;IP Ports &#40; 9100 &#47; 9101 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> liz77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem getting two Standard TCP&#47;IP Ports &#40; 9100 &#47; 9101 &#40; aka RAW &#41; to show printer on-line after restarting the laptop.</h2>
                    
<p>Both printer work when&nbsp;using USB.&nbsp; The network printserver is a Belkin F1UP0001 and allows the use of ports 9100 and 9101 for RAW printing.&nbsp; This setup works when using Windows XP and Vista - I'm not concirned about any bidirectional printer communication
 as it was disabled in both the XP and Vista configuration.&nbsp; In Windows 7 it is possible to have both printers working after creating a new Standard TCP/IP port for each printer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They will both&nbsp;remain working until I logout or shut down the laptop.&nbsp; After
 rebooting only one printer is available and that is on port 9101 and&nbsp;shows online - the printer prints jobs ok the other printer shows offline.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So far my upgrade as been straight forward other that having to hunt for a few compatible drivers.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi
<span><span>Liz77,</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Windows Forums.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To make sure that printers on the network are being displayed, check if the network is working correctly. If the
 network is working correctly, try these troubleshooting options:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Make sure that all computers on the network are in the same workgroup. One way to do that is to change the workgroup names on your
<span>Windows&nbsp;Vista</span>‚Äìbased computers. For information about changing a workgroup name, see
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Join-or-create-a-workgroup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Join or create a workgroup</span></span></a><span>.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If you don't know the name or network address (a location on the network) of the printer, contact the person who installed the printer on the network
 or a system administrator. If your computer is connected to a network domain, you might not have permission to use some printers and the printers will not be displayed. To obtain permission, contact a system administrator.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>If you are adding a printer that is plugged into another computer on the network and shared for other people to use, make sure that the computer
 where the printer is plugged in is turned on. You can also contact the computer owner to make sure that the computer is connected to the network or to see if the name of the printer has changed.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>For more information, please visit the link mentioned below:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-network-printer-problems</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You&nbsp;may also want to update&nbsp;the printer driver by visiting&nbsp;the printer manufacturer's&nbsp;website.</span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps.</span></span></p>

<p><span>Thank you for your reply.</span></p>
<p><span>In answer to your bulleted reply.</span></p>
<p><span>The print server is on the same network and is in the same workgroup, although I do not believe the latter matters when using TCP/IP printing.</span></p>
<p><span>The network is not a domain ‚Äì there is no domain server.</span></p>
<p><span>The printers are not connected to another computer / pc</span></p>
<p><span>The printer drivers are the latest version available from the manufacturers and function correctly when used as a virtual port when printing via USB.</span></p>
<p><span>The networked printer server is a dedicated print server with a static IP address (IPv4)and supports TCP/IP printing ( RAW ) via a Windows standard TCP/IP
 port ‚Äì this works perfectly and reliably in XP home, XP Professional and Vista Home Premium when using standard TCP/IP ports.</span></p>
<p><span>If there were problems with either the network, IP address, port number,
<span>&nbsp;</span>Rights, security, firewall etc <span>&nbsp;</span>then
<span>&nbsp;</span>it would not be possible to have a successful printing session during a user logged in session on the laptop.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is only after logging out of the laptop as a user or rebooting that one of the ports ( 9100 )shows the printer off line.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have physically swapped the printers and consistently it is the same port which shows the connected printer off line.</span></p>
<p><span>Is it possible that this problem is also tied to the inability to see the root of any network storage devices ( NAS) ‚Äì it is possible to see the roots in XP
 and Vista.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is however possible, in Windows 7, to map a drive to any one of the folders on the NAS devices ‚Äì this is also possible in XP and Vista.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The NAS devices have the correct workgroup, have static IP addresses ( IPv4) on the same network ‚Äì in fact there is only one network.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Every device connected to the network has a static IP address and <span>
&nbsp;</span>there are no duplicates.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ALL the DHCP servers are disabled.</span></p>

<h2>            External hard disks - Access denied - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased a laptop, running on Windows 10. I've been using a WD My Passport Ultra 1.5 TB external hard disk to store my data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, when I connected this hard disk, it worked for a second and immediately said access denied, and did so even after a couple of restarts and updates.</p>
<p>I thought my hard disk was damaged, but this happened when I connected another hard disk, and USB drive to the laptop as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It did not work for any external drive, but only once when I was able to change the permissions, it was able to work, until I had to restart the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could anyone help me out with this problem, or must I send it for repair or replacement?</p>
<p>I doubt that my hard disk is damaged, as other external drives show the "Access denied" message as well when connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried various solutions including the permissions changing, but it only worked once till I eventually restarted the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance to anyone who posts a reply and can help me in this and what I can do about it.<br />
</p>
<p>Every other external device like a mouse works normally, but only the hard drives have some sort of error.</p>
<p>Please help me with this problem!</p>

<h2>            Office 2016 Pro getting list of available content and files -- but I&#39;m not saving to SharePHioint</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 Enterprise fully patched, Office 2016 Pro fully patched. We use SharePoint and Onedrive for Business, and I use Onedrive personal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About ten days ago I mistakenly tried to install SharePoint Designer 2013, which brought with it a lot of things that caused "incompatible versions of Office" problems. I tried to do a RESTORE, but the system could not complete it (a file was missing?).&nbsp;
 So I uninstalled it, then went through looking for Designer-related things to turn off. That at least got rid of the incompatible Office messages every time I'd start Word, Excel, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But... now when I SAVE in any Office app, a box comes up with "Getting available content and file types". This goes away after about a minute, but this seems to be SharePoint related and I'm not saving files to SharePoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Mike</p>

<p>Well, duh. Seems that this is related to having put a file in a shared Onedrive for Business folder, and having said "share with others for editing." This turned that Office sharing feature on for both Onedrive personal and business. (our Business Onedrive
 is part of our SharePoint cloud.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I think most of this has been solved, and it probably didn't have anything to do with the attempt to install and then remove Designer.</p>

<p>Hi Jodi,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the xbox 360 dashboard is not customizable. You cannot physically change where the panels are on the dashboard. Therefore you cant change where the netflix panel is. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi Megan,
<br />
<br />I‚Äôm sorry to hear that you have encountered this issue. 
<br />
<br />However, if you didn‚Äôt use your Skype account for a long time and didn‚Äôt purchase Skype products, it means that your payment method was used by another person to buy Skype products.
<br />
<br />If you need more information, refer to the following support article, please:

<h2>            Internet not able to connect through Wifi, DNS Server issue</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Internet commection</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop has Windows 10. Things went fairly well until I installed Kaspersky. I quickly uninstalled it. Problems started with my wifi. When I start up there is no internet signal avail. Sometimes I can't open the settings for wifi, sometimes I can. I can't
 really do anything. When I trouble shoot it finds no problems. Now suddenly it found a problem. The report says its the DNS server. There are other pc's in the house, all of which work just fine. After trying to open settings a few times, it restarts on me.
 After restart I am online. That does not sound like the providers problem.?</p>

d.&nbsp;Have you installed all pending windows update on your computer&nbsp;&nbsp; (Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.)</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you are receiving an error message prompting that ‚ÄúDNS server is not responding, it could be an issue due to TCP/IP settings which may not be configured properly on the computer. It could also be due to any sort of malware or virus on the

<p><span><span>b) Type the following commands and press Enter after each command:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>ipconfig /flushdns</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>ipconfig /release</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>ipconfig /renew </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>reset TCP/IP settings on the computer and check if it helps.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 sign-in issue. password not accepted</h2>
                    This morning I booted up my laptop. The Filter Keys dialogue box opened, which was odd. I can click out of it, but it doesn't matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I try to log in, Windows will not accept my password. I am locked out of my computer. I have tried opening in safe
 mode, but that also requires a password, but will not accept my password. Also my laptop is not recognizing any entries from its own keyboard. I am using an external keyboar, as I always have. Any ideas about how&nbsp; can get onto my laptop?

    <title>Problem with Missing Direct X and Microsoft.NET Framework 3.5 Service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> faykrup  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Missing Direct X and Microsoft.NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 &#38; .NET Framework 3.5 family update. Error code 57</h2>
                    I too am having the same error code 57 when I try and download the Microsoft.NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 &amp; .NET Framework 3.5 family update, and when I went into my control panal/Uninstall or Change Program, it shows that I don't even have the Framework
 in there at all. Why?<br />
I'm also missing my Direct X...I found that out when I tried to play my Sims 2 game. I can't play it without the Direct X.<br />
I have the StartUp disks for this laptop, and had to Reboot the whole system at one time, this is when I have been having the following problems.<br />
What can I do?<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p>Step #1 =&gt; Before doing anything else, write down what .NET Framework versions are currently installed:</p>
<p>How to determine which versions of the .NET Framework are installed and whether service packs have been applied<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785</a></p>
<p>Step #2 =&gt; Now see Resolution Method 2 in this related KB article: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923100</a></p>
<p>After running the .NET Framework Cleanup Tool, reinstall all .NET Framework versions (but only the ones you wrote down in #1 above) manually using the download links on the page then run Windows Update manually to install security updates for same.</p>
<p>NB: If you remove .NET Framework 3.5 (SP1) using the tool, reinstalling .NET Framework 3.5 will also install .Net Framework 2.0 SP2 and 3.0 SP2; then Windows Update will offer .NET Framework 3.5 SP1.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT! =&gt; If you remove .NET Framework 3.5 (SP1), reinstall your .NET Framework versions in the following order:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. .Net Framework 3.5, then...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. .Net Framework 1.1, then...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. .Net Framework 1.1 SP1</p>

            <p>For those users who see the Kind property marked as "document" instead of "picture", this is what is causing your pictures to not show up in the Photos app. To further investigate this, please answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When did this start happening for you? </p>
<p>2. Did this start happening&nbsp;after installing a certain app? What photo/document software have you installed on the computer? During installation, apps can change registry values.</p>
<p>3. Did this start happening&nbsp;after upgrading to 8.1? After a&nbsp;fresh install of Windows? Did it occur after installing updates from Windows Update? The most likely case is that an app got installed that changes the Kind for these types of files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix this, you could try uninstalling the app that was installed just before this behavior started. You could also try changing the Kind property for each filetype you own. To do that, perform the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Launch the Registry Editor by launching search (Windows key + S) and typing in "regedit", and clicking the first result "regedit.exe".</p>
<p>2. In the left navigation pane, navigate to the folder HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\KindMap</p>
<p>3. Find the filetype(s) your images are of in the&nbsp;right pane listing&nbsp;all known filetypes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Right-click on the filetype and click Modify.</p>
<p>5. In the Value data field, change the word "document" to "picture" (do not include quotation marks), then click OK. Repeat this process for any additional filetypes that aren't showing up.</p>
<p>6. Close Registry Editor.</p>
<p>7. Launch the Photos app and check to see if your photos are now appearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to restore default libraries and rebuild the system index if you are still not seeing a change after performing the above steps. To restore default libraries:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Launch File Explorer (Winkey+E).</p>
<p>2. Click the View tab at the top of the window.</p>
<p>3. Click the Navigation pane button and make sure the "Show libraries" option is selected.</p>
<p>4. Below, in the Navigation pane, expand the Libraries tab.</p>
<p>5. Right-click on the Pictures library and click Properties.</p>
<p>6. Click the Restore Defaults button.</p>
<p>7. Click Apply, then OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To rebuild the index:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Launch search (Windows key +&nbsp;S) and type "Indexing Options", and choosing the first result.</p>
<p>2. In the Indexing Options window, click the Advanced button.</p>
<p>3. Click the Rebuild option.</p>
<p>4. Let the computer run for a while without touching it while the index is rebuilt (interacting with your computer during this greatly slows it down).</p>
<p>5. Launch the Photos app and check to see if your photos are now appearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know the answers to the earlier questions I asked so we can prevent other users<br />
from hitting this problem, and let us know if the steps listed fix your problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Adam</p>

            Same issue App shows folders no photos. &nbsp;I scrolled through all threads&nbsp;and tired all the suggestions about kind and regedit and reindex. Nothing worked UNTIL I renamed the folder containing the pictures. Viola!! The photo app displayed and opened the
 photos. All I did to rename was add an "x" to the folder name. A few weeks ago I did post this issue on the Libra community. The only reply I got was a snarky one from someone who seemed offended that I posed a question about compatibility of the app and Libre.&nbsp;
 Hope this helps. I saw one other person in the thread fixed theirs the same way. It's easy enough to try.

            <p>Troubleshooting these activation/not genuine whatever posts would sure be a lot easier if a few questions were asked:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the system used to work properly what do you think happened to it since that last time it did work properly?</p>
<p>Did you do some kind of upgrade, downgrade, windows update, repair install, new install, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was there some issue you were troubleshooting prior to this incident because it looks like you are missing an important folder on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Errors that end in 0003 are "Path/Directory not found" errors so it appears the Windows Activation Technology folder and contents are missing on your system:</p>

<h2>            shift key writes x and w</h2>
                    Hi, I'm having a problem with my shift keys the left one writes x and the right one writes w. Also when caps lock is on if i press s it brings up a + and opens dialogue boxes. I've tried turning off sticky keys, running virus scans and restoring my computer
 to a previous date but nothings worked. I've also checked that all my language settings are correct. im using windows 7. if anyone has any ideas on how to fix this it would be helpful Thanks

<h2>            Xbox Account bands</h2>
                    <p>Ok my&nbsp; Question is you permanently suspended people in the past for whatever what if they changed. What if people got one last chance to have a fresh restart. Ive seen the post unband me. Alot people get reported for no reason and your so called investigation
 sucks. Girl gets harassed says <strong>[mod removed-profanity]</strong> off seriously people have a right to defend themselves. Why band people like that. Why not let people earn it back just take all the modded crap out. Reporting and blocking doesn't work
 because you don't even bother talking to us in person or have enforcement team number because these guys dont deserve jobs for simple reason they cant even treat people the way you want to be treated and say policy stuff. You know enforcement team will cause
 everyone to leave xbox forever and no customers no people no real honesty instead of bot messages</p>

<p>Actually you do have a right to defend yourself HOWEVER this does NOT give you the right to break the rules as long as you follow the rules</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have the tools to defend yourself</p>
<p>Set.contacts to friends only and block and mute</p>
<p>Dont retailiate</p>
<p>It is that simple</p>
<p>It isnt a license to break the rules</p>
<p>Everything that occurs on xbox live nust be rated E for everyone</p>
<p>It doesnt matter who started it everyone who breaks the rules will be punished when reported</p>
<p>And yes a police officer and your teachers will tell you the same</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes and you can use your Skype for Windows 10 to send SMS. Also,&nbsp;you can send an SMS text message to almost any number, as long as it's text-enabled. Most mobiles and some landlines can receive SMS text messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information on how to send SMS, please go to this link <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA3591/how-do-i-send-an-sms-from-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>If you need a patch you would have to get that from the company that makes the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, Try To Troubleshoot Compatibility<br />
<br />
This can help with some (but not all) programs:<br />
1) Uninstall the program if it's already installed. Then when you install/reinstall it instead of double clicking on the install file right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"<br />
2) Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next windows click "Start the Program" to install it.<br />
3) After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some programs may not be able to run in windows 7.<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t change delivery optimization service propreties - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> user654654  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t change delivery optimization service propreties</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have accepted that Microsoft doesn't care about low bandwith users and this is also partly a way for me to vent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I want to ask why I suddenly can't change this services propreties. I used to be able to set it to "deactivated" and It'd be fine until I restart the PC (the very fact, that it just reactivates is kind of **** up). But Since I updated to Version
 1809 (Build 17763.194) I get a "access denied", even though I open the Service-Tab as Administrator and can also change other services propreties without any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am honestly sick and tired of this. I already don't like Microsofts meddling on my system but then it also kills my whole bandwith. This is MY PC and I want control over what it does and when it does it. If I wanted a system that just does what ever the
 **** it wants I'd buy a Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also deactivated everything I could in the delivery optimization menu inside the Windows Update menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware that it can also be controlled via GPO or a Reg-Key. I will most likely go for these workarounds but I predict it'll just get overwritten.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

            Hi User654654, try this registry fix, I hope it works for you . . 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Click View and make sure 'Address Bar' is turned on
<br />
<br />Paste this into the Address Bar at the top and hit Enter
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\DeliveryOptimization\Config
<br />
<br />In the right hand pane, double click DODownloadMode
<br />
<br />Set its value data to one of the following numeric values (only enter the number):
<br />
<br />Try 0 first and see if that gets re-enabled, if so, try another value . . .
<br />
<br />0 = off
<br />
<br />1 = On but local network only
<br />
<br />2 = On, local network private peering only
<br />
<br />3 = On local network and Internet
<br />
<br />99 = simply download mode
<br />
<br />100 = bypass mode       
        </p>
