<h2>            Computer crashes after 5 minutes or less</h2>
                    I recently decided I wanted to upgrade to windows 10, but to do so I would need to do some updates. All the updates installed fine except for one, the service pack. It claimed it was because of corrupt files. So I used the command prompt to scan my files
 (sfc /scannow) it said it found some errors and would fix them once the computer was restarted. I restarted my computer and it crashed after 3-5 mins. of use. It has continued to crash. Luckily I can use it in safe mode, but it will occasionally crash as well.
 Please help, I really want my computer back. :(

<h2>            How do you change an alias if you cannot verify your email&#63;</h2>
                    I have an email account that was deactivated a long time ago and it is not provided by outlook or any other microsoft related programs. There is no way to recover it and I cannot change my alias because I can't verify the email that is already associated
 with my account. I have tried multiple times to fix this problem in the past with some employees but they do not seem to know how to fix it. I need major help addressing this issue because it restricts the accessibility of the account. I also have tried to
 rename my alias as the supposed "alternative" that this website tells me but it says that the service is unavailable and I'm still stuck with an inactive email. A solution would be wonderful because this has gone on for too long.

It says ,,Cant download hurks redemption".Plus that before the first time it started downloading it asked me in which storage i want to download it and i clicked on usb 3 where i am maxed with 100% progres but how i can see now it is trying to be downloaded at the basic memory storage of my xbox 360 where i have 0.56% progres but anyways&nbsp;the first issue is more important. The hurks file is about 108kb (just saying if that can help). Please help me cuz i gave money for that and yeah. Thanks from now &lt;3333</p>

<p>Thanks for the fast reply, i tried the tipps you gave me execpt reseting the computer, sadly nothing helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And i would like not to reset again my computer because i just got a new Harddrive, also its just happend already a few times now, it feels like windows have a structure problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because i though it would be a common Windows 10 problem i searched in the internet and followed these tips :&nbsp;https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fix-100-disk-usage-in-task-manager-improve-pc-performance-on-windows-10/&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed that the process "MsMpEng.exe" is the reason why i have these spikes, atleast it looks heavly like that, in the Resource Monitor its the processor wich takes the most bits to do something.</p>

<p>Thank you for that information. Performing a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="How to perform a clean boot in Windows">clean boot</a></strong>
 usually isolates which program is possibly causing the high disk usage issue. If the issue continues even if the device is in a
<strong>clean</strong> <strong>boot</strong> state, it may already be a hardware issue. Should this be the case, I recommend getting in touch with the device manufacturer for further assistance.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for providing us the troubleshooting steps that you have done so far. This will help us narrow down the issue. Just to verify, may we know what is the make and model of your computer? In the mean time, try installing all the available Windows Updates
 including Optional Updates and see if it helps. You can also try to uninstall and reinstall the latest display driver from the computer manufacturer's website.<br />
<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.

<p>Thank you for providing the information. Have you already tried reinstalling the display driver from the manufacturer's website? Since you're using a desktop, you might not see the Change brightness slider anymore because you can change the brightness using
 the buttons on the external monitor instead.</p>

</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the issue happen with one contact or multiple contacts? </p>
<p>
</p><p>One possible reason is because you are signed in to the wrong account. With that being said, I highly suggest you to sign out and as you sign back in, manually type your Skype Name instead of your email address.
</p>
<p>

<p>This didnt work. It's the same for all contacts but there is just one in particular I am concerned with as it was my late father which contained videos of him. I'm sure you understand why I am anxious to get this back and how frustrating it is that your
 app update is what has apparently deleted it. I hope you can resolve it asap and I look forward to hearing from you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Ashley,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's really odd that your computer doesn't continue to restart and even got stuck on the restarting screen. However, since you're using a laptop, we suggest that you remove and put the battery back in your laptop, then boot it up again. Once your computer
 boots up completely, we suggest that you restart your computer and see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your feedback.</p>

    <title>Does Windows 8 turn itself off&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Does Windows 8 turn itself off&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Last week I upgraded my PC from Windows 7 to Windows 8 Pro. I've noticed twice now, that in the morning my PC is turned off. Normally I leave my PC on 24/7; I just log off my profile. As far as I know, no one is turning the PC off, so I'm wondering if Windows
 8 is doing it by itself? Is it some new power setting?</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response. I've checked the power settings and it is plugged in it never turns off. If it is running off of a battery, then it will go to sleep after 15 minutes. I do have it on a UPS; does it consider that to be a battery? I want it to
 go to sleep, and even shut down, if it is running strictly off of the UPS, but I would assume that if the UPS has power from the house current, that it wouldn't signal that it is running strictly off of the UPS. Am I wrong about that?</p>

            <p>OK, this is becoming a <u><em><strong>very big issue</strong></em></u> for me. I left my desktop on while I was gone running some errands. Two hours, max. The stupid thing had turned itself off. I've checked the power settings and it is set to NEVER turn
 off, both when it's plugged in and when it's running on battery.&nbsp; What's going on???</p>

<br />After so, right-click on it again, choose Properties, then ensure startup type is on Automatic. 
<br />
<br />.
<br />Did you  Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter?
<br />
<br />On Cortana's search box, type, "Troubleshooting" &gt; left-click on the result &gt; Hardware and Sound &gt; open Hardware and Devices and follow the on-screen instructions.
<br />
<br />Hope it helps

            Hi PooyanMahmoodi
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try following and check after each step
<br />
<br />1. Run Bluetooth Troubleshooter
<br />Type troubleshoot in Windows Starts Search box (Cortana) &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Click Bluetooth and run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />2. Take actions related to Bluetooth driver
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Bluetooth &gt; Right click on entry below &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Rollback the Driver 
<br />Click Properties &gt; Go to Driver tab &gt; If there is rollback option, click it
<br />
<br />B. Uninstall the Driver 
<br />Uninstall &gt; Reboot the computer &gt; The driver will be installed automatically when you restart
<br />
<br />C. Update driver from manufacturer's website
<br />Your Bluetooth drive may need to be reinstalled from computer manufacturer's website. If you need my help to locate the driver on the website, please let me know following -
<br />A. What is your computer's make and model? For example Lenovo T470
<br />B. What is the Windows version and build? To check this, type winver in Windows Start Search (Cortana) box and click winver.
<br />
<br />3. Head to following Microsoft help on Bluetooth issue and execute the steps there
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/windows-10-fix-bluetooth-problems-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/...</a>
<br />
<br />4. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />Built-in : Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Click Windows Update &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Guided Walk though - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />5. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br />

            Hi Pooyan
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />I see some important updates for your model I recommend you apply:
<br />
<br />BIOS Update June 2019
<br /><a href="https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/N550JK/N550JKAS210.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/N550JK/N5...</a>
<br />
<br />I noticed the last Bluetooth driver update was from 2014. 
<br />
<br />If updating the BIOS does not work, try reinstalling the drive using compatibility mode:

<h2>            internal Hard drive locked by bitlocker &#40;i have the password&#41; but it asks for a numeric code before i can get into windows</h2>
                    <p>So to be short, I encrypted my drive, set a password (which I remember). then after I booted my pc from a cd to run a "unnamed program", I restarted the computer and tried to go back into windows and i got a screen asking for the bitlocker code. I thought
 I had saved it on my outlook account (im sure I did) but when i logged into my outlook account, it said that no bitlocked code was saved!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>is my drive bricked?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have everything backedup on my external drive. so even if you dont know how to solve my problem, you might know if i can format the drive some how.</p>

In case the key is nowhere to be found you may try to write zeros to that drive which will wipe any and all data from it including the OS, system partitions and everything else. You can then install a fresh copy of the OS (if you need one on that drive) and
 restore the data from your backup (kudos for having one!).&nbsp;</p>

If you don't need the data you may be able to fill the drive with zeros using an application. This will remove any and all data from the drive and basically bring it to its factory state. Some encryption types don't allow doing this so you may give it a try
 and see if it works.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> gordontate  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Interrupts 100&#37;</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new (bought 3 weeks ago) Acer Aspire 3 - A314, SSD laptop.&nbsp; &nbsp;On 20/12/2018,&nbsp; Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1803 for x64 Systems (KB4483234) was successfully installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning, when I switched on, I noticed it took 5 minutes or so to boot up and when it eventually did manage it I found I could not&nbsp;</p>
<p>open any apps or websites.&nbsp; I just saw the small&nbsp; circle of doom.&nbsp; I managed to shut down on the power button and restarted but got the same result.&nbsp; &nbsp;Eventually, I got Task Master to open and noticed that System Interrupts was showing 100%.&nbsp; I noticed the
 fan did not seem to be running during all of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 4 or so attempts at shutting down and back on it eventually booted up in normal time and now seems to be running ok.</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />I recommend using SFC. During the analysis carried out by SFC on the files of the system, it will check the versions of each one of them and in case it finds one that has been overwritten or is damaged, the tool itself will proceed to recover a good version of that file to replace it. It is a tool based on the command prompt that offers several commands to perform these tasks of file analysis and recovery.
<br />
<br />Check this link, it is to run (Scannow and Dism) that are used to repair Windows system files.

            Hi Gordon
<br />
<br />This does not indicate any underlying issue with your PC, most likely a Windows Update had not completed correctly and your repeated shutting down prompted the completion of that update process. 
<br />
<br />The symptoms you have described are very unusual and most likely will never return, however, it is hard to know with the Windows Updates . . .

<p>Thank you all for your responses to my questions.&nbsp; I ran Dism and though I had never used it before and was therefore unsure if I was using it correctly, it showed no problems.&nbsp; I thne ran sfc /SCANNOW which I had run on a different machine some years ago.&nbsp;
 This time it seemed to get stuck at 61% so I left it to see what happened.&nbsp; When I went back&nbsp; the laptop had itself left SCANNOW and so there was no report visible.&nbsp; I did a bit of searching and learned, as I&nbsp; understand, that reports go into a CBS.Log.</p>
<p>I managed, after a couple of attempts, to get into the log and it was showing a number of faults that left me feeling uneasy.&nbsp; &nbsp;I therefore took the bull by the horns and did a Windows Reset.&nbsp; I hope this has cleared all the faults that were probably present.
 I have since run another sfc /SCANNOW and this time I watched it get to 100% and it reported no faults (or whatever terminology it used) found.</p>
<p>Thank you all, once again, for your help and comments.</p>

<p>After doing a system restore, an error appeared in Event Viewer stating "the IP Helper Service terminated with the following error: The specified module could not be found." (Event ID 7023).&nbsp; It has appeared at every subsequent boot since then until I changed
 the service startup to manual instead of automatic.&nbsp; When I attempt to start IP Helper Service manually, I get "error 126 The specified module could not be found."&nbsp; I checked the associated DLL file name value for ServiceDLL in the registry, and the iphlpsvc.dll
 is in the proper location (system32 folder).&nbsp; Also, all dependencies are running.&nbsp; Why isn't the IP Helper Service starting and how can I get it to recognize the iphlpsvc.dll?<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you remember making changes to your computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>Boot the computer in clean boot and then check:
<b>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7
</b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p><b>Note</b>: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow step 7 to boot the computer in normal startup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>Try to do a system file checker on your computer and check for errors in the disc:
<b>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</b>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:
</b></p>
<p>Try to create a new user account and check if that works fine:

<h2>            Keyboard and mouse not working.</h2>
                    I installed a Kaspersky&nbsp;Antivirus&nbsp;update on my laptop and when I did my keyboard and mouse pad stopped working. I took my laptop to where I bought the laptop and the technician uninstalled Kaspesky Anitvirus and&nbsp;they still don't work. Is Windows 7 not
 compatible with Kaspersky Anitvirus? I was told it was a Windows software problem not a hardware problem. Is there a way to get my keyboard and mouse working again? Please help.

Receive no error messages just an intolerable delay in every aspect of the New Message.<br />

Please advise.<br />

Frankly, I'd return to plain ol' Mail if I could. Perhaps there is a way to reload Live Mail without losing everything?

<p>Gab es damals für die PS2 und eben auch&nbsp;für die Xbox. Außerdem war es für lange Zeit auch auf dem (deutschen)&nbsp;Xbox Live Marktplatz erhältlich, aber anscheinend hat man es entfernt. Von daher, lieber TE,&nbsp;folge Lösung 2 von OnkelTobi und besorg dir diesen

<p>Burnout 3 Takedown gab es für die alte XBox. Ich war bis jetzt der Meinung, dass die neue Version für die Xbox 360 nur als Download zur Verfügung stand. Irre ichm ich da? Oder kann man das Game wirklich für die 360 kaufen?</p>

<p>Na Burnout Revenge meinte ich nicht. Eigentlich meinte ich diesen Artikel</p>
<p><a href="http://www.speedmaniacs.com/News,Burnout-3-Takedown-Als-Xbox-Original-Titel-fuer-die-Xbox-360-Update,3213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.speedmaniacs.com/News,Burnout-3-Takedown-Als-Xbox-Original-Titel-fuer-die-Xbox-360-Update,3213</a></p>
<p>Den Artikel habe ich so verstanden, dass die Burnout Takedown "remastert" haben, so dass er auf der 360 spielbar ist (bessere Grafik und online gaming).</p>
<p>Was würde denn passieren, wenn ich eine alte Burnout Takedown DVD in die Xbox 360 lege? Kann er das abspielen (man muss bestimmt einen Emulator installieren)? Und wenn ja, dann ist doch die Grafik auf niedrigstem Niveau.?</p>
<p>Meine Hoffnung war ja, dass die Grafik aufgewertet wurde. Aber das werde ich nu nicht rausfinden.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Also durch den Emulator der sobald du das Spiel einlegst runtergeladen wird, kann die Grafik ein wenig aufgehübscht sein.</p>
<p>Remastert ist da gar nichts dran.</p>
<p>Die Online Modi funktionieren nicht mehr da für alle Xbox 1 Spiele die Server vor längerer Zeit abgeschaltet wurden.</p>
<p>Ich kann dir allerdings Revenge empfehlen da es um einiges besser als Takedown ist und auch für die 360 gemacht ist.</p>
<p>Solltest du allerdings das Takedown noch als Xbox 1 Spiel haben dann läuft das genauso und du sparst dir auch noch Geld da du es nicht nochmal kaufen musst.</p>

<p>Danke für die Antwort. Das werde ich dann probieren. Revenge macht auch Spaß, doch mag ich die Kreuzungscrashes bei Burnout Takedown so. Ist halt Nostalgie. ;-)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I hope someone can help. I am unable to play any of my home videos ( from new cell ) on my 6 day old Hewlett Packard Pavilion PC with Windows7- in any location. I added RealPlayer in hopes it would allow it but it doesn't. I was unable to play downloaded
 cell vids on my previous (Windows Vista) HP PC as well . On my new PC - Cell videos are only playable in ReaPlayer, visually but no audio at all. They will not open at all in WMP. (I do have vidioes on my Toshiba camcorder and they do play fine.&nbsp;I tried to
 check for the codec type but this is what I see - - - - - - . I am also unable to play any audio files at all from my cell downloads. Does anyone have any suggestions, I am not very PC intelligent either I'm sorry to say. Any suggestions would be appreciated
 - Thank You!! (Below are the 3 vids I tried to check the codec on.)</p>

<p>This is what I get when I try to open an audio in WMP library: Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just opening audio&nbsp;in WMP without library I get a&nbsp;this message&nbsp;- <span>
The selected file has an extention (.qcp) that is not recognied by Windows Media Player, but the Player may still be able to play it. Because the extension in unknown by the player, you should be sure that the file comes from a trustworthy source.

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<ol>
<li>Is the issue specific to a file or file format? </li><li>Are you facing issues playing other files as well?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file.
</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You might encounter this error message for one of the following <strong>reasons</strong>:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a)&nbsp;&nbsp; The file type is supported by the Player, but the file was compressed by using a codec that is not supported by the Player.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>b)&nbsp;&nbsp; The file might have been encoded by using a codec that is not supported by Windows Media Player. If this is the case, Windows Media Player cannot play the file.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Windows media player will only play the files and videos only if it supports that file type.</div>
<div>Windows Media Player 12 has built-in support for many popular audio and video formats—including
<strong>3GP, AAC, AVCHD, MPEG-4, WMV, and WMA.</strong> It also supports most<strong> AVI, DivX, MOV</strong>, and
<strong>Xvid </strong>files. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please refer the below article that gives you Information about the Multimedia file types that Windows Media Player supports.</div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316992" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316992</strong></a><strong>
<br />
</strong>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the files are not supported by Windows media player then you need to use some third party player which supports that file format.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE DISCLAIMER:</strong></div>
<div>Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third

            If you want to view the videos and also create DVDs <br />
using Windows DVD Maker...it may be worth a try to <br />
convert the videos to the .WMV format. Once the files<br />
are converted they will be much easier to use.<br />
<br />
There are many converters available on the net...some <br />
free...some retail.<br />
<br />
The following freeware converter is just an example:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Format Factory (freeware)<br />
<a href="http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Format_Factory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Format_Factory</a><br />
(the 'direct link' is fastest download)<br />
(the file you want to download is : &gt;FFSetup290.zip&lt;)<br />
(FWIW...when installing...you may want to uncheck<br />
'all' the boxes on the final screens)<br />
(Windows XP / Vista / 7)<br />
<br />
First you will need to unzip the file or just open the<br />
folder and drag &gt;FFSetup290.exe&lt; out of the folder<br />
and drop it on your desktop. Left click it to install.<br />
<br />
Next...after downloading and installing Format<br />
Factory...you may want to open the program and<br />
left click the 'Option' button on the toolbar and<br />
select an 'Output Folder' / Apply / OK.<br />
(this is where you will find your files after they<br />
are converted)<br />
<br />
Drag/drop your video clips onto the main screen...<br />
<br />
Select 'All to WMV' / OK...<br />
<br />
Click...Start...on the toolbar...<br />
<br />
That should do it...<br />
<br />
Good luck...<br />

<span>FULL</span>&nbsp; game!!! &nbsp; &nbsp; (I dont have my xbox wifi connecter right now)&nbsp;</p>
<span>FULL</span>&nbsp; game!!! &nbsp; &nbsp; (I dont have my xbox wifi connecter right now)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hook it up upstairs start the game but wait... Its not the full thing its only the trial version??? I bought the game the hard drive knows it, if I go to system storage and go to minecraft it says full game but when I start the game it loads as a trial.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I re downloaded it 2 times same issue. Will this be fixed or is it a 100% internet game?</p>

<p>most likely a 100% internet game...</p>
<p>this is like how the game Castle Crashers is</p>
<p>if i am not connected to the internet, my character data will NOT load because the data is stored ONLINE</p>
<p>also, because u downloaded it online, it will be seen as something u need to be connected to "online" to use i believe</p>
<p>many downloads are like that, usually to prevent achivement mess ups... for example, if u get an achivement offline, you (possibly) may not get that achivement on ur online profile.... hard to explain</p>
<p>but i believe its a part of all games</p>

<p>I play it offline. &nbsp;Maybe you need to play it once online to register a key or something hidden we don't see. &nbsp;I know the indie games must be played online, but all my arcade games seem to work offline.</p>

<p>What do you mean by "I set up my xbox up stairs"? &nbsp;Are you using another Xbox upstairs? Offline play is only allowed on the Xbox you originally downloaded the game, where the license for the game is on.</p>

<p>I bought the game on my dads xbox that is down stairs, On my account. I took his hard drive and brought my own xbox downstairs to replace my dads xbox so I can connect to the internet and redownload it. Would that be why? Im on my account and I redownloaded
 it on my own xbox..</p>

<p>That's the problem. &nbsp;Only one Xbox(your dad's) can have the license to play the full game offline. &nbsp;This is a security measure to prevent people from "stealing" the game to multiple offline Xboxes. &nbsp; &nbsp;So the only solution is to have your Xbox be connected
 to Live, or do a license transfer. &nbsp;Do you have separate accounts or do you share?</p>
<p>If you have separate accounts, basically all you do is go connect YOUR Xbox to Live, sign in with your account, and select the license transfer option. &nbsp; Read this page to learn more about it if you're unsure.

<p>
</p><p>I have no problem viewing and accessing messages within my windows mail.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The messages are not there? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Where are they as I have thousands in different subfolders which I can within the inbox on the windows mail, but none of these are within the folder within c:/.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">The folders you see in the program interface will not necessarily match the ones in the file system. The message store index keeps track of which messages are in which folder, and this varies quite a bit. Why do you want to see
 the files in the file system? It's not a good idea to perform any file operation on them there, because it will be invisible to the database indexer, which will get confused as a result.&nbsp;</p>

Andria, your instructions and images are for Windows Live Mail 2009, which is largely obsolete. It would be much better if you posted solutions for the current&nbsp;version until and unless it's established that the enquirer is using an old version.
