<h2>            Some of my keyboard keys will randomly stop working then start again every couple of minutes</h2>
                    <p>On my keyboard (it's not bluetooth), the A, L, K, Z, and : keys will all stop working at random and often annoying times. I'm talking in a matter of minutes they can work, not work, then work again. It's rather annoying because it's not like it's happening
 every so often it's every single time i'm typing I run into the problem (even now as I type this it's a problem that keeps coming up.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried restarting my laptop, blowing air and cleaning the keys by lifting them up. It's not that old of a computer and this is the first major issue i've ran into.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Not sure what topic to post this under, so I apologize if this isn't where it goes. It seems like this was the most reasonable place to post it especially considering i've never stepped foot in the microsoft forums before this.</p>

            <p>How old is 'not that old' ? Do you do a lot of typing ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- You may want to check the web site for the mfg of your laptop to see if there are any newer keyboard drivers
</p>
<p>than what you have installed available.</p>
<p>It's also possible an update (large updates such as 1703 in partiular ? ) has corrupted the driver, so reinstalling
</p>
<p>may be worth a try regardless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Apparently having <em>Filter Keys</em> enabled is causing problems for some as well.</p>
<p>Go to Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Keyboard and turn off &gt; Filter Keys</p>
<p>(and any other setting you don't use, eg- Sticky keys can cause problems if you tend to rest on a key too long )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still no good ?</p>
<p>- Do you have a keyboard you can plug into the USB to verify if it's a hardware issue ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>.</p>

            <p>Not that old being I got this computer towards the end of 2016. (Maybe around August/September) I do a lot of typing however, I mean I can't really give an estimate but I spend most my day on my laptop if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First two didn't work, and the last one proved that it's a hardware issue. I did some digging (because it's a very.. peeving issue..) I think I found a solution which involves reshaping the ribbon for the keyboard a bit, which i'll do in the morning since
 it's kind of late and then post if it worked or not.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pen</h2>
                    Hi, I recently bought the surface pen thinking it would work for my hp pavilion x360 convertible pc. The pen connects fine through Bluetooth, but wont let me draw or write anything. Also it says when you click the top button it should bring notes up, but
 for my case it brings up sticky notes. It&nbsp;wont let me draw or click anything on it, I was just wondering if it will ever let me use it to draw, write or just even use as a stylus.

            hi Boorsman did you try reducing the screen size from&nbsp;the square touch panel where&nbsp;you move the arrow with your fingers? put one finger on the right upper corner and one on the left bottom corner and slide your fingers to the center at the same time but&nbsp;do
 not apply&nbsp;pressure. that worked for me on a sony vaio with windows 8 and I hop it will work for you. good luck!!&nbsp;

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is only happening with that one application then it is a problem the developer of that application needs to fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a windows application is developed properly, it will automatically size to the visible screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Regards</p>

<p>See if you can put it into a Cascade windows.&nbsp; That would set it to normal mode and resize it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Right-click in the Taskbar.&nbsp; Minimize all other windows you do not want involved in the operation first.</p>

            try the control button and the plus or&nbsp; minus to enlarge you would use the control and plus button together to lower the screen use the control button and the minus , works great for windows 8.1 and maybe universal for all windows ..

    <title>Tracking a stolen laptop via my Microsoft Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brambleshire  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tracking a stolen laptop via my Microsoft Account</h2>
                    A few months ago I left behind my laptop in an airport terminal. I was unable to recover it from the airline or any airport lost and founds.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I recently learned that you can should be able to view a devices last known location by logging in to your Microsoft account, but when I log in I see the device, but no information about its location. When I click on "find my device" and "device info" it just
 tells me to "install the latest updates."<br />
<br />
It was only this September when I lost my laptop. Was this feature not available then? Why do I not have this functionality for this device? What does it mean?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<h2>            Updating from Windows 8 to 8.1 problems - update KB2871389 wont show up</h2>
                    I am currently running a Lenovo U400. &nbsp;It came with Windows 7, but i have since updated it officially (through Microsoft) to Windows 8. &nbsp;I am now trying to update it too windows 8.1<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, I cannot seem to find the update&nbsp;KB2871389 anywhere. &nbsp;It will not show up in Windows 8.1, and when trying to manually install it, it says it does not fit my supported computer. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What is going on, shouldn't every computer running windows 8 update to 8.1?</div>
                </div>

</p><p>I suggest you wait for some time before upgrading your U400 to 8.1. I have upgraded my U400 to 8.1 successfully but all Metro apps are crashing due to ATI Redon Graphics drivers issue. They still haven't released drivers for 8.1 specifically and this is
 affecting Metro apps.</p>

</p><p>To help in resolving your concern about the error you're receiving when doing a Remote Desktop session, try running a<strong> SFC scan</strong> to restore any corrupted files that may cause the error. If the SFC scan does not help, try running the
<strong>DISM </strong>in the same article and see if it helps.</p>

            Hi Jake, if you are using Skype on Windows 10, please try this:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Privacy - Camera
<br />
<br />Make sure 'Allow apps to access your Camera' is turned on and make sure Skype is also set to On

<p>Hi Jake,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that you have granted Access to your camera in computer Privacy settings, then restart Skype, and tap on the three dots next to your profile image in Skype. Open Settings, then Audio &amp; Video settings. If you see your camera there, you should be
 all set. :)</p>

<p>Hi Rozalia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This error occurs if a device that was previously connected to the computer is no longer connected. We suggest reconnecting the hardware device to the computer. If the issue persists, you may perform
 the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Run the Windows troubleshooter: <a href="http://aka.ms/diag_device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Find and fix problems with devices and hardware</a>. This will automatically diagnose and fix issues.</li><li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update the device drivers</a>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to update us with the result.</p>

            Hello this did not help at all. This laptop use to have the button to turn Bluetooth on and off. It is now missing in settings under Bluetooth and other devices. The paired devices all say that Bluetooth is turned off. I wish to know how to turn it back
 on.

<p>Hi! I have same laptop, same problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said in some other threads here, bluetooth disappears after getting newest update from Windows Update. When I reinstalled BIOS bluetooth was back, but then system update itself and bluetooth is lost again - "not connected to the computer", as if it
 was something you can plug in and out.....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is your newest update, which I can't stop from installing because there is no such option in Win10 Home :/</p>
<p>
</p><p>And one more thing -&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you updating us. If the persists, we would like to know if you have checked Device Manager to make sure you have the latest Bluetooth drivers installed by going to
<strong>Device Manager</strong> &gt; expand Bluetooth &gt; right-click Bluetooth radio &gt;
<strong>Update driver</strong> &gt; <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have updated your Windows 10 computer prior to the issue, we suggest that you try
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15290/windows-connect-bluetooth-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
pairing the Bluetooth device again.</a> If a Bluetooth device uses a customized Bluetooth profile, the device might not work after an update.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Bluetooth devices that use one of the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10568/windows-10-supported-bluetooth-profiles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
supported Bluetooth profiles</a> should still be paired and work properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also run the Bluetooth troubleshooter by going to
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; security</strong> &gt; <strong>Troubleshoot
</strong>&gt; Under Find and fix other problems, select <strong>Bluetooth </strong>&gt;
<strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>. </p>

<p>No help. That's not the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As everyone has said above, the WHOLE BLUETOOTH function has disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, there is no way to fix or find a way to access bluetooth settings. They are GONE from Device Manager etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows behaves and comments like the PC has NO bluetooth on it anymore - not only connections, but NO hardware in the eyes of the operating system.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue with my HP Spectre 13.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The entire bluetooth hardware disappeared after a Windows 10 update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to fix the problem, I disinstalled the update but I was forced to setup again all my laptop with a new Windows 10 installation. After that, the bluetooth was working well. But again, an update of Windows 10 doesn't show my bluetooth hardware on my
 device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's sure that our bluetooth problem is due to this Windows 10 update. Please, fix it asap.</p>
<p>

<p>My brother laptop (HP Spectre 13'') seems to have the same issue after last windows update (please fix it).</p>
<p>I succesfully solved this way (don't know if this can be considered a "general" solution, but in my case has worked):</p>
<ol>
<li>Downloaded and installed last bluetooth drivers updates from Intel update site</li><li>Reboot the PC</li><li>Nothing different (bluetooth not working)</li><li>Brutally shutdown the PC (holding down power on button)</li><li>Turn on the PC</li><li>Bluetooth is back and works.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone else succeed using this trick, I'm glad being helpful.</p>

<p>The same thing happened to me after the last update, which I had to force-restart.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this is the same issue for everybody, but what led me to a solution after bluetooth disappeared from everywhere, including the device manager (although it eventually reappeared as a hidden device after I troubleshot the buggy Windows update),
 was that I had another bug, which I dismissed as unrelated at first, but turned out it wasn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the hidden bluetooth elements in the device manager gave a Code 45 - device not connected to computer. Updating drivers, restarting services, uninstalling did nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But under USB devices I also had a USB device with no name and a Code 43. Hardware troubleshooting couldn't fix it. It occurred to me to check online, eventually, and as it turns out bluetooth devices are treated like USB devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I uninstalled the USB devices in the device manager. I uninstalled the top one and they all disappeared, and - more importantly - the hidden bluetooth devices disappeared at the same time. Then I shut down (not restarted) my laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I powered back on, everything was back, all the bluetooth and USB devices, no error codes of any kind. Even my paired devices didn't have to be reinstalled. No problem since.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone.</p>

            AFAIK, there are no CDs that are as large as 1.4 GB.&nbsp; Either your original disk is a DVD or your copy software is confused.<br />
<br />
Assuming that what you have is a DVD and (a) you have a DVD burner, (b) your copy software is capable of copying DVDs, and (c) the DVD isn't copy protected, then yes, you can make a copy of it.<br />
<br />
Put the original disk in your reader, open My Computer, select the drive, and select Properties.&nbsp; That should tell you the size of the disk and how much data is on it.<br />

    <title>Several 100MB of traffic on a FIN_WAIT_2 port - process long gone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m&#246;rre noseshine  say:</h3>
<h2>            Several 100MB of traffic on a FIN_WAIT_2 port - process long gone</h2>
                    <p>I have 100s of Megabytes of traffic for a loooooooong time (10-20 minutes) after the process has gone on the port that used to belong to that process and which now is in FIN_WAIT_2. I know some people will say "impossible", but here is the proof - I used
 to be a network guy, even doing (Linux) kernel programming of TCP code (Firewall) so I know at least a little bit what I'm talking about even if that was some time ago. I feel I have to say that because any previous such reports/discussions that I could find
 where met with incredulity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Wireshark so I can SEE the traffic, and it is all on the port that "netstat -an" lists as "FIN_WAIT_2".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background: This is about twitch.tv and Video-On-Demand (not live) streams. I'm using the latest Flash and Firefox. Even when I make sure (process list) that both Firefox and the Flash plugin are gone network traffic continues to max out my 16Mbit connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The connections (which are TCP -&gt; HTTP) are to "Level 3 Communications" (a company) data centers, which is where twitch hosts them (I verified all of this, and besides, as I said, I can see the traffic with Wireshark).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>How can I prevent this useless traffic? How is that possible anyway? Yes I know it's ultimately not Windows' fault, but I have no access to twitch video-on-demand servers nor to the code of their flash video player. I *could* manually add a Firewall block
 for that port, but I'm not even sure that would prevent the server from continuing to send the packets, only that I don't see them - and this "denial of service attack" on my Internet connection would still be there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have found this, and there is one sentence that gives me pause:</p>
<p>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff550023%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>"If an acceptable TCP segment arrives on the connection before the FIN_WAIT_2 timer expires, the offload target restarts the FIN_WAIT_2 timer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since there ARE such packets coming form the server (lots of them!) it seems that may be what happens, and the FIN_WAIT_2 timer doesn't expire?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Could be this is not twitch.tv specific, since I've been watching my system more closely I have noticed that it may be a general issue with playing video streams through Flash (on Firefox?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may be more wide-spread, here is a similar report for videos on Chrome (they don't say HTML5 or Flash videos?):

<p>Good Morning all my fellow 360 gamers,</p>
<p>I've just gone an ordered myself a nice new 3D TV. Does anyone know what 360 games support full stereoscopic 3D?</p>
<p>Obviously I want to make the most out of my new purchase, so gaming through 3 dimensions would be a start :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>A couple of my mates have gone 3D, their verdict was - "ace for films... off-putting for games".... but then they are grumpy old gits.</p>

<p>Had a 50" 3DTV since last November, not really for games, I'd say. It just makes Black Ops about 10 times harder &amp; will send your head spinning within 20 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's much better used for Sky 3D where things actually jump at you during movies/sport. Though I often get a headache still after watching 60 mins of football in 3D.</p>

<p>The 'gimmicky' 3D films, such as Piranha 3D, look terrible, but Alice in Wonderland, Avatar, etc look fantastic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They're certainly not a waste of money (As long as you haven't bought it solely for games, and have the ability to watch 3D TV shows)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Samsung, which all have a built in feature to 'upscale' normal TV to 3D (much like the SD &gt; HD upscaling) So although you don't get things jumping out of the screen, there is a good sense of depth, which can also be used with any game, too. (I think
 Sony 3DTV's also have these feature)</p>

<p>Il messaggio l'ho letto anche prima ma non saprei darti una risposta.</p>
<p>Certo che da quello che dici pare un problema di MW3 e non tuo.</p>

<p>Grazie uait ... Anche per me il problema e' su MW3.</p>
<p>La cosa strana e' che se così e' , visto che il problema lo ho solamente con MW3 , nessuno abbia notato problemi.</p>
<p>Se c'è un problema lo noterebbero in molti , e sicuramente lo scriverebbero su qualche forum.</p>
<p>Grazie comunque ancora uait.</p>

<p>A me questo lavoro lo faceva saltuariamente su MW2 (altra piattaforma) senza però mandarmi messaggi come a te.</p>
<p>Forse proverei a cancellare il profilo e riscaricarlo, ma aspetta l'opinione di qualcuno più esperto.</p>

<p>Grazie luchador ...</p>
<p>Un'altra cosa che mi sono dimenticato di scrivere ...</p>
<p>Quando lancio il gioco e vado nella modalità multiplayer sta tanto a recuperare il profilo.</p>
<p>La musica va a scatti e anche le animazioni del menu ( la nebbia sullo sfondo ) , e il cd gira come un pazzo.</p>
<p>Il gioco lo ho installato nell'hd.</p>
<p>Spesso riparte addirittura la presentazione ...</p>
<p>Ho notato che continuando a premere il tasto A non appena compare la schermata nel giro di massimo 10 secondi recupera il profilo online ... altrimenti devo aspettare che finisca di macinare ...</p>
<p>Questa cosa comunque me la ha sempre fatta da quando è uscito il gioco ...</p>

<p>Uguale a me con MW2. Alcuni giorni era proprio ingiocabile.</p>
<p>Da quanto ti fa questo scherzo? A me solitamente durava una giornata per poi sparire e ripresentarsi dopo circa una settimana.</p>
<p>Con MW3 online non ho quasi nessuna esperienza, quindi non posso fare paragoni.</p>
<p>EDIT: ricordo che quando si manifestava il problema, uscivo&nbsp;completamente dal gioco&nbsp;e rientravo nel multi&nbsp;accedendo ad internet non dal gioco&nbsp;ma dalla schermata iniziale della console. Qualche volta funzionava.</p>

<p>Mi rendo conto che&nbsp;la soluzione&nbsp;che ti ho dato è uguale al rimedio della nonna.</p>
<p>Altri consigli purtroppo non ne ho. Credo comunque che il problema sia legato esclusivamente al gioco.</p>

<p>Molti incolpano una patch.</p>
<p>Ricordi se poco prima di avere questi problemi hai scaricato qualche aggiornamento?</p>

<h2>            Several Service Control Manager Issues &#40;Event ID&#39;s 7000, 7009, 7011&#41;</h2>
                    Starting-up Windows first thing each day is slowly, well, getting slower.&nbsp; Went into the Event Log and wondering what may need to be done to fix/repair the following Service Control Manager issues:<br />
<br />
Event ID 7011: A timeout (30000 milliseconds) was reached while waiting for a transaction response from the SftService service.<br />
<br />
Event ID 7009: A timeout was reached (30000 milliseconds) while waiting for the Microsoft .NET Framework NGEN v4.0.30319_X86 service to connect. (This appears three times)<br />
<br />
Event ID 7009: A timeout (30000 milliseconds) was reached while waiting for a transaction response from the ShellHWDetection service. (This appears three times)<br />
<br />
Event ID 7000: The Dell Digital Delivery Service service failed to start due to the following error:
<br />
The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion.<br />
<br />
Are some of these related to the fact that I am not connected to the internet when firing-up my PC?<br />

            I agreed to the Windows 10 "upgrade." There have been so MANY problems since then. I consider myself to be very good at configuring software, but Windows 10 is a total "downgrade." So many great features in Windows 7 are gone, like FreeCell. And my taskbar
 refuses to autohide. And Microsoft won't let me use my own name for my own computer. And Microsoft changed my computer password to one of my email accounts and I had a few anxious hours getting it out of the password file on the LOCKED COMPUTER hard drive.
 I could go on for pages. NOBODY SHOULD INSTALL WINDOWS 10 until they get all the bugs fixed. Figuring out how to delete the account picture Microsoft chose, which wasn't even me, took me through a lot of grief until I finally found this answer. On a Microsoft
 web page. SO UNTYPICAL. Thanks, Microsoft.

            <p>For changing a computer's name you can either use:</p>
<p>-Settings -&gt; System -&gt; About</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>-Control Panel -&gt; System -&gt; Advanced System Settings -&gt; Computer Name (as in Windows 7 and earlier).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think an account picture can be 'deleted', but it can be changed: Settings -&gt; Accounts -&gt; Your Account, then browser for any picture or take one with the camera if equipped.</p>

<h2>            I want to allow Chrome or Firefox to use my mic and camera on certain websites</h2>
                    <p>I want to allow Chrome or Firefox to use my mic and camera on certain websites (for example Firefox 'Hello' - skype alternative). On the Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera section the only browser shown is Edge, which does not support Firefox 'Hello'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I add to the list of apps that want to use my camera, so that I can then give the new app the required permissions? For example Gimp 2.8 - photoshop alternative - can no longer use the webcam under Win 10 as that is not on the App list either.</p>

</p><p>Specifically, how may I add ANY program that doesn't self populate?&nbsp; I should be able to choose from anything installed on my computer, not what Microsoft chooses for me.&nbsp; Microsoft Edge appears - but not Firefox.&nbsp; And yes, Firefox is the default program.</p>

</p><p>Hi Johny, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Change which sites can use camera and microphone with the steps below: <br />
<br />
1. Access Chrome.<br />
2. Click <strong>Settings </strong>at the top-right portion of your Chrome web page.
<br />
3. Click <strong>Show advanced settings</strong>.<br />
4. In the "Privacy" section, click <strong>Content settings</strong>.<br />
5. In the Microphone and Camera section, choose one of the options:<br />
* <strong>Ask when a site requires access to your camera and microphone</strong>: Chrome will alert you whenever a site asks to use to your camera and microphone.<br />
* <strong>Do not allow sites to access your camera and microphone</strong>: This will automatically deny any site requests to use your camera and microphone.<br />
* To remove permissions that you've already granted, click <strong>Manage exceptions</strong>.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: </p>
<p>If you're using Chrome at work or school, your network administrator might set camera and microphone settings for you. In that case, you can't change them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 professional - very slow transfer to&#47;from internal HDD  &#40;WDC WD2500BEVT-75ZT2&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>Happy generally.</p>
<p>Only real problem is that the transfer rate to/from internal HDD of my computer is very slow. Trying to sort it but most of the online help is for &nbsp;Windows 7.</p>
<p>I have Disabled Indexing and set (ticked) the Write-caching policy for the drive to "Enable write caching" and "Turn off Windows write-cache buffer" with no improvement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grasping at straws I then tried to check if DMA is enabled &nbsp;for this drive in the System and Security but cant find it in the Device Manager IDE ATA/ATAP as suggested in a Win 7 article.</p>
<p>All i see in the dialog box for ATA Channel 0 Advanced settings is Channel properties--Supported Devices 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Device and Device Properties windows being blank.</p>
<p>Can Anyone out there suggest a solution for this speed issue for me</p>

            Hey there Robert :)<br />
<br />
Do you have a backup of your data on the WD Blue drive? It's a rather old model so I'd make a backup of everything important just to be on the safe side.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What do you mean when saying that there are slow transfer speeds?<br />
<br />
I would check the condition of the drive and see if it's performing properly and no hardware issues are causing the lower performance. I would recommend using WD Data Lifeguard Diagnostic tool and see if the drive passes both the quick and the extended tests
 without issues. This should rule the drive as either healthy or not. |Here's a link to the tool: http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=wPizpN<br />
<br />
Checking if the drive works the same way with another SATA cable on another SATA port and possibly on another computer could also show you if the problem comes from the drive itself or from your computer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can try some benchmarking tools and see the exact speeds that your drive is working with. Benchmarking the drive on multiple computers and verifying that the results are similar is a good idea. Feel free to post them here as well as the S.M.A.R.T. status
 of the drive with the raw values. :)<br />
<br />
You could also check the load of the drive and see if any of your applications is using it and bottlenecking its speed.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Post back with some results.<br />
<br />
Captain_WD.

</p><blockquote>Hey there Robert :)<br />
<br />
Do you have a backup of your data on the WD Blue drive? It's a rather old model so I'd make a backup of everything important just to be on the safe side.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What do you mean when saying that there are slow transfer speeds?<br />
<br />
I would check the condition of the drive and see if it's performing properly and no hardware issues are causing the lower performance. I would recommend using WD Data Lifeguard Diagnostic tool and see if the drive passes both the quick and the extended tests
 without issues. This should rule the drive as either healthy or not. |Here's a link to the tool: http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=wPizpN<br />
<br />
Checking if the drive works the same way with another SATA cable on another SATA port and possibly on another computer could also show you if the problem comes from the drive itself or from your computer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can try some benchmarking tools and see the exact speeds that your drive is working with. Benchmarking the drive on multiple computers and verifying that the results are similar is a good idea. Feel free to post them here as well as the S.M.A.R.T. status
 of the drive with the raw values. :)<br />
<br />
You could also check the load of the drive and see if any of your applications is using it and bottlenecking its speed.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Post back with some results.<br />

<p>Thanks for you prompt reply Captain</p>
<p>I was hoping for a software solution as I would not be comfortable opening up my computer (it is a dell studio hybrid which is why it has a hard drive designed for a laptop) and im sure everything is crammed in there and easily damaged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did followed your advice to download the diagnostic however and then performed the quick and the extended tests. The drive passed these tests. I will email you those results together with the SMART data.</p>
<p>Transfer speed i am getting between my C and D drives (which are partitions of the HDD) is of the order of 300kB/s</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help.</p>

            I would agree that tinkering with the hardware can be a risky thing to do, but there's no way to test some of the things purely with a software.&nbsp;<br />
Since the drive passes both tests it should be safe to use and the problem should be elsewhere.&nbsp;<br />
What is the transfer rate that you are getting to another device? Have you tried defragmenting the drive?&nbsp;<br />
Waiting for your e-mail :)<br />

<p>Seems I may have wasted your time.</p>
<p>Turned on my computer this PM and transfer rate to/from internal HDD is up to between 20 and 30 MB/s which is similar to that of the external USB connected drives. Magic</p>
<p>One small wrinkle error 0x80070522, I must just remember not to try saving files to the root.</p>
<p>Once again capn, thank you so much for your assistance and above all your patience with a rookie.</p>

<h2>            Security alert for LED flashlight, still going&#33;</h2>
                    <p>This was posted in the old community and never resolved. Unbelieveable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am constantly getting security alert popups from Skype. &nbsp;I get many at a time and have to click them all away. &nbsp;I, and other users, have isolated the problem to the Incredible LED Flashlight ad Skype is running in Canada. &nbsp;There are five pages of posts
 about this in the old community and no one will fix it. &nbsp;The issue was first reported April 13 so we're at about 7 weeks of this now. &nbsp;Skype is damn near unusuable when this ad comes up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FIX THIS.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Occasionally, you may see advertisements for other companies in Skype (if you're using the free version of Skype). Advertisements help keep Skype free for millions of users, and these advertisements will not disrupt your Skype experience in any way.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To provide ads that are of greater interest to you, we may use non-personally identifiable Skype profile information (including profile information from a linked Microsoft account), such as age, gender, country of residence and language preference, as well

<a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA140/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">change your privacy settings</a>.</p>

<p>So, you are saying that if I do not like the faulty ad that is causing security problems, I should pay for Skype to get rid of it. &nbsp;That would be a form of extortion. &nbsp;I'm sure that is not what you mean. &nbsp;What has really happened is that you noted my inquiry
 was related to Skype ads and you pasted a stock response without reading the question. &nbsp;Which is just as bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm reporting an ERROR, not complaining that Skype has ads. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, that error kicked me out of an important business meeting yesterday morning when the damn faulty ad locked up my skype with repeated security warnings. &nbsp;The ad is faulty. &nbsp;It is causing problems. &nbsp;It is not working as intended.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can I mark a response as helpful, but not mark it as irrelevant?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I understand this is likely a copy paste response and you probably aren't looking into the issue further. However, it is important to note, the copy paste response
<strong>is a LIE.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</strong>The issue contained in this post is highly disruptive. I get dozens of security alerts every time the banner ad in my skype window changes to the LED flashlight ad, and skype is unusable while they are open. Not only can I not send, or sometimes receive
 messages, but this causes slowdown to my computer while running performance sensitive software and has more than once caused a crash. Even if I avoid the crash this typically results in 10-15 minutes of lost work for myself and 4-24 coworkers depending on
 the instance, as well as 2-10 minutes of additional downtime while I force close skype (which does not always work with the security notices) or restart my computer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It has come to a point where I close skype if I am doing something important, which is often. I have also found that the program has started to sometimes instead of displaying the notices, which I will not notice until I tab in to skype and find it unresponsive,
 sometimes having missed hours of messages. I used to work around this by having notifications to my phone, but recently the phone app has updated and has also become unresponsive and unreliable.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Skype can no longer be relied on and I've been working on moving my contacts to other platforms, but honestly it would be nice to have this fixed and not have to force such a change. I tried to post this same complaint myself a couple months ago but couldn't
 force replicate the issue to get additional information. I'm glad others are coming forward now and disappointed it's being ignored. Advertisements are a fact of life, but leaving disruptive security flaws in your programming is bad practice. &nbsp;

<p>I also posted about this 3 months ago .. its so annoying to have it still be a problem and its no doubt the incredible flashlight ad..&nbsp; ..Its at the point now i have to end task on skype now and re start it ..
<br />
<br />
it was trouble free for about a month or more ..but i had disabled ads in skype with the above hack...but after windows crash i'm back to normal .. .. why does Microsoft refuse to fix this one problem.. is money that tough they would rather have a bunch of
 unsatisfied users then just tell the ad company to update or fix the problem ...&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
really the option is to use a hack!!!!! and get zero ads!!!..<br />
<br />
or fix the one problem and get all ads??&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
or just dump skype finally and move onto something else..then they get zero money..</p>
<p>because i bet they still get money even though we hide the ads.. with the above hacks..<br />
