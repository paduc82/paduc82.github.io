            <p>I need to find a redress on this issue. &nbsp;Microsoft as a company pushing clan thing as a partner of cod. &nbsp;Not a general posting. Which does not push the Cod Microsoft partnership of getting the community connected as never befor is not in general terms. &nbsp;The game is all about claning up. And not in general terms. &nbsp;The head of xbox Major Nelson is helping to sell this and not in general terms. &nbsp;Major Nelson spent most of his time talking and selling the grouping up. In other words clans.</p>
<p>This seriously needs to be changed its what the game is all about. As long as they are posting for BO2 there should not be a problem. &nbsp;Why run over half of the xbox live customers out of the forums when the company has a different view of the matter. Why do the higher up push the sale of elite which is about claning up, Then you in the forums say a BO2 is no place for you. </p>
<p>Not to be rude but the title is not listed as non clan call of duty black ops 2 forum</p>

<p>Well I'll clarify. &nbsp;You can talk about clans in the sense of clan options and so on. &nbsp;The problem is that clans are so huge the forum is riddled with JOIN US and so and so's clan sucks and all that. &nbsp;It's only separated because the clan community is large
 enough to support itself but there are still TONS of people who do not play in or with a clan. &nbsp;There are plenty of aspects of the game including the Spec op and or Zombie stuff and single player campaign that are not clan related. &nbsp; That's why we created
 a separate clan discussion forum. &nbsp;This forum is for discussing the game, tactics, news, meeting people to casually play with, feedback on the game, thoughts about updates to the game and things like that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one said this is not a place for anyone. &nbsp;We have tons of people who are in clans who post in the COD forums all the time. &nbsp;If they discuss clan battles, setting up games etc they do it in Clan Discussion. &nbsp;Besides, when it comes to talking about clans
 does it really matter where you do it? &nbsp;The clan forum is so like minded people can meet up. &nbsp;It's been set up that way for a few years and we have very few people that come and say "I want to talk about clans but I want to do it in this forum and not the
 clan forum" &nbsp;People who want to discuss clans go there and get along fine.</p>

<p>It's not - "<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2fresized-image.ashx%2f__size%2f550x0%2f__key%2fCommunityServer-Discussions-Components-Files%2f2530%2f0218.8164353_2D00_policeman_2D00_emoticon.jpg" />THERE WILL BE NO CLAN DISCUSSION

<p>Scratch is by no means trying to harass you or make you feel unwelcome on this forum. Clans are of course going to be a big part of Blops2 but if the forums is made up entirely of "JOIN" or "RECRUITING" threads it makes it difficult for the actual discussion
 threads to be seen. Therefore the best place for people looking to join or recruit for clans is in the forums create specifically for those things.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>This is a rule usually set in most of the CoD forums and it's not usually a problem for most players.

<h2>            Driver verifier detects a violation in win32kbase.sys</h2>
                    <p>In driver verifier with all of the "Standard" tests enabled, my F1A75-M motherboard &amp; A8-3850 cpu based system bluescreens with stopcode DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION (0xC4) in win32kbase.sys.&nbsp;<span>Winver is Windows 10 1803 17134.48.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>With slightly more blue screen info enabled, it writes at the top left:</p>

Parameter 1 = 0x2000 in this context</a> is supposed to mean there is a problem with&nbsp;StorPortInitialize in the storage miniport driver. Of which I only have Microsoft's own storahci.sys loaded. No dumpfile is written, which seems normal if the storage driver

    <title>Unknown computer on network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> craignavin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unknown computer on network</h2>
                    <p>I have had my computer since 2016 and not had another computer on my network in those years. However, this past week I have noticed that there is another computer on the network.
</p>
<p>I dont know where this computer came from or whos it is. There is no other computer in the house. I am using a wired connection from a Wifi extender for my connection and have had no problems with it.
</p>
<p>The past couple weeks my internet has been patchy compared to usual, drops from 90mbps to 12mbps max. I think that this unknown computer could be having an effect on the internet speeds. But I am more concerned with what the computer could be doing on the
 network as i dont know its origin. The computer is called TMNANOSEM2PLUS and it has two folders on it (pics included).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f36234b-c3fe-468e-b21a-f4e5a99b53f6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f36234b-c3fe-468e-b21a-f4e5a99b53f6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>The Harddisk folder has two folders inside of it called movie and timeshift. Both of these folders are empty.
</p>
<p>The root folder has a lot of folders inside of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07c74560-0f96-4e4d-b1fa-008a43707ccf?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07c74560-0f96-4e4d-b1fa-008a43707ccf?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice on what this could be or how to delete it would be appreciated. There is no way to access it with remote access or delete it.<br />

            Another thought though. Are there any other devices in your network? Smart TV, game system, Blu Ray player, streaming device, etc...? It is possible that you are seeing shared folders contained in such a device and not necessarily another computer

            Craig if not connected to the network you would not be able to see the device or access it's folders. <br /><br />Are there any other devices in your network?

            There are but surely they would be under a different section of the network window or named more accurately as to what they are?

<h3> leonshi2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Raid Controller Driver included in Windows 10 April Update &#40;and later&#41; causes update hang up,  please fix t</h2>
                    <p>Clearly the Raid Controller Driver included in the Windows 10 April Update (and the later 1803 as well) has issue with older type of Raid Controller. Specifically, it is known to cause problem for Sony Vaio VPCZ1xxx and Acer S7 391 series.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When update directly from windows, the process stuck at x% after first rebooting. The circle spins but hard drive led wont flash. It last forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is a clean install, the process will stuck at x% during "preparing for installation". Again the circle spins but hard drive led wont flash. It last forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, the only solution is to manually load the official Intel Raid driver during clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since windows 10 update is now required at any time, please fix this before next major update.</p>
<p />

                    So I recently upgraded from Vista to Windows 7 from a student download I receieved from my school. After hours of the installation, the computer restarted itself a couple of times, I know that is part of the installation. However, when it was complete
 &amp; I logged in there was a box on the top left corner that said Configuring Personalized Settings with a black background and then just freezes. The mouse pointer will not move but I am able to use Safe Mode. Whenever I go into normal mode the same thing happens
 &amp; my laptop keeps freezing..not sure what it could be :/ any ideas?&nbsp; Thanks a lot !

<p><span>Hi Dianaq02,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Windows Forums!</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Boot to safe mode and place your computer in clean boot mode</strong>
</span></span><span><span><span>and check if the issue persists. To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of
 drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts. This article describes how to troubleshoot problems in Windows Vista or in Windows 7 by performing a clean boot.<br />
<br />
Steps to put your computer in clean boot: <br />
<br />
1. Click <strong><span>Start</span></strong>
<br />
2. Type <strong><span>msconfig</span></strong> in the
<strong><span>Start Search</span></strong> box, and then press ENTER.<br />
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong><span>Continue</span></strong>.
<br />
<br />
1. On the <strong><span>General</span></strong> tab, click
<strong><span>Selective Startup</span></strong>.
<br />
2. Under <strong><span>Selective Startup</span></strong>, click to clear the
<strong><span>Load Startup Items</span></strong> check box.
<br />
3. Click the <strong><span>Services</span></strong> tab, click to select the
<strong><span>Hide All Microsoft Services</span></strong> check box, and then click
<strong><span>Disable All</span></strong>.
<br />
4. Click <strong><span>OK</span></strong>.
<br />
5. When you are prompted, click <strong><span>Restart</span></strong>.
<br />
6. Restart the computer in <strong>normal mode</strong> and check if you are still getting the same problem.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Follow the steps from Step 2 to Step 6 as given in the link below to check which software is conflicting.<br />

<strong>Error “the Audio Service Is Not Running” When Opening the Volume Mixer in Vista<br />

<br />
If needed :<br />
<br />
Try setting all the Windows Services back to their defaults.<br />
<br />
BlackViper's list of Services<br />
<a href="http://www.blackviper.com/WinVista/servicecfg.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.blackviper.com/WinVista/servicecfg.htm</a><br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; Services&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list&nbsp; - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You may need to update/re-install the sound drivers.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition Audio&nbsp;<br />
(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on and RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the reboot to see
<br />
if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot until it is. It can take several
<br />
tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Also Right Click Speaker near clock - Playback Devices - right click in the box area - check<br />
Show disable and disconnected devices. Highlight speaker and on the&nbsp;lower Right click Properties<br />
check settings for Device Usage enabled and so on. Also do same for Configure on Lower Left of<br />

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have previously uninstalled .NET Framework v4.5.2 and it no longer shows in the control panel as you would expect.&nbsp; After i tried to reinstall it, it said that the program is already installed but is not appearing in the control panel.&nbsp; I have
 tried to reinstall it many times and it repeatedly says that it is installed.&nbsp; I cannot reinstall it and cannot uninstall it; I have used ccleaner to try and fix the registry and it has not worked at all, any help?</p>

            I'm having the same issue and I have tried everything I can think of and find! The Microsoft .net framework repair tool just says something about restarting and re-registering &nbsp;the windows installer service.&nbsp;

<h2>            Upgrading Win 7 without SP1 to Win 10</h2>
                    <p>I have been unable to upgrade my version of Win 7 to SP1. &nbsp;I have been trying ever since I got this laptop, been on innumerable forums and came to the conclusion it just won't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I thought a free upgrade to Win 10 was too good to miss - but apparently I will because I need to have SP1 installed to be able to upgrade! &nbsp; ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please someone tell me this can be done without the Win 7 SP1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it can't then I will just have to pass!</p>

            <p><span>* Getting Windows Update errors with Windows 7 SP1? MS notes "inconsistencies," provides fix:
</span><a href="http://is.gd/22brle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://is.gd/22brle</span></a></p>
<span>
<p>* 1. Click on Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories, and right-click on Command Prompt.</p>
<p>2. Choose Run As and select an Administrator account.</p>
<p>3. At the command prompt, type net stop cryptsvc and wait for the service to stop.</p>
<p>4. Type CD\ and press Enter.</p>
<p>5. Type CD windows\system32 and press Enter.</p>
<p>6. Type ren catroot2 catroot3 and press Enter.</p>
<p>Other solutions:</p>
<p>1. Make sure you install the latest updates for Windows 7, your applications and device drivers. This can ensure a smooth experience I noticed, although Windows 7 SP1 is minor, you don’t want to take any chances. If you are updating through Windows Update,
 it also guarantees a smaller update since only missing patches will be applied.</p>
<p>2. Backup – you can never go wrong with backing up; this is something you should do often even when you are not making major changes to your computer. Windows 7 has made it very easy tobackup your computer . The built in system imaging and backup and restore
 center makes it convenient to back up the operating system and all your critical data. In fact, I used this to test the beta and RC releases of SP1 on my production system. This method carried its risks, but at least I knew my RTM installation was safely backed
 up and tucked away from pre-release code.</p>
</span>
<p><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/</span></a></p>
<span>
<p>3. Don’t do it during a major project, if you have something you are working on at the moment on your computer or in the middle of an assignment or work related project which you might need your PC for, don’t install the Service Pack right away. Do it in
 your off time, such as on the weekend or when you know you can leave your PC while it installs itself automatically. My installation took over 2 hours.</p>
<p>4. This brings me to another point, which is, don’t install SP1 on a laptop on battery power, it’s a CPU intensive task and will use up most of your battery power. So make sure your laptop is connected to power. For desktop users, I strongly recommend you
 have a UPS connected, you just don’t know when the unexpected can occur. You might just be in the last lap of completing the 2 hour installation and lose power.</p>
<p>5. Disable your Antivirus, I remember installing the SP1 beta with Microsoft Security Essentials version 1 installed and received an error that my Antivirus is not compatible. Although this was resolved, your experience might vary. I haven’t experienced
 the issue in the RTM code although I am running Microsoft Security Essentials version 2. Someone reported receiving an error message about Forefront Client Security not allowing the Service Pack to install. The recommendation is to disable Forefront which
 is based on the same core scanning engine as MSE or make sure you at least have the latest version of Forefront client security installed.</p>
<p>6. Another thing you should do is a clean boot before installing the Service Pack, you can do this by:</p>
<p>* Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>* Accept User Account Control permission</p>
<p>* If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</p>
<p>* On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</p>
<p>* Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</p>
<p>* Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</p>
<p>* Click OK.</p>
<p>* When you are prompted, click Restart.</p>
<p>* After the computer starts, proceed with the installation.</p>
<p>7. Another task you should try is to check your hard disk for errors:</p>
<p>* Click Start</p>
<p>* Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD</p>
<p>* Click ‘Run as Administrator’</p>
<p>* At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f</p>
<p>When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the (extensive!) replies.</p>
<p>Both confirm that I *have* to have SP1 installed before I can upgrade to Win 10.</p>
<p>This seems exceptionally stupid of Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will have another look at doing the SP1 upgrade but as I spent days and weeks earlier this year in conjunction with Win 7 forums - all to no avail - I don't hold out much hope.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(See&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/windows-updates-activation/347038-win-7-service-pack-1-installation-fails-messes-up-drive-letters-new-post.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/windows-updates-activation/347038-win-7-service-pack-1-installation-fails-messes-up-drive-letters-new-post.html</a>&nbsp;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I still can't get it to work I gues my only other option is to go down the 'work around' recently published by MS for people still running XP, Vista etc.</p>
<p>

<h3> rtremor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error when updating Cirago BTA-6130. Error code 800F020D.</h2>
                    I bought a Cirago BTA-6130 and Windows Update is showing me an optional update for the driver for this device. When I choose it to be installed, it gives me an error code of 800F020D but there is no instruction on what to do or how to fix it. I had a Microsoft
 Wireless Laser Mouse 8000 but the bluetooth stopped working. I asked MS for help but they sent me a link and the instruction is so confusing, so i bought the BTA-6130 and it works but the Windows Update is showing me an update but it doesn't seem to work.
 Can you help me with this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

            Hello Raymond,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting.&nbsp; I'm going to suggest the simpliest solution for you issue.&nbsp; Since your device is working perfectly right now, I wouldn't worry about changing it and to hide that update for it in Windows update so that it will not try to install it again.&nbsp;
 Now should you decide to update the driver for your mouse, then I recommend checking the manufacturer's support site for the latest drivers.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if this helps you.

    <title>How to get sound from stereo mix but not from speakers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to get sound from stereo mix but not from speakers</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium on my laptop. I've set up my software to stream music (online radio, etc.) from my stereo mix output to my TV. It works well. However, I'd like to ONLY get the audio streamed over stereo mix, but NOT over my laptop's
 speakers. When I try to mute my speakers it mutes my stereo-mix output. Is there any way, short of physically disconnecting them, of muting my speakers, while still getting output from my stereo mix output?

I think you have misunderstood my question. Your answer tells me how to enable stereo mix, which I have already enabled by default and is working correctly. My question is how do I prevent sound from coming from my computer's speakers while still having audio
 transmitted over stereo mix. What I am trying to do is stream the audio from my laptop to an external device using VLC media player, which reads from the stereo mix channel and streams it over the network to my device. I have the audio streaming working, but
 I ONLY want to listen to the streamed audio NOT the audio coming from my speakers. If I try muting my speakers then that mutes the stereo mix output as well, which I don't want. Do you know of any way to accomplish this, or is what I'm asking not technically
 possible?<br />

            The only thing I have found to do the job is this. Either plug a headphone in to the jack, and what I did is cut a end off from a old cord and use it for this purpose.

</p><p>The iBall Slide &nbsp;<strong>comes preinstalled with&nbsp;&nbsp; a one year subscription to Office 365</strong>, as well as &nbsp;the Windows Anti Virus and 1 TB of cloud storage. We are not great fans of &nbsp;so-called free &nbsp;pre-loads which you have to pay for after a while,
 but&nbsp; in this case you have the option to&nbsp; open an Outlook&nbsp; email account and use the free online&nbsp; office features. Strangely, the tables leaves &nbsp;out an NFC sensor, that&nbsp; any business user would demand. Even Intel's Education tablet for kids has one!.</p>

<h2>            Annullamento automatico abbonamento Xbox Live</h2>
                    
<p>Sono ormai 4 le volte che mi è stato annullato l'abbonamento ad Xbox Live in automatico da Microsoft. Ogni qualvolta sottoscrivo un abbonamento da Xbox Live, dopo qualche ora o qualche giorno mi viene annullato l'abbonamento in automatico. In pratica sottoscrivo
 l'abbonamento di un mese, gioco a Fifa 14 online senza alcun problema e dopo qualche ora/giorno mi viene annullato l'abbonamento. Quando succede, ricevo una mail da Microsoft come la seguente:</p>
<p><span><em>Gentile XXX XXX,&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><em>Con la presente desideriamo confermarle che la sottoscrizione a Xbox Live Gold è stata annullata il venerdì 25 aprile 2014.</em></p>
<p><em>Ci dispiace tu abbia deciso di disattivare l'abbonamento. Se lo desideri, riattivare l'abbonamento Xbox Live Gold è semplice. Visita il sito Web all'indirizzo&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/extendmembership" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/extendmembership</a>&nbsp;e
 potrai tornare a usufruire di un'esperienza di gioco multiplayer senza paragoni, app per l'intrattenimento ed esclusivi vantaggi riservati agli abbonati.</em></p>
<p><em>Grazie per avere utilizzato i Microsoft Online Services.</em></p>

<br />probably your GeForce has not enough memory. Has it 1GB RAM? The game requires at least 2GB videoRAM.       
        </p>

<p>I don't think a copy of the games requirements is what Igor was asking for. It was how much VRAM&nbsp;
<em>your</em> GTX750&nbsp; ti has.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe&nbsp; <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">all GTX750ti have 2GB VRAM</span></em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">,&nbsp; and</span>
<p>This would put your graphics card just a bit below the minimum requirement. The game
<em>may</em> run with all low settings,</p>
<p>but you may also need to use a lower resolution such as 1600x1024,1360x768 or similar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you need.... Upgrade your graphics card. Either a second hand GTX1000 (1060\1070) series.</p>
<p>GTX1060 is close to an GTX970.</p>
<p>I wouldn't bother with the GTX1050ti because it is too close to the GTX670's minimum requirement for the game, with the exception</p>
of having more VRAM, which could help at times, but it would be more a tweak in performance vs a proper upgrade.<br />
<p>Or.... A brand new and shiny GTX1660 or 1660ti , which they say is equivalent to the GTX1070 .</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Note that the power requirements for the higher end gpu's are also higher. </p>
<p>Nvidia's recommendation for the 750ti is only a 300W minimum power supply, but the minimum for the GTX1660ti is 450W.</p>
<p>GTX 1060 is 400W and GTX1070 is 500W minimum.</p>
<p>Many (most&nbsp; ?) people playing system intensive games regularly will add 100W+ to the Nvidia recommended minimum.<br />
</p>

<p>Intel does not make dedicated graphics cards... yet. Only the Integrated graphics built into their cpu, which is not really suitable</p>
<p>for AAA games.</p>
<p>- You could also try the equivalent AMD graphics cards. I don't know which model to suggest as they haven't been keeping up</p>
<p>with the capabilities of Nvidia at the top end for the past few series.&nbsp; Well, not since around 2012, maybe 2014, and I haven't
</p>
<p>kept up with their models .</p>
<p>Good value for money though. The reviews will have plenty of benchmarks to compare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Or are you thinking cpu upgrade ? i3 @3.6 is good, but being dual core with Hyper Threading could be a drawback if the game</p>
<p>does not accept the HT 'virtual' cores when it searches for a quad core cpu. </p>
<p>I should have noticed the specs say i5, and it's a bit too early to get information regarding using an i3 cpu, so you may need
</p>
<p>to wait until the game has been out a few weeks to find out, but you may also be able to find out if an i3 is OK by posting</p>
<p>on the developers forum or support site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrading may help a bit with some cpu intensive games such as FC5, but the gpu is still more important for gaming performance.You would want to read reviews and compare with compatible i5 models to determine if it's worth the cost vs building a</p>
<p>machine with all new hardware.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t install kodak all-in-one printer.  Access denied.</h2>
                    
<p>We have a hp computer that was updated with Windows 7 home premium edition.&nbsp; We installed our Kodak all in one printer and everything worked well until the print head died on the printer.&nbsp; We ordered and installed a new print head for the printer and now
 we can not print.&nbsp; After spending close to 4 hours on the phone with Kodak, they told me that the problem is with Windows 7.&nbsp; My logon is set as administrator yet I keep getting "access denied" errors.&nbsp; Kodak support made sure that I have the latest software
 downloaded.&nbsp; I would really like to print but need some help.&nbsp; Please help.</p>

<p>Hi hjb,</p>
<p>You will&nbsp;likely&nbsp;still have to right click on the installation program and select "Run as administrator" even using an account with administrator&nbsp;privileges.</p>
