<h2>            Event Templates available in Windows 10 Calendar App</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft!</p>
<p>I hope this message gets reviewed by the right product managers.</p>
<p>I am a frequent user of the Windows 10 Calendar App. Although the app is very user friendly and useful, the event template icons are not</p>
Are there additional Event Templates available in Windows 10 Calendar App?

<p>How can I upload *new* event template icons for the calendar app?</p>
<p>The very few icons are very limiting and user *UN*friendly.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>fabtech</p>

            Hello fabtech. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Sadly, No there is no way to add your own or download any extra event icons than what is available. 
<br />
<br />You should leave feedback for Microsoft about this through the feedback hub by pressing windows + F

                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently noticed that my AT2020 was recording extremely low levels. I did a bit of searching and i found quite a bit of Microsoft threads and found that it is a consistent problem. I was just curious as too if you guys had fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im also providing links to the other 2 discussion pages about the same problem.</p>

            Hey James, I'm really sorry to say that this issue has not been fixed yet. Some users have said that swapping out a specific .dll with a windows 7 .dll helped improve the quality, but that seems superficial at best. Being a (small-time) streamer myself, it's also a nuisance to me.
<br />
<br />Sorry I couldn't offer more assistance.

            I wanted to use system image but that option was not shown. Under backup was the message this feature is not available in a portable workspace environment. When the computer crashes , I get a message on reboot that says leave the usb drive&nbsp;connected until
 windows has shut down. I have installed Windows Media Center and the updates from Microsoft Update. I had system images but could not defragment the drive they were on so I did a quick format and went to make a new system image. That was when I ran into problems.
 I am using Norton Internet Security and Malware Bytes to protect my system. I have four external hard drive attached&nbsp; for backup of data. One is dedicated to system&nbsp; images. The C or internal drive is the only drive that shows as a boot / system drive in computer
 management - drive management. The computer is connected wirelessly to a home network using wpa2 security.

<p>I think you have an insight to the problem. I bet we've all upgraded&nbsp; to 10 and installed new hard drives.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I copied my entire hard drive by using a sata to usb 3.0 cable to connect and copy to my new Samsung SSD PRO 1TB. During the process my system drive would have seen my Samsung SSD as a&nbsp;USB device, and copied that way to the SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when I pulled my HDD and replaced it with the SSD and booted, somewhere in the system, it thinks that Samsung SSD is connected via USB which it is NOT anymore.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bet the problem is either in the registry somewhere or a flag on the SSD.</p>

            This question is still open even though it looks like you haven't gotten a reply. There is no error number, but our computers are being treated as though our internal Hard Drives are removable WorkStation Drives and they are not. How can we convince Windows
 that our internal drives are in fact our main internal permanent drives and not WorkStations?

    <title>Windows 10, computer trying to connect to all wifi hotspots at once - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wanderlustking  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10, computer trying to connect to all wifi hotspots at once all the time</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Lenovo think pad purchased just last month from Best Buy, it is running the newest version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is I have turned off the setting under Wifi Sense to auto connect to available hotspots but still everytime i go into the wifi connections every wifi my computer can find it checks off the box connect automatically. I uncheck all the boxes, as
 soon as I leave the tab it auto checks them all again. My problem is I'm in europe traveling on business I'm constantly getting disconnected from my hotel wifi because my computer is trying to connect to all of these in range at once all the time. I have searched
 far and wide using bing and google to no avail. Please someone help me figure out how to stop my computer from checking off the box to connect to every possible wifi. I will be connected to my hotels wifi and have no networks in range, then the train pulls
 up outside my hotel (with a free wifi server) and my computer tries to connect to it and I'm disconnected from my hotels internet. Another example is someone within the hotel sets up their own personal wifi connection with a phone or whatever, with a password,
 and my computer tries to connect to that as well disconnecting me from the hotels internet.</p>
<p>

            I will check on all of this the next time I am over there. Which probably won't be till June as she lives 7 hours away. I just thought that someone could tell me an easy way of getting that on there but if Vista did not have it then I don't know. When
 I go in June I am upgrading her windows to 7 Ultimate.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Windows vista the add/remove programs is named as programs and features. Make sure the operating system is Windows vista before performing the above steps.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may upload the&nbsp;screenshot so that we could help you further. </p>

            <p>Try Revo Uninstaller Pro free version.&nbsp; It worked for uninstalling programs that I couldn't uninstall in the control panel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know this sounds blonde but look in progams in control panel, it should say uninstall a program. Also try it in classic view if you are not doing so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t connect to router after update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> solitudesa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to router after update</h2>
                    
<p>Last night I updated my 360 (it failed once during the update but finished).&nbsp; I played some Dragon Age and then went to sleep.&nbsp; This morning, like a lot of other people, I can't connect to Live.</p>
<p><b>What Country/State/Province do you live in? </b>South Africa, Gauteng<br />
<b>Modem brand &amp; model number: </b>Huawei, SmartAX Mt880a<br />
<b>Router brand &amp; model number: </b>TRENDnet TEW-652BRP<br />
<b>Network Connection Type: </b>Wireless<br />
<b>If Wireless, what type of encryption are you using? </b>WPA2-PSK <br />
<b>Things you have tried: </b>I've got three computers in the house that's connected.&nbsp; Switched them all off and switched the 360 off plus the modem and router. Switched modem and router back on with the 360. I tried to set the IP manually but was unsuccessful.&nbsp;
 The 360 sees the connection and everything else connects like normal.&nbsp; It's only since the update that the 360 fails.<br />
<b>Is UPnP Enabled? </b>Unknown<br />
<b>Is NAT Type Open? </b>Not entirely sure what that means. NAT is set to Enabled and Obtain an IP automatically.<br />
<b>Any Error Codes you encounter: </b>None<br />
<b>What type of internet do you have? </b>ADSL<b> <br />
Who is your ISP(Internet Service Provider)? </b>TelkomSA, also tried others<br />
<b>When you run "Test Xbox LIVE connection" what is the exact message shown on screen?</b></p>
<p>Can't obtain an IP address from your router or modem.</p>
<p>Turn your router or modem off and back on, then wait 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Have you restarted your router or modem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that's about it.&nbsp; It's frustratring.&nbsp; Oh, it's one of the new Slim models.&nbsp; I bought it new in December with a Kinect.</p>

<p>And now for an interesting point. &nbsp;After some testing I realized that if I set my router to Wireless G instead of Wireless N then the XBox can connect. &nbsp;The update screwed up the 360's N connection somehow. &nbsp;The console is only about 3 meters away from my
 router.</p>
<p>But yes, I've got a slower network now but at least the XBox can connect. &nbsp;So everyone who has the same problem, please try it out but still post here because it's something that Microsoft should know about and fix.</p>

<p>I am having the exact same problem as you. I have a new 250 Gig wireless and everything has been working fine for weeks untill today's (may 28th) update.
</p>
<p>now I am experiencing exact same symptoms as you. My router and firmware are fine, with all my pcs and mac computers still working.</p>
<p>My xbox sees my router and lets me put my password in, and tells me my router is not issuing an IP. &nbsp;Router UPnP Enabled, and router enabled to issue IP's. I have turned off router and xbox, reset xbox network settings to original to factory settings. no
 dice. I jumped through the hoops and hasnt worked. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope we can wake up tomorrow and this will be patched</p>

<p>I haven't had the time yet to check unfortunately. &nbsp;Worked until late last night and typing this now before going to work again. &nbsp;I will mark this question as answered though. &nbsp;Since it worked for SuparFubar and I've got a good feeling that it will for me
 too. &nbsp;Plus if it doesn't work then at least I know everything is working using wireless G.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help Shad0wmanUK and thanks for the update SuparFubar.</p>

<p>How do you switch to Wireless G? That's really annoying and a big problem for me. My router is ages away from my xbox and I already have a very slow internet connection. I hope it isn't much worse if I have to change it.</p>

<p>Jay, it depends on your router make/model, its easy enough to do once you have access to the routers menu via your browser, if your not sure download a manual for your router.</p>

<h3> debpem  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win32 Api hook</h2>
                    <p>I ran a Trend Micro Housecall scan, it says I have 1 problem that it cannot repair:&nbsp; Hooked_Service_API,&nbsp; Service Api: ZwTerminateProcess</p>
<p>Image Path:&nbsp; C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\SPINProc.sys</p>
<p>Original Handler:&nbsp; 0x805c866a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CurrentHandler&nbsp; 0xeee9f416&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service number&nbsp; 0x101</p>
<p>ModuleName&nbsp; Psinproc.sys</p>
<p>SDTType&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what I can find out about this, it is spyware or virus, that changes the behavior of the pc during game playing, which is exactly the problem I have been having lately, but, I cannot find a solution for removing it.&nbsp; I have ran several other scans,
 they find it, but all say they cannot repair it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have windows xp pro, 32bit on my pc</p>

<em><span>Hello, I bought a Xbox One S console limited edition of 500 gigabytes, as it turned out, the Minecraft game code should be with the console, but it is not there (as they said in the store, they most likely lost it in the store when checking).</span></em>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Response:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hi there,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>if there should be a code in the bundle it would clearly show on the box the console was in. In case it was missing I do assume that only the store where you purchased the console is the only
 one that can solve it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Be sure to check every piece of paper that came with the console since if a code was present it would be on there.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Keep in mind that not all console bundles will come with a game.</span></span></p>
<p>Let us know the results</p>

<p><span><span>Thanks for reaching out to the forums in regards to this issue. I'm sorry to hear
 that the code for Minecraft is missing. Usually these codes that come with our Xbox bundles come in a slip where it has more

</span><span>recommend</span><span> to double check all the contents in the box.

<h2>            Battlefield 3 - Cooking granades</h2>
                    
<p>Solo per informare che ... le granate si possono "cuocere" anche in battlefield 3 !!</p>
<p>E' sufficiente premere il tasto per lanciarle ( LB ) e tenere premuto contemporanemente il tasto di fuoco ( RT ) ... cos√¨ facendo si toglie la spoletta alla granata ma la si pu√≤ tenere in mano prima di lanciarla ..</p>
<p>Ovviamente in quel momento sarete parecchio vulnerabili ma &nbsp;√® una funzione che&nbsp;ho sempre utilizzato parecchio in altri FPS e che&nbsp;sino ad ora ero convinto&nbsp; ( non solo io: che stupore anche tra gli amici questa sera quando ho reso nota la cosa .. ) &nbsp;mancasse
 in BF3&nbsp;&nbsp;!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Una nota generale: ma possibile che uno debba scoprire i comandi "&nbsp;per caso " e non ci sia un manuale da qualche parte ( o esiste ? ) che spieghi tutte le funzionalit√† e i comandi ? Dove sono finiti i buoni - vecchi manuali di gioco ??</p>

<p>Un paio di considerazioni per√≤:</p>
<p>1- il procedimento √® imho abbastanza macchinoso; in altri fps √® sufficiente tenere premuto il tasto di lancio granate e rilasciarlo quando si intende lanciarla
</p>
<p>2- Come dicevo sopra non capisco il senso di non aver a disposizione un manuale -anche in pdf, per l'amor del cielo - &nbsp;con TUTTI &nbsp;i comandi ( per fanteria - veicoli e velivoli ) : sono sicuro che ancora c'√® gente che non ha la minima idea di come spottare
 i nemici o, da caposquadra, impartire ordini ai compagni ... e a questo punto mi chiedo se ci siano o meno altre features "da scoprire "</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Beh, io sono un fissato ( figurati che in MW2 cambiavo le mimetiche delle armi in base alle mappe: non partivo in Sub Base se non avevo il mio ACR mimetico ghiaccio ! )</p>
<p>chess√≤ ... forse le mie non sono le migliori scelte, ma con la mimetica giusta mi sento pi√π sicuro:l'attenzione per i dettagli penso che paghi sempre ... forse l'impatto che hanno nel gioco √® minimo, ma vi assicuro che certe volte mi capita di uccidere gente
 che in OP Metro indossa la khaki oppure altri che girano tra i boschi del Caspio con la navy blu ...&nbsp; distratti&nbsp;( ma ridicoli vi assicuro ) !</p>
<p>Comunque il JERICHO prima di ogni partita si regola come segue:</p>
<p>Caspio : Paratrooper ( US ) - Kit veterano (RU)</p>
<p>Picco Damavand : Navy Blu ( US - RU )</p>
<p>Grand Bazaar : Urban ( US - RU )</p>
<p>Isola di Kharg : Desert Khaki ( US - RU )</p>
<p>Canali di Noshahar : Expeditionary Force ( US ) - Desert Khaki ( RU )</p>
<p>OP Firestorm :&nbsp; Expeditionary Force ( US ) - Desert Khaki ( RU )</p>
<p>Operation Metro : Ranger ( US ) - Urban ( RU )</p>
<p>Senna : Ranger ( US - RU )</p>
<p>Autostrada di Teheran : Navy Blu ( US - RU )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Un'ultima cosa: se mi accorgo che in partita molti nemici usano l' IRNV allora corro ai ripari con la Spec Ops Black meno individuabile dal visore notturno ad infrarossi.</p>

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a windows 10 enterprise, and I have got some odd behaviour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I attempt to access a site that uses https and client certificate authentication I get a 403 forbidden error.&nbsp;&nbsp; This happens for multiple different sites with multiple different certificates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My certificates are all fully trusted and in my local user store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The certificates work on other non windows 10 machines, and we have been able to see on one machine that the https handshake is successful its failing at the client.</p>

<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having a limited or restricted access to a website or directory is one of the possible reasons why you're getting this error when accessing a secured website. For you to be properly assisted on the current issue with your Windows 10 Enterprise, we recommend
 posting this in <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=win10itpronetworking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft TechNet</a> as there are available IT Professionals who can best handle this case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have other Windows concern, feel free to contact us.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for that, I have asked the question on tech net.&nbsp; The problem is not one of security on the website or directory as the error is a 403.7 with the certificate.&nbsp; Addtionally the same certificate and credentials work on other machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks though for the suggestion about technet</p>

            after like 4 hours on the phone with Microsoft and Xbox support. The only solution seems to be escalating the account. My problem still hasn't been fixed, but no other solution has worked yet so hope it does cause it seems like there's nothing left to
 do.

<h3> mike33wj  say:</h3>
<h2>            I am having problems loading Windows 7 driver for Canoscan 4200f from Canon site</h2>
                    I downloaded the driver from the Canon site which&nbsp;was saved in a folder 4200fvst8611a_xpen. In that folder it has created a file called Set Up SG which is a .exe file.&nbsp; When I open that file it goes through Winzip Self Extractor as Canon ScanGear CS 8.6.1a_xp
 Set Up and then nothing happens.&nbsp; Canon have suggested that the I need to find where the computer is storing the extracted file and then run it form there.&nbsp; I've done a system search using 'Canon ScanGear' but it comes up empty.&nbsp; Does Winzip Self Extractor
 store files in a set place?&nbsp; Any other ideas of what I might&nbsp;be doing wrong?

            You're looking for something that doesn't exist. <br />
<br />
Running the original 4200fvst8611a_xpen.exe file installs the scanner driver, including scangear. Scangear is not a stand-alone program, it is only&nbsp;opened during the acquire process from whatever graphics program you are scanning into. Assuming you&nbsp;installed
 the Canoscan Toolbox you can also open Scangear from there by ticking the box labelled "Use the Scanner Driver to make Advanced Settings". Otherwise you never see the scangear interface and&nbsp;it just does a quick scan using&nbsp;the&nbsp;settings for&nbsp;whichever Toolbox
 button you chose. In the Advanced Mode for Scangear you can change assorted preferences including whether or not it closes automatically after finishing each scan.

<p><font color="#000000">I understand that you are trying to use the Imation Disc Stakka device on your Windows 8 computer and would like to have its drivers and associate software for Windows

 way to use it on Windows 8 is to try installing the latest versions of the drivers and the OpdiTracker software in Windows 7 Compatibility Mode and check if that helps. You may use the CD disk that you have received with the device to install the drivers and
 the OpdiTracker software in its compatibility mode. For this, I would suggest you to refer to the article ‚Äú<b><i>Get your apps and devices working in Windows 8</i></b>‚Äù from the given link:</font></font></p>

<h2>            GTA San Andreas Xbox live download disc error</h2>
                    
<p>I deleted the game and re dowloaded it, lost all my progress -.- and found that it was not the mission "monster" that was glitching out the game but rather that part of the map in particular that it makes you drive through. I'm curious if you guys are planning
 on fixing the game from your end, because its clear i cant fix it myself by deleting things</p>

<p>If you could please go through all these steps. Make sure to read through them as a few of them may seem similar but are actually different. I know you said you tried some of this but I would appreciate it if you still tried this all again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. clear your cache and restart your console. Instructions here: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache</a> and if that does not solve it, then try #3 below as well. And then go back to #2 if 3 does not help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Clearing the Marketplace System cache (not just console cache as I mentioned above):</p>
<ol>
<li>On your console, go to <b>Settings</b>, and then select <b>System</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Storage</b>, and then select your primary storage device. </li><li>Select <b>System Items</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Marketplace System Data</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Delete</b>. </li><li>Restart your console. </li></ol>
<p>Try that and then delete and redownload the game if it does not immediately solve the issue. (Step 3)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.. How to delete it (From dashboard &gt; system&gt; settings &gt; storage &gt;select memory unit with GTA &gt; Games and Apps &gt; select GTA game &gt; delete. And then redownload it form your download history. See here:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/962228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/962228</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. If that does not help delete and redownload your profile. See here: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete</a>. When you delete it make sure to select "Delete Profile Only" for the final steps. If this does not work, please try the other 3 things and the 1 below in order again
 just in case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Deleting the game as stated above (#3) then downloading demos until it fills the space (Check to see the total memory space-GB-that GTA takes up) originally occupied by gta, and finally redownloading gta</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope one of these helps you! If it does not then you will just have to wait for Microsoft and Rockstar to find a solution. They do know about the issue and are looking into it.</p>

<h2>            Meltdown &#38; Spectre Update KB4056892 fails and Hangs my PC</h2>
                    <p>KB4056892 patch has failed to install twice on my desktop Dell Inspiron 531. It hangs on reboot. No drive activity, no keyboard or mouse input. I have to power off and do F8 to get into system restore to get the PC running again. &nbsp; After restore, Windows
 Update shows: "‚Ä¢ 2018-01 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1709 for x64-based Systems (KB4056892) - Error 0x800704c8"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until I can figure out with the Dell or AMD what is the issue, is there a way to keep KB4056892 from automatically installing?</p>

<p>I had the same problem.&nbsp; Overcome by:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Downloading "Hide or Show" updates program available from Microsoft</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Turn off automatic updates.&nbsp; Easy for Wi-Fi as just turn on metered connection.&nbsp; Not easy for wired connection.&nbsp; Go to registry and edit.&nbsp; Very good U-tube video on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Run this in admin cmd line:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; dism.exe /image:c:\ /cleanup-image /revertpendingactions</p>
<p>
</p><p>once KB4056892 is downloaded, run Hide/show program and check to hide this update</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Turn on autoupdates.&nbsp; Check by running hide/show program. Update is still hidden</p>

<h2>            APPARENTLY, European servers are now located in Europe...</h2>
                    
<p>So, I was on Battlelog today havin a geez, and one lovely fellow dug up some evidence that in last weeks server migration, they actually migrated the European servers (previously located in the Netherlands), to Redwood City, California. Grab a server's IP
 and check the IP on this website:&nbsp;http://www.iplocation.net/</p>

<p>EA did not moved anything ! Guy who started this whole discussion made a mistake. Website he was using to find servers by IP address was showing him location / place they were registered to / owner etc so it was always California since EA is located in Redwood
