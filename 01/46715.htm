<h2>            Spotify won&#39;t load.</h2>
                    I hope you could help me on this. I was able to load spotify on my computer the last few days after I found it in my files again. Today, I turned on the computer and it didn't open like it usually does automatically. I tried opening it, and it said "Failed
 loading skin" What does that mean, and how can I fix it?? I tried to change the compatibility but it didn't work, and now it needs an administrator password and it didn't need it yesterday. My dad swiped his finger on the fingerprint reader and that's when
 it said failed loading skin. I just tried it again and it didn't ask for the password this time, but two boxes came up. That one that said "Failed loading skin" came up and also, a box with a yellow triangle with an ! in it came up too.Why is this happening?

            Hi IcarusCSGO
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Analysis Results
<br />
<br />File Name:  042519-39890-01.dmp
<br />INTERRUPT_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED (3d)
<br />DEFAULT_BUCKET_ID:  WIN8_DRIVER_FAULT
<br />PROCESS_NAME:  csgo.exe
<br />IMAGE_NAME:  HDAudBus.sys
<br />
<br />B. Third Party Drivers
<br />
<br />None
<br />
<br />C. Recommendations
<br />
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />Type restore point in Cortana Search &gt; Create a Restore point &gt; Check whether against your drive, Protection is ON or not. If not ON, click Configure button below to Make it ON &gt; Now press Create to create a restore point 
<br />
<br />2. Some third party drivers are causing BSODs. To know if a third party driver is one of the causes - Enable Driver Verifier and generate dump files and upload to Onedrive and share the link here (Don't forget to turn off Driver Verifier after the job is done). Do read the instructions carefully particularly how to get back into Windows when you get the crash.

<br />
<br />HDAudBus.sys is a Windows component which means something else drove it into Fault. 
<br />
<br />Further detailed analysis did not help.
<br />
<br />1. Check with Intel Support, their on-line docs and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues. Update the BIOS, chipset drivers, and all the major on-board and separate device drivers (see all methods below).
<br />
<br />BiosReleaseDate = 05/16/2017 &lt;-- BIOS and probably chipset driver dates.

<br />
<br />2. Check with CSGO's Support and Forums to see if this is a known issue.
<br />
<br />3. Run the memory tests (see methods below).
<br />
<br />4. As needed use ALL the methods in the troubleshooters below.
<br />
<br />5. After ALL the above if needed run Driver Verifier to see if it can indicate a CAUSE (see Driver Verifier methods below).

<br />
<br />This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : 
<br />
<br />======
<br />
<br />Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names (and update BIOS and chipset drivers).
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />  
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<br />   
<br />====================================================
<br />
<br />Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in the system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.
<br />
<br />To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.  &lt;-- best method

<br />
<br />For the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool.
<br />
<br />Type in Cortana's search box -&gt;  Windows Memory Diagnostics 
<br /> ........find at top of the list - click it. in Windows 8/8.1/10 the name is "Windows Memory Diagnostic".
<br />
<br />=====
<br />
<br />After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run 
<br />DriverVerifier.

<p>Thank you so much for all these tips and solutions of which I tried to do every single one of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) <strong>Troubleshooting blue screen errors:</strong></p>
<p>I've tried every single method listed there and I haven't recently installed anything new beside a driver updater which I uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp;<strong>DriverView:</strong><br />
After downloading and running this program, I could only update 2 drivers, my internet and sound driver because I cannot find drivers for my other hardware. Also my display drivers are up to date: (screenshot below)<br />
</p>
<p>https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsfFb51dF3BqiG5RoJ7b6RNy1fuw<br />
</p>
<p>I hope you can further guide me on what more should I update and if possible with some exact links, thanks!<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3)&nbsp;<strong>Memtest:</strong><br />
I did a memtest around 2 weeks ago with 8 passes running around 9 hours+ without a single error: (screenshot below)<br />
</p>
<p>https://1drv.ms/f/s!AsfFb51dF3BqiHBGMcBp559vYg6p<br />

I ran driver verifier before actually reading your reply and I got a bluescreen so here is the dump:<br />

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Neither minidump helped at all.
<br />
<br />Run the Intel Driver Assistant to up date the Intel Chipset and other Intel drivers shown in your Driver View list. Be sure to check with the System Maker or Motherboard maker (for custom systems) to see if there is an updated BIOS available.
<br />
<br />Intel Driver &amp; Support Assistant
<br /><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support...</a>
<br />
<br />======
<br />
<br />After the above try installing any problem drivers in Safe Mode.
<br />
<br />And/or use Device Manager - Problem Driver - General tab -  Uninstall
<br />Then manually install the latest driver
<br />
<br />Combine both methods if needed.
<br />
<br />Last method would be to uninstall the driver in Device Manager then click Update Driver (because this might not find the latest versions).
<br />
<br />=======
<br />
<br />Use all the methods in previous analysis.
<br />
<br />After ALL and if needed run Driver Verifier.
<br />
<br />Here to help,

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Your processor appears to be ok, at least as far as the test go.
<br />
<br />What you want to do if update your Intel drivers. The ones listed as Intel in DriverView. So do that in the Intel Driver &amp; Support Assistant link.
<br />
<br />======
<br />
<br />Here is the result from the Driver Verifier minidump which I had failed to notice in your previous reply.

<br />Uninstall it using this method and then reinstall the latest driver from Nvidia. It may be necessary to uninstall again and revert back to an older stable driver. Be sure to check with Nvidia Support and their forums as this could be a known issue.

<br />Do not run HWINFO, the diagnostic program, at all times. So disable it or uninstall it. Diagnostic software can sometimes help discover issues however they can also cause system instability when running other programs.

Even if it was because the card over-heated it still has to be either the GPU or whatever caused/allowed it to over-heat. Or if it was attempting to measure the heat.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You could run Driver Verifier just to see if it helps (and may not).<br />
<br />
Driver Verifier can help find some BSOD issues : <br />

            It seems that we're talking about two completely different things. My replies related to your Windows logon account and its associated profile. Your question appears to relate to your Microsoft Answers account. The two have nothing to do with each other.<br />
<br />
While you are logged on to Microsoft Answers you can click the button labelled "Edit Profile" near the top left-hand corner. You now have the opportunity to change your EMail address. You should also change your password in case the logon at your office machine
 was set to automatic mode.<br />

<h2>            Error code 0x80070057 call of duty ghost</h2>
                    
<p>Since call of duty ghost was on sale this week I have bought the digital hardened edition. However I cannot download it when I press the install button in the store gives my the error code 0x80070057.&nbsp;I don't know why it doesn't work since I have bought
 several other games that day which installed and&nbsp;work just fine. I have tried resetting my console but that didn't change anything I have also tried to download it to an external hard drive but even that it wouldn't do (the hard drive works fine for other
 games). The basic game appeared in my gamelist however if I download it and select manage game the dlc are not available. Any suggestion to fix this would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi burnninggalaxyX, I have this issue since last september, same boat as you I bougth the hardened on sale and got the same exact error code. Contacting the support doesn't help, both xbox and activision can't do anything about it. &nbsp;I think it's a problem
 with the hardened edition contents in it, when you go on the xbox store from the website you can see what's include in the special edition of all games, but not ghosts, nothing in the hardened edition. Anyway, you can go to the season pass page, click on install
 and after that install the dlc one by one, or go to the in game store and install the dlc there, it works for me.

            Hello, 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />Please try the below steps:
<br />First of all:
<br />Try re-registering Store and clearing cache:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8239-re-register-store-app-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8239-re-reg...</a>

<br />If that doesn't help, make sure:
<br />You are not using a proxy server/3rd Party Firewall or a VPN.
<br />The next step would be to disable metered connection if you have set so.
<br />If all of these doesn't help, try doing a repair install that keeps everything.

<br />Please let us know how that goes and  if you need any assistance.

<h2>            A Problem With The Screen Resolution.</h2>
                    <p>So, this might sound a bit strange, so bear with me. So, yesterday, I was playing a game, and it crashed. Okay, but the screen size didn't change back with it. So, I reset my computer. **** happened. So, I updated the display adapters. They DID update, but
 once again, that didn't do anything. So, I deleted the</p>
<p>Display Adapter, knowing that will probably fix it. It did... for a while. After about 5 minutes, back to the ugly 1980x1080 screen size. (Also, should I click "Delete Driver From This Device"? Or with that make this unusable?) I deleted the Monitor, and
 that didn't fix it, so I just want some help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I dunno if this is important or not, but the game was Hello Neighbor, Pre Alpha. I dunno if it is, but hey. May as well say it.</p>

<h2>            Windows Image acquisition stops working - followed by crash</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently running windows 7 on my laptop, recently I've had some blue screens and crashes and I cannot seem to figure out the exact cause or the solution to my problem. I've explored several options, including switching internet browsers (as I noticed
 that my computer would crash right after firefox did, there were some issues with the plugin container not working).</p>
<p>In problem reports I can find frequent instances of Windows Image Acquisition that stopped working, regularly it precedes the crash of the entire system. I ran a system scan, but could find no problems. I regularly do windows updates, scan for viruses etc.
 I've had 5-6 crashes in a month time, making it a bit worrisome, other than the crashes my laptop runs without any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to prevent future crashes or what the underlying problem is? Could problems with Windows Image Acquisition actually be the cause of the crashes or is this a coincidence?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Eva</p>

<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>Windows 8.1 has bad Compatibility for many games.<span>&nbsp;
</span></font></font></font></span></p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">For fixing Mouse lag &amp; freezes I often need to use Compatibility Administrator again and again!</font></span></p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">In win 7 I never need this. In win 7 Compatibility was perfect for new and old apps! Why you killed it?</font></span></p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">So, you want that we love 8.1? As gamer I can't love it! Cuz It have a lot problems!</font></span></p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">I read forum and try all fixes and updates. Including<span>&nbsp;
</span>KB 2908279....</font></span></p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">Games is still has a problems after it. For example, games based Quake 3 engine. I fixed it by Compatibility Administrator. BUT WHY I should use
 it every time!? I never need it in 7! System have problems with<span>&nbsp; </span>

<p><span><font color="#000000"><br />
</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">I know, tomorrow I will find another game and again I will fix it. And I hate it!</font></span></p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">So please fix it for systemwide or create for gamers mouse driver or mouse core update that return Win 7 mouse without NoDTToDITMouseBatch problem!

<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">P.S.</font></span></p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">Now I know, Microsoft have no testers, who playing games you have no gamers in your team! That is why you make this problems! And this is so sad!
 I do not understand why Windows 8.1 not able to provide us normal compatibility like Win 7 or even like Win8!? How we can enjoy it?</font></span></p>

You probably are not using a Microsoft mouse, so it is up to the mouse mfr to develop a driver that works with win 8 not the other way around.<br />

<p>&nbsp; This is perfectly normal.&nbsp; By design, even administrative accounts do not run with full administrative privileges at all times.&nbsp; This is one of Windows 7's more important security features, called User Account Control (UAC).&nbsp; It helps ensures that, while
 running as an administrator, nothing can "sneak by" and make system changes of which the user is unaware.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 update changed Keyboard to US layout. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kentish maid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update changed Keyboard to US layout.</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft applied an extensive update to my PC today, which took some time.&nbsp; This is within MS WIndows 10.</p>
<p>Now when I use the keyboard I get US placing of symbols, instead of UK.&nbsp; This is incredibly annoying since it impacts well used things like email addresses, etc.</p>
<p>I have checked in region settings, but it still shows UK as my default, and only language.&nbsp; This leaves me with nowhere to go to change anything.</p>
<p>This has impacted the whole of my keyboard use, not just one particular program.</p>
<p>It also removed my browser settings and history, which was by default FireFox. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It will now be necessary for me to find a way to stop WIndows from automatically changing my PC - after I can get my keyboard sorted.&nbsp; Will probably have to resort to a restore which is time consuming and very frustrating!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get the keyboard layout back to the way it should be ??</p>

<h2>            Where is Windows Media Player Visualizations&#63; &#38; Why are my songs not playing in order&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I just updated my computer to Windows 7 and got the Media player 12. I do not know where to get the visualizations as I was able to on the previous version. Where is this located on the player so that I can play it. Also, when I play a song, it does
 not go in order but jumps around to a song in a different location. I am not finding this new media player easy to use, it is a bit confusing to me.<br />
I would appreciate any help. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If songs are not playing in order, then might be shuffle option is selected in Windows media player. When you turn on shuffle,
 items will play in a random order. When you change the sort order, the Player rearranges the items in the list and plays them in the newly sorted order, unless you have turned shuffle on, in which case the Player continues to play the items in random order.
 Shuffle option can be disabled when windows media player is in “Now playing” or “skin” mode</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

    <title>Lifecam doesn&#39;t turn off in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lifecam doesn&#39;t turn off in Windows 10</h2>
                    Hi. I noticed today that my webcam light was on, even though I was not using any application that used the webcam. I installed Windows 10 yesterday and am wondering if there are some compatibility issues with the LifeCam webcam. I went to the Microsoft
 download sight, and confirmed that the firmware was the latest version.&nbsp;I uninstalled my LifeCam software and attempted to reinstall LifeCam 4.25.&nbsp;Towards the end of the install process, the following message appeared: "setup cannot continue because an unexpected
 error occurred". Yet when I checked my list of installed programs, LifeCam was there! And the light on my webcam is still on. Any suggestions? Thanks.

I just noticed that the only time my Lifetime webcam light turns off is when the screen goes to sleep.

<p>I was able to resolve the problem. I ran a full virus scan of my PC using Norton 360 and a virus was found. The virus is called W97M.Downloader. Once this was removed, my camcorder operated normally. Strangely enough, when I ran the same scan on my laptop
 computer, the same virus was found. The built in camcorder on my laptop had not had a problem.</p>

            <p>I was able to successfully get LIfeCam HD-3000 working (camera turns off when you're not running an app that uses the camera) by removing LifeCam in SETTINGS|CONNECETED DEVICES, installing LifeCam 4.25 driver (which I somehow found on the web via Google
 Search) and unplugging/replugging LifeCam USB connection to computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow one or all of the above allowed Windows 10 to install the LifeCam properly.</p>

    <title>Does the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool lock itself to one - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shannonjacobs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool lock itself to one computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Starting from this page:</p>
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you click on Download Tool Now (for 32 or 64 bits, as appropriate), the next question is about upgrading this computer or others. By having clicked on this computer, have I already committed to locking the resulting DVD to this particular computer?
 Or is this the same DVD that I can use for any Windows 10 upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background on why the question matters: This is not my only computer running Windows 7 (and I have friends with old computers, too), but it is the only one that is running so badly that I have decided to test it with Windows 10. Part of the negative-trust
 situation with Microsoft is because I firmly believe their so-called upgrades over the last 8 months or so have been causing the computer to run more and more badly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next part of the negative-trust situation is Windows-10-upgrade failures, as in a bunch of them, with 3 GB downloaded each time. I really wish the error messages were more informative, or led to more useful information. So far the only thing approaching
 a consensus seems to be a recommendation to wipe the world if the in-place upgrade has any problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it is certainly possible I will like Windows 10 so much that I will decide I want to upgrade my other machines, but if this DVD is locked to this one, then I may have made another 3-GB mistake. Just because MS isn't paying for my bandwidth doesn't mean
 I appreciate their wasting it because of unclear questions. Oh yeah, and another DVD to burn, too. Obviously, if my choice had been informed (and I still don't know), then I would have preferred to create one DVD that would work for my other machines, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Whenever I deal with MS they treat me like a thief, and I don't appreciate it. THAT is the main reason I have not bought anything from Microsoft whenever ANY other option exists. Of course, MS doesn't care, since they sold the software to the maker and
 I didn't have any choice, did I? (Actually, I did, and I already bought my first Mac, but that's a different story.) So right now the mystery to me is why Microsoft seems to be biting the makers' hand that fed them. Actually more like gnawing off the entire
 arm.)</p>

            <p>It's sort of useful information, and it's clearly presented, but it doesn't really address my question.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps the best approach is to clarify my misconception at that time in terms of how I think I understand things now. The real solution would be for Microsoft to explain things clearly, but apparently it's against their religion or something. The commandment
 against meaningful choice because it would provide too much freedom?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, the download tool now starts with two options. I thought I had gotten there by a path that meant both options were going to create a DVD, and therefore the first option seemed to mean it was now creating a special Windows 10 DVD for this computer,
 whereas the second option would be creating a more portable installation DVD. Perhaps it's really hard for me to guess how Microsoftians think since I don't look at each person as a criminal? My incorrect theory at that point was that the Media Creation Tool
 was about to create a media (a DVD) and if it was only for this computer, then it might be locked down by steps like this: (1) Get the serial number from the computer, (2) Put the serial number in the data, (3) Download the data, and (4) Create the media for
 that one computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In actuality, the first option does NOT create ANY media. The first option is just the same as the Windows Update approach. It downloads everything (around 3 GB (again)) and immediately attempts to install it. It did get somewhat farther along this time,
 but it ultimately failed and reverted to the old OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This question was originally asked during the long download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that obviously led me to trying the other option, which actually leads to a menu of ISO options and a bunch of new questions, but I think they should not be appended here, but should be searched for and possibly asked in a separate post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So let me try to conclude with a short answer to the original question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, I think the first option simply downloads the 'normal' Windows 10 installer for the OS that is running.</p>

            <p>The last comment seems to be quite divergent, but my second comment was kind of a closure for the topic--but I can't mark my own comment as "Answer" or even as "Closure of the question". I actually created a separate thread to address the situation, but
 that one was never really answered either, though I mooted most of it by succeeding without the DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I can report that I do have Windows 10 running on one of my computers, and it runs well enough that I already believe Windows 10 is not a monster OS, but somewhere from good to quite good. Whether or not I will upgrade any of my other computers
 remains undecided. The best candidate is actually my last and largest XP box, but I'm not going to buy a Windows 7 upgrade just to see if it can handle Windows 10. (However, if that machine did run Windows 10 well, then I think it would push me strongly towards
 the "quite good" rating.)</p>

                    <p>-i had updated my windows 10, and then all of a sudden i am in an infinite loop</p>
<p>-i notice all the other videos online allowed the user, after a few restarts, a list of options such as reseting your pc or go into command prompt</p>
<p>-my computer does not give me the option, and probably because it is a custom build and i do not see any options in the Asrock uefi setup either</p>

            On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive

<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.

<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.

<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.
