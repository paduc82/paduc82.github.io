<h2>            Activating Windows 10 with a Windows 8 Product Key After a Hardware Change</h2>
                    <p>I updated to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 a while back and everything worked just fine.&nbsp; However, two things have happened since then.&nbsp; I had to replace my motherboard and processor, and I had to reinstall windows due to getting a virus.&nbsp; When I had to reinstall
 windows, it wouldn't accept my Windows 8 product key, which I am assuming is because Windows 10 won't take a Windows 8 key.&nbsp; I tried working with Microsoft Support but all they managed to do was reinstall windows again without the activation.&nbsp; I decided that
 I'd ignore the problem, but the "Activate Windows" watermark in the bottom right corner is starting to annoy me and I can't get access to all of the features that I paid for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go into the activation settings, I have Error Code 0x803F7001.&nbsp; This means that "We can't activate Windows on the device as the previous version of Windows was not activated prior to upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp; Go to the store to buy genuine Windows."
 From this, it makes it seem like it doesn't recognize that I've ever bought windows, but I in fact have bought it before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem gets worse when I can't remember where the heck I placed my product key.&nbsp; Is there any hope for figuring out how to activate windows without taking my house apart?</p>

 added your Microsoft account and linked it to the digital license on your device, you can use the Activation troubleshooter to reactivate Windows. For more info, see Using the Activation troubleshooter. If your Original Hardware Manufacturer (OEM) changed

<h2>            What does &#91;suspect&#93; mean in e-mail subject header&#63;</h2>
                    Very recently a couple of e-mails I've sent to people I already know have appeared in their inbox with [suspect] in the header. This looks a bit odd. Can you tell me what it means and do I need to do anything to get rid of it ( assuming its something to
 do with my account. Thanks

            Let me know whether you are using Windows 10 default mail app or Outlook. What is your mail client.
<br />
<br />There few possible causes for this.
<br />
<br />1. When you send a mail to many people, the receiver mail server might interpret this as suspected spam branding it as suspect.
<br />
<br />2. Receiver's anti-virus might scan the attachment and brand it as suspect.

<p>Thanks very much for your reply. I'm using the Windows 10 mail app. The three e-mails concerned were just to single individuals and without attachments. I did recently get an e-mail from Microsoft telling me that Outlook was being upgraded "over the next
 few weeks" so I don't know if it could be related to that but I don't actively use Outlook to send e-mails.</p>
<p>If you have any further suggestions please do let me know; its just a bit unfortunate to be labelled as " suspect " ! Thanks</p>

            Hello Graeme, I‚Äôm Virginia an independent advisor here.
<br />Do the recipients have any anti virus software which may intercept mail &amp; mark potential spam or mail containing multiple recipients‚Äô email addresses as suspect? If not then it may well be their mail app/client doing this.

            Hi Virginia, yes I'm sure they do but we were surprised, as these are people I have e-mailed previously on a semi regular basis and this has never shown up before, and I am in the address book of two of them. And these were e-mails to single recipients
 not multiple. Does that help ? Thanks for your reply.

            How often do you email them? Sometime receiving email from the same sender may activate a warning to the recipient.
<br />They may have to create a rule within their email client to allow your address as a safe sender. I had to do this with Windows Live Mail, however I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs possible with the Win 10 mail app.

            Oh perhaps once or twice a month, which is why it was surprising for this to show up now. Perhaps we'll check if it continues. Hopefully it may not, and it may have been a blip. Thanks again

            Yes that is a surprise so we‚Äôre back to the ‚Äòwarning‚Äô being a new feature with the recipients‚Äô email client.

            No, this is definitely not related.
<br />
<br />I would suggest that you keep an eye on your mails and when it repeats again, you will have to log a ticket with Microsoft as this will require the complete tracing of your mail. MS Support can take remote control of your computer and will do relevant diagnosis.
<br />
<br />To log the ticket
<br />
<br />A. Phone - You can talk to support by picking up appropriate country

<h2>            Windows 10 using full memory and crash</h2>
                    <p>Hi ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought HP Pavillion with high end configuration for doing high level performance.</p>
<p>Configuration: Win 10, Core I7, 16 GB RAM. .</p>
<p>
</p><p>But My system is very slow and hanging now compared to my old system of 8gb I3 config. People come and see my lap during work and say "your high end laptop is slow, LOL let me bring my laptop ".&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If I play any game then system will hang for 2 - 3 min and closes all the applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open Task Manager it shows 100 % CPU usage. I am really confused of using 16 GB Ram and I7 config.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I really tried but nothing worked. I am frustrated because of this crash and sometimes I think of quitting my job role because of this laptop's performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help solve this ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OR christmas deal - I am ready to Replace my laptop with laptop of 8gb ram and I3. LOL.</p>
<p><br />

            Hi Mary, 
<br />
<br />I found someone who had luck with this fix on the web
<br />
<br />‚ÄúI learned how to fix this error because I could not open the collection challenges.  You need to open Windows 10 Update  Assistant and select the Download Tool.  Go through the screens until you get to the "choice" page.  Select update this PC now.  It should take about 30-45 minutes and should fix your Solitaire Collection issues.‚Äù

<br />
<br />If that doesn‚Äôt work - let‚Äôs try to run a 3rd party tool - Download and install Ccleaner - <a href="https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner/download</a>
<br />
<br />After installing, run the cleaner, and then the registry tool. Run the registry tool until there are no more fixes to be made. Reboot, and see if you can install solitaire. 
<br />
<br />Let me know and we‚Äôll work through it!
<br />- C

            <p>Hi Yashwanth,</p>
<p>I tried your suggestions &amp; deleted recent Window updates, back to January 6th &amp; it didn't work. &nbsp;This morning I was looking again to see if there where other updates that I should delete that I missed. &nbsp;I went to "settings, update &amp; security, windows update,
 advanced options, view your history, uninstall updates"--I noticed the "turn windows features on and off" option on the upper left of the page &amp; thought I would check it out. &nbsp;I noticed that my "print &amp; document services" box was filled in rather than checked
 (which means that only part of the features were turned on). &nbsp;I check all of the print features &amp; now am able to print without any problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for you help. &nbsp;I pointed me to an area to allowed me to figure out a fix for me.</p>
<p>Donna</p>

not with Retail FPP or OEM System Builder <br />

you need a volume license to use the same Product Code / Key to install on multiple systems<br />

            Multiple Activation Licenses are a specific product under Volume Licensing agreements, normally only available through specialist resellers. Retail Licenses are single device licenses ONLY.

<h2>            Missing an administrator account</h2>
                    
<p>During setup of a new computer with Windows 7, I created two user account, selecting both as administrators.&nbsp; Today while trying to move a program I got a message stating that I can't perform the action because I don't have administrator privileges.&nbsp; I went
 to Control Panel, User Accounts and Family Safety, Add or remove user accounts.&nbsp; Under the names on the icons, the word administrator is displayed, but when I click on a user account and then on Change the account type, both users have the radio button next
 to Standard User lit.&nbsp; I try to move it to Administrator, but the Change Account Type button becomes grayed (probably because I am not viewed as an administrator.&nbsp; So why did the user accounts change mysteriously to Standard User and how can I get them administrator
 rights when I don't see any other user on startup.&nbsp; Thanks!!</p>

            You need to reboot into Safe Mode, then log on as Administrator. You can now modify the privileges of all other accounts.<br />

                    <p>I am using Windows 8.1 Pro. I have 5 Pen drives(Two of 2GB, two Of 4GB, one of 8GB) and memory card of 2GB and 1GB; I don't use all of them at same time, so I thought of using them for readyboost. Now, I want to know that which file system is better to be
 used with readyboost, which out&nbsp;of four file syatems&nbsp;(NTFS, FAT, FAT32, ExFAT) is faster and most suitable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, other if I use removable drive NOT for readyboost, which file system is faster, better and recommended?</p>

            <p>Had this same question a few years ago and after a lot of discussion with file system folks, it basically came down to "doesn't really matter, but we recommend NTFS for the improved resiliency."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason it doesn't matter is because the readyboost cache is really just a single file, so the cluster and block size and methods of the underlying file system really don't matter.&nbsp; But NTFS is capable of recovering from failures on the fly, and thus
 suggested for use.</p>

<p>Hi Harsh.G</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with Shawn.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NTFS is the better option because it is more resilient. Also Windows 8x uses NTFS as the default file system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing to consider is that Fat32 is limited to a file size of 4GB and NTFS is 16TB.</p>

 are several programs that start automatically and run in the background that may interfere with the system. These programs may include antivirus and system utility programs. When you perform a clean startup procedure, you prevent these programs from starting
 automatically.</span></p>

<br />
I don't think you're reporting the error message correctly.&nbsp; Or rather, it looks like your combining two different error messages.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Does the message include "cable unplugged" or "little or no connectivity"?<br />
<br />
Is "Local Area Connection 3" in use?<br />
<br />
Assuming that you don't want to use your Local Area Connection 3 (i.e., wired networking)<br />
<br />
Open Network Connections (Start &gt; Run &gt; ncpa.cpl &gt; OK)<br />
Right-click on the icon for Local Area Connection 3" and select "Disable"<br />

            Your response is a bit garbled, but I understand that you're seeing this error message in a computer that's connected to your router by Ethernet cable.<br />
<br />
Please list all of the icons you see in Network Connections (Start &gt; Run &gt; ncpa.cpl &gt; OK)<br />
<br />
You can also see if the following works:<br />
<br />
1.) Shut down your PC. <br />
2.) Unplug the power cord. <br />
3.) If you have a laptop, remove the battery as well. <br />
4.) Walk away from the problem for at least 30 minutes. <br />
5.) When you return, reconnect battery and power cord. <br />
5.) Start as usual. <br />

            Hi Lisa.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See Fixes here:  
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/windows-10-fix-bluetooth-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/...</a>
<br /><a href="http://superuser.com/questions/823894/how-to-make-bluetooth-mouse-automatically-reconnect-to-my-microsoft-surface-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://superuser.com/questions/823894/how-to-ma...</a>
<br />
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try turning off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Dish Remote Access App - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crazygreekdude  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dish Remote Access App</h2>
                    
<p>I just purchased the <a href="http://www.dish.com/technology/tv-everywhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SlingBox adapter</a> for my dish receiver and can't wait to start watching and controlling my DVR content when I am traveling or not staying at home. I think Microsoft needs to get together with Dish and make a Dish Remote Access app for the 360. I don't see
 why I should buy another box to stream my shows from the Dish receiver to another TV that is not hooked up to the receiver or even to my Grandfathers house when I go stay there to take care of him during the week. The Xbox is capable of doing it and some of
 us don't want to pay Verizon/Comcast (Fios/Xfinity) for their over priced services. Anybody else agree with this? It would be so convenient. For now I guess I'll be confined to using it with my phone, tablet, or Laptop.</p>

<p>I agree with you, I have the sling box also. I went on the Internet explorer app on the Xbox. Then I went to the My dish anywhere website. I could log on but then it wouldn't play anything I clicked on. It kept saying "sorry but your web browser doesn't
 support the sling player." Does anyone else have any suggestions ? </p>

<p>Same here i need this to be here already, why limit us to only Fios and Xfinity, they have made major improvements to the app over the past couple months i was expecting it to already be available on the xbox 360 but they just keep adding pointless apps
 that nobody wants or uses(The Next Level, Pizza Hut, etc) they keep on expanding in all genres of apps except TV, i've seen about 10 new video apps that don't even let you watch full episodes of shows or any content that you would want to watch in the first
 place, Microsoft need to hurry up and talk with Dish to bring the Dish Anywhere app to the xbox360, i better see this added with a whole bunch of better apps @ E3,....also why add 1 pizza app that doesn't even have as many stores across the US as others such
 as Domino's, get the Domino's app as well, what are you guys waiting for.....i have a gaming headset so my tv is always on mute when my xbox is on, i hear everything through the headset, so when i want to watch some of my dvr content from my Hopper with Sling,
 it sucks that i have to switch over and basically have the tv low so i don't disturb others in my house, i don't even do it because i'd rather be able to hear everything as loud as i want through my headset....the tools to make this happen are available all
 we need is Microsoft to make it happen.</p>

<p>And no, there isn't anyone you could talk to about this because it's just not possible. With the move from the original XBOX to the XBOX 360 it was known that in the design and the different ways that developers programmed their games that some games would
 simply not work on the XBOX 360. This is obviously seen with the current list of games, each of them in some way has an issue either with freezing in cutscenes or another generic error. If you want to play your original XBOX games that are not on the list
 then you will need to head on over to an antique shop and purchase a working original XBOX.</p>
