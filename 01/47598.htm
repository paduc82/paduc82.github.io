    <title>Possible cause of network adapter problem in Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Possible cause of network adapter problem in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 home edition. My connection was constantly up until yesterday after i bridged a connection from my wireless router to a virtual machine network adapter that was running Kernel. I was just trying to connect to the
 internet VM and ive never had a problem doing this. We bridge connections in class to VM network adapters all the time. The only difference is that in class we run Windows 8, not 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Point being, since bridging (<em>which did not even work anyway</em>), I disabled the VM network adapter as well as the bridge. The problem is that ever since every 2 or 3 hours ill notice my connection down, troubleshoot fixes it by restarting my adapter
 with a message saying there may be something wrong with the adapter or its settings. All drivers are updated and working properly though. The
<em>details&nbsp;</em>listed under troubleshoot are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Device PCI\VEN_14E4&amp;DEV_4365&amp;SUBSYS_00181028&amp;REV_01\4&amp;4825080&amp;0&amp;00E0 requires further installation.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 10 being new to everyone, im wondering if the problem is with the OS, the virtual machine, or my adapter. Also, if anyone has any knowledge of how i might go about fixing this I would be grateful, I love to learn about this stuff considering
 I graduate from my IT program soon...knowledge is power in this situation. It takes a little while before a reset occurs so it is not a huge issue yet...thanks for reading guys. I hope to get some replies soon</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">P.S. I did a Google search for the device requiring further installation and there were no results.</span></p>

OK here we go!! I'd if this will even get posted ,but for the last year I have had a hacker,hijacker,stalker etc. He has literally metamorphisized my phones into basically junk. I just bought a Samsung 6 edge. I finally got the FBI working the case as I have
 been through 60+ devices. I'm directly tethered to his devices so it looms like I am typing from desk or laptop rightnow. I know this person, name is Brandon Grinstead out of Danville Ca. He told me I would never get online again to further my education in
 computer engineering and he gets to keep stealing my data,media and go through my emails and either shut them down or just pick out of them what he wants. He uses try and is recording me 24/7. &nbsp;I've seen it and how he's doing it and I look like I'm insane
 and as if I'm waiting for the next alien abduction. If you have ANY advice for me. I would surely take it. He has been stalking me long enough. When I got my new phone,2 whole days ago it somehow came equipped with ICE in the emergency phone contacts because
 I've been trying to fill out the FBI ICE3 form. Usually he makes my fonts like a 72 so it supercedes the rest of the page. He's opens my dvr from direct TV and unlocked all the ppv movies as well. Behind this post is a laundry list of phones tablets and other
 devices he's rendered powerless. I'm NOT a hacker. &nbsp;I and my husband work very hard for what we have and I believe that he is using the airwaves to get through. He's been gaming A LOT, using my phone as if it were his and goes to great lengths to keep his
 promise. If this finds it's way to 1 person that is NOT him. Feel free to call me, nothing I have is safe I've seen where he's uploaded floor plans for the building I'm in at the time. HELP please. The local to call , I like to call them will do nothing about
 this. I'm in a very small town in sw &nbsp;kansas. They don't understand an I from AC/DC, yeah the band. God please deliver this post safely. Sincerly, Michele Amack.&nbsp;<br />

            In the aftermath of my first post too the Microsoft Community, be advised that this person is a developer of sorts. Through XDA and using a system Bomgard he has disabled my edge screen to work at all. The fingerprint scan not only doesn't recognize my
 print but won't even allow me to rescan saying NO MATCHES!!!. I LOVE MY new device and would like to keep it, I think of all of my contacts that he has stolen and wonder how much of their data he is currently stealing? My Dr's personal cellphone was in my
 contacts and this person is a heroine addict. I continue to pray for his soul. I just want what is rightfully mine and believe I'm entitled to my privacy and don't believe that I have to share everything I have,especially when it's forced. I hope this finds
 it's way to someone that is NOT in the pirate community. As he has developed these pages himself. Not to bad of a job huh? A beautiful mind is a TRAGIC thing too waste. I'm ready too live with my husband and cats without a third party. &nbsp;

    <title>duplicated accounts with windows 10 mail app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidbarnes44  say:</h3>
<h2>            duplicated accounts with windows 10 mail app</h2>
                    <p>I am helping a neighbour upgrade to Win 10. It went successfully, however we are having trouble setting up mail accounts in the Mail app.</p>
<p>We know there are emails because they were there when we were on Win 7 and also we can see them using internet explorer after the Win 10 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We used add an account, and set up an 'other (POP3)' account, but could not get the emails to sync, even after a restart and look again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next we deleted the mail account and restarted. Then set up the Mail account again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when we go into settings/manage accounts, we see the same account TWICE. When we click on one, in an attempt to delete the account, nothing happens ie we don't get the facility to delete/change the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help please - any ideas as to what to do next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>David</p>
<p>
</p><p>16 July</p>
<p>My neighbour is away at present. On&nbsp; his return I'm thinking of trying the following</p>
<p>1. Remove Mail&amp; Calendar&nbsp;using Powershell</p>
<p>2 Restart the laptop</p>
<p>3 reinstall Mail &amp; Calendar either from Windows Store or via Powershell</p>
<p>4 Restart</p>
<p>
</p><p>My assumption is that removing Mail completely will remove all settings etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this seem reasonable?</p>

Did you look in DXError.log for the causes as recommended by the system? Locate the error log and copy and paste it here, maybe someone can help you resolve the issue.

<h2>            Buy Halo 4 on Marketplace</h2>
                    
<p>Does anyone know if it is possible to buy and download Halo 4 on xbox live marketplace?</p>
<p>I did find a "Halo 4: Forward unto dawn" for 4000 microsoft points on the marketplace but I am not entirely certain that it is the actual game :)</p>

<p>Kind of a long travel for me to get to a store and buy Halo 4 so this would be great for me :)</p>
<p>Thanks for help!</p>

<p>Forward Unto Dawn is the 5 part mini-movie prequel to the game. &nbsp;Since the game just came out, it will not be on Games on Demand for a while.&nbsp; If stores are too far, it may be best to try ordering it online (amazon, futureshop, walmart, ebgames, for example)</p>

<p>New games usually show up on the Marketplace 2-4 months after release so we won't see it there for a few more weeks. &nbsp;Do not buy Forward Unto Dawn as it is NOT an actual game but a 2 hour prequel movie about a group of UNSC recruits.</p>

<p>I don't download full games from Marketplace (unless it's an Arcade game Im interest in). &nbsp;I get them new from my favourite retail stores. That way you get the case and 90 day warranty and don't have to worry about downloading the whole game from internet

    <title>Surface Book freeze - Help&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beardhammer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book freeze - Help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have experienced quite a lot of issues today with my newly bought Surface Book.&nbsp; To ensure I get the best feedback, I will describe this in length.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, this is a Surface Book 1, with a i5-6300 CPU processor, 237 GB saving capacity, 8 GB RAM, 64 bit, Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I got this Surface Book about three weeks ago.&nbsp; Initially I experienced a somewhat slow response when trying to log in, especially from the keyboard - this being after the pc had been in standby/sleep mode for a while.&nbsp; I feared this might have been the
 "sleep of death" bug I had been reading about.&nbsp; However, after installing a large amount of updates, drives etc the problem seemed to disappear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For several weeks now I have tested what it can run and cant run in terms of games and programs.&nbsp; So far, no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But today it has frozen several times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problems occured when I started playing SimCity (the newest version). I think several other games were downloading in the background.&nbsp; After a while, the keyboard started acting up.&nbsp; It simply did not respond.&nbsp; After a while, the game crashed (or more precise,
 the entire pc crashed) and resulted in a blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a restart, I tried running the game in less demanding settings.&nbsp; As I recall, there wasnt anything downloading in the background this time, and I think I had cleared up some more space on the HDD.&nbsp; I experienced a few instances where the keyboard didnt
 respond, but by tapping the keys enough times, it responded after a short while (still very frustrating).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later on I was writing a work related document, were I experienced a slow-responding keyboard at instances where the program had stood idle for a couple of minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, I tried to download another game (again, to see what the computer could handle).&nbsp; The game this time was Splinter Cell: Black List from the Uplay program.&nbsp; As it were over 19 GB, I went and did something else while the game got downloaded.&nbsp; But
 when I returned, the keyboard, the touchpad, the screen - it was all frozen.&nbsp; I had to force shut down.&nbsp; When I rebooted, I saw that the game appearantly had mostly downloaded before the freeze&nbsp; - which had left about 5 GB left of free HDD space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted the game, and tried to run a full system scan with my McAfee Antivirus software.&nbsp; It found nothing.&nbsp; I rebooted, and somewhere along the line, a system update had downloaded - so the screen told me that it was being installed.&nbsp; (Question: do I
 need to deactivate Microsoft Defender, or can McAfee and MD coexist without conflicting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried running a couple of things through Command Prompt.&nbsp; More specifically:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- "sfc /scannow"</p>
<p>- "chkdsk /R"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even those found no issues.&nbsp; I tried diagnozing the memory of the computer as well, but once more there seemed to be no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried once more to download Splinter Cell Blacklist, hoping that the tests I had run had had some impact.&nbsp; But after a while, the entire Surface Book froze once more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time I noticed that the HDD bar indicating space status was red.&nbsp; Previously I had a SP3 with 128 gb, and constantly had to fight with the space limit, more often than not having the HDD bar in red.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am at a loss, and seriously frustrated.&nbsp; Googling reveals that freezes like this has been a problem since the release of the product.&nbsp; I had hoped that updates would have remedied this issues (and perhaps it has in some instances).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then again, perhaps not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general strokes, the Surface Book has been a great upgrade from the SP3.&nbsp; But unless this issues can be solved, I see no other solution than to return the product.&nbsp; I hope I can avoid that.&nbsp; Per</p>
<p>
</p><p>This question got very lengthy.&nbsp; But I am getting desperate.&nbsp; And I need help to identify what it is that's causing these problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi!&nbsp; Sorry for a slow response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I have run Software Diagnostic Kit - but it couldn't really find anything, it seems. The problems I did run into was because I misread when to have the AC plugged in or not.&nbsp; When I rerun it properly, there were no problems left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But, I tried something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issues might have had something to do with downloading games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to download the game again, but this time onto a microSD plugged into the Surface Book.&nbsp; No issues whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried downloading a game about the same size (20 GB), and no issues either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently I have 35-ish GB of free space.&nbsp; When the machine froze last time, I saw that there was only about 5 GB left on the HDD.&nbsp; That might have something to do with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know of any similar issues?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help so far.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, the biggest issue is that I have no clue why the Surface Book froze in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I had the same problem with my Surface Book. AFter spending nearly 20 hours online and trying the various suggestions, I actually uncovered the cost. It is Adobe software that is launched at startup time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you need to do is to DISABLE the following 2 startup programs by going into Task Manager/Startup tab</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adobe GC Invoker</p>
<p>Adobe Collaboration Synchronizer</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not need to disable any other Adobe startup modules.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I disabled the 2 modules above, my Surface Book no longer locked up.</p>
<p>Can't explain why this worked, but it did.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am trying to back up my data in Asphalt 8, a game from the Windows Store. Whenever I try to sign into the app, I get the message shown in the title of this post. I'd love to hear any recommendations, because I've been facing this problem for awhile.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Failure to authenticate your Xbox login information is one possible reason as to why you're encountering the error message "Sorry, we can't sign you in. Please sign in at Xbox.com and then start this app again.", when backing up your game data. For us to
 determine the root cause of this issue, kindly clarify the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you using the same Microsoft account to sign in to the game, the Xbox app, and the Windows 10 PC?<br />
</li><li>Are you trying to back up your game data using an external storage or through the online cloud?</li><li>Are you able to sign in to the Xbox app?</li><li>Have you tried backing up other game data and check if the same issue occurs?</li><li>Are you able to sign in to <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox.com</a>?</li></ul>

<p>When you finish selecting the files you want to delete, click <span>OK</span>, and then click
<span>Delete files</span> to confirm the operation. Disk Cleanup proceeds to remove all unnecessary files from your computer.
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>The More Options tab is available when you choose to clean files from all users on the computer. This tab includes two additional ways to free even more disk space:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Programs and Features.</span> Opens Programs and Features in Control Panel, where you can uninstall programs that you no longer use. The Size column in Programs and Features shows how much disk space each program uses.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>System Restore and Shadow Copies.</span> Prompts you to delete all but the most recent restore point on the disk.</p>
<p>System Restore uses restore points to return your system files to an earlier point in time. If your computer is running normally, you can save disk space by deleting the earlier restore points.
</p>
<p>In some editions of <span>Windows&nbsp;Vista</span>, restore points can include previous versions of files, known as shadow copies, and backup images created with
<span>Windows</span> Complete PC Backup. This information will also be deleted. For more information about System Restore, search
<span>Windows</span> Help and Support for "system restore.</p>

<h2>            how can I check if a password is good enough for a strong password&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've posted because I need help understanding something, at the moment I'm working on what passwords to come up with and I've been to Microsoft's Password Checker, after checking a couple out I found this 'Note' stating that the password checker doesn't
 guarantee security, that it's for my personal reference only, how can I check if they're good enough for a strong password if I can't even&nbsp;USE them, how am I supposed to know what password IS secure, and how can I refer to it when I'm not guaranteed security
 checking for a strong password. As for the 'Note' it came from this Microsoft URL</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/password-checker.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            A strong password is hard to guess. If you write it on the keyboard of your computer it's not secure.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've posted because I need help understanding something, at the moment I'm working on what passwords to come up with and I've been to Microsoft's Password Checker, after checking a couple out I found this 'Note' stating that the password checker doesn't
 guarantee security, that it's for my personal reference only, how can I check if they're good enough for a strong password if I can't even&nbsp;USE them, how am I supposed to know what password IS secure, and how can I refer to it when I'm not guaranteed security
 checking for a strong password. As for the 'Note' it came from this Microsoft URL</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            About this password checker
<p>This password checker does not collect, store, or transmit information.</p>
<p>The security of the passwords typed into this password checker is similar to the security of the password you enter when you log on to Windows.
<strong>The password you enter is checked and validated on your computer.</strong> It is not sent over the Internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Javascript downloaded from the Internet does the calculations on your computer. It uses a HTTPS link, so it will be encrypted and cannot be tampered with. If you have malware on your computer which is&nbsp;monitoring your keystrokes (a keylogger), then your
 security cannot be guaranteed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            I personally wouldn't use an online device to check the security of my password.&nbsp; Whether or not it is supposedly sent over the Internet.&nbsp; However - what you saw is that the web page does not guarantee that if it says your password is a good one, you won't
 be hacked.&nbsp; It is just for reference.&nbsp; It is not commenting on the security of the web page you are using to chekc the password - but of the password - meaning there is no guarantees.<br />
<br />
It's not too difficult to come up with one.&nbsp; 15 or more characters, mix in numbers, letters, symbols and upper and lower case letters.&nbsp; Try not to use your name, family names, etc.<br />
<br />
Come up with a phrase, change it up and make it your password.&nbsp; Get something like KeePass (http://keepass.info/) to store all your password (and it has a built-in password strength meter if you want to use it)<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
Why do I have to come up with a new password?!<br />
&nbsp;--&gt; YD0IH4v32C0m3UpWAN3wPwd?!<br />
(That would be pretty hard to crack and could have come out so many ways.)<br />

            Again - they are not speaking of the web site itself - but of not guaranteeing that the passwords they tell you are secure will be 100% unhackable/uncrackable.&nbsp; It is just a reference site.<br />

<h2>            Unable to select photo for lock screen</h2>
                    Ever since the dreaded Windows 10 Fall update (Windows 10 Home, version 1607, build 14393.222), which annoyingly reset all my privacy settings, I have been unable to select a custom image for the lock screen. (My custom desktop image was preserved.) Under
 the Lock Screen settings, I choose Background: Picture, but the browse button is grayed out. How do I fix this?&nbsp;

            <p>It's a much fainter gray than the Browse button on the background setting screen. The Browse button on the background setting screen works. The Browse button on the lock screen setting screen does nothing when clicked on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a note on the top that states that some settings are managed by your organization. Perhaps that's the problem.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Error with xwizards.dll when setting up new wireless connection&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mjacobs80  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error with xwizards.dll when setting up new wireless connection&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am using a Dell desktop with a Netgear USB wireless adapter. I had been using this just fine at my old address when this computer was running Vista.</p>
<p>I later upgraded to Windows 7 through an online download.</p>
<p>I have recently moved. My desktop was connecting to the old wireless network just fine. However, I cannot add any new wireless connections to use the internet at my new home.</p>
<p>I can see a list of wireless signals, with corresponding signal strength indicator bars, and I get the message "Connections are available."</p>
<p>When I click on ANY of these available connections to use, there is no response from the computer. No hourglass waiting cursor, no dialog box, nothing.</p>
<p>I went into Control Panel and clicked on "Connect to the Internet" under Network &amp; Internet. Doing this caused an error message to pop up: C:\Windows\system32\xwizards.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the
 program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or software vendor for support"<br />
<br />
I do not know what xwizards.dll is, or why it is used for connecting to the internet. I tried uninstalling the Netgear software for the USB wireless dongle and reinstalling it from the Netgear CD-ROM, but that did not seem to change the situation.</p>
<p>I also ran the System File Checker tool. The tool reported that it found corrupt files but was unable to fix them. The System File Checker tool made reference to something called CBS.log. I tried to open that file in Notepad but I got an "Access is denied"
 message (I am logged in as Administrator.)</p>
<p>I am not sure how to repair this damaged file since I do not have a Windows 7 CD (I upgraded via internet and never had a physical CD) and I cannot connect to the internet apparently to download a fix.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<div>Hi <strong>MJacobs80</strong>,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Scenario 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. From which website did you download Windows 7?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As you do not have the Windows 7 disc, lets follow these below steps to troubleshoot this issue.</div>
<div>Here you need to search for the file on your computer and copy the file from the search result and paste the file in the system 32 folder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>To do that:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Click on start.<br />
b. Click on Computer<br />
c. Type in <strong>xwizard.dll </strong>in the search field present in the right top corner of the screen and hit enter.<br />
d. From the search result copy <strong>xwizard.dll </strong>file apart from the one which shows from the path<strong>c:\Windows\system32</strong> and paste it in the below path.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>C:\Windows\system32\ </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Restart your computer and check for the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Scenario 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As you are receiving permission issue when accessing the file CBS.log, lets give permission for the file and check if the issue persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To take ownership of a file or a folder. You must have ownership of a protected folder in order to access it. If another user has restricted access and you are the computer administrator, you can access the folder by taking ownership.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>To take ownership of a folder or file, follow these steps: </strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click the folder or file with the Padlock icon and click Properties.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Security tab, and then click OK on the Security message (if one appears).<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Advanced, and then click the Owner tab. <br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Name list, click your user name, or click Administrator if you are logged in as Administrator, or<br />
click the Administrators group. If you want to take ownership of the contents of the folder, select the Replace owner on subcontainers and objects check box.<br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK, and then click Yes when you receive the following message:</div>
<div>You do not have permission to read the contents of directory folder or file name. Do you want to replace the directory permissions with permissions granting you Full Control?</div>
<div>All permissions will be replaced if you click Yes.</div>
<div>Note folder name is the name of the folder or file that you want to take ownership of.</div>
<div>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK, and then reapply the permissions and security settings that you want for the folder and its contents.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To troubleshoot the issue with Windows Media Player, please follow the steps below to grant full permission to access the location where the file is stored:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the folder where the files are stored and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Security</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Edit</strong>, then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>Everyone</strong> in the box and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Put a check mark in <strong>Full control</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, .mov files are only supported in Windows Media Player 12. Visit this article for additional information on how to check the version of Media Player installed on your computer:

            Hi Spartanz17,
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small utility which will find your Windows 10 Product Key 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://neosmart.net/OemKey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/OemKey/</a> 
<br />
<br />Check which Product Key is actually used on your system for activation
<br />
<br />Then do the same on your brothers system . . .
<br />
<br />On your Brothers system, go to Settings - Update and Security - Activation, what is reported there - it is activated with a digital licence?

            Hi Spartan, <br /><br />This sounds like more of hardware problem if the HDMI isn’t being recognized. Is your brothers PC a laptop or desktop? Let’s check all the connections, and hard boot it down (push and hold power button for 15 seconds) let go, wait 5 seconds and turn it back on. Let me know what happens and where we’re at. <br /><br />Let me know, we’ll figure this out!<br />- C

            Ok, you mentioned HDMI wasn’t displaying, then just mentioned inactive... I want to make sure we’re on the same page. Do you have a black screen and windows won’t boot, or does it boot and windows says it’s not activated. 
<br />
<br />It seems crazy it would deactivate instantaneously. If anything it should of told you that you couldn’t use the key. 
<br />
<br />Let me know where we are at, we’ll figure this out.

            Do you have another TV/monitor to test hooking it up to?
<br />
<br />And you said it boots, and it’s black, just a backlit screen, or do you go to a black desktop, any cursor?

<h2>            Windows Live Mail - Read receipt doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I was testing the "read receipt" option under Windows Live Mail to see what it would do.&nbsp; I sent an e-mail to my sister with "read receipt" checked.&nbsp; However when she opened it, I did not get any notification that my e-mail had been read.&nbsp; Why is it not working?<br />
                </div>

            <p>For you to get a read receipt back, the recipient must (a) be using a mail client program (like Windows Live Mail) to read mail, and (b) that program must be configured to return read receipts. One or other of those&nbsp;requirements is not being fulfilled.<br />
<br />
In Windows Live Mail, when viewing your message list press Ctrl-Shift-O for Options. You'll find the options for read receipts on the
<em>Receipts</em> tab.<br />
<br />
