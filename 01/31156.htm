    <title>Flickering in certain windows tools &#40;services.msc for - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Flickering in certain windows tools &#40;services.msc for example&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I noticed something odd when I was in the services management console.</p>
<p>I go win+r then <strong>-&gt; </strong>services.msc <strong>-&gt;</strong> i <strong>
maximize</strong> the services window.</p>
<p>Then, I'll go with my mouse between the name and description column (to get the black drag cursor icon).</p>
<p>I'll <strong>drag</strong> the description column from left to right.</p>
<p>When I do this I notice certain service names (not all) start flickering. Like quickly disappearing, reappearing.</p>
<p>Now I asked a friend to do the same and he noticed it as well ( I am on windows 10 and he is on 7).</p>
<p>I contacted Microsoft support for it and they said my system files would be corrupted? I found that hard to swallow so I tried:</p>
<p><em>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system</em></p>
<p>Nothing seemed to be wrong.</p>
<p>What I am curious about is... what is causing this behavior? My PC has it, my laptop has it, a friend has it...&nbsp; cant be simply corrupted system files in all cases to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATE*</strong> it seems to have to do something with this setting. </p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>BUT not completely, cause even with the setting of when i drag and let go of my mouse some service names flicker.....</p>

<p>Hi Ronaldo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for bringing this issue to our attention. Upon simulation of your concern, we were able to eliminate the flickering by unchecking the
<strong>Show window contents while dragging</strong>. Try it out and see if it helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the outcome. We'll keep an eye out to your response.</p>

<p>It does not completely.</p>
<p>If you drag left and right and let the mouse go you can still see it a bit.</p>
<p>The funny thing is (and that is why i asked the question).</p>
<p>When you do this thing in like an explorer screen with files/folders it does not happen.</p>
<p>So why does it happen in the services screen? </p>

<p>Thanks for following up, Ronaldo. As mentioned previously, we tried to simulate this issue and were able to get rid of the flickering on our end. Just to verify, can you tell us the specification of your PC? You can find these information by searching for
<strong>Dxdiag</strong> in the search bar. Post a screenshot of the specifications of your PC so we can have a closer look.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nem.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NEMESIS</a>&nbsp;is an XBOX One Community. We find that it's easier to play with others, when we are all on the same system, to begin with. NEMESIS plays a variety of team based, first person shooters, and we are always looking to
 expand the titles in which we support.</p>
<p><em>Currently, we are playing:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Battlefield 4</strong> </li><li><strong>Destiny</strong> </li><li><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</strong> </li><li><strong>Halo 5: Guardians</strong> </li><li><strong>Rainbow Six: Siege</strong> </li></ul>
<p>If it's team based or cooperative in nature, NEMESIS will look into supporting the title.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nem.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NEMESIS</a>&nbsp;is a laid back group of gamers. We play to win, but ultimately we play to blow off steam and have fun. We don't want or need try hards here.</p>

<p><em>Our Leadership is highly active and involved in the Community</em>. Need to speak to someone? Don't expect to wait days or weeks before getting a reply, our management team is on the site and playing XBOX on a regular basis.</p>

Check us out at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nem.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NEM.gg</a>. We take great pride in our site as it's the hub of our Community, events are posted there, member streams, gaming news, and
 much more. We want our members to be able to check out our site, get all the information they could possibly need or want, and then jump in the game. No need to go check out 50 different websites or youtube videos to get the latest and greatest.</p>

 should show up), but the opportunity is there, if you'd like to. We want you to be able to jump online, get into a party with NEMESIS members and start ruining other people's days. Don't play alone!</p>
<p><em>No tryouts</em>. Your skill in a game is relative to how you behave or act. People have good and bad days, and we aren't going to require you to have some super awesome skills, a specific kill/death ratio, or anything to be a member in NEMESIS. If you
 aren't so good, just be willing to put in some effort to learn and improve. If you are awesome, be kind enough to pass on your knowledge and expertise to those of us who aren't on "your level".</p>

</li><li><strong>Play</strong>. We know people just want to go off and play some single player every now and again. But if you are playing a supported title, and you are in matchmaking or something, accept the invites. Why join a clan, if you aren't going to play
 with them? </li><li><strong>Have a thick skin</strong>. We don't take ourselves to seriously. Do something stupid, be ready to be called out on it. It's all in good fun.

<p>Personally, I haven't witnessed anyone who was able to balance multiple games in a clan environment myself. Normally, one takes precedence over the others.</p>
<p>That being said, NEMESIS does support multiple titles and allow its members to be on rosters for any or all of them, as long as you own the game (plan to own the game) and can make a concerted effort to attend events for them.</p>
<p>We do host events for each game, some games have more than others (for example Destiny sports multiple events due to the Nightfall reset and Raids). It all really depends on how you want to play.</p>
<p>Halo 5 is in its infancy, as such we are allowing our members the freedom to just play it over, get into a rhythm they like. In the coming days a lot more events will be planned and hosted for that particular franchise.</p>

<p>Looking for a mature gaming community that you can hang out, meet new people, and have a good time with? Then TRU is the place for you! We strive to bring back what gaming communities originally stood for; That is to have fun, game with friends, and still
 be able to maintain a military-type ranking system for organizational purposes. TRU offers many unique opportunities that other gaming communities don't offer anymore. TRU holds monthly tournaments, recruiting contests, and random gaming events, all for prizes!
 We have many different rewards you can earn by just participating with the gaming community.
</p>
<p>Now, I'm sure you're asking. . . Why does he call it a gaming community instead of just calling it a clan? Well, a gaming community is actually quite different from a clan. A gaming community recruits hundreds, even thousands, of people and have set rules
 and most have military structures. The leaders hold the tournaments and events rather than just gaming online. We also have different areas for different games. For instance, TRU has divisions for Halo 5 and Black Ops 3. We are also accepting different ideas
 for new games. Clans generally only have up to 10 people in them and they are all skill based.
</p>
<p>TRU has systems set up for laid back gamers and for the skilled, competitive gamers. I also want to add that we are looking for many leaders for each division and squads, so if you have gaming community experience, or are willing to learn the responsibilities
 of a TRU leader, then make sure to sign-up and apply on the website!</p>
<p>If TRU sounds like something that interests you then please send me a message via Xbox LIVE or sign-up on the website and forums and then Apply to Join that way. We accept many new members each day, so make sure to head over and check us out! I look forward
 to seeing many of you people on the site and looking around. We did just finish our site, so please excuse the activity that happens daily, we are still getting used to the new features.</p>
<p>We are looking for members who have previous gaming community experience! If you have been in a gaming community at all, no matter what rank, please let me know and we can get you started. We are also looking for members on the Xbox 360 too!</p>

<p>G'day,</p>
<p>Regarding IPv6 address. Contact your ISP to see if they provide it and get them to enable it if they do.</p>
<p>If you have had IP6 address in the past you can clear your MAC address but using System Turn off console should do the same thing.</p>
<p>I would use Settings &gt;Power+startup and do a full shutdown. Remove power cable from console to clear cache and reboot router and wait... until router is fully operational before you power up the console.. So order of power up is Router&gt;TV&gt;AVR (if using)
 then XBox console last of all.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend using a wired network instead of WiFi to connect to XBL via the router.</p>

<p>1. I am using ethernet connection (not wifi) to the router.</p>
<p>2. I have both my Windows 10 pc and Xbox on connected to my router.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My Windows 10 PC can get IPv6 address without any issue, but only Xbox does not get IPv6 address.</p>

    <title>Removal of automatic message on Windows 10 Home Edition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scottberriman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removal of automatic message on Windows 10 Home Edition</h2>
                    <p>I recently read an article showing how you can write a <strong>customized message</strong> that is displayed each time Windows is booted.</p>
<p>The method I used was to run regedit and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I navigated to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/Windows/Current Version/Policies/System/</p>
<p>
</p><p>then modified the 2 entries legalnoticecaption and legalnoticetext</p>
<p>this method worked fine just as promised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that when I went back to undo the process I was unable to stop the message from occurring during startup.</p>
<p>I reversed the steps that I outlined above in order to get rid of the message but the message remains regardless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to hear from anyone who could help.</p>
<p>Thankyou,</p>
<p>Mr B.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>We have told u before, the link you mentioned does not work. They told not to call US Store</p>
<p>Call Indian Store and Indian store is pathetic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can u wake up and solve this issue at INDIAN Store???</p>
<p>This is really pathetic and nobody in Microsoft is bothered to take care of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can not &nbsp;handle your online store why don't you sell media????&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or you dont want PC gamer at all!?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very disappointing.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to stop windows speech recognition interpreting speech as commands</h2>
                    <p>I have the problem where speech recognition in windows 10 will interpret words which I am trying to dictate as commands e.g. it will hear a word, even totally unrelated words, as requesting to close a window or change tabs, which is pretty destructive. The

<p>Dictation works best when you dictate phrases. This is because WSR is not only listening for the sounds of each word but comparing each word to words before or after for context clues. It is good to enunciate each word clearly but not in isolation as this
 may be interpreted as a command.</p>

<p>I have not been using Dragon NaturallySpeaking for several years. However, I seem to recall there is a dictation mode that ignores commands and only dictates.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 keep changing keyboard layout for default system language - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erikwroblewski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 keep changing keyboard layout for default system language</h2>
                    <p>Good evening.<br />
<br />
I know about the various posts on this subject around on MS Community but, for some reason, I am not able to answer/reply to them, so I am starting this one. My problem is this (I will divide it in topics, trying to give a full understanding of why it is a
 problem):<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>I want my OS to be in English Language, by default. My reasons for this are: a) I am trying to improve my skills on English Language, and so, I had been setting up everything I can to use it as default, so I can be more "immersed" on the idiom; b) I am
 studying IT in a regular basis, and my study material are in English more often than not (menus, how-to's, etc, use English terms); c) when I need to find a solution to something technology related, it is easier to find it in English - like I am doing right
 now.<br />
<br />
</li><li>I am born and live in Brazil and thus, my native language is Brazilian Portuguese. Further, all&nbsp;peripheral devices - like keyboards - are tailored for Brazilians, meaning they have a Brazilian Portuguese Layout. That said, I also need to write a large amount
 of text in my native language for professional reasons and thus, I have the Brazilian Portuguese Language Pack installed on my computer (I also have a Polish Language Pack installed because I am learning Polish and it helps a lot when writing, but this one
 does not seem to make difference in my problem).<br />
<br />
</li><li>Since my physical keyboard is a Brazilian Portuguese Layout, I installed this layout on my English Language Pack, and removed the English (US) layout from there (Settings --&gt; Time and Language&nbsp;&nbsp;--&gt; Region and Language&nbsp;--&gt; English United States&nbsp;--&gt; Options&nbsp;--&gt;
 Add/Remove a Keyboard). In my Taskbar, Input Methods, I have both languages (English and Portuguese), and both are using the same Keyboard Layout.<br />
<br />
</li><li>This setting works great, but only until I reboot my system for some reason. After rebooting, the system starts with English Language having an English (US) layout, and no Brazilian Portuguese layout (Polish and Brazilian Portuguese stay unaltered).<br />
<br />
</li><li>Now, the strangest thing: both me and my wife have computers with the exact same model and hardware (Dell Inspiron 15 5547), and both computers have the same Windows version installed (Windows 10 x64 Professional - OS Build 16299.248), both licences acquired
 through Microsoft Imagine, both recently fresh installed (at the same day with 3 hours of difference between them), from the same media acquired through Media Creation Tool, with the exact same basic configuration (the only thing different is "Computer Name",
 a couple of software packages - none from Microsoft - and Internal Network IP Addresses)&nbsp; and, yet, her computer do not suffer from this "bug".</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>So, I would like how can I solve this - aside from stealing my wife's machine - because it is annoying me a lot. I have tried some solutions suggested on the other posts, and none worked - luckily, I created System Restore Points and Windows Registry Backups.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Erik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you have installed the Brazilian Portuguese keyboard layout on your English Language Pack and the changes disappear after you reboot your system, it is possible that the appropriate keyboard layout is not being selected or there are software conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help resolve the issue, you can perform a clean boot by referring to the article on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, you can check the steps provided in the article on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17424/windows-change-keyboard-layout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> on how to <strong>change the default keyboard layout or input method</strong>. Note that the steps for Windows 8.1 will also work for your Windows 10 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Xbox one backward compatibility for Skate 3 not working.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi support,&nbsp;</p>
<p>we have purchased skate 3 for xbox 360, but it seems that the game is NOT backwards compatible, even though on the xbox site they show a picture of this game, which is also the reason my children purchased this game...</p>
<p>Is there a workaround to get this working?</p>
<p>Do you have a date when this game will work on Xbox one?</p>
<p>What options do we have?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<h2>            How do I fix Duplicate ownership for directory Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have been having problems deleting some files and folders since getting a new computer with WIndows 10. &nbsp; I'm not sure what is happening but I did read a post that said to run the system file checker. &nbsp;I did that and I got some errors. &nbsp;One of the errors
 is a duplicate ownership error:</p>

<h2>            My Windows 10 Mail keeps shutting down</h2>
                    <p>When I open the program and wait for sync, it shuts down after approximately 10 secs and doesn't sync. &nbsp;If I click on an older email, the program immediately shuts down. &nbsp;I tried the troubleshooter, I tried uninstalling and re-installing to no avail. &nbsp;This
 has all happened since the last Windows 10 update. &nbsp;Very frustrating. Please help.</p>

<p>We appreciate your response. One of the possible reasons why you are experiencing issues with using the Windows 10 Mail app is due to some software conflicts after the update was installed. To further address this issue, we suggest that you follow these
 troubleshooting methods: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1:</p>
<p>Run the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System File Checker tool</a></strong>. This is a utility that allows users to
 scan for corruptions in Windows system and it can also restore the corrupted files. The link contains further information about how to run the System File Checker tool.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Method 2: </p>
<p>Run the DISM tool. This tool can repair the components of your Windows operating system, and records the corruptions to the log file. The process generally takes 15-30 minutes depending on the corruption and size of the partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To run the DISM tool, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press Windows key + X and then click on Command Prompt (Admin). If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password or click Yes.</li><li>In the Command Prompt window, type <strong>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</strong> and then hit Enter.</li><li>Once the scan is finished, restart your computer. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, don't hesitate to reply on this thread. </p>

                    this device is reconized by my computer but will not load files previously saved to it , i can see them when i look inside the harddrive but when i restore them the restore shortcut always shows as empty. usually Autoplay comes up when you plug it in to
 the usb port and it reads the files adds them to music libraries etc. But now it only plays newly added files.

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Are you referring to Recent Places option in windows explorer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Recently Changed folder is the saved search. This folder is created when 7 is installed and is simply intended to show some of the capabilities of the search component. Some users do not like this folder since it does keep a history of files that have been
 modified on the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can delete all the files in the recently changed folder at one shot instead of deleting individual file and this will not delete your actual file. Just press
<strong>crtl</strong> plus letter <strong>A</strong> key this would select all the files in the folder later hit the delete to empty the folder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            WIndows 10 - Not enough main memory to complete</h2>
                    <p>I have a new laptop and dedicated Windows 10. The validation/sort routine in my accounts package which uses PowerBasic is failing with "not enough main memory....".&nbsp; This machine has 12 GB of RAM, an I7 processor.&nbsp; I checked the RAM usage and have 10GB free
 when running this routine (it seems to use only 0.8MB.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also did a check on the memory and the system found no faults.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same program runs happily on my Win 7 machine that has only 3GB RAM</p>
