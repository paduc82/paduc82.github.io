<h2>            Accessing the resource &#39;Recycle Bin&#39; has been disallowed.</h2>
                    <p>Greetings to the well of knowledge...</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I have a Windows Server 2008 R2 system being used as a Remote Desktop Server.&nbsp; One of the users of this server cannot access her recycle bin.&nbsp; She has no Recycle Bin on her remote desktop and, when attempting to open the Recycle Bin from within Windows Explorer,
 she gets an error: "<strong>Accessing the resource 'Recycle Bin' has been disallowed.</strong>"</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I'm not even sure where to begin looking for where this being disallowed: registry or GPO...or both?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Also when this server was set up, the person who did this removed the "Personalize" item from the Desktop right-click pop-up menu.&nbsp; I can't seem to find the Registry or GPO setting to put this back.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ken</p>

            I have installed Photoshop CC on my Surface Pro 4.&nbsp; It works fine although a bit slower than my desktop PC, which has more powerful processors.&nbsp; While the&nbsp;screen is obviously a bit smaller (you could always hook you SP to an external monitor), you can
 change the menu sizes in Preferences, and the full Photoshop functionality is&nbsp;a massive&nbsp;quantum leap forward over what is available in&nbsp;the iPad Pro (which I tried before switching to the Surface Pro).&nbsp; Using Photoshop you can set the sRGB environment yourself.

    <title>Why can&#39;t I delete a trojan from the System Volume Information - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j gibbons  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I delete a trojan from the System Volume Information folder&#63;</h2>
                    I've seen this before but was just hit with this problem. While viewing some web pages (Yahoo business section) I was hit with this trojan:<br />
<br />
Virus or unwanted program 'TR/Spy.Banker.Gen2 [trojan]'<br />
detected in file 'C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\plugins\npRACtrl.dll.<br />
Action performed: Deny access<br />
<br />
Good, the virus protection worked and I was able to send it to quarantine but now I'm getting this message on a regular basis:<br />
<br />
Virus or unwanted program 'TR/Spy.Banker.Gen2 [trojan]'<br />
detected in file 'C:\System Volume Information\_restore{AE2D1EEE-ADB3-4A87-9E45-504030DE5956}\RP45\A0005265.dll.<br />
Action performed: Deny access<br />
<br />
Why have the Windows developers decided to add a security feature to save trojans and make it so difficult to get rid of them?<br />
<br />
After trying several methods to remove this file and being blocked by Windows I finally booted a Fedora 16 Live CD and deleted the System Volume Information folder from my drive. Because Windows will not allow access to this folder, even with administrative
 access, it is not easy to deal with this problem.<br />
<br />
And don't get me started on System Restore Points which I have turned off!<br />
<br />
Again, I've fixed this problem by using Linux tools but I would like to know the reasoning behind keeping trojans around in places we normal mortals can't access?<br />

            <p>Boot your computer in Safe Mode and manually delete the trojan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reboot your pc, and as it powers back up press F8 repeatedly (before the Windows Start logo appears)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then select Safe Mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then navigate to the path the file is located and delete the file. The folder may be hidden, you will need to Unhide the folder if it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then Click Start &gt; Run &gt; Type in " Regedit " and press Ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then press CTRL + F and search for any traces of the Virus in the registry and delete any. (First make a backup of your registry before you do this)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use your Linux tools to clean any remains of the Virus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows XP always had many security holes, it is a good idea to keep up to date with the latest service pack and windows updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dont download any cracked software or visit file-sharing sites, they are riddled with malware. Some exe's are modified and include additional scripts that download Trojans in the background.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure you're using some kind of firewall, I think Zone Alarm is one of the best ones for Home Users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            For most people, the way that a virus gets into the System Volume Information folder is because the virus has infected a file that is backed up by System Restore. That's not really a problem, because the virus is effectively quarantined unless you actually
 restore using the infected restore point.&nbsp; And after a period of time, the restore point will get deleted as System Restore does its own housecleaning.<br />
<br />
It's possible, I suppose, for a malware author to deliberately store malware in the SVI folder, but I haven't ever seen anyone mention that.<br />
<br />
In fact, the folder you reference <span style="font-weight: bold">is</span> a System Restore Point (the _restore in front of the long string and the sub-folder name "RP45" should have been clues).<br />
<br />
You may think that you have turned off System Restore, but it wouldn't kill you to right-click My Computer, select Properties, and click the System Restore tab to have a look.&nbsp; (I just did that to confirm the method before I put it in this Reply, and to my
 surprise, SR had been turned back on for all of my non-system partitions, including my external drive.&nbsp; I know I had it turned off before.)&nbsp; And SR had gone back to its default of using 12% of my hard drive.<br />
<br />
Because System Restore is an important safety feature, Windows makes it particularly difficult to get at the System Volume Information folder.&nbsp; It's not intended to "save trojans" but to make it hard for people with a quick Delete key finger and too little
 knowledge to seriously damage their systems.&nbsp; You don't need to resort to Linux, however, to get at this folder:&nbsp; "<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309531" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to gain access to the System Volume Information folder</a>."&nbsp; But be careful.&nbsp;
 If you start deleting things manually from the _restore folder, you'll screw up System Restore (but if you want to turn it off anyway, that doesn't much matter).<br />
<br />
System Restore doesn't always work exactly the way you might think it works, but if you check the box to "Turn off System Restore on all drives" and click OK (and agree to the warnings), the _restore folder and all of the RP subfolders in it will be deleted.<br />

I just checked it and I had already turned it off on all drives. The check box is currently unchecked but it shows a status of "Monitoring" on all the drives.<br />

Thanks for the note to check the registry. It reminded me that AV programs don't always do all the cleanup they should. I found no references to the file so I guess the AV got it before it could do anything.<br />

The sentence above isn't consistent with the sentence below.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>The check box is currently unchecked but it shows a status of "Monitoring" on all the drives.<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
Or perhaps you were just saying that you had experienced the same thing I had -- you had turned it off, but something turned it back on.<br />
<br />
<br />
When the check box is UNchecked and the status is "Monitoring," then SR is <span style="font-weight: bold">
on</span>.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
When the box is checked (and OK or Apply has been clicked), the status for all drives will be "Turned off" and you won't have any _restore folder in the SVI folder.<br />

            Sometimes I get ahead of myself. Now I notice the box must be checked to turn it off. I guess some update turned it back on! Thanks for clearing that up.<br />

    <title>Media player library not auto updating for .mp4 files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hyrallih  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media player library not auto updating for .mp4 files</h2>
                    My Media Player video library auto-updates when new files are downloaded/place into my target folders except for files with extensions .mp4. &nbsp;When media player is closed and re-opened, the bottom right corner says that media player is updating the library,
 and does - omitting all .mp4 files.
<div><br />
<div>These files require me to go into managing libraries and remove the shared folder, then re-ad it, which gets tedious with so many files. &nbsp;Is there a way to correct this?
</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you!</div>

            Notepad is a plain text editor, pictures won't be viewable. User WordPad instead.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: wordpad

                    <p>So, rewind 6 months ago: I spent weeks getting my stereo mix to work on Windows 8.1. &nbsp;I tried every single solution, until I finally figured out one that worked. &nbsp;I can't remember what it was. &nbsp;But, fast forward back to now: I just updated my computer to
 Windows 10, and guess what? &nbsp;Stereo mix has disappeared AGAIN! &nbsp;Before anyone asks, no, it's not disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For computer stats, I have a Dell Inspiron 5520 running Windows 10 as of yesterday, 8.1 before that.</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Usually when you install Windows 10 all the drivers for the hardware gets installed with the operating system files. If you are facing any issues with the drivers installation, then I would suggest you to go to the device manager and right click on the device
 so that you will have the option to upgrade the drivers. If you are still facing the issue, then you can download the drivers for that particular hardware from the manufacturers website and install in compatibility mode. Also check with the computer manufacturer
 to see if there are any updated drivers for Windows 10.<br />

            <p>Hello Vijay, and thanks for the response. &nbsp;I think it didn't install this time because it didn't install itself the first time--I had to do it. &nbsp;I tried checking the drivers for updates, and both of them were fully updated. &nbsp;Where can I find the driver I
 need for my computer? &nbsp;If I remember correctly, I had to go in and manually edit some computer file, which said that the thing was switched off instead of on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, here is what I found. &nbsp;I went to the folders&nbsp;C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository \chdrt.inf_amd64_4559154dc75c2011 and opened chdrt.inf, like I did last time. &nbsp;I looked for the words:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>;HKR,%EPattributePath%\EpSettings\StereoMixEnable,Enable,1,01</em><br />
<em>;HKR,%EPattributePath%\EpSettings\StereoMixEnable,MixAssocSeq,1,E0,E0</em><br />
<em>;HKR,%EPattributePath%\EpSettings\StereoMixEnable,MuteGainSettings,1,00,00</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This was the solution to my problem last time: the lines were commented with semi-colons. &nbsp;Only this time, I went in and found the lines, only to find that they were all already uncommented.</p>

            <p>DVD players for desktop PCs run around $20 in Canada.&nbsp; Commonly available in computer parts stores, but all kinds of other places.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To install:</p>
<ol>
<li>remove all power cords</li><li>Hold the ON button in for 7 seconds</li><li>Open the side of the case</li><li>You may have to remove the front panel which probably means lifting a few clips that hold it in place</li><li>There should be two Philips head screws on the side of the drive holding it in the case</li><li>Two wire connectors in the back</li><li>Slide out the old DVD player</li><li>Slide in the new player</li><li>Attach the wires, they only go one way</li><li>Line up the new player in the case so the front panel will match it properly, there may be no adjustability</li><li>Install the two screws</li><li>Replace the covers </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Whole process is like 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Been talked about before. Someone else owned the rights to the site and made it redirect. Funny, but nothing really unusual, like that article is stating. To answer the article's question, though; because Activision already has a MW3 site. Done and done.
 I do enjoy seeing the redirect, though. Pretty amusing, as you stated.</p>

<h3> fortune mile  say:</h3>
<h2>            O365 E5 Plan Skype for Business application for apple watch 3 series&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I checked, and there is no, O365 E5 Plan- Skype for Business application, for apple watch 3 series?</p>
<p>Please update if there is an application currently; if not, when there is one please update this post.</p>
<p>The voice feature to making calls via the Apple watch is&nbsp;equipped with&nbsp;its own LTE,&nbsp;but Skype for Business restricts access to only the iPhone currently, with Windows 10 mobile dead for now and MS Band dead too.</p>
<p>Alerts from mobile application shows up on the apple 3 series watch from Skype but does not provide a GUI to communicate via Skype using the apple 3 series watch and its own data connectivity including wifi.</p>
<p>It seems Microsoft is behind or plans to kill Skype (?); as it is moving away from Consumer services (?). Though this is&nbsp; part of O365.</p>
<p>Anyone else looking for this or requesting same please chime in here.</p>
<p>Thank you !</p>

<h3> nickhello  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Snowball iCE Doesn&#39;t Work on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>**PLEASE NOTE: I DO NOT WANT TO BE LINKED OTHER FORUM POSTS. I HAVE READ THEM ALL AND THEY DONT FIX MY SOLUTION!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello there. Thank you for stopping by my post,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically. I bought myself a new Blue Snowball iCE at Canada Computers for a little "graduating" present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used it for the first night and I worked perfectly for the first 2 days. I unplugged and plugged it back in everytime i turned my computer off and eventually broke the white piece out of the back. I took it back to Canada Computers and the nice gentlemen
 there glued it back in for me. I let the glue dry until the next morning and it ended up not being detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This however isnt like the other "NOT DETECTED" issues like you see online. Mine doesn't come up in my "Recordings Tab" or my Device Manager or my Devices and Printers. Now it did come up as a Code 45 yesterday and I uninstalled the drivers that way but
 now...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I plug my Blue Snowball iCE into my computer, The red light comes on but it doesn't start installing the drivers or show up ANYWHERE including my device manager etc...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC Specs are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>GPU: Asus Nvidia GeForce GTX 750ti</p>
<p>CPU: Intel Core i5-4460 @ 3.2GHz</p>
<p>RAM: 6.00GB&nbsp;</p>
<p>64-bit&nbsp;</p>
<p>Model: ASUS Desktop PC k30AD_M31AD_M51AD_M32AD Series</p>
<p>Windows 10</p>

            <p>Not the way this works for most of the people who volunteer their time and expertise here. hah</p>
<p>&nbsp; (re: your "bump"...)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I implied - you need them to TEST the device on their computer now that the 'repair' was completed - make sure that the 'glue' did not get into something it should not have and has now broken it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise - use System Restore and go back to a time/day before you ever installed the device in the first place - if possible. &nbsp;Beyond that (if the device is functional), you will need to find a way (from the manufacturer) to remove all traces of the device
 so it can be re-discovered.</p>

<p>MY COMPUTER DOESN'T RECOGNIZE MY USB MIC.<br />
<br />
Typically, when there’s an issue where the microphone can’t be recognized by the operating system, there’s a failure in communication between the firmware of the microphone and the audio drivers on your computer. Where the communication breakdown occurs takes
 some troubleshooting to find out. Run through these questions as a quick diagnostic:<br />
<br />
Have you made sure to try all the available USB ports on your computer?<br />
Do you have another USB cable you can try using?<br />
Have you removed any potential devices that can cause interference with your mic, like webcams, magic jacks, etc?<br />
Have you had an opportunity to try the mic on another computer to see how it behaves?<br />
If your mic fails to work on any computer, contact the USB support team by emailing *** Email address is removed for privacy ***."</p>

    <title>GRAVE PROBLEMA SU SKYRIM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laemoth  say:</h3>
<h2>            GRAVE PROBLEMA SU SKYRIM</h2>
                    
<p>salve...chiedo aiuto a voi:</p>
<p>mi si è bloccata la storia su skyrim!</p>

<p>praticamente... nella missione "La stagione Interminabile" ho convinto Angreir (un barbagrigia) ad indire un consiglio per un trattato di pace tra gli imperiali ed i manto della tempesta)Tullius l'ho convinto semplicemente a partecipare,ma quando vado da
 Ulfric Manto della Tempesta questo mi caccia via,dicendomi che devo andare a Korvajund a dimostrare se Galmar (l'uomo che dovrebbe darmi la missione) ha torto o ragione.<br />
ho provato ad andare da Galmar,ma questo mi dice "mi chiedo come tu abbia fatto a convincere ulfric a parlare con gli imperiali,secondo me è soltanto una perdita di tempo" anche se non l'ho convinto,e la cosa si ripete all'infinito.<br />
ho provato a ricaricare il gioco più volte,ho persino trovato questa Korvajund da solo (e colpo di scena:l'unica entrata è franata -.-)<br />
come posso fare? è un bug e devo semplicemente aspettare il fatidico 28 novembre per l'aggiornamento o c'è qualche anima pia che è riuscita a risolvere la cosa e puoi spiegarmi come fare?</p>

            Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It appears that the file association on your computer is corrupted and the default program to open files is set to Adobe.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong>
<div>I would suggest you to set the file associations to default and check if it helps.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Change which programs Windows uses by default<br />

&nbsp;<br />
<div><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>I would also suggest you to&nbsp;refer this KB article that will help&nbsp;automatically fix the file associations on the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>‘When you run an .exe file on a Windows Vista-based or Windows 7-based computer, the file may start a different program’:

<strong>Important</strong> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added
 protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
 Base:

<br />
Wireless mouse or usb mouse you are using?<br />
I hope issue probably driver,Try installing Ultranav or Mouse driver from manufacturer website for windows 7<br />
<br />
Check preferences
<p>From the <strong>Apple&nbsp;</strong> menu, choose <strong>System Preferences</strong>, then choose
<strong>Bluetooth</strong> from the <strong>View</strong> menu. The Bluetooth preferences pane will list the Bluetooth devices paired with the computer, the status of the devices (paired or connected), and whether Bluetooth power is on or not</p>

            Thanks for the replies. I finally figured it myself. I did the following:
<div>1. Right clicked the Parallels icon on the MAC Dock.</div>
<div>2. Clicked on the "Virtual Machine List" subject, and the list dialogue box appeared showing only the Windows 7. To the left was a power button.</div>
<div>3. I clicked on the power button, and it started Windows 7, and the mouse was working perfectly after that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I still don't know how I disabled it in the first place. Anyway, I'm back in business.</div>

                    <p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Specs:</strong></span></p>
<p>Name: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dell XPS 9000/435T<br />
CPU: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Intel Core i7 920 @2.67ghz<br />
Ram: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;24GB @ 1066ghz<br />
Video Card: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Radeon R9 290X / 4 GB of Video Memory<br />
Hard Drive A: &nbsp; 1 x Hard Drive (1TB running Windows 7)<br />
<strong>Hard Drive B: &nbsp;1 x Hard Drive (3 TB running Windows 7)</strong><br />
<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Trying to update to Windows 10 &nbsp;-&nbsp;This is the<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;drive&nbsp;</strong><strong>I'm having issues with described below).</strong><br />
<strong><br />
Note: I am able to boot up windows 7 on drive A no problem. &nbsp;Drive B is the one I tried<br />
to upgrade from WIndows 7 to WIndows 10</strong></p>
<p><strong>______________________________________________________________________________</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Friday evening, 8/21/15, I decided to upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 (<strong>On Drive B which is now the primary drive I work from).</strong> &nbsp;I followed all of the instructions item by item and successfully upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp;After restarting
 as required, I was very excited about how great it looked and how fast it was.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I was upgrading the computer I was on, I chose the upgrade this computer (rather than creating a USB Thumbdrive. file). &nbsp;As part of the process, it mentions that is creating a restore point so I wasn't too concerned. &nbsp;I woke up Saturday morning and
 computer was completely off (I don't generally turn it off so thought that was odd).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I powered on, the computer would not boot, below is a screenshot of the error. &nbsp;And that's when the rollercoaster started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: &nbsp;Safe Mode DOES NOT WORK, NO Restore Points Could be found, NO repairs could be made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I NEED TO SECURE the Data on the Drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP, have no idea what to do next!!!</p>

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you&nbsp;do&nbsp;a startup repair and see if&nbsp;it helps&nbsp;using Windows 10 Media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please click on the link below&nbsp;and refer the article by Andre Da Costa:</p>
<p><strong>How to download official Windows 10 ISO files&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once, you've created the&nbsp;.ISO file, boot from the installation media and follow the steps:</p>
<p>1. At the&nbsp;install screen, go to Repair your Computer &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Startup Repair.</p>
<p>2. Follow the&nbsp;on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Please reply if you have further related queries.</p>

<h2>            Ask for Xbox One Controller repair&#47;replacement when you don&#39;t have a console</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having some issues with my controller. The left stick doesn't work correctly and the right trigger motor doesn't work anymore. The thing is that i can't ask for a repair or replacement because i'm always led to&nbsp;this page (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/fr-fr/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/fr-fr/devices</a>)&nbsp;that
 asks me for my Xbox One serial number before i can ask for support. But I don't have one. I bought the controller to play on PC...</p>
<p>So i'd like to know if there's any way to ask for repair or replacement on MS/Xbox support when you don't have a console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you !</p>

<p>Hello there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for posting on Xbox Forums! In order to request a replacement controller, if it's still under the 90 day warranty, is either through the
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Devices website</a> or to Contact Support. If you do not have a console in which you can use the website to create a replacement order then your next best move would be to
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us#0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Contact Support</a>.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Various Payment Issues - Xbox Game Pass - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spiralgamerpro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Various Payment Issues - Xbox Game Pass</h2>
                    <p><font>I first bought Xbox Game Pass about 3 weeks ago with a debit card, and after my 14-day trial expired, the first monthly payment was taken from my card. Roughly 5 days after that, any time I tried to boot up an Xbox Game Pass game, I was told I needed to renew a subscription. When I went to My Subscriptions, it said that my subscription had been suspended due to a past-due payment. When I went to renew this payment, before I could do anything, I received an error message stating that this payment option had been declined. I tried renewing this from Xbox.com, but the "My Subscriptions" page won't even load. I get an error message saying "Something happened on our end, and we can't show all the data at the moment. Waiting a bit might help," indefinitely.</font></p><p><br /></p><p>I then tried to purchase other items off the Xbox Live Marketplace with this debit card, and they all worked perfectly without any issues. This led to me to believe it was just a problem with Xbox Game Pass.
