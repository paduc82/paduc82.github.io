<h2>            My laughably BAD career in Black Ops. </h2>
                    
<p>Yes. Laughably bad. Purchased on launch day and since have logged better than 6 days into Black ops. My k/d has hit an all time high of 0.67. My killstreak stats are hilarious to most players; a low number of low end killstreaks, about 90 napalm strikes,
 60 some odd mortar teams, and a handful of higher killstreaks that were only obtained through the care package blessing of digital warfare. I have never earned a chopper gunner nor have I ever earned a gunship... Actually I have never even purchased them and
 I am on my 9th prestige!!!! Truth be told I have never earned anything higher then an attack helicopter outside of the care package. I have a highest killstreak of 11 and I would be generous to say I have got 11 kills in a row MAYBE 5 times. My win/loss? forget
 it!!!! I tried to join up with some clans to maybe get my game a lil stronger. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.... No clan in their right minds wants to take a player like me, seriously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been gaming since the launch day of the NES. yea, the first nintendo, kids. Okay, maybe not the launch day but I had one as a kid, and it was still the newest thing out there! anyway... &nbsp;all these years of gaming and having a blast, and today after
 a couple frustrating sessions of Black Ops It hit me....</p>
<p>THIS IS NO LONGER FUN FOR ME.</p>
<p>I mean, who wants to lose that much? I feel like the video game curve has surpassed my skill level about 1 Call of Duty title ago. Yep. In the case of Black Ops, I constantly die from the backside. Or, claymores. Damn they should have taken claymores out
 of objective based gaming. I get a kill. take a death. take a death. get a kill. the pattern repeats it self... I watched a guy on youtube yesterday go 83kills and 3deaths. baffled me worse than sudoku (or whatever you call that stuff)??? how can the ends
 of the spectrum vary so much? It is just a game right? huh? I am lost in the matrix here... years of gaming and successful dueling and not I can't decide if I have burnt out or the gaming world just left me behind at some point. The antiquated gamer. &nbsp;I feel
 let down by my favorite industry ever... and I don't know why? I feel that feeling like when you know you need to break it off with that girl, but you just keep holding on to every little bit hoping it will work itself out. I feel DONE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And... the fork is inserted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your stats are pretty much like myne apart from I got 18 to 19 days game time and am 9th prestige rank 42 my kd is .77 with about 35000 kills and 46000 deaths but I run about like a headless chicken can't stay still for any long time although I keep meaning
 to try. It would be great if I knew which weapon was best to roll with and improve my game was using the famas a lot but kinda having fun with l96a acog at the minute cause get a lot more satisfaction wen I pull of a nice kill but at the same time I'm getting
 twice as many deaths.your not alone believe me </p>

<p>I started out pretty bad. </p>
<p>I am now a 15th Prestige, Level 15 and I am pretty good, I guess. My score per minute stays around 320 and my kdr stays around 2.0.</p>
<p>When I first started, I was excited to get a 1.0 kdr, but stayed around .70 and I have no idea what my ppm was.. probably more like
</p>
<p>Maybe the way you are trying to play isn't what you are good at.</p>

<p>its people like this that ruined online play on all the cod titles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>myself ,i couldn`t care less win or lose,i have no idea what my kill/death nonsense stats are,no idea of killstreaks numbers i have achieved,i just don`t care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the one thing all the cod games need is more people that don`t care,they may well become a much better place to play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OP,ignore all your own stats and everyone else`s and just play for fun.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong... in between feeding opposing teams large amounts of kills, I have a pretty good match occasionally. My biggest failure is getting worked on from my blindside. I've tried theater examination and finding different ways to move through
 maps and dozens of different load outs. People always behind me getting the easy kill makes me absolutely crazy and puts my controllers in some pretty serious danger. I try to play conservative and only rack up 5 or 6 kills in a match with the 5 or 6 deaths
 to mirror them. So, I usually run wild and bank on hopefully catching the enemy off his guard... this grants me more kills in a match but also many more deaths.
</p>
<p>I play pretty much every gametype except SnD, which I really don't care for.</p>

<p>FYI this has been my most successful load out...</p>
<p>Scavenger pro <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">If you are Just breaking even with kills/deaths, scavenger is probably a waste. Maybe try fj if you are rushing or ghost a camp a bit ( if you keep getting killed from behind I would suggest the camping)</span></p>
<p>SOH pro</p>
<p>Tactical Mask pro <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">For modes like dem or dom tac mask is useful, but in most modes you are probably better using ninja or hacker</span>.</p>
<p>AK47 suppressor</p>
<p>Crossbow<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"> Unless you are different than everyone else, the crossbow is more of a novelty weapon. Maybe go with a launcher, even if you arent getting a lot of kills, you can still be useful to your team by taking out air support.</span></p>
<p>semtex</p>
<p>concussion</p>
<p>jammer <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">helpful at times, but personally, I like claymores, they are almost always good for a couple of free kills per match and if you're using hacker, you free up the equipement slot.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">The main thing is to have fun ........ if you arent having fun, then it may be best to put it away for a while. But then again, sometimes just taking the game less seriously can greatly improve your results.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are worried about doing poorly and upsetting teammates, maybe try some ffa. It doesnt really matter what you do there. When I'm just looking for fun, I'll try stupid stuff, like trying to use the crossbow as a primary
 weapon, or just running around stabbing people. Sure you might die a lot, but if you arent too worried about taking even more of a hit on your k/d, you can find all kinds of fun stuff to do</span>.</p>

<p>Right on, a tired old guy. I let the death toll I rack up bug me sometimes. But, I am a just-for-fun player. I could care-less about k/d but it is frustrating that I have been a long term CoD player and at this point I am not a MONSTER!
</p>
<p>I really like the idea of destroying air support to help the team even when i'm getting washed out. Although, I fare really well with the crossbow. it's the only reason I've scored a good number of triple kills.
</p>
<p>Thinking, i'm going to give Black Ops a rest tho. idk?</p>

Good day.</span></strong><span> </span><strong><span>Recently acquired gamepad Xbox Wireless Controller.</span></strong><span>
</span><strong><span>The box says that there is full support for Win 10. The question is as follows: If the gamepad was running on batteries via bluetooth, and then the batteries got stuck, can I connect the gamepad
 via USB and play via bluetooth?</span></strong><span> </span><strong><span>At the moment, the gamepad is connected, moreover, the system sees it (in the Xbox Accessories application), but in the Control
 Panel \ All Control Panel Elements \ Devices and Printers it simply does not exist.</span></strong><span>
</span><strong><span>Accordingly, the game also does not see it.</span>]</strong></p>

                    <p>I have used Photos to edit images, but the edited images are now saved as XML Document rather than JPEG. How do I resolve this as I am unable to see the photos. Thank you.</p>

<p>You are welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like Tom_WC has found the likely culprit: file encryption. Are you using file encryption? That would explain you can read the file - but after writing it - it can only be read again using the computer that wrote it. It must be decrypted first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What form of encryption are you using? I'll try to look it up.</p>

<h3> yohanesandreas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth icon doesn&#39;t appear in action center or in settings.</h2>
                    <p>At first, I can not connect Bluetooth to my speakers and often experience such a signal loss.</p>
<p>Then I update driver from device manager. But still not work. Then I reinstall Bluetooth driver. Uninstall, Restart, and Reinstall. And try to update driver again. But I found that the Bluetooth Virtual Device has nothing or an option to update.</p>
<p>Finally, I tried to uninstall the Bluetooth Virtual Device, uninstall the Bluetooth Driver. And tried to reinstall the Bluetooth Driver (again). And not working.</p>
<p>I give up. So I wrote this, hope someone can help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here are some screenshots what I have done and please give me an explanation and advice if I am doing something wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(NOTE : I no longer install the laptop's built-in driver. Previously, I used a Qualcomm Bluetooth Driver.)</p>

<p>Thank you for your attention and replying my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, the bluetooth icon has appeared. And i've done troubleshooting as you suggested.</p>
<p>However when I try to connect to the speakers, it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>I have no idea. Can you identify what caused it? Could it have anything to do with the registry or something?</p>
<p>If so I hope you can give me steps to fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<h2>            Windows Automatic Update Error 80072EFD - After new HD installati&#8203;on by Toshiba</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>

<p>The hard drive went in my computer and I got it repaired at Toshiba Service centre. Four weeks later and it wont update windows which now causes web site security certificate errors with itunes, banks and paying for items on the web. I have called Toshiba
 and told them when I got it back it doesn't work correctly and they say its not there problem! Windows worked fine before the hard drive re-install.</p>

<p>I have tried nearly every suggestion on windows forums out there and tried to install the windows fix it tool but it wont let me on my laptop. I have also tried installing the Intel driver that people recommend but that also doesn't work. I have malware
 scanned the system as suggested by Microsoft it still wont work.</p>
<p>I keep getting windows error code 80072ED. The only thing i havent done which was suggested by toshiba was do a re-install by holding 0 key when rebooting the computer but I dont want to lose my hard drive and wipe it all. Im using windows 7 home premium.
 Somebody please help.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Too many &#39;service host&#39; processes in task manager taking up disk space</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago I encountered a website unrelated to mozilla try to get me to download a 'firefox update' which I promptly ignored and closed the window. The next day when I turned my laptop on I got a firefox update but I mistook it for the malware I encountered,
 and force closed the update via task manager- while it was updating. It turned out to be the real firefox update and as soon as I closed it I got 'firefox cannot load XPCOM' and wouldn't start so I uninstalled and reinstalled firefox and rebooted, and it worked
 again, but now I have a butt ton of 'service host' processes running in my task manager that were never there before and the 'disk' section in task manager is running at 90-100%. This is not normal for my laptop. It's in the red because of all these 'service
 host' processes. I've uninstalled and reinstalled firefox several times but no luck. Scanned for malware and viruses in case they were causing these service host processes, but nothing came up.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/60f8a44a-0940-4d47-b778-2864498259c7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/60f8a44a-0940-4d47-b778-2864498259c7" /></a></p>
<p>There are more 'service host' processes not in the picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted on <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-performance/a-process-called-service-host-local-system-is/8cb5b527-8ef1-4e8a-8ad1-a9eada572ebe?auth=1&amp;rtAction=1504556190660">
this thread</a> but it's rather old and didn't get a response. I tried most of the solutions there and none of them worked. I disabled windows defender, turned off windows update, turned off BITS, turned off all startup programs, disabled superfetch, but none
 of that worked- I still have a butt ton of 'service host' processes running that won't go away. I also tried 'end task' on them in task manager but when my laptop rebooted they were still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try going into Command Prompt and typing '<strong>sfc/scannow</strong>' as instructed in part of the thread I linked, and when it was done it said "Windows resource protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included
 in the CBS.log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. Note that logging is currently not supported in offline servicing scenarios."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read somewhere else the solution to this result was to use the '<strong>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</strong>' command so I entered that and waited for it to finish. When it did, I got this error:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/21be5905-7176-4525-a79e-d9703fff0ff5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/21be5905-7176-4525-a79e-d9703fff0ff5" /></a></p>
<p>I've been scouring the internet for three days trying to figure out how to remove all these 'service host' processes, and I've tried a LOT of solutions that popped up but none of them have worked :( I haven't been able to fully try the method above because
 of this error, so I'd appreciate some help.</p>

<p>Hi Brianna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why the Task Manager on your Windows 10 computer is showing processes with high CPU usage. It is possible that there are several programs or applications running at the same time or there is system corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have performed several troubleshooting steps, you can do a clean install on your Windows 8.1 computer. Information and steps are on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/windows-create-installation-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi so, I went into Settings-&gt;Change PC Settings-&gt;Update and Recovery-&gt;Recovery-&gt; and chose the option 'remove everything and reinstall windows' That's the same thing you're suggesting, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still having the 'disk' section in my task manager acting up even though I completely removed everything off my laptop and started like new. It's at %100 when I start up my laptop and eventually it goes back down, but it'll go back up to %100 again,
 at random intervals.</p>

<p>Okay so turns out what I did instead was slightly different. I followed the directions from the link you&nbsp; provided and installed Windows 8.1 that way.&nbsp;I used USB to put the installation media on and it took a couple hours. Then ran 'setup.exe' in the USB
 and started downloading. Things went smoothly until it got up to 96% and I got 'Windows 8.1 installation has failed' error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried downloading it again but still got the same error message at %96.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doesn't say what's wrong or give help on how to fix the issue, just tells you it failed and the only thing to click is 'Ok' to close the window...</p>

<p>Turns out I didn't disable windows defender like I thought I did- I went into the actual program and turned off real-time protection, but discovered it was still running in task manager 'services' today</p>
<p>
</p><p>I right-clicked it and pressed stop, but I got 'the operation could not be completed- access denied.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this might be the sole program causing my disk to run at %100, but I can't disable it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried going through this route: Control Panel-&gt; System and Security-&gt; Administrative Tools-&gt; Services-&gt; and double-clicked Windows Defender Service. The option I need to click to disable is there, but it's all grayed out. (It also confirms it's still
 running next to 'service status')</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9478d6ef-ebd3-4734-ae51-30f4f72a05db" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9478d6ef-ebd3-4734-ae51-30f4f72a05db" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to click from 'automatic' to 'disable' but I can't. If I could access these grayed out options, I can see if it's really Windows Defender causing my disk to run at %100. I think this might be what's causing it but I can't access options to disable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured I needed admin permissions to access them. I am the admin account though, and I also tried right-clicking 'run as administrator' on Services but the options are still grayed. I opened Services properties tabs and then the security tab, then clicked
 'edit permissions' but I can't check the 'special permissions' box becuse it's grayed out too.</p>

<p>Thanks for getting back to us. Windows Defender can no longer be disabled but it can be turned on or off. Additionally, you can disable the Windows Defender real-time protection by referring the steps provided on this

    <title>Install Windows 10 using UEFI bootable USB thumb drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> khou17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Install Windows 10 using UEFI bootable USB thumb drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched on this site and others for the past few days and can't figure out how to solve this problem. I have an ASUS X205TA with Windows 8.1 that's currently not booting up properly because I deleted the recovery partition. It's giving an error now
 saying it can't start up with code 0xc0000225</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't mind if that can't be fixed. My main purpose was to free up space for the Windows 10 installation. As I read through the forums now, it looks like I can plug in a USB drive and use that as a "secondary" storage and it will install albeit a bit slower.
 It's too late for that now and I just want to get Windows 10 install if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I read, this laptop is using UEFI instead of BIOS which is new to me since I haven't messed around with the more recent hardware changes. I downloaded Rufus and have set it to GPT partition scheme for UEFI computer and FAT32. I left the cluster
 size at 8192 bytes as well as 16 bytes without any difference. I also tried using a 16GB USB thumb drive and a 16GB micro SD card (laptop has a slot for it). Neither are recognized by the laptop when I try to select a device to boot from. It only shows the
 "Windows Boot Manager" as the only option. I wiped out the USB thumb drive and just put a random file on it. Strangely the drive is detected when I didn't "burn" the ISO image. I also tried using the Windows CD/DVD tool to copy the ISO over but from what I
 read that definitely won't work for UEFI. I got the WIndows 10 ISO file from the Microsoft media creation tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ASUS tech support wasn't able to help me much either on this. I asked if there was a more recent BIOS firmware that may help and was told to download version 208 (I had 205 previously) and that didn't seem to change much in terms of my boot options. Trying
 to see if I can have the legacy mode in the BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks.</p>

            <p>I don't know what happened. Kept trying all different variations in the Rufus app and seem to have it working now. This time I booted up and was able to see the USB thumb drive under the Windows Boot Manager option. I think the only option I changed this
 time around was the cluster size to 4096.</p>

<h3> redlynx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Bug&#58; Task Manager not showing processes</h2>
                    <p><span>There are quite a few people having problems with this issue but the threads are all locked without any bugfix provided by Micosoft. So here we go AGAIN:</span><br />
</p>
<p><strong><span>I have quite a few processes running but task manager is empty! Why?</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reading threads with suggestions I have tried some of the more creative ones like setting regional settings to US (I live in Sweden) I have not, and I will not create a new user account though... Neither will I stand on my head to fix&nbsp;Microsoft‚Äôs bug.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have though run SFC with no errors.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And I have a suggestion that the bug lies in the rendering since toggling the "Always on top" option in task manager toggles the bug from showing or not. However I have found tasks showing with task manager "on Top" AND with the opposite. The&nbsp;<strong>BUG&nbsp;</strong>is
 intermittent but very repeatable.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I find it remarkable that a basic operative systems function like a Task Manager is not working properly in 2018. REALLY&nbsp;BAD Microsoft!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hope my clues here can lead to functioning Task Manager again in Windows 10 in 2018‚Ä¶</span></p>

<p>I had this exact same issue (no processes showing in task manager, no users showing, the same statement if I try to restart, and the same output for "query user." I had the same reaction too; I though I might be compromised. It would be nice to get a response

<p>Same problem showing empty in the process tab of task manager and same problem (warning message) when turning the computer down!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several years ago I asked a colleague who had connection with MS to send a list of problems that I encountered in using the Windows OS. I have not seen any change and improvement since then. For an example, in the file explorer, you have to click the folder
 area (left side) or the file area (right side), not just move the cursor to the particular area, before you are able to scroll the right list. Not very smart, not very considerate!</p>

    <title>Bluetooth will not discover devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tallytiger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth will not discover devices</h2>
                    
<p>I upgraded my Dell Dimension 4600 to Windows 7 (clean install on new hard drive).&nbsp; At first everything worked perfectly.&nbsp; At some point, there was an update installed that included an updated Bluetooth Driver.&nbsp; Now, everything works except for my Windows
 Keyboard and Mouse Elite for Bluetooth. Windows Compatibility Center says it should work with default drivers but it doesn't. &nbsp; I tried rolling back the driver but that wasn't an option so I have uninstalled the device and driver and installed without internet
 connection so it would only install the native driver (verified by date and version).&nbsp; It still will not work. &nbsp; I have searched many forums including this one, probably tried 12 to 15 different proposed solutions and nothing seems to work. Device Manager
 says it is installed and working properly but when I go to Add a Device, it does not find anything (phone, mouse, keyboard) even though I have made sure they are discoverable, have working batteries, etc.<br />
<br />
So, I went out and bought a new IOGear GBU421 Bluetooth 2.1 USB Micro Adapter that specifically says it is Windows 7 compatible. Per the instructions, I ran the Setup from the CD it came with and plugged in the adapter at the time the setup told me to. It installed
 all of the drivers and said I was ready to go. After a restart, I went to Add a Device and just like before it will not discover my mouse, keyboard or phone. I went to the IOGear website and downloaded and installed the updated driver with the same results.
 Still not working. I called IOGear and they stepped me through a few things and still not working. At their suggestion, I took the dongle to another computer that is also running Windows 7. At their suggestion, I just plugged it in and let Windows automatically
 install the drivers. After a restart I went to Add a Device and it worked perfectly on the other computer. So, their suggestion is to go back to my Dell, un-install what I installed from the CD and from the online update, remove the device via device manager
 and have it also remove the drivers, restart and plug in the dongle and let Windows find and install the drivers just as it did on my other computer. After doing all of that, it still will not work on the Dell.</p>
<p><br />
So, I am thinking problem with my Dell.&nbsp; So, I boot to Ubuntu via CD and let it install it's native drivers.&nbsp; Bluetooth works perfectly with Ubuntu on my Dell.&nbsp; So, my reasoning and process of elimination, this has to be some setting with Windows 7.&nbsp; Perhaps
 there is something I did not remove? Perhaps there is a hardware conflict even though nothing shows up in Device Manager?<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a thought on this?</p>
<br />

<p><span>Hi TallyTiger,</span></p>
<p><span>The Dell Dimension 4600 does not support Windows 7 or Windows Vista.</span></p>

<p><span>Unexpected behavior within Windows is to be expected on incompatible hardware. An upgrade install over top of Windows 7 may temporarily resolve the issue but since the hardware

<p>Hi Imran M and thank you for looking into this.</p>
<p>I was aware that Dell does has not tested the Dimension 4600 with Windows 7 nor do they support compatibility with it, but, that doesn't mean it isn't compatible. Also, how do you explain that every single piece of hardware in the computer, video card, sound
 card, usb controller, etc., all function as intended as well as all peripherals plugged into said adapters except for a bluetooth dongle and not just one bluetooth dongle but all three that have been tried?&nbsp; Also, how do you explain that the Bluetooth dongle
 worked before a Windows update was installed and now it doesn't?</p>

            You say pressing it has no effect when the machine is in standby.....Kinda vauge.<br />
<br />
You mean that you change the settings and then when the computer goes in standby you are still unable to wake with your usb?
<br />
<br />
You do mean that you are turning off "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" under power management in device manager?<br />

            I'm having the same problem.&nbsp; The only way to manually wake my computer from sleep is to press the power button, however scheduled wakes like mcupdate work just fine.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The USB Keyboard device has "Allow this device to wake the computer" checked and "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" is not checked.&nbsp; I've also tried setting every USB and HID device like that but it had no effect.<br />

</p><blockquote>I'm having the same problem.&nbsp; The only way to manually wake my computer from sleep is to press the power button, however scheduled wakes like mcupdate work just fine.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The USB Keyboard device has "Allow this device to wake the computer" checked and "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" is not checked.&nbsp; I've also tried setting every USB and HID device like that but it had no effect.<br />

It all worked fine in the RC but doesn't in RTM. </blockquote>
<p>I too have the same issue- the keyboard woke up the computer by pressing any key on it and the mouse woke up the computer just by moving it a cm or 2 (WITH WINDOWS 7) then I upgraded to windows 10 and no matter what I can not get it to wake up-I am using
 a G510 keyboard and Microsoft wheel mouse as stated same components worked fine with windows 7 - the keyboard however quickly flashes the back lights when trying to wake the system but it stays in sleep mode until I press the power key.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for keeping us updated on the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that your system keyboard doesn‚Äôt work when you login to the system using Microsoft Account while it works when you login as normal account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It seems that you have turned on Filter key for the Microsoft account and hence your keyboard is not working.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Filter Keys is a Windows feature that ignores keyboard input unless the key is held down for a significant period of time. It‚Äôs also triggered when you hold down a button such as SHIFT for 8 seconds.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps to disable filter key
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key</strong> +
<strong>R</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type <strong>control</strong></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>ease of access</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>change how your keyboard works</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Uncheck the box which says <strong>
turn on filter keys</strong>. </span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click Ok.</span></li></ol>

                    I am trying, in vain, to access the form to replace the Surface Pro power supply cord that is under recall.&nbsp; All information tells me to go onto my Microsoft account and get the form.&nbsp; No form accessible.&nbsp; Keep getting rerouted to the original notice.&nbsp;
 Very frustrating.

<p>Hey Dorian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though you are playing on PC, you still have a Microsoft account and Xbox profile tied in to games you purchase through our store. The links the moderators provided will help you sort this out by having you log in and modify your online privacy settings
 to your liking. Not all games have the same requirements in privacy, so you will need to find a sweet spot to allow access to everything you need. Hope this helps! :)</p>

<p>Hi Dorian!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying to let us know your account is an adult account. Since you have an adult account and you got a message asking for parental consent, there is a possibility you may be listed in a Microsoft family as a child account. You may wish to have
 the person listed as the "adult" for the <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft family account sign in</a>, select your profile and select remove where parental controls are listed. If that still doesn't work, then you would need to
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact Xbox Support</a> to request a callback to you for assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps out!</p>
<p>Let us know the results please.</p>

<h2>            SFC&#47;SCANNOW</h2>
                    greetings, i had recently done a command sfc/scannow and it came up saying that Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some&nbsp;of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For&nbsp;example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log.
 Note that logging is currently not&nbsp;supported in offline servicing scenarios. i found the cbs log but honestly i did not understand anything found in &nbsp;the log. so am wondering if i should speak to the answer desk about this issue or is this something i can
 fix myself?

            my pc was just glitching out a bit like games i run where lagging and freezing and google chrome kept crashing so i did a few anti virus scans came with nothing so i did sfc scan and i guess no errors where found but still as of right now am not experiencing
 those odd lags and app failures so am not sure if the sfc did do something or a background app was running without permission or didn't close properly.

            but good to know that you guys did fix the sfc function cause it wasnt working before in the early few months of win10 but the false error its giving should be addressed and on a side note will u guys add the safe mode function to be rebinded back to F8
 on before start up? cause its stupid to have it as it is now as to how i use safe mode, for scenarios where a virus is on my pc and it prevents proper start up or it gulich out my desktop how would i access the safe mode to remove it?

<p><span>Do you have Service pack 3 installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You need to be at Service Pack 3 level before you can use Windows Updates.</span></p>
<p><span>To determine which service pack is currently installed on your computer, follow these steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Click
<b>Start</b>, and then click <b>Run</b>.

<span>OK</span>: <b>winver</b>
</li></ol>
<p><span>A dialog box displays the version of Windows and the service pack that is currently installed on your computer.</span></p>

<h2>            Nvidia drivers crash on Windows 7</h2>
                    I recently bought an Amilo Notebook Pi 3540. I installed Windows 7 Professional on it but my the drivers of my Nvidia GeForce 9300M GS keeps crashing. The screen flickers whole the time and eventually it will completely crash (blue-screen error).<br />
I tried reinstalling Windows 7 but that didn't help.<br />
Now I installed Windows 7 Ultimate but it still crashes. This time however my screen won't flicker and there won't be a blue-screen error. The screen just goes blank and the system restarts.<br />
When I searched for the problem I found this analysis:<br />
<br />
On Wed 21/10/2009 9:00:43 your computer crashed<br />
This was likely caused by the following module: nvlddmkm.sys<br />
Bugcheck code: 0x116 (0xFFFFFA8006E054E0, 0xFFFFF880048FE490, 0x0, 0x2)<br />
Error: VIDEO_TDR_ERROR<br />

product: NVIDIA Windows Kernel Mode Driver, Version 186.91 <br />
company: NVIDIA Corporation<br />
description: NVIDIA Windows Kernel Mode Driver, Version 186.91 <br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to fix this problem?<br />

            <p>The tool detected (potential windows update database error) and when i applied the fix i got the message that the issue is fixed. When i ran the tool again, surprisingly, it gave me the same message again regarding the potential database error!!!. So i applied
 the fix again and it said that the issue is fixed, so i ran the tool for the third time and the potential database error still there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>what is really interesting is that I have another MS account on the same laptop (which is even not an admin account) but for my surprise, when i logged into that account and tried to get to the credential manager, there was no problem to get to whether the
 Web or Windows credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This made me wonder that the problem might be a corrupt account. Your advice and recommendation will be appreciated.</p>

            <p>To further isolate the issue, you can try creating another Admin account on that computer and check how it goes. You can start by creating a new User account. Once done, sign in to the PC using that account and do these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Control Panel. </strong></li><li>Click <strong>User Accounts.</strong></li><li>Click on the <strong>Change account type</strong> option.</li><li>Select <strong>Administrator</strong>.</li></ol>

    <title>Windows 10, won&#39;t start applications, mouse won&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cameronmurraytz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10, won&#39;t start applications, mouse won&#39;t work sometimes, only 1 in 3 restarts are viable, generally going crazy</h2>
                    <p>OK so I'm really at a loss as to even what could be happening here:</p>
<p>After a recent update, 2 out of 3 times I turn on my PC (Windows 10, custom built PC) the computer just doesn't seem to behave normally. For a start, random applications won't start. No errors or warnings at all, they just don't start. This includes most
 of the applications that run at startup normally (Onedrive, Dropbox, Plex, a whole bunch of others) and most of what I try and run after startup (Spotify, VLC etc.) but then some applications work fine (Chrome and iTunes seem to work). The computer seems to
 start fine, as I said no warnings and it appears to function properly, sometimes I don't even initially notice since Chrome browser works fine and that's usually what I use most often. After that random things seem to happen, sometimes straight away, sometimes
 after a few minutes. For instance, left click on the mouse won't work, or will only work sometimes. It is not a hardware issue as I have tried multiple different mice, and right click works fine. Then sometimes, the keyboard will stop working, sometimes completely,
 sometimes just intermittently - sometimes just pressing "control + another key" doesn't work, but I can type fine. A couple of times the computer has gotten stuck in an endless loop of restarting explorer; going black, explorer starts without any warnings
 or messages, then crashes 5 seconds later and repeats. A couple of times my cursor just flickers between the regular cursor and the "doing something" cursor with the spinning wheel off to the side a couple of times a second - as if it's doing something in
 the background, I have no idea what though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A random combination of these things occur roughly every 2 out of 3 times I start the computer, and then if I'm lucky the other time, the computer will start fine, with nothing at all wrong with it. Everything works fine, all my applications load and function
 as usual, but sometimes I will have to restart it 3 or so times to get it working like this again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have NO IDEA where to even begin with this, it's intermittent and there are no warnings or error codes I can research. And the symptoms are so scattered and random, there doesn't seems to be anything linking them together. I can't even open certain things
 like parts of the control panel to do diagnosis so I haven't got a clue. Because it's so intermittent, I couldn't say for sure what update caused this, there hasn't been any general windows system updates done in the last week. But for some reason there is
 over 45 updates to the same thing ("Update for Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Update 4 Redistributable Package (KB3119142)") since the start of February this year. They all have the same build code, and they all (bar one or two) say they were successful - this
 seems like odd behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried "Resetting to a previous build" which just gave a generic error, which also occurred when I tried to "Diagnose startup problems". And apparently system restore is turned off for all drives, which I find hard to believe since I used it about
 a year ago. I've since turned it back on but that doesn't help me now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm totally at a loss, so if anyone could provide an insight I would be very grateful...</p>

            <p>Hi BURZYCKI,</p>
<p><br /></p><p>Thank you for bringing this up. Normally, you should be able to see all of your Xbox messages on all Xbox platforms like to your Xbox console, Xbox App on your computer, and Xbox on Mobile devices. It is possible that you're encountering a sync issue on each platform that's why it didn't show you all of the Xbox messages in your account. Can you tell us any troubleshooting steps that you have tried so far?</p>
<p><br /></p><p>In the meantime, I suggest that you try removing your Xbox account on the Xbox app and on the console, and then download it back to refresh your account details. To remove an Xbox account on Xbox One, you may refer to this <em><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>link</strong></a></em>. To remove your account on the Xbox app, kindly perform the following steps:</p><br /><ol><li><p>Press the Windows key on your keyboard, and then click Settings.</p></li><li><p>Select <strong>System</strong>, and then select <strong>Apps &amp; features</strong>. <br /></p></li><li><p>Find the Xbox app, and then click on <strong>Advanced options</strong>. <br /></p></li><li><p>Click <strong>Reset.</strong></p></li></ol><p><br /></p><p>We'll keep an eye on this for you.</p>

<blockquote>While trying to install Office 2007 service pack 2, it keeps failing and shows error code 0x8024002D. Any suggestions?</blockquote>
<br />
Means - a full-file patch failed because the source was required<br />

<br />
Either provide the installation media or download the full SP2 and try installing the update.<br />
<br />
If you download the full SP2, you can burn it to disk and reuse if ever you need to reinstall Office.<br />
