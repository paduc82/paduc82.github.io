<h2>            FSUTIL and Windows Update Failures.</h2>
                    <p>To SandyA1: P A Bear (I reposted, but don't know why you couldn't answer.);</p>
<p>
</p><p>To the casual observer, there just can't be that many issues with hardware, drivers, etc. among us users.&nbsp;(The hardware should have a WHQL, and it was qualified as acceptable, or the Windows 10 operating system wouldn't have installed.)&nbsp;Assuming that this
 is correct, it&nbsp;possible that Windows Update Software&nbsp;may be using the file system USN journal to detect if software files&nbsp;have been installed, and/or, the proper files have been modified in the proper order.&nbsp;There may be something corrupt with the Journal
 Entries or the way it functions. Is there a good way to check? </p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I say this is in the nature of the message telling us that Windows couldn't complete the updates, and it is rolling back. It just seems like a common sense message to give IF Windows Update Software&nbsp;is using&nbsp;the disk's journal&nbsp;method at the end
 of the process to confirm installation integrity. (This is a&nbsp;common practice used by us software programmers.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read some on the fsutil. The command (fsutil dirty querry c:) may not tell the whole story if the journal is nearly full and appending. Looking at SoftwareDistribution, the journal could get so huge
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">that an automatic update to the journal itself may&nbsp;be triggered</span>. Data gets lost or severely delayed in this event, causing the&nbsp;Windows Update Software&nbsp;not to find what it needs to complete the process. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I further found (fsutil USN deletejournal /n /d c:) however; I don't get the warm fuzzy feeling this would be totally safe. This may also not up size the journal to handle the SoftwareDistribution folder's intended tasks. Is there a good way to check size
 needed, and/or can you delete the journal without creating a new one? Are there commands that look into the journal log, determine its size, and can that be compared to the size needed to complete the Update Agent's tasks?</p>

<p>
</p><p>The file system's journal capability isn't designed to detect problem with file integrity on a running system...&nbsp; Instead it was designed to keep track of write transactions in case of a quick eject, power failure, etc. so that the file system could "roll
 back" a partially complete transaction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if a file got corrupted due to a bad download, antivirus twiddling, etc. the Journaling system will not be of any help.&nbsp; In fact, I rather doubt that the Windows Update service interacts with the Journaling system at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might be wrong, but I think you're barking up the wrong tree...</p>

            <p>It is really time to stop guessing... The Windows Update Agent (WUA) API has been around since Windows XP and is well documented.</p>

            <p>Thank you sincerely for your response. Please see the link by srfreeman&nbsp; https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa387099(v=vs.85).aspx</p>
<p>I have pasted an excerpt below. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"System administrators can use WUA to programmatically determine which updates should be applied to a computer, download those updates, and then install them with little or no user intervention.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Independent software vendors (ISV) and end-user developers can integrate WUA features into computer management or update management software to provide a seamless operating environment."</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In my original post, my concern was two fold. 1. Is it possible that multiple processes could be started at the same time by multiple&nbsp;ISV's that are massive enough to&nbsp;trigger an update to the journal that other ISV's were relying on before it slipped off
 of the stack? I can also&nbsp;envision time out errors. For instance, surely the process would be done in 15 seconds, therefore; as a responsible ISV, I'll terminate the process in 20 seconds to avoid malware. I also have no doubt that the ISV&nbsp;has
 wait their turn such that the journal is stable and reliable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was it Einstein who said "We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking that we used when we created them."?&nbsp;I wouldn't hold the Update Agent nor the&nbsp;Journal as infallible, but I'm sure they work well. Now that Microsoft is moving towards "Windows
 as a Service", the&nbsp;possibility exists that multiple vendors are trying to use the journal all at once, and the old&nbsp;tunnel vision thinking of&nbsp;how it used to be OK when used one at a time no longer applies, or&nbsp;to say it another way, is beyond the capacity of
 an old XP component.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was merely&nbsp;hoping&nbsp;I could "flush" the journal analogously&nbsp;to see if it would&nbsp;help similar to flushing the software distribution folder or the database that does not seem to ever work for us&nbsp;by the troubleshooter. (I will go one step further and bet you
 this either is, or it at least could be&nbsp;a future&nbsp;problem without controlling ISVs protocol&nbsp;somehow.) To explain, I have programmed for over 35 years, and I have been caught up in OS architecture changes where older code called a dll that was busy, and&nbsp;a new
 dll was started by the OS automatically, not having the&nbsp;same information&nbsp;as the former dll.&nbsp;Looking back, I can say I had the
<em>"same thinking flaw"</em> when the OS didn't act the way I thought it always did. Our mind needs to get off disk errors, bad sectors, SSD flaws and hardware. Modern hardware is too reliable for that to be the first avenue of approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what do you say? Nothing ventured, nothing gained! Could I get some help with my&nbsp;questions on using FSUtil? We&nbsp;can always that that the Journal has now been shown not to be the problem when we are done!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Thank sincerely for you for your&nbsp;reply. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Great link to add to the discussion</span>! This points directly to a flow chart where Update evaluates the "aftermath" of an update. I believe ISVs are either using the system improperly that provide drivers, software, etc., or, such things are not Windows
 10 approved.&nbsp;To augment the discussion and amplify the questions, and bear in mind they are just questions, please read my reply to
 simply from observing that installations reach 100%, but the Update mysteriously rolls back because something failed in the 'Update Result' section. (It could also explain why some users get unknown errors, or, fictitious error codes that could simply be typo's
 from an ISV's code.)

            <p>Jerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cause of my problem is that Windows Update does not work. "There it lies." For all of us that suffer under the new venture by Microsoft&nbsp;that is trying to move towards&nbsp;"Windows as a Service", it is clear that Microsoft has no answer as to why Windows
 Update does not work. I wish to focus on what side the problem exists by trial and error, if not by reason. Every user had a functional computer and operating system until Windows 10 came out. There just isn't such a massive leap in hardware architecture out
 there to explain it. For instance, if I bought the absolute latest HP, I wouldn't get any more features than I have now. (I might get the next generation in I7, say a 7000 number as opposed to a 5000 number, but so what.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have submitted reports, had tech support, and have lost massive amounts of time doing clean installs THAT NEVER WORK! I'm not going to waste my time here with more boiler plate answers. As a moderator, if you want to knock me off, go ahead, however; you
 just might learn something if you don't. Focus on the questions of users. Ask questions as to what observations led them to their hypothesis. Investigate those hypothesis, or, let others investigate those hypothesis, don't dismiss them from other posts that
 are related, and this forum will be a better place to come. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing I could submit would be helpful related to the questions that I asked. It is up to experienced users to get to the bottom of the trouble, and as you read the post thoroughly, if I'm wrong, or there is something you think might be helpful, ask it
 then. What might be helpful is to compile a list of posts that are update failure related, and then send out a survey asking for the general information you seek. That could be evaluated by "update detectives" to see if a pattern emerges. My guess is that
 will go no where. Why do I say that? Because before Win10 ever gets installed, the computers are checked for WHQL! In other words, it has already been done in the laboratory, or at least, it should have been done in the laboratory. Anything else is just software,
 and the only software in question is that provided by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To continue to get bombarded with DISMs, Troubleshooters, requests for hardware, etc., (and other old ways of thinking) will only demoralize users from pursuing what is going wrong, a ruin the only chance Windows has of ever getting "Windows as a Service"
 off of the ground. I am doing my best to be sincere here! Now, if you do decide to knock me off, is there an appeal process?</p>

            <p>Your rant is replete with misinformation... the noted link does not point directly to a flow chart of any kind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your "The command (fsutil dirty querry c:) may not tell the whole story..." leads some one to believe there is a story to be told, which is not the case. The command - fsutil dirty query C: - simply checks to see if the volume's dirty bit is set.</p>
<div>If the volume is dirty, the following output displays:<br />
Volume C: is dirty<br />
If the volume is not dirty, the following output displays:<br />
Volume C: is not dirty</div>
<p>
</p><p>In your example - fsutil USN deletejournal /n /d c: - the usage of both the /n and the /d parameter simply makes no sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your "...some users get unknown errors, or, fictitious error codes..." is itself fiction.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>The complaints of others are massive that turn out to be ISV oversight, such as UAC hiding prompts that the user never sees cause UAC is on of course, pointing to that such drivers were never really tested. This leads canceled by user errors when the user
 did nothing. It leads to dowloads that are there, but bad Update install results that may come from an unhealthy reliance on journals by ISPs. Millions of users may only send emails and surf the net. Fewer people do real world events. Numbers don't impress

<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried sending it via my e-mail (Charter).&nbsp; It is too large (55mg), so i tried compressing it, still too large.&nbsp; I tried sending it from the file it is in but that is when i get the error message that if there is a mail service loaded it needs to have
 an association with ?&nbsp; The question has been asked and answered out here before, but that was Windows 8 and the free program they suggested is obsolete.&nbsp; Dont know why it is doing this other than Microsoft probably took more than just Word away.&nbsp; I think it
 is really nasty that they want you to purchase a yearly subscription.&nbsp; Anyway, i have also tried to upload it to fb, but they just keep saying to retry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks though</p>

                    <p>Salve, non ne posso più. Ho comprato i due giochi /state of decay 2 e gears 4) circa 1 anno e mezzo fa e ci ho giocato senza problemi per un po di mesi, poi all'improvviso non sono riuscito più a giocare in coop con un mio amico. Ho formatto, seguito qualasiasi
 guida. Sono riuscito ad avere nat moderato e connessione ok nei parametri di XboxLive, ma comunque non riusciamo a giocare in coop. Nelle mie schede di rete non è presente la scheda teredo di cui tutti parlano, ho provato a reinstallarla come nelle guide ma
 non c'è modo di metterla, facendo la procedura di installazione driver da gestione nei driver legacy, non è selezionabile e non posso installarla, ho seguido anche la guida per la disattivazione della stessa ma niente, sembra non esistere nel mio pc . Tutti
 gli update sono installati. Non so più cosa fare, gioco a tutto tranne che ai giochi microsoft mi sembra assurdo. Ho Windows 10 home originale. E' assurdo inventarsi una scheda di rete per far giocare online e poi creare questi problemi.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[Translation - Hi, I can't do this anymore. I bought the two games/state of Decay 2 and Gears 4) about 1 year and a half ago and I played without problems for a few months, then suddenly I could not play in Coop with a friend of mine. I've formed,
 followed by Qualasiasi guida. I managed to have moderate NAT and OK connection in the parameters of xboxlive, but still we can not play in Coop. In My network cards is not present the Teredo card that everyone talks about, I tried to reinstall it as in the
 guides Manon no way to put it, doing the driver installation procedure from management in the legacy drivers, is not selectable and I can not install it, I I also follow the guide for disabling the same but nothing, seems not to exist in my PC. All updates
 are installed. I don't know what to do anymore, I play everything except Microsoft games seems absurd to me. I have Windows 10 original home. It is absurd to invent a network card to make play online and then create these problems.]</strong></p>

            <p>I got the same problem, I found the roots of problem and the way to solve it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The problem was the Windows Update, the newer version of Chinese Microsoft IME Popular Words Dictionary - KB2723161 (Version 16.0.626.1) was detected, downloaded and installed before the Version 16.0.625.1 was detected, downloaded and installed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/771bdc0d-b64b-4b5f-b7ca-296e2f9e02e8" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I searched the "Windows\<font color="#000000">SoftwareDistribution\Download" located the CHSHAP_x64.cab, It&nbsp;was the&nbsp;<font color="#333333">Chinese Microsoft IME Popular Words Dictionary - KB2723161 (Version 16.0.625.1) trapped there for unable to complete
 update process. I extracted the CAB file and manually click install, cannot install with message of "newer version already installed", click uninstall or repair will not work as well,&nbsp;the installer&nbsp;only work for Version 16.0.625.1 only.</font></font></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6769c241-3117-4e2e-abb8-aec8c32ffd66" /></p>
<p>the solution is to get the "<font color="#000000">CHSHAP_x64.cab" <font color="#333333">
Version 16.0.627.1, Version 16.0.626.1 and Version 16.0.625.1 from Microsoft. Manually extract the&nbsp;<font color="#000000">CHSHAP_x64.msi from CHSHAP_x64.cab and uninstall&nbsp;the
<font color="#333333">Version 16.0.627.1 and&nbsp;Version 16.0.626.1, install the Version&nbsp;16.0.625.1, reinstall back the</font>&nbsp;</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#333333">Version 16.0.626.1, Version 16.0.627.1. </font></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>other else, if Version 16.0.627.1 was the latest and does not need the older Version 16.0.625.1,&nbsp;Windows Update&nbsp;should skip the older version check for installation? because it cannot be install with newer version was installed.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Sticky Notes fails to initialize in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fbarros  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sticky Notes fails to initialize in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>I have a recently installed instance of Windows 7 Home Premium. I tried to lauch Sticky Notes and got the following message: "Sticky Notes has failed to initialize (Quit). Please refer to help if problem persists." This message appears again every time I
 log in to Windows. I have also tried running Sticky Notes as an administrator, and it ran fine, so I presume the issue is related to my&nbsp;user account settings. I've already run the "src /scannow" command from an elevated system prompt and confirmed that all
 files are correct in my computer.</p>
<p>Can you please help on how I fix this problem or either stop Sticky Notes from attempting loading every time I log in ?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
Let’s try the below methods and check for the issue.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong>Perform clean boot on your computer.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Starting your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program. This kind of startup is known as a "Clean boot."</div>
<div><br />
Follow the steps provide in the below article to perform clean boot. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note: </strong>To return your computer to a Normal startup mode, follow these steps:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Click Start in the Start Search box. <br />
b. Type msconfig, and then press ENTER.</div>
<div>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or provide confirmation.</div>
<div>c. On the General tab, click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.<br />
d. When you are prompted, click Restart.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong>Check if the issue persists in new user profile.<br />
a. Open User Accounts by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking User Accounts and Family Safety and then clicking User Accounts.<br />
b. Click Manage another account. <br />
c. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
d. Click Create a new account. <br />
e. Type the name you want to give the user account, click an account type and then click Create Account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Create a user account</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it works in a new user account then you need to fix the corrupt user profile. You may visit this link for the steps:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</a><br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Check if you can open sticky note by clicking on StikyNot.exe file in the following location: C:\Windows\system32 (Default installation drive).</div>

    <title>Netbios problems after 1809 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simbee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Netbios problems after 1809 update</h2>
                    <p>After updating to 1809, my main PC was no longer seen by other computers in my LAN.&nbsp; After numerous tweaks to settings, services and registry, it appeared that nothing would get Netbios over Tcpip working.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because it was more than 10 days since updating, I no longer had the option of rolling back. Fortunately I had a pre-update restore point to go back to and as soon as I was back on 1803, the PC was visible again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have others had this problem with 1809? Is there a solution?&nbsp; Obviously I will not be re-updating to 1809 until the file deletion issues - and this Netbios one - are solved.</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Microsoft has withdrawn V1809 Update due to file loss and other issues.
<br />
<br />When V1809 will be re-released, wait for sometime and if no such critical issue reported, go ahead and upgrade. We hope Microsoft will fix all these issues and then only release the update again.
<br />
<br />Good luck!

            At first, try scanning your system for PUP (potentially unwanted programs) using some antivirus software like Malwarebytes (download a PRO version and use it in trial mode, you will be good to go). You can try another one from Symantec, TrendMicro or Kaspersky,
 whatever you prefer. Most of this software is capable of at least finding such unwanted software.
<p>
</p><p>Additionally,&nbsp; try using Microsoft Installer Cleanup tool (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Installer_CleanUp_Utility) to clean up&nbsp;remnants of program components&nbsp;and&nbsp;HijackThis tool (https://sourceforge.net/projects/hjt/) to cleanup traces of this program
 if any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't want to use Windows Installer Cleanup tool as it was long time abandoned by Microsoft, use their FixIt tool, which you can grab from here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17588/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed\</p>
<p>
</p><p>When nothing helps, try cleaner tools like CCleaner or Revo Uninstaller, although personally I wouldn't advocate for using such tools; some people say the tools worked fine for them, so you may at least write their names down to try them out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side note,&nbsp;avoid tweaker/driver downloading tools. If you need a driver use Device Manager | Properties | Details | Hardware Ids to find out vendor identifier and hardware identifier of the devices that's missing the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Such 'helper' software is often kind of scamware and hard to remove afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't hesitate to ask more.</p>

<p>I recently began getting pop ups about slim cleaner. I have a new computer that is less than a month old. Slim cleaner is pulling up items from 3 or 4 &nbsp;years ago from an old computer. They need to be banned from PC's and other devices what can be done about

            <p>Hey there.<br /><br />Your laptop would need to have an HDMI-in port rather than an HDMI-out port. Unfortunately most laptops on the market don't include an HDMI-in. If you have Windows 10 and your laptop has the supporting hardware you can stream your Xbox One through your home network.</p>

    <title>Windows XP&#58; Media player suddenly stops playing DVDs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wolind quark  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP&#58; Media player suddenly stops playing DVDs</h2>
                    
<p>For some reason, Media player has stopped playing any DVDs.&nbsp; It was fine untill recently, and I watched them quite regularly, but they have spontainiously stopped working.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no idea why.&nbsp; Here is the message that comes up when I try.</p>
<p><strong><em>Windows Media Player cannot play this DVD because there is a problem with digital copy protection between your DVD drive, decoder, and video card. Try installing an updated driver for your video card.</em></strong></p>
<p>If it helps, I had been using <em>Nero Showtime</em> to watch some movies, but then the "free trial period" ran out.(why did I have to pay for it if it was free anyway???).&nbsp;&nbsp;media player&nbsp;is version 11.0.5721.5145</p>
<p>&nbsp; I had tried to copy some files from my own DVD onto the computer so I wouldn't have to find the disc every time I wanted to watch it prior to the problem starting.&nbsp; Also, It<em>only</em> happens with DVDs, if the files are allready on the computer then
 it works fine.</p>
<p>I hope the I have given enough information for you to be able to solve the problem...</p>

<p>Nice try, but it didn't work.&nbsp; the first file was for media player&nbsp; 10 not 11, and the second is bigger than I care to attempt to download(not to mention that it wasn't for the appropriate version of media player).</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?&nbsp; If it helps, Shortly before the problem occured there was also a problem with the audio not working.&nbsp; It could play DVDs, but without sound.&nbsp; sound worked with everything else.&nbsp; I can't think of anything else that might help.</p>

            Rightio then, seing as no-one else seems to have any suggestions on downloading software, I come to the next step: Should I take it to my local computer shop and ask if they know how to fix it? If there is free software on the internet I might as well
 use that, but as so far nothing's worked, I think it might be time to try my computer shop. If no-one can answer my question then I guess I'll just have to take it to the experts...

<p>People would offer more help, if you would try their suggestions instead of dismissing them out of hand. You never responded to<span>S.Sengupta's suggestion. The codec checkup utility will determine whether or not you have a valid DVD decoder on your system
 (it doesn't matter what version of MP you have, you still need a decoder with XP).</span></p>
<p><span>Run the utility and report back.</span></p>
<p><span>The second file is a DVD decoder trial, the other software you had on your system may have corrupted or demoted the proper decoder. The nVidia decoder will make itself preferred and is free for 30-days. If that fixes the problem, then you need to either
 pay the $20 for the decoder or figure out what original decoder came with your system, find the discs, and reinstall that one.</span></p>
<p><span>You could also check to see if you have current and proper drivers for the vidio card as well.</span></p>

<p>Ok, maybe I didn't make myself clear enough...</p>
<p>I <em>Have</em> tried the first download(and I had at the time of writing that response, but was just expecting it to fix the problem), and That told me that I didn't have an appropriate driver installed.&nbsp; ok, so I have buy a new driver.&nbsp; but why did it
 suddenly stop?&nbsp; it was working fine for quite a while before stopping, and I am certain&nbsp;that it wasn't a temporary driver.&nbsp; seing as it looks like I'm going to have to buy a new driver anyway, can you tell me what you think might have gone wrong with it so
 i can hopefully try to avoid a similar situation in the near future?</p>

<p>You keep mentioning&nbsp;a "driver" -- do you mean the decoder (which is what the utility checks)? A driver refers to a piece of software that tell hardware (like a video card or printer) how to interact with the operating system. The decoder is softare that
 works in conjuction with a media playing application to tell it how to decipher a file into music or video.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, if your system came with a DVD decoder, then it is possible that something you installed recently removed it. You mentioned Nero, did it work before installing that? If so, the Nero app may have replaced the original decoder, leaving you
 with no decoder after the Nero trial ran out. If a decoder came with the system originally, then find the setup/install discs and see if there is a way to reinstall it (or check at the manufacturer's web site and see if it can be downloaded).</p>
<p>Otherwise, download and install the trial of the nVidia decoder to verify that is the problem.</p>

<p>I've recently upgraded my system hardware to multi-core CPU and a GPU which is capable of nVidia pure video acceleration.&nbsp; Admittedly, I didn't have a clue what that message about 'copy protection' problems meant when I had seen it in the past.</p>
<p>You had written:</p>
<p>"<strong><em>Windows Media Player cannot play this DVD because there is a problem with digital copy protection between your DVD drive, decoder, and video card. Try installing an updated driver for your video card."&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p>Me--I notice you don't mention what kind of graphics card Windows wants an updated driver for.&nbsp; It's only my two cents for anyone else out there who'd like to iron out their Media Player capabilities, but sometimes the "updated driver" is less stable than
 the one I was previously using.&nbsp; And that's in spite of hundreds of dollars in hardware upgrades.</p>
<p>One software featured an 'Interactual Player' that would load the DVD headers and then demand that I tamper with screen resolution and 16bit color, (like your's did).&nbsp; And besides yielding an unsatisfactory 800 x 600 screen rez, it still wouldn't play anything
 more than the header.&nbsp; It's decoder was valid for uTube, but not for DVD's.&nbsp; Which, by the way, I only discovered by uninstalling that player/decoder, and then uTube stalled out, loaded really really slow, and sometimes not at all.&nbsp; I intimate it was only
 functioning on 'browser' conversions, and standard OS codecs.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Social Answers forum, I've now loaded two fully functional players/decoders from sources referenced here in the Microsoft knowledge/answers database.&nbsp; Anyone building up their system or adding new DVD equipment should see this resource:</p>

<p>OK. Ran the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>That tells me that the Apps Store Cache is corrupted.</p>
<p>So .................</p>
<p>yes, I "need further help", - how do I un-corrupt it?</p>
<p>Or, as it seems that many users are affected is it a Microsoft repair job?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>YES!</p>
<p>After scratching around the Windows Update links I found that KB4016635 seemed promising. That led to a huge cumulative update that took forever to download and install. 'Did a manual restart and all seems back to normal.</p>
<p>So KB4016635 seems to be the magic wand - a bit cumbersome but it did the trick.</p>

<p>"<span>Stand: 29. August 2006" - Denke, es erübrigt sich zu erwähnen, dass diese Liste nicht mehr die aktuellste ist. Vor allem nach dem neuen Dashboard-Update könnten weitere Spiele aus der Liste gestrichen werden, einige andere vielleicht hinzugefügt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Genau derartige Informationen fehlen auf XBox.com. Da gibt es mächtig Nachholbedarf. Es kann nicht sein, dass auf XBox.com/Games verwiesen wird, der User aber im Trüben fischt. Drittanbieter schaffen es schließlich auch, derartige Informationen bereit
 zu stellen.</span></p>
<p><span>Meiner Meinung nach sollten User, die alte XBox-Spiele besitzen, nach dem Kauf der XBox 360 in der Lage sein sich eine portierte Version ihrer alten Games über den Marktplatz (kostenlos) herunterzuladen. Es müssen schließlich nicht alle Spiele betroffen
 sein, sondern lediglich die Top100 (Verkaufszahlen).</span></p>

<p>Da haste wohl recht :)</p>
<p>Da MS den Support zur "alten" Xbox aber eingestellt hat, und auch Halbherzig die meisten Seiten zu dem Thema gelöscht wurden, wird es wohl nur noch schlechter werden.
</p>
<p>Selbst per Tel.Hotline bekommt man nur noch gesagt das der Mitarbeiter dazu leider nichts mehr sagen darf (also Tips Hilfen etc)^^</p>
<p>Leider finde ich den dazu passenden Artikel auf xbox.com nicht mehr, bin noch neu in der Materie und die Seite muss meiner Meinung nach auch noch schwer überarbeitet werden :)</p>

<p>Man mag es kaum glauben, aber der Support für Xbox-Abwärtskompatibilität wurde tatsächlich gegen Ende 06 leise zu Grabe getragen, daher ist die 06er wohl mit die aktuellste. Es gibt zwar noch eine US-Liste, die ist AFAIK von Anfang 07, aber auch die ist
 mit Vorsicht zu geniessen. Ich denke z.B. an SC2 oder Panzer Dragoon Orta, stehen beide drauf, laufen bei mir aber gar nicht (SC) oder nur bis Level 3 (PDO).</p>

<p>naja, aber wozu der ganze Stress, die XBOX1 Konsole gibt es mittlerweile hinterhergworfen.</p>
<p>Durch mehrere Gelegenheiten/dumme Zufälle oder sonstige Einflüsse habe ich mittlerweile 6x XBOX1 Konsolen (4 Grün LE und 2 crystel LE)</p>
<p>Da laufen die Games GARANTIERT</p>

<h2>            Surface Book keyboard</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am wondering what does keyboard layouts look like in US / UK / Germany. If any of you happen to have Surface Book from mentioned countries I would like to ask you to make a photo of the keyboard and post it here. The whole idea behind this is that
 in my country SB is currently not available and it doesnt look promising, so I am about to order from one of those countries, but I would like to end up with SB with US keyboard !AND! cee7 adapter power plug (common in continental europe).</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Surface Book i5 Black Screen with 6 White Vertical Lines</h2>
                    <p>Today, after pulling my laptop out of my backpack, after no physically straining events on my Surface Book, the screen just went black with 6 vertical white lines. By using my monitor, I was able to update the laptop and try other random suggestions that
 I found online. The screen has yet to change. Anyone know the problem or how to fix it?</p>

                    <p>Original title: Help! Trying to uninstall a software,&nbsp; Then suddenly an error code popped up.</p>
<p>Hi !&nbsp; I was trying to uninstall a software on my PC, and when I was about to uninstall it an error popped up. The error code was:&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Error Code: -5005 : 80070002&nbsp; <br />
Error Info: <br />
&gt;Kernel\KernelMedia.cpp (95)&nbsp; <br />
&gt;SetupNew\setup.cpp (851)<br />
PAPP:Webzen Game Starter<br />
PVENDOR:WEBZEN (##ID_STRING1##)<br />
PGUID:255FC1CF-2620-4B64-BE02-79B9E609BB3D<br />
$15.0.0.498<br />
@Windows Vista Service Pack 1 (7601) <br />
IE Version: 9.10.9200.16521<br />
<br />
Can any one explain this to me and help me to uninstall this without screwing up my PC?
<br />
Thanks in advance :)<br />
<br />
EDIT:&nbsp; After seeing that error code and closed it (with the X button) a program popped up called:
<br />
<br />
Program Compatibility Assistant<br />
<br />
Program: Setup.exe <br />
Publisher: Acresso Software Inc.<br />
Location: C:\Program Files (x86)\Installshield Inst...\Setup.exe <br />
<br />
With selections of: <br />
<br />
"Uninstall using recommended settings"<br />
"This program uninstalled correctly"<br />
<br />
Is it safe to continue and uninstall it using the recommended settings?<br />
<br />

            Thank you for responding to my problem.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
No. It is not from Acresso Software Inc, and I have never heard that software before. What I was trying
<br />
<br />
to remove was a software from a game (MU online) that I installed before that I do not play anymore.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I had successfully uninstalled the game, but when I was uninstalling unnecessary software few days
<br />
<br />
ago, I saw a software called "WEBZEN Game Starter" which is I believed that it was came from the
<br />
<br />
game (MU online) that uninstalled.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, I've tried the first method that you gave me.&nbsp; I downloaded it, and it gave me a list, which software
<br />
<br />
that I unable to uninstall, but unfortunately, it wasn't in the list so, I chose <b>
Not listed</b> then I hit<b> Next</b>. <br />
<br />
Then, It was asking me about the Product Code of the software what I am trying to uninstall, but I
<br />
<br />
didn't know what is the Product Code of that software so, I browsed my <b>C:</b> drive to look for the
<br />
<br />
software, but it wasn't there.&nbsp; So, after that I tried to uninstall the software again through
<b>Add/remove <br />
<br />
programs </b>and wait for the UAC prompt to look for the details of the program, and I found the CLSID
<br />
<br />
but I'm not sure if its the same as the Product key so I just wrote it down, and also what I found out in
<br />
<br />
the details the publisher is from Microsoft Windows, I just skip the 1st method to ask you if it is safe to
<br />
<br />
put the CLSID to type it in the product key.<br />
<br />
<br />
I tried the method 2, unfortunately it didn't now solved my problem.<br />

<h2>            rechargeable batteries for sculpt</h2>
                    <p>hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i want to buy "sculpt ergonomic desktop" and intend to use rechargeable batteries for all components (keyboard, number pad, mouse).
</p>
<p>online available product specification only lists types for the non-rechargeables. the local dealer was not able to give a definitive
</p>
<p>statement and asked me to contact microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>as there are plenty of different types available in regards to their power (ampere hours) i don't want to use one that may damage the
</p>
<p>devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>which rechargeable batteries can be used in regards to their technical data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks a lot<br />
&nbsp;:-)<br />

<h2>            Cannot get computer to recognize WD My Passport Ultra after upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a new WD My Passport Ultra about 3 months ago.&nbsp; I was still on WIndows 7 at the time of purchase and had no issues with it not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fast forward 1 month and I upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; Now, the computer wont even recognize it being plugged in.&nbsp; Have searched blogs, posts, MS community trying different "fixes" and nothing has worked.&nbsp; I went to WD website and made sure I had correct driver
 installed.&nbsp; I tried following a MS blog about going to device manager and then finding the device and right clicking but that doesn't work as it is not even recognized as being plugged in.&nbsp; I assume other USB's are working because I have a USB mouse and have
 had no issues with it thus far (quite an old mouse I might add).</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP WITH THIS ISSUE.&nbsp; NEED MY FILES!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; Come on MS!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must add anyone who might post back please keep in mind I am very un techy so need step by step instructions please.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">I performed the troubleshooter solution first and it did not help the issue.&nbsp; I then thought I would try it a second time just to ensure I had done
 everything properly.&nbsp; The second time it worked as far as getting the USB ports to at least acknowledge something was plugged into them.&nbsp; I have not used the computer enough after this fix to see if it drops connection to the devices connected via the USB’s
 as it was doing before.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">I greatly appreciate the help with at least getting my USB’s back online.</span></p>
