            A new or reformatting the hard drive would eliminate any thoughts you might have had about locking the system. And I don't know of any methods in the current laptop technology to remotely communicate with a laptop's firmware (BIOS) to secure the laptop
 from booting up.&nbsp;

    <title>Is the original Terminal able to be used with Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erikj13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is the original Terminal able to be used with Windows 7 Professional&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, <br />
I am having a problem with the original Windows Terminal on Windows 7 Professional Service Pack 1. I can open the program on Windows 7 Pro. I can use the program on Windows 7 Pro. My problem comes in when I save my work. For some reason I cannot go through
 my explorer and just click on the document and open it automatically with Terminal. It tells me that it needs a program to open it with. So I browse and click on Windows Terminal since the program isn't included in the list of program to open with. So to try
 and get around this problem I went to the properties of the document and tried to change how it opens and what it opens with. No luck. I am honestly stuck on what to do.
<br />
<br />
The reason I am trying to use the original Windows Terminal Program is because the program allows the functions buttons/macros to be displayed at the bottom of the screen. Maybe I just don't know how to do that with Hyperterminal? I really don't know. I am
 trying to find these answers for my boss, so I really only have common knowledge of the program as I have only had a week to review it. If any help could be provided to me it would be much appreciated. Thank you for any advice.<br />

            I am going to have to wait for my boss to return. This project I am doing is for him. I do know that the file extension it is saved under is the one used by terminal as I saved the file through terminal first. As far as the remote computer part. No, I
 am not trying to open the file on the remote computer. I literally have just saved it on a USB and transferred to another computer. The computer that is having problems using the program is away from the shop right now. I hope to be able to use it sometime
 today to get you those screenshots. Thank you.<br />

<h2>            How to use Exchange ActiveSync with Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
Other Windows Live Mail issues
<div><b>Please provide your impacted Email address : </b></div>
<div>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div><b>Did you receive an error code or message? </b></div>
<div>No</div>
<div><b>Please enter the error code or message you received </b></div>
<div>No code or message. Simply no way to setup Exchange ActiveSync account on Windows 7 (PC) with Live Mail (or Outlook for that matter) - unlike convenient Apple products or most smart phones.</div>
<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Mail are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Version 2011 (15.4.3538.513)</div>
<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows 7</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
</p>
Exchange ActiveSync - A Microsoft Product:<br />
<br />
On an Apple&nbsp;iPad or iPhone or on any Nokia Smart Phone or on most Android phones you can connect to&nbsp;my company's&nbsp;e-mail by selecting<br />
-Add account, <br />
-select type: Microsoft Exchange, <br />
-enter the e-mail address, <br />
-enter the domain, <br />
-enter the user name, <br />
-enter the password <br />
-enter the ActiveSync server address<br />
<br />
and you're good to go!!!<br />
<br />
For some reason I am not able to connect neither Windows Live Mail nor Outlook in that convenient manner (on my Windows 7 Netbook)<br />
Is there software that I can download that enables Windows Live Mail - Exchange ActiveSync connection?
<br />
Are there e-mail clients for Windows 7 that enable Exchange ActiveSync?
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks </p>

            Hi <span>ColoniaClaus</span>,<br />
<br />
Please be informed that Exchange Active sync does not currently support&nbsp;connecting of Mail Clients (e.g Live Mail, Outlook)&nbsp;to specific devices like your Windows 7 Netbook. There's also no available software that will allow you to enable the connection.<br />
<br />
For more information about Exchange Active Sync, please refer to this <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_live/b/windowslive/archive/2010/08/30/hotmail-now-supports-push-email-calendar-and-contacts-with-exchange-activesync.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Service Pack install error 0xc004f013</h2>
                    I was trying to install the new beta release of Vista Service Pack 2 and after 1 restart and 30 minutes of waiting I got the following error: Unexpected error 0xc004f013<br />
<br />
I have searched the web and found that some users that were trying to install Service Pack 1 got the same error but after uninstalling a specific update the error was gone.<br />
Does anybody has a solution to my problem? I'm afraid that I might get the same error when the final Service Pack 2 is released...<br />

<h2>            How to disable on-screen keyboard on startup&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Operating System: Windows Vista</p>
<p>My laptop keyboard was not working last month, hence I switched to on-screen keyboard. But now my keyboard is repaired and I want to disable On - Screen Keyboard to run at start-up. It always pops up at startup, how can disable it to run at start-up. I have
 searched across msconfig and other also searched in application itself to disable automatic startup when Windows boots up.</p>
<p>Please Help</p>

            Hi TheRafeSCV
<br />
<br />If you have a problem seeing other PC's in the Network Section in File Explorer:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type Services and hit Enter
<br />
<br />When the Services app opens, scroll down to find the following services, then double click each one in turn, set their startup type to Automatic and start the service if necessary
<br />
<br />1. Function Discovery Provider Host
<br />
<br />2. Function Discovery Resource Publication
<br />
<br />3. SSDP Discovery
<br />
<br />4. UPnP Device Host
<br />
<br />Save that and close the Services app       
        </p>

<p>Thanks DaveM121.</p>

</p><p>All 4 of these were already running, though they were set to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Auto</p>
<p>2. Auto (Triggered)</p>
<p>3. Manual</p>
<p>4. Manual</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 2 that were manual I've switched over to Auto.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, still no computers listed though.</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Make sure you've SMBv1 protocol enabled:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-enable-or-disable-smb-protocols-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-enable-or-disa...</a>
<br />
<br />If you're looking for HomeGroup, it is no longer available now because network sharing is changed on Windows now and HomeGroup is removed on V1803 or later. 
<br />
<br />Here are the alternatives atm:

<p>Hi TheRafeSCV,<br />
With Win 10 1809 build 17763.134, I have the problem not showing my computer, but only in the specific case when the PCs have both Ethernet and Wi-Fi adapters and the connection is done through the Ethernet. I gave the detailed description in another post,
 but for some reason they don't let me put the link to the other post in here.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a807c2ed-095c-48b9-ba3d-8c0b779d4da9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a807c2ed-095c-48b9-ba3d-8c0b779d4da9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<div>
<p>Clearly when it does not show my computer, it is also not visible from the other computers in the same network.&nbsp; Restarting the service&nbsp; "Function discovery resource publication"&nbsp; makes my computer visible again. Also it keeps showing after a normal shutdown/power
 up if the power option for 'Fast Startup' is turned on, but my computer disappears again after a PC restart.
<br />
To recover I need to restart the service&nbsp; "Function discovery resource publication" again even if it is already running.<br />
All my computers are on the same workgroup al running the same Win 10 1809 Build 17763.134, network discovery is enabled and my network adapters are set for private network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that with Win 10 1803 everything works fine providing that&nbsp;<span>"Function discovery resource publication" is set to start automatic, with 1803 there was a different bug and the service was not started at all unless it was changed to Automatic..</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>One more detail for 1809, if I disable the Ethernet adapter and connect to the router with the Wi-Fi adapter I don't have the problem, my computer keeps showing up after any PC restart.
</span></p>
<p><span>If I re-enable the Ethernet adapter the bug returns after the PC restart.</span></p>
<p><span>Note that if I issue a Network reset my&nbsp; computer becomes visible after the first PC restart, but fails after that on every subsequent PC restart.</span></p>

<p>Hi fg2001,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for this information. I have the exact same setup you describe and it acts the same way. A restart of the FDResPub service gets it working properly. I came up with a workaround to restart the service automatically at system startup. You may have already
 done this, but others may benefit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Create a command script named FDResPub.cmd with these two lines:</p>
<p>
</p><p>cmd /c net stop FDResPub</p>
<p>cmd /c net start FDResPub</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Save the script at a convenient location. I used C:\Scripts\FDResPub.cmd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Use Task Scheduler to create a new task:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Name: FDResPub</p>
<p>Description: Restart the FDResPub service.</p>
<p>Run whether user is logged on or not.</p>
<p>Run with highest privileges.</p>
<p>Configure for: Windows 10</p>
<p>Triggers: At Startup</p>
<p>Actions: Start a program&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Scripts\FDResPub.cmd</p>
<p>Optional start at: C:\Scripts</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has worked for both restarts and shutdowns with Fast Start disabled.</p>

<p>Hi Plarini,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the workaround, I tried it on my MSI GT70-0NC and it worked every time, but when I tried on the DELL XPS 8700 it only worked intermittently after a PC restart.
</p>
<p>So I changed the task</p>
<p>Triggers: At Logon &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; At logon of any user &nbsp;</p>
<p>That seems to work fine after every PC restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround is fine, but I hope the guys at Microsoft fix this specific issue affecting the machines with both Ethernet and Wi-Fi adapters.</p>
<p>It appears that if the services Function Discovery Resource Publication is started too early it creates the problem for the machines connected through the Ethernet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have this issue on the same machines if I use Win 10 1803, but the bug is solid with 1809.</p>

<blockquote>how to rotate photos without altering the image dimensions</blockquote>
================================<br />
Please explain how the photo was altered.<br />
<br />
If a photo is 640x480 and you rotate it 90 degrees <br />
...say from Portrait to Landscape...the dimensions <br />
should stay the same.

<h2>            charged twice for same content</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>when i went to play gears of war 3 today i knew i would need to download the new "forces of nature" content. 800msp no problem.
</p>
<p>but i also noticed that the "fenix rising" content was also needing to be downloaded, even thou as you can see from my image i had already purchased on the 17/01/12</p>

<p>so i set them both to download then realised i had been charged anoter 800msp for the "fenix rising" content again.</p>
<p>why/how is this able to happen if the content is already on the hard drive?</p>

<p>many thanks.</p>

    <title>Official Xbox Magazine Review - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bentleyma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Official Xbox Magazine Review</h2>
                    

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grand ambition, the kind that dreams of a game that could only run on Xbox 360, deserves a warm and grateful welcome — and Assassin’s Creed is brimming with it. But Ubisoft’s latest is also an incomplete dream — one that’s not fully
 realized in too many ways — and that deserves a blade slipped gently between the ribs. Spending $60 on this mixed bag of high highs and low lows is a tough call, but we’d do it simply because the good parts are that spectacular. Still, mind our caveats — we
 expect Assassin’s Creed to infuriate a lot of the people who play it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.oxmonline.com%2ffiles%2fu8%2fAC-1.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assassin’s grand ambition is to create living, breathing medieval cities and countryside that teem with people and eye-popping vistas, and its monumental success in doing so makes it one of the prettiest games on 360. All game long,
 you’ll pause at the top of an impossibly high tower to marvel at the sprawl of rooftops unspooling into the horizon, or dawdle in the middle of a busy city square to appreciate the bustling crowds. Everyday citizens respond naturally to you, guards chase you
 like you owe them money, and you can free-run across rooftops with a grace that would make the new James Bond jealous as hell. In short, this game’s graphics and crowd A.I. succeed brilliantly at immersing you in a medieval Holy Land fantasy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.oxmonline.com%2ffiles%2fu8%2fAC-2.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But don’t play tourist for too long. After all, your job is to reshape the political machinations behind the Crusade, and that means you’ve got loads of key figures to kill at the behest of your master. The plot’s made even more
 interesting by a parallel, set-in-the-future story line that starts off as fascinating...but more on that later.</p>
<p>As far as gameplay goes, it boils down to this: you’ve got nine main targets to scout, stalk, and kill. Each one is fantastic fun, offering a great range of different environments and people. You’ll creep through ornate palaces
 to take out a fat merchant, hunt down a creepy doctor in a hospital, and even put an end to a scholar’s book-burning madness.</p>
<p>The open environments and variety of paths remind us of a spellbinding mixture of Gun and the Hitman series with tons of swordplay, free-running, and exploration thrown in for good measure. But that doesn’t mean you should expect
 to focus much on stealth and cunning. Quite the opposite, in fact. Assassin’s is almost entirely about action, which isn’t a bad thing, but it probably contradicts a lot of expectations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.oxmonline.com%2ffiles%2fu8%2fAC-3.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of all that combat, what we love about Assassin’s many group battles is that there’s very little of that enemies-politely-waiting-their-turn-to-stab-you crap. These boys are in it to make you bleed, and you’ve got to scramble
 around and use your entire arsenal to stay alive.</p>
<p>You’ll need a whole lot more than your wits, though — you’ll need an absurd amount of practice. It’s a damn shame that Ubisoft Montreal sacrificed simplicity and usability simply to get all fancy and high-minded with the controls.
 Y is my head, A is my feet? Who cares, just make the game handle smoothly! Unfortunately, until your skills are maxed out at the end of game, the split-second timing required to pull of advanced moves will feel more like luck than skill, and even after what
 must be the longest tutorial ever, you’ll still constantly study the manual for a glimmer of help and hope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.oxmonline.com%2ffiles%2fu8%2fAC-4.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another badly missed opportunity, the 210 side missions in the game are brutally repetitive. With only six simplistic types of side quests on the menu, you’ll get to the point where you can beat each one with your eyes closed
 — and you’ll wish you could do it in your sleep to avoid the monotony. On top of that, you’d have to be smoking something to want to collect all 420 flags scattered around the game. Exactly what part of that tedium is supposed to make us feel like über-assassins?
 There’s one saving grace here, and it’s a big one: If you’re not obsessed with completing every side quest, you’d don’t have to — roughly a third is all that’s required to just finish the game. Whew!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.oxmonline.com%2ffiles%2fu8%2fAC-5.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then…there’s the ending. What a letdown! Treading lightly, let’s just say that only one of the two primary storylines is satisfyingly resolved. The other just stops as abruptly as
<em>The Sopranos’</em> series finale…without six seasons of groundwork to make it meaningful. It’s an utterly unfair cliffhanger that, while pointing to an intriguing future for Assassin’s as a series, stains the whole game with a sour aftertaste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.oxmonline.com%2ffiles%2fu8%2fAC-6.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So yeah, that’s a heap of caveats and complaints, and it’s a shame that the meat of Assassin’s isn’t as satisfying as its first impression. We still think you gotta play it (or at least rent it) because the good parts are truly
 majestic. Just go in with your eyes wide open, and listen for the <em>snik!</em> of the game’s hidden blade popping out to kill off any hope of this game living up to its full potential.</p>

<p>Own this game. Couldnt get into it altho I tried many times. Controls are hard and the story is impossible to follow. I will get the other two for my game collection one day but I wont rush for it. Beautiful graphics I admit but very hard story to follow.
 Great concept tho. 6.3/10</p>

<h2>            ACPI_BIOS_ERROR when installing Windows 8</h2>
                    Is there anyway to get around the acpi_bios_error when installing windows 8.&nbsp; My PC passed all the prelim checks before I pulled the trigger on the upgrade for Windows 7 pro, however, after the install I get this error and it reverts back to windows 7.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I saw some posts about this w/ the pre-release, but was hoping w/ the retail product there would be a solution.<br />
<br />
I have a legacy Alienware m15x w/ the following:<br />
<br />
-Phoenix Bios version 36 (there are no updates for this from the manufacturer)<br />
-T7700 2.4 ghz core 2 duo<br />
-80 gb intel SSD<br />
-m8800gtx<br />
<br />
Any solutions would be appreciated!<br />

Hi,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Welcome to the Windows 8 Community!</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
From your issue description I understand that after installing Windows 8 you get an error message “ACPI_BIOS_ERROR “.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I would suggest you to try updating the BIOS and chipset drivers from the computer manufacturer’s website and check if it works.</p>
<p>
<b>Disclaimer:</b> Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft
 cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</p>
<p>
If updating BIOS did not help, then it would be better to contact the computer manufacturer for further assistance.</p>
<p>
<b>Reference:-</b></p>

            Unfortunately Dell is not supporting any of the older Alienware models, so those of us left w/ them are hopelessly waiting for a miracle.<br />
<br />
$3K gaming laptop w/ no ability to upgrade or even get new nvidia drivers working!&nbsp; What a travesty.<br />

<h2>            Bing daily photo</h2>
                    I enjoyed seeing the new Bing daily photo &nbsp;on my Windows 8 PC's. But I seem to have lost it. This has happened on my Laptop and Desktop, so I am wondering if they have&nbsp; stopped publishing it as it seems strange that both my PC's have lost it.

            <p>OK as soon as I post this, next day the picture changes on both PC's. Don't know why I was stuck with the Easter egg screen for so long but glad its gone as it was too gaudy for more than a day</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interested to know if anyone else had the same issue, but hopefully it seems to have&nbsp;been sorted, assuming the present landscape picture changes tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> tethramm  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSoD Driver_Power_State_Failure</h2>
                    I have recently started experiencing many BSoD errors stating that my computer has run into some issues and it needs to restart. At the bottom, it says I can find more information about the error by searching Driver_Power_State_Failure. I don't know how
 to fix this, or how to provide any information on how I can fix it. Along side these error messages, my performance in video games (usually very good) has become absolutely awful. &nbsp;Can someone guide me through a process in finding out what the problem is?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Upload the zip containing the .DMP files to Onedrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply. Preferred sites: Onedrive, Mediafire, Dropbox, etc. Nothing with wait-timers, download managers, etc.<br />
<br />
<strong>4 (optional):</strong> The type of .DMP files located in the Minidump folder are known as Small Memory Dumps. In %systemroot% there will be what is known as a Kernel-Dump (if your system is set to generate). It is labeled MEMORY.DMP. The difference
 between Small Memory Dumps and Kernel-Dumps in the simplest definition is a Kernel-Dump contains
<em><strong>much </strong></em>more information at the time of the crash, therefore allowing further debugging of your issue. If your upload speed permits it, and you aren't going against any strict bandwidth and/or usage caps, etc, the Kernel-Dump is the best
 choice. Do note that Kernel-Dumps are <em><strong>much larger </strong></em>in size due to containing much more info, which is why I mentioned upload speed, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/add-photos-files-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upload photos and files to Onedrive.</a><br />
<br />
After doing that, to learn how to share the link to the file if you are unaware, please visit the following link -
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Share files and folders and change permissions</a> and view <strong>'Get a link'</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUpUtilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete .DMP files upon use. With this said, if you've run such software, you will need to allow the system to crash once again to generate a crash dump.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Patrick

            Hello Patrick, the advice you gave me looked like it was working for quite a long time. But just a second ago while watching a stream on twitch, I crashed. The same BSoD and the same "Driver_State_Power_Failure". I will be sharing the zip .DMP files in
 a second.

<h2>            Can I choose which folder to install Age of Empires&#58; Definitive Edition&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So. If I am understanding this correctly. I am unable to specify the folder in which I want to install Age of Empires: Definitive Edition from the Microsoft Store?&nbsp;<br />
Or am I just plain stupid?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The files for the games or apps that you downloaded from the Windows Store will only go directly to a specific folder or location on your storage device. To check where the games are located, you may go to this path:
<strong>C:\Program Files\WindowsApps.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>To check the configuration files for each that you downloaded from Windows Store, you may go to
<strong>C:\Users\user name\AppData\Local\Packages.</strong></p>

<p>Okay, so that means that I am unable to customize the location where I want to install the game.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I cannot fathom this decision. I sadly doubt that Microsoft will be able to compete with the other large distribution platforms such as Steam with this current way of handling installations. At least for steam I can choose to have it all in one folder, and
 where to place that folder.<br />
<br />
I like to keep my drives tidy so that i can easily traverse them. I don't like that I am only able to choose the drive's root folder for install, and that the Windows store then clutters my drive's root folder with multiple new folders.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note. Is it possible to turn off the "tablet-like" "show title bar, and show task bar buttons?</p>
<p>These are very strange to have enabled in a full-screen RTS game.</p>

            This is a terrible customer experience. Most gamers have their OS installed on one drive and their games on another. I simply do not have the storage capacity on my main drive. Are you telling me that we are unable to switch the download/installation location
 for anything purchased off the Microsoft Store?

<p>I agree with the previous comments.&nbsp; Windows 10 is a massive pile of crap, and Microsoft is continuing to push users in a direction they do not want to go.&nbsp; This is why I started Dual-booting Linux, and plan to convert over to it in the future.&nbsp; Microsoft
 is a dying company trying to profit off of their monopoly before they go.</p>

<p>Sorry i'm just picking up this thread now so hoping someone can help me.&nbsp; I have just installed this game and it doesn't work.&nbsp; I understand I have to add it to the whitelist on my f-secure.&nbsp; There's a problem - neither I, nor an agent from F-secure can
 find the files on my laptop to add them to the whitelist.&nbsp; I have tried all the recommended options in this forum and others and it's just not there.&nbsp; I've run a search on my C drive - nothing. I've searched by file type, date, Age of Empires, AOE etc etc
 - noting.&nbsp; And yet it's there as I can start the game - it just crashes as soon as I start playing because of F-secure.&nbsp; Can anyone help?</p>

<h2>            Disk full error cant resolve it&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I cant copy paste files and cant change or schedule programs or change msconfig settings neither can i schedule start up check-disk or if by mistake it starts at start up it doesn't resolve the problem. I have tried several time to run the chkdsk and final
 result is again disk full error.<br />
<br />
So ultimately i have to perform Full time taking windows recovery.<br />
<br />
This error occurs very frequently like after around interval of 2 to 3 months after the windows recovery.<br />
<br />
This is very big problem for me please let me know if there is any alternative solution to this other than chkdsk?<br />

            <p>Well if the hd is on a IDE cable,then use xp "XCOPY" &amp; put the OS on</p>
<p>a larger hd.XCOPY transfers all data,including the OS,so once its done,</p>
<p>xp is on a larger hd,&amp; the older one can be used for storage (photos,music,etc).</p>
<p>To use XCOPY, simply place current hd on farthest connection,new closest</p>
<p>to MB.Set old as master,new slave,in xp,go to run,type: diskmgmt.msc</p>
<p>In msc,R.click on the new hd,select "create a partition" &amp;"format",use xp</p>
<p>default settings.Once thru,exit msc,return to run,type: XCOPY C:\*.* D:\ /c/h/e/k/r</p>
<p>Agree to all in the DOS window.Once its thru (5-10 min),youre done,exit xp,shutdown</p>
<p>pc,set new hd as master,start pc..</p>
<p>Also,D: being the new hd,if asigned diffrent letter,then use it.With a new hd,old</p>
<p>as a slave &amp; storage,youre pc will increase performance,plus other areas.&nbsp;</p>

            So you can't copy paste files and cant change or schedule programs or change msconfig setting and cant schedule startup check disk and if it starts it doesn't resolve the problem.<br />
<br />
Why don't you tell us what the problem is exactly and what happens when you try to copy and paste files?<br />
<br />
What happens when you try to change or schedule programs or change msconfig settings?<br />
<br />
What does "full time taking Windows recovery" mean?<br />
<br />
Why do you think you need to do do anything to your system.ini or win.ini and what are you trying to change?<br />
<br />
For the error that occurs around interval of 2 to 3 months, exactly what does the error say and what are you doing when you see it?<br />
<br />
I don't think any of that eHow article applies to anything here - that article, taken from KB289545, only applies to running Microsoft Word 2001 on a Macintosh computer:<br />

            I would have to agree with ElderL here. Give some details about what happens when you try to perform the actions you describe as not working. Otherwise we are left to guess. Guessing leads to meaningless answers/suggestions/speculations non-resolving replies

            Sorry;<br />
For the inconvenience caused to you.<br />
<br />
1.Cant copy n paste<br />
<br />
When i try to copy paste or move any file <br />
It says: error copying file as there is no disk space. and suggest me to run the disk cleanup.<br />
<br />
2.when i tried to modify start-up programs through msconfig.exe(services and startup tab) and at end try to apply the changes then<br />
It says:<br />
"Disk full while accesing c:/WINDOWS/system.ini" and <br />
"Disk full while accesing c:/WINDOWS/win.ini"<br />
<br />
3.System restore also not working,<br />
It says:<br />
"the instructions at "0x5c029836" referenced at memory at "0x00000000".The memory could not be read."<br />
<br />
4.Check disk<br />
<br />
Ultimate result is that i can't save files on the system disk[48gb free space(as indicated in drive properties)] or update/install/run/schedule programs because there is no disc space due to error.<br />
<br />
Also there are few programs which report error like "debug or stream write error".<br />
<br />
<br />
Above are all the things which are happening just due to disk full error and i am not here to confuse sir.<br />
<br />
so please me know if there is any solution to this<br />
<br />

            I'm going to wait to see what ElderL has to offer, but I have seen this happen when the file system has somehow been converted to Fat32.
<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>click My Computer</li><li>right click the drive</li><li>look at the Properties, which should say FAT32 or NTFS</li></ul>
Let us know which is says. FAT32 or NTFS. <br />
<br />
This could also be a symptom of a multitude of bad sectors on the hard drive. Tell us what the file system is first then we'll go from there.

    <title>Forza Hub not updating Forza 6 progress - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stormrazor hd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forza Hub not updating Forza 6 progress</h2>
                    
<p>I was wondering if this is a common issue? I have&nbsp; Forza 5 digitally on my HDD and my stuff shows up in the Hub for that game but I have a physical copy of 6 and it doesn't reflect any of my progress. In fact when I click the Forza 6 column it takes me to
 the Marketplace page prompting me to buy the game. Not sure if MS or Turn 10 made a post about this somewhere and I just missed it.</p>

<p>So this is a known issue? I only have the digital version and it updated for the first day or so but after that my progress in the hub wont update. It is still showing me driver level 8 and I am like at 14 now I think. It is showing no gamerscore for the
 game and I do have some. I hope this is a known issue so it can get fixed and not just on my end.

<p>Well when you give someone trying to help a bad rating and you did not explain the entire problem is makes us go hunting for the message as it is removed to a different platform. Added it certainly does not inspire enthusiasm for trying to offer free support.
 Remember we are not Microsoft Representatives, we are Independents here to help you.<br />
<br />
Your new explanation is not even close to the original question which we answered.<br />
<br />
This sounds like a home user who wants to sync data across two+ computers and has no idea how it can be done - sounds like more of a backup issue than running a business level program.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Yes there is a known issue trying to keep persistent connections across&nbsp;a peer to peer network. For the best information you need to check in with Microsoft's TechNet which the support venue for such business oriented networks. Of course it also offers free
 support and I will be there as well.<br />

            Hi JaneWilson2
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Uninstall and reinstall the Printer (Credit to Andre Da Costa, MVP for providing steps)
<br />A. Uninstall Printer
<br />Click on Windows Key+X &gt; Apps and Features &gt; Scroll down and click Programs and Features &gt; Select your printer &gt; Select Uninstall
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Select your printer &gt; Remove device
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Scroll down and click Print server properties under Related settings &gt; Under Driver tab, look for your printer &gt; Select it and click Remove button at the bottom
<br />
<br />B. Install Printer 
<br />Go to the Printer manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers &gt; Reinstall the Printer driver &gt; Reboot the computer
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; On Right side, Click Add a printer or scanner &gt; If Windows detects your printer, it will be listed &gt; Select the printer and follow on screen directions to set it up (In case of Wifi printer, your computer should also be logged into Wifi network)
<br />If Windows doesn't detect your printer, then you will get a blue message - Click The printer that I want isn't listed
<br />If you are using Bluetooth / Wirelss printer &gt; Select Add a Bluetooth, wireless or network discoverable printer &gt; Choose the printer &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions
<br />If you are using wired printer &gt; Select Add a local printer or network printer  with manual settings &gt; Select Use an existing port &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            why does my screen keep switching applications in winows 8&#63;</h2>
                    My computer keeps switching applications when I am in the middle of doing something - it seems to happen when I touch the mouse pad, and usually when I'm working in an Office application.
