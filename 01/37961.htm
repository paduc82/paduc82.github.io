            <p>You need to go on to the HP site and download the drivers for your specific laptop. I think the device you are having a problem with is the HP 3D Drive Guard.</p>

<p>This is the automatic head park utility and has nothing to do with 3D graphics.</p>

<h2>            Error 0x80072ee2 Windows Store</h2>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Ramón.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been working with this error, since I have this laptop (since 2013, I guess). When I try to enter in to my Windows Store account, it takes a long time to load and it ends with this error (We weren't able to connect to the Store. This might have happened
 because of a server problem or the network connection timed out. Please wait a few minutes and
<span style="color: rgba(0, 91, 106, 1)"><strong>try again</strong></span>. (0x80072ee2)). In that year I watched a lot of tutorials, I saw a lot of cases posted here (I still seeing), I visited a lot of websites, etc. , but nothing worked for me, my last choice was to
 use Dell Backup &amp; Recovery to reset my laptop (I thought that it could fix the problem), but I didn't do it at once, because I had a lot of data (about 500 GB or more), so I was thinking to buy a external hard drive, but in that year I was a child (about 12
 or 14 years old) and I didn't like to ask mom or dad for money xD. 2 or 3 months later, I was tired of watching videos, and tutorials, so I forgot that and continued using the laptop without caring the Windows Store. Now I'm 19 years old and I was able to
 get enough money to buy a good external hard drive. When I got my hard drive I started to do my backup at once, when I finished it, I proceeded to start the Recovery program, when the Recovery finished I was very happy, because I thought that finally the problem
 would be fixed. Later Windows, started to configure the system, etc. , when I was in the start I clicked in Windows Store, the Store opened, then I clicked on my account and the error appeared again, if I entered an app and then the updates, the error would
 appear again and sometimes when I was downloading an application, suddenly the error would appear again (my emotions got down completely). Well this time I decided to fix this error and not let it go unnoticed. I started to see tutorials and videos again,
 but nothing was working again (now comes the good news). I saw a tutorial where a guy said that I had to turn off my firewall temporary (my firewall was controlled by McAfee and McAfee came by default with the Laptop, in that time I thought what if all this
 time the problem was McAfee ?? So, few hours ago I uninstalled McAfee (I had to nothing to lose: McAfee wasn't activated, I wasn't gonna paid for that, before the Recovery process I used Avast, and I had Windows Defender also, right now I only have Windows
 Defender). After uninstall McAfee, I restarted the Laptop, I clicked on the Windows Store and later in my account, THIS TIME MY ACCOUNT APPEARED !!! I saw my email account, the Payment and billing info, ... So I was very happy, I was gonna cry xD, then I stand
 up and exited outside to breath and say thanks to God, literal, I exited outside, I was very excited, after 10 or 15 seconds I came back to configure the account and start to enjoy the Windows Store, however the error appeared again, and I felt bad again,
 not quite, because at least I discovered that McAfee was part of the problem. I didn't want to post this problem because I thought that I could deal with it, but now that I'm very close, I would like some help please. What could I do now to enjoy the Windows
 Store ??</p>

            Hi Ramon.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />No expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the tens of thousands) recommends Norton or McAfee, but we do solve problems by having them uninstalled.
<br />
<br /> I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.   
<br />
<br />If you want the best on-demand scanners install and run Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner free scanners.  
<br />
<br />Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset.  After it resets, restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that fails then Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset.  After it resets, restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that fails then reinstall Store.  Type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Administrator, copy the following code and paste it into the box using the Edit tools from Box's top left dropdown menu, press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage *WindowsStore*).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</code>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />If these all fail then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Once you uninstall McAfee we've also found it can continue ruining Windows until it's reinstalled.  Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            First, try signing out of the Microsoft Store. Click your Profile picture at the top right, click your account then sign out.
<br />
<br />Restart your computer, launch the Microsoft Store app, sign in again, then attempt downloading again. 
<br />
<br />Other things you can try...
<br />
<br />Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete try opening the Store again.
<br />
<br />Also check if the Store works in another user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: wsreset.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.
<br />
<br />Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />Reinstall the Store:
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (Admin) 
<br />At the command prompt, type the following then hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /F /FI "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.
<br />
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.

<p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that you are experiencing when you try to open a program can occur due to several reasons, such as, corrupted Runtime components, missing Runtime components, etc. When did the issue start? Have you made any significant changes to your computer
 before the issue started? Which programs are affected by the issue that you are experiencing?</p>
<p>

            Sorry for the late response. The only change made to my computer recently was the installation of the Dymo label printer program. This error literally started occurring out of no where I used my computer one night with no issues and then tried to use it
 the next night for the same thing and the error popped up. Now it is doing it on almost any application that I try to run. I read about the error online and it said to delete and replace the c++ runtime file but I was unsuccessful due to the error blocking
 the installer from downloading and the uninstaller from removing the old files. PLEASE HELP!!!

            Sorry about the delay but I don't have a lot of time to work on this. I am getting an error that says the application failed to start because it's side by side configuration is incorrect and it tells me to goto the error log to fix but that doesn't work.
 I attempted to install new c++ files ( the newest ones available on Microsoft.com) but that is unsuccessful due to the install program being blocked by the error as well.

<h2>            Windows 8 Start Screen and Apps Not Responding</h2>
                    I upgraded to Windows 8 Pro on its release date. &nbsp;It had been working fine for me until yesterday (11/16/2012). &nbsp;Suddenly, I can't get the Start screen to respond. &nbsp;I'm unable to launch apps, access the Charms bar, etc. &nbsp;By pressing WinKey + D multiple
 times, I am able to get the Desktop to load. &nbsp;Once loaded, the Desktop seems OK though I can't access Charms from it either. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried the Apps Troubleshooter from http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=271185, but it didn't find any problems. &nbsp;Also, my screen resolution is above&nbsp;1024 x 768, my video driver is current (I checked for updates via Device Manager), I do NOT have UAC
 disabled, and I'm logged into my own account (which is linked to my Microsoft account). &nbsp;Also, I do not have a 3rd party AV/security product installed, just Defender.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In Event Viewer, I do see repeated errors from&nbsp;Time Broker (listed as&nbsp;TimeBroker.exe or&nbsp;&nbsp;svchost.exe_TimeBroker). &nbsp;The error message reads, "The Time Broker service terminated unexpectedly." &nbsp;That didn't seem to be a problem until yesterday, but I don't
 know what to do about it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>I would appreciate any suggestions or advice.k</div>
<div><br />

            <p><span>Hi Matt,
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Sorry to know that you are facing an issue with
<span>Start Screen and Modern UI apps.</span></p>
<p>It would be helpful if you could reply to this question to assist you further.</p>
<p>Have you made any recent software or hardware changes on the system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let’s try the following steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>Step I:</p>
<p>You may try booting in safe mode with networking and check for the issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Post the results, so that we help you with further troubleshooting.</p>
<p><strong><span>a.</span></strong><strong><span>
</span></strong><span>Right click at the bottom left of the desktop and select Run.<br />
</span><strong><span>b.</span></strong><strong><span>
</span></strong><span>Type </span><strong><span>msconfig
</span></strong><span>and hit enter.<br />
</span><strong><span>c.</span></strong><strong><span>
</span></strong><span>Now click the 
</span><strong><span>boot</span></strong><span> tab.<br />
</span><strong><span>d.</span></strong><strong><span> Place a check mark
</span></strong><span>on the </span><strong><span>safe boot option</span></strong><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Choose the type of safe mode by selecting one of the options below the
<b>Safe boot</b> check box:</span></p>
<p><span>&gt;
<b>Network</b>- For safe mode with networking.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>f.</span></strong><span> Click
</span><strong><span>apply
</span></strong><span>and then </span><strong><span>ok. Restart the computer.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After you have
 finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.<br />
a. Press the ‘<b>Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.<br />
b. In the ‘<b>Run</b>’ windows type ’<b>MSCONFIG</b>’ and click ‘<b>Ok’</b>.<br />
c. On the ‘<b>General</b>’ tab, click the ‘<b>Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click
<b>‘OK’</b>.<br />
d. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click <b>‘Restart’</b>.</span></p>
<p>Step II:</p>
<p><span>If you are not facing the issue in
</span>safe mode with networking, then <span>place the computer in clean boot state and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click the
<b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</span></p>
<p><span>d. On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option
<b>Load startup items</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e. On the
<b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click
<b>‘Disable all’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>f. On the
<b>‘StartUp’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’. </b>In the<b> Task Manager window
</b>under<b> startup tab, </b>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></span></p>
<p><span>g. Click
<b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services.<b><br />
</b>a.<b>
</b></span><span>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the <b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the <b>Service</b> list.<br />
d. Click <b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns<b><br />
</b></span><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally
 selected in the <b>Service</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items<b>.<br />
</b></span><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem,
 repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns.<b><br />
</b></span><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally
 selected in the<b> Startup Item</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the<b> Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem.<b><br />
</b></span><span>Once you determine that the startup item or the service that is causing the problem, contact the program manufacturer
 to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>Step 7:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps
 to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click
<b>‘OK’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<b>‘Restart.</b></span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>Step III:</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, you may try performing a system restore prior to a point before you were experiencing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: When you perform System Restore to restore the computer to previous state, programs and updates you installed are removed.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>a.
</span></strong><strong><span>Press Win + R</span></strong><strong><span> and type in
</span></strong><strong><span>rstrui.exe</span></strong><strong><span> and press enter.</span></strong><span><br />
b. Click <b>next </b>and Select a restore point prior to the issue and click on Next.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>c.</span></strong><strong><span>
</span></strong><strong><span>Click on
</span></strong><strong><span>Finish</span></strong><strong><span> to perform the restore</span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

            Thanks for your message.
<div><br />
<div>I have not made any changes to my system. &nbsp;The problem began however after the following Windows Updates were installed: &nbsp;KB2761226, KB2737084, KB2729462, and KB2727528. &nbsp;I have tried uninstalling those updates, but it didn't resolve the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regarding your steps for testing. &nbsp;I have already tried that as it was suggested on several other posts. &nbsp;It didn't work. &nbsp;Even with all non-Microsoft services and startup items disabled, I still had the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>One other note. &nbsp;I have two user accounts. &nbsp;My main user account (which is an Admin account) is linked to a Microsoft account. &nbsp;That account is the one with the problem. &nbsp;If I login with my second account (which is a local account), it works fine.
<b>&nbsp;I would like to try reverting my main user account back to a local account</b>, but I haven't been able to do that because I can't get to the Change PC Settings screen while logged in with that account. &nbsp;Is there another (like from the command line) to
 revert to a local account?</div>
<div><br />

            Matt et All,
<div><br />
<div>I'm having the same problem and as of today. I had an update to restart for and this seems to be the result. It seems as if the svchost.exe is a parent for explorer.exe. I have the 32 bit and
 64 bit versions running at home and only the 64 bit is affected, if that helps.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I really need to get this figured out, so I'll be watching this thread.&nbsp;</div>

            Ok, I restarted in safe mode at minimal settings and was able to operate. I think that with the network turned off, the system did not try to log into my WIndows LIve account. I have a restore point from the 15th that I'm going to try and revert to. From
 there, I plan on turning off WIndows Updates since I think the last two updates is what caused this. I'll keep you posted as to my results.

            <p>All right, I'm back working. The two updates I have are KB2769165 and KB2770917. 165 is a digital signature update... so maybe it's the digital signature for the MS server that my account authenticates to since that seems to be what the problem was. In any
 event, I rolled back to before those two updates hit and everything's working again. &nbsp;I guess I'll wait to run updates for a few weeks to see what happens. I'll also check this thread to see if anyone else has more details. Hope this helps.

            <p>I am in the same boat.&nbsp; After an update in the last 2 or 3 days, My UI has stopped responding after a very short time.&nbsp; The mouse moves, but the buttons do not highlight.&nbsp; I can tap the Windows key and it will flip back and forth, and I can get the UI working
 again for only a very short time.. a matter of seconds.&nbsp; Most of my apps are stuck with 'installing'.&nbsp; It acts as if there's a mem leak or something stopped. I have many entries as well that svchost_TimeBroker has stopped.&nbsp; I tried a refresh of my system,
 and Windows 8 unkindly moved all of C drive apps/progs to windows.old.&nbsp; More time to fix things.&nbsp; Meanwhile, if I get to my desktop, it will generally work as long as I am in a program, IE or explorer, or installed games that still exist after the refresh.&nbsp;
 Please fix this asap, apparently there was a buggy update.&nbsp; I have run the UI troubleshooter, relogged from local account to active and back to local, ensured the computer time is correct, and ran the update troubleshooter, all to no avail.</p>

            Yes, same problem here. Applied the 13 Nov updates ( KB2769034, KB2769165 and KB2770917) on 15 Nov. Got the unresponsive problem, as mentioned above, suddenly on the 18 Nov. Between these 3 days, I did not make any software or hardware changes. There was
 an AVG Antivirus update between but doubt that's the problem. I had to reinstall windows 8 pro, after which, I applied the rest of the prior updates except for those 3 mentioned above. Will be keeping an eye on this thread.

            <p>I also got this behavior a while after I installed the updates that is mention in this thread.<br />
(Only thing I installed after the Windows Updates was some 'Metro' Apps. )<br />
</p>
<p>I reverted to the restore point prior to the updates and everything worked again. I then did a Windows Update again and install all the same updates again. (To check If I could recreate the problem) But this time I did not get any problem. Rebooted a couple
 of time of times to verify that the problem did not come back.&nbsp;<br />
I then created a manual restore point so I can revert to this state again if the issue comes back.</p>
<p>Guess the update in combination with somethings else triggers this problem. Problem are what the "else" part is. So far (2days) the problem has not returned.</p>

            my machine will not go to the desktop win+d or to the run prompt win+r or via mouse commands. Alt tab brings up the window and I can get MS config to run but the screen will not make that window active if I select it via alt-tab. &nbsp;so now how to I get this
 machine into safe mode.

    <title>Windows 10 second monitor issues. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 second monitor issues.</h2>
                    <p>Salaam!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a dell optiplex 7040 with intel hd graphics card and NVDIA Gforce Gtx1050.</p>
<p>I have to connect one hd tv through HDMI and one HDTV through DP to VGA converter in extended display mode. I have connected both through all combinations, removed converter, changed displays, updated graphics and monitor drivers, applied different resolutions,
 refresh rates, but Windows is unable to detect another display. But strangely both displays are working fine. I have to run and test a dual display game in unity. But unity says there is only one display because of Windows cannot detect other display.</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 64bit and 16GB RAM,</p>

            Hi Rafique, 
<br />
<br />You’ve done a ton already, but let’s try some others. 
<br />
<br />Download and install the latest BIOS
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/drivers/driversdetails?driverId=KTMMD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/drive...</a>

Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br />See if we have any luck. Next, make sure you’re running 1803, with all patches applied, test again. 
<br />
<br />Next, I’d uninstall the GTX card from Device Manager. Shut down, yank from the MB. Boot up the PC so it only detects the onboard graphics, verify the monitors work, etc. 
<br />
<br />Then reinsert the card, and install the latest driver, and give it a shot again. 
<br />
<br />It may seem like more of the same, but I’m trying to give you things you haven’t done that I would!
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

<p>I removed the drivers and external card. Updated BIOS, Updated Windows to latest version, installed the drivers for default intel graphics card. The Windows still says "didn't detect another display".</p>
<p>But both displays are working fine in duplicate and extended configuration. I not installed the NVIDIA card because if default card cannot pick second display, the external should not.</p>

            *scratching head* that is so crazy that they work fine, but windows won’t “detect” the monitor. <br /><br />Just for humors sake, and this may be a pain, but do you have a TV that could mimic a monitor? Try the combinations of the tv and both monitors so see if windows reacts differently? <br /><br />- C

<p>
</p><p>Sounds like 3 monitors?&nbsp; What does Identify show?&nbsp; I usually have a fiddle to do to get 3 separate screens in Extended mode. &nbsp; E.g. I would start with Second Screen Only and then switch to Extend.&nbsp; What happens?&nbsp; And what happens with Identify?&nbsp; In fact,
 I only have one physical adapter, the third screen is Wi-Fi Direct, so maybe that is why it seems so awkward.</p>

            One display is directly connected with HDMI. Next is the adopter that converts DP to VGA. Next is VGA replicator that is running 2 displays. But Windows should detect 2 displays at least. Strange thing is that the displays are working, and being identified
 but not being recognized. I am able to replicate, extend but I required detection at the same time. Because Unity3D required to detect displays at game start.

            Unfortunately, those look to be the two routes at this point, a reset or clean install. 
<br />
<br />Start &gt; Settings
<br />
<br />Click on Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery 
<br />
<br />Once in that tab, click on “Get Started” under Reset this PC. 
<br />
<br />This should take a moment, and you’ll be prompted to “Keep my files” or “Remove everything” - The process will start once one is chosen, your pc will reboot and a clean install of windows will start.
<br />

<br />
<br />Clean install:

<p><strong><span>Hi Arpit Vavadia,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Are you facing the issue with one particular DVD or all the DVD’s?<br />
<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may check the region settings and value for the change settings option –</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click<strong>Start</strong>, and then click
<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Click<strong>System and Maintenance</strong>, click
<strong>System</strong>, and then click<strong>Device Manager</strong>. <br />
<strong>Note</strong> If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click <strong>System</strong>, and then click<strong>Device Manager</strong>.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click<strong>Allow</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. In Device Manager, expand<strong>DVD/CD-ROM drives</strong>, right-click the CD and DVD device.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Click on<strong>properties</strong> and in the window click on the
<strong>DVD Region </strong>tab.<br />
<strong>Here check the value of change settings and if the value is 0 then you will not be able to make any changes to the region settings.</strong><br />
<br />
</span></span><strong><span>Note: You may change the DVD region settings only maximum 5 times. After that you may have to do a firmware reset or update.<br />
</span></strong><span><br />
<span>If you are able to change then make the change of region according to your location and the DVD you are using.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also to configure your DVD drive to play discs from other regions, select a geographic area from the list of regions. Typically, you would select
 the region in which you reside. <strong>It is not usually necessary to change the setting again.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may refer to the below link for assistance -<br />

<p>So your message stating the&nbsp; following</p>
<p><br />
<u><strong>Not at all. You just have to be signed in to be able to use the <em>Send to &gt; Mail recipient</em> function for an image file. When the message compose window opens, click on an image, then click the paperclip on the

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>will work on one computer but not another? That seems odd. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also as stated earlier when my thread sat from June 2 until today with no responses I just assumed it was time to look elsewhere for a solution and when&nbsp;I found one that worked I was very happy and posted to thank you for the solution and ask for clarification
 on one of the methods you had in your post and had I posted that thank you and question in my thread I doubt you would have known what I was referring to. I have copied and pasted in the past have been told to NOT cut portions out of another thread and paste
 them elsewhere and then expect people to know what you are talking about as they have no frame of reference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway this point has been belabored way too long and I am not sure how else to express myself so that I am not&nbsp; continually misunderstood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll just say thank&nbsp; you for helping me solve a problem I have had for a long time and couldn't seem to find an answer to even with my other thread sitting for many days.</p>

<h2>            15 repeated successful net Framework 4 Windows Updates &#40;KB2656351 KB260021&#41;</h2>
                    As described in several other threads the above updates have been installed successfully but come back next log on<br />
In my case this has happened for the last 15 days Other updates installed during that period installed with no problems<br />
I have tried every microsoft fixit and scan offered as a solution without success<br />
I am getting severely mad at watching the updates download then install on closedown taking 30 minutes<br />
I have considered uninstalling net Framework 4 and reinstalling it. <br />
However I am not convinced the problem lies with net framework 4. It seems equally likely to me that a Windows Update indexing file is corrupted
<br />
I am desperate to remove the problem ANY suggestions would be appreciated<br />

            I tried the suggested repair to net framework 4 <br />
On reboot the Windows Update screen automatically appeared with the message<br />
"All udates have been successfully installed"<br />
This was confirmed on the history screen which showed yet another success<br />
HOWEVER closing the screen and restarting Windows Update produced a differen message<br />
Yes you've guessed it "2 Important updates are available"<br />
I decided to hide these 2 updates as I am fed up with the closing down delay<br />
Will the updates really be installed successfully?<br />

            <blockquote>Neither 2656351 or 2600217 appear under <b>View installed updates</b><br />
</blockquote>
<p>Then neither of them are, in fact, installed - despite what <strong>Update History</strong> may be telling you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>I can not believe that a method of resolving&nbsp;this is not available for a program with so many millions of users.</blockquote>
<p>I never said the problem cannot be resolved. The only way that <em>I</em> know how to resolve it is by running a Repair - which you've already done (according to your earlier reply). See below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DISCUSSION: You might instead ask yourself why .NET Framework 4 (Client Profile&nbsp;and/or Extended) is installed to begin with?&nbsp;There are two (2) possible reasons:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. You installed an application which required .NET Framework 4 (e.g., QuickBooks; Intuit Tax Preparation software) - in which case either you would have been prompted to install KB982670 or possibly KB982671 or the application would have installed it for
 you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Windows Update offered &amp; installed <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/982670" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB982670</a> (most likely) as an <strong>Important</strong>, yet Optional, <em>non-security</em> update!&nbsp; Later on when Windows Update offered an
<strong>Important </strong><em>security-related </em>update or an Optional, <em>non-security</em> Reliability update (e.g., KB2600217), .NET 4 Extended would have been installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<em>What were they thinking?]</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving on:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OPTION A:</strong> Assuming you do <em>NOT</em> have an application installed which requires .NET Framework 4 =&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Uninstall .NET Framework 4 Extended (if listed) &amp; reboot, then uninstall .NET Framework 4 Client Profile &amp; reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. <strong>VERY IMPORTANT! =&gt; </strong>And then immediately "reset" Windows Update (cf.
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB910336</a>) &amp; reboot -&nbsp;<em>and then immediately&nbsp;</em>change your Automatic Updates (AU)&nbsp;setting to the the
<strong>Check for updates but let me choose...</strong> option (cf. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-how-Windows-installs-or-notifies-you-about-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-how-Windows-installs-or-notifies-you-about-updates</a>).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: The change will apply to ALL further updates. [If you&nbsp;fail to do&nbsp;the reset first, AU
<em>will</em> attempt to install KB2656351 and KB2600217&nbsp;again, without any prompts!]&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you've Approved an update, it
<em>will be</em> automatically downloaded and installed without any further notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. If &amp; when AU asks your to Approve <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/982670" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB982670</a>&nbsp;again, hide the sucker per <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/24376-windows-update-hide-restore-hidden-updates.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/24376-windows-update-hide-restore-hidden-updates.html</a>&nbsp;!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Many thanks for your assistance in this matter.<br />
I think I may have stumbled upon a solution<br />
Following one of the links on your reply I read about downloading the client support and full netframework4 files for local installation<br />
I tried simply running the full installation file in repair mode which failed and rolled back with 3 seperate error messages in a log<br />
I then remembered seeing the insistance in the client support file installation instructions to first carry out a clean boot.<br />
I clean booted and re-ran the full instaltion file in repair mode successfully (no errors)<br />
I rebooted normally and inspected the control panel installed updates. <br />
To my pleasure all full and client updates were shown as installed INCLUDING both kb2656351 and kb2600217<br />
Do you thik this is the end of the matter and I should close the thread?<br />

            <p>Very good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you need to ask yourself a question: What's loading in normal (Windows) mode that&nbsp;isn't loading when you start your computer in a Clean Boot environment?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you can answer that question, you'll know what the troublemakers are. After identifying the troublemakers, find out how to stop them from interfering again in the future - preferably by eliminating them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>So I played the Gears 3 beta on my roommate's 360, as I didn't bring mine to university. Question is, are the game saves stored only on a harddrive or will I still have my beta data if I recover my gamertag back home? Thanks.</p>

<p>They are saved on the Harddrive....and I think they are also linked to your gamertag. So you'll need both</p>

<h2>            the screen keeps moving right and left when I change the view</h2>
                    The screen for my computer moves left and right. The only solution I have&nbsp;found&nbsp;so far is to have the screen display the image in low&nbsp;resolution&nbsp;like this. When i switch the&nbsp;resolution&nbsp;I get this.

            <p>I suggest that you install the driver from AMD for the graphics card rather than from Windows Update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows update doesn't really provide version history of drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AMD provides the update to Microsoft and Microsoft provides it as a optional update.</p>

<h2>            The other person can&#39;t hear me when I&#39;m playing audio</h2>
                    So when I'm talking to my friend and I'm watching a video or playing a game with sound as well, my audio gets messed up for them but I can hear them just fine. Is there anyway I can fix this, or is it a problem with my computer specifically?

<p>Hi harishamarnath,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let's address your network concern with your WiFi. In order for me to have a better idea on what's going on, I would like to know these information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are your other devices able to connect to your <strong>D-LINK</strong> router without any issues?</li><li>After resetting the router, have you tried other user profiles if the issue is happening on other user profiles?</li><li>Is the issue re-occuring when connecting via Ethernet cable?</li><li>What is the version and build of your <strong>Windows 10</strong>?
<ul>
<li>You'd be able to have this checked by pressing the <strong>Windows button + R</strong> on your keyboard to open the
<strong>Run</strong> box, then type <em><strong>winver</strong></em> and press <strong>
Enter</strong> afterwards.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, as an initial troubleshooting I suggest that you run the <strong>
<a href="http://aka.ms/diag_networking10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">network troubleshooter</a></strong> on your
<strong>Winodws 10</strong>. This way, <strong>Windows</strong> would be able to check for issues and automatically fix them upon detection. If you've already performed this and still, only your
<strong>Windows 10</strong> is not able to connect to your router, I suggest that you forget
<strong>WiFi</strong> your windows is connected to, and <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17237/windows-10-mobile-wifi-connections" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reconnect to your WiFi connection</a></strong>. You might also want
 to consider the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4000461/windows-10-wifi-problems-home-layout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">settings that are set to your modem for your wireless connection</a></strong> as this might also be a factor.
 If all other WiFi devices such as mobile phones, tables, other laptops can connect with no issues, I recommend that you
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware-winpc/how-to-install-and-update-hardware-drivers-in/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">reinstall your network drivers manually</a></strong>.
 By doing so, you'd be able to ensure that your network drivers are up-to-date and also tailored fit for your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'll be waiting for your response to assist you further.</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 Wireless Controller Battery Charging - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> krumm151  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Wireless Controller Battery Charging</h2>
                    
<p>I have a rather technical question to ask. I am working on a project for a class at Iowa State University (I'm studying Electrical Engineering). I need to know what pins from the USB charger need to be connected to which contacts on the battery to charge
 the battery. I have dismantled the controller and am re-purposing it. I am using components from the controller (specifically the charger, rechargeable battery pack, motors, buttons and trigger mechanisms). My project is to create a modular device that attaches
 to a pinball machine that can be placed over the flipper button on one side and have a button on the other to allow both flippers to be operated on one side for single arm amputees.</p>

    <title>No sound - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laura deniz  say:</h3>
<h2>            No sound</h2>
                    <p>Hello ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This started when I updated my drivers with Driver Booster by Iobit. &nbsp;I never had any problem with this software before and I'm using it since years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It updated many drivers including the sound driver and the AMD graphics card driver. And the sound was gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since that I created a return point before updating , I rolled back to solve the issue. No luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted the drivers , both sound and graphics card drivers (because sometimes graphic card drivers affect the sound drivers for better game quality as I read somewhere) . I downloaded them from Device Manager. No luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I deleted them again , this time I manually downloaded them from Internet very carefully. No luck again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the volume manager down right side of the screen and click on the playback devices , everything seems allright.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wondered if the hardware had any problem , but I tried HDMI , I tried connecting speakers , headphones , nothing , no sound at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the tricky part :</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I asked a friend to check my pc , and he connected from teamviewer , he could hear every sound my pc was doing from his pc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then I formatted my pc , since its windows 8 it is easy to format. &nbsp;Ofcourse it means I downloaded and updated every driver again. Updated windows ect.. No luck.. no sound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'll bring my computer to the service for the first time If I can't solve it but first I wanted to open a thread here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance</p>

            Hi Laura,<br />
<br />
<br />
Bases on the information that you have provided us, considering that you have performed a clean install of Windows 8 and the issue persists, possible that this has something to do with a faulty hardware. We suggest that contact the manufacturer of your device
 for better assistance.<br />
<br />
Regards.

            Hi Michael
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Earlier version stored chats on the local computer. Starting Skype 8, chats are being stored in the cloud. Hence, a limit had to be decided and decision was for 2 years.

<p>
Why not to sync everything to the PC and keep it on the PC for an unlimited time frame?
</p><p>I am pretty sure, that I have enough free space there on my PC to keep a chat history for more than 100 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I access my older chat history from Skype 7 since I got forced to update to Skype 8 what I actually do not want?</p>
<p>Did I lose my complete history of many years by this unwanted update?</p>

            Any reference in a main.db file of an image, points to the cloud, when the file is not already cached locally. If you do not already have a copy stored locally, only &lt; 2 year old images would be available. All other older image links in the main.db would

<h2>            Moving Librariy files and folders to secondary hard drive</h2>
                    I recently purchased a new PC and am running Windows 10.&nbsp; The PC came with a 1 Tb hard drive and it is rapidly getting full.&nbsp; I just purchased and installed a 3 Tb hard drive and have installed it.&nbsp; I would like to move the 4 Library folders over to the
 new HD but am not sure how to do that other than&nbsp; cut and paste and it seems to me that doing it that way would cause problems.
