<h2>            Toshiba Satellite C650D laptop web camera stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Web Camera Fault</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Toshiba Satellite C650D laptop, 32bit using windows 7. Out of no where my web camera stopped working and just says "web camera initialization failed. Please check your device and re-start". I would not post on here unless I was really stuck but
 i've tried everything that i could think off. I completely deleted the driver for my computer and re-installed it about 3 times with same outcome. Completed all updates. Physically pulled apart laptop and cleaned around camera and dis-connected and connected
 wiring to camera. The web camera is not listed in device manager also.&nbsp;Any support with this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Given that you've tried re-installing the driver and you've checked the physical hardware, I think my next step would be to try restoring the registry and system files from a recent backup and check to see if it helps.&nbsp; If not, you can always undo the restoration
 process, so it's a good thing to try first.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
If the problem just began recently, you can restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point. System Restore doesn’t change your personal files. It only takes a couple minutes, and you can undo the process or try another date if it doesn't
 fix the problem on the first try. When you aren't sure where to go, this is by far the safest, fastest, and easiest option to try first.

            Thanks for taking the time to reply I did this trying a couple of different restore point with no luck. I'm starting to lean towards the problem being the web camera physically not working like not getting power?

            Hi Shashwat, there will be not issue reactivating Windows 10 when you want to reinstall. Windows 10 is totally different to previous versions of Windows. 
<br />
<br />When you initially activate Windows 10, a unique identifier is generated from your hardware, that is then stored in the Microsoft Activation Servers as a digtial entitlement for your PC. 
<br />
<br />Then when you reinstall Windows 10 at any time, Windows will automatically contact the Activation servers looking for this digital entitlement and activate automatically, with no user intervention
<br />
<br />So you will not even need your product key, just keep in mind these steps when reinstalling to avoid activation issues:
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues       
        </p>

            <p><span>Hi Zonged,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Based on the description, you are not able to mount the image from Disk Image Tools Manage ribbon.
 Correct me if I misunderstood the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1) Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps and check:</span></p>
<p><span>a) Open Windows Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Select the Image file and then click on Manage.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Once you clicked on Manage, you can see that Mount option is highlighted.
</span></p>
<p><span>d) Select Mount and check.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Once the image file is mounted it will display the contents of the image file. If it didn't displayed
 the contents of the image file, I would suggest you to open Windows Explorer and check in the virtual drive whether the contents of the image file mounted on to the drive or not.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>I hope it helps. If you have any issues regarding Windows in future please let us know. We will be happy to help you.</span></p>

<h2>            Error, format, missing files, installation problems... Great&#33; &#91;WINDOWS 7-8 INSTALLATION&#93;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please, first forgive me for my poor english, it is quite lacking since my first language is french.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm a web artist and I just changed my operating system from win 7 to win 8. As it was first very fine, I soon found out that the hardware reserved memory took 5 out of 8 Gb, leaving me with only 3 Gb to run very high definition images on photoshop. As
 lag is not my favorite thing online I just looked at google, found out I just had to check the BIOS, everything was fine even looking on how to find the bios with de PC Settings. This is where things were fine. I didn't find the way to access the BIOS.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My simple thinking was "why not go back to win 7?". My computer had a severe compatibility problems and simply could not install. My hard drive was not damaged by all luck and I forgot to take not of the RTS-thing compatibility. I cleaned up the drive,
 formated, nothing could be done. I gave up putting back my home premium. Being extremely angry and with the simplest idea of just asking the microsoft team, I tried to re-install windows 8 put was put in front of the legendary error 0x80070017 which is described
 as a:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"Error code 0x80070017 usually refers to bad media. If this is happening on both your flash drive and your burned DVD media I would recommend that you download the file again as you may have corruption in the ISO itself."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problems are that I do not have money for another disc drive and that my computer refuses to boot from a random key no matter how I try, be it software wise or manually using diskpart/cmd prompt. I fought, tried to burn again, but the original win8
 files in which I was shows Program files (x86) (32 bit base) are now gone and well... they appeared when I first installed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I shall now get to the point.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) I want access to my BIOS to regulate my RAM, I bought a computer in order to use 8Gb of RAM and not only 3, unlike many people, I use my RAM. Show me how to get to it. I checked out how to get to it and it just wont work. Startup Menu, anything. Event
 that restart-thingie. I spent my times on tutorial and I was left unable to get to my BIOS. The UEFI manufactured software button does not exist for me.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2) If win8 is not for my computer? CD corrupted. I don't mind. Give me a way to put back win7. I just love windows 8, I'd like to get a solution, but I'm stuck.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3) With further insistence, I managed ton install windows. I had to reburn cd after finding out the other was damages. This is the image I get. Before I try and re-install for the I-don't-know-how-many-times-it-is-now, I need help badly. The missing files
 makes it so I can't install some of my important softwares. Here is an image link:&nbsp;http://img28.imageshack.us/img28/7403/seiv.png</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you so much!</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>If you upgraded to Windows 8 from a different version of Windows, and you didn't format the partition during the installation process, files that were used in your previous version of Windows are stored in the Windows.old
 folder. The type of files in this folder depends on your computer. After you’ve used Windows 8 for a while—for example, one or two weeks—and you’re confident that your files and settings are back to where you want them to be, you might want to reclaim disk
 space by using Disk Cleanup to delete the Windows.old folder. Refer to these links for reference:</font></font></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Now, to come back to BIOS settings and graphics card memory allocation, if you are using a standard graphics card, you can go to BIOS settings and increase or allocate some additional memory for the display card which would
 in turn help to avoid memory issues while using high definition images on Photoshop. You can go to BIOS by using shortcut keys which appear across the manufacturer logo screen when you turn on the computer. For best reference on how to go to BIOS, it’s always
 recommended to refer to the manual provided by the manufacturer of the computer. When you reach the BIOS settings, locate the graphics card settings and then increase the memory allocation. For further reference, you can also contact the manufacturer of the
 computer.</font></font></font></p>

 any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Further adding few information, if you intend to install Windows 8, you can go for clean installation of Windows for better results. Refer to the link:</font></font></font></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><strong>Note:</strong> When you perform a clean installation, your existing version of Windows, including all of your files, settings, and programs, is automatically replaced. You can back up your files and settings, but
 you must manually reinstall your programs and restore backed-up files when the installation is done.</font></font></font></p>

    <title>Remote Desktop License Issue &#40;Disconnect in 60 minutes&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carson alexander  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote Desktop License Issue &#40;Disconnect in 60 minutes&#41;</h2>
                    Someone help! I really do not want to go through the trouble of reapplying this RDP server license to the server again. Here is the situation I am in. There are a total of 6 active users that work in my onsite server and use as a VM, through an RDP 10
 license user. 4 users have great experience and 0 issues when using the VM when jumping in. However, 2 of the users are experiencing an issue that i can't make sense of. When these 2 users jump in they get a prompt that says in the next 60 min. you will be
 disconnected from the remote session. I would assume that all users would get this if it is a license issue. This issue has just come up and previously for months the 2 users used it with no problem. Does anyone know a fix to this issue before I redo the license?
 I will be attaching a screenshot of the notification pop-up of what the 2 users are seeing. Thank you to anyone who is willing to help me with this!!<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/563d0bae-a2a5-46e4-b53f-595292427246?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/563d0bae-a2a5-46e4-b53f-595292427246?upload=true" /></a>

    <title>Can you have 2 sets of mirrored drives - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smarterit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can you have 2 sets of mirrored drives</h2>
                    <p>I have a Win7 x64 Pro box that i use as a file server. I originally set it up with 2, 1TB drives and mirrored them. Now I've outgrown them and purchased 2, 3TB drives to mirror.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I converted the disks to GPT disk to recognize above 2TB's, but when I try to create a Mirrored Volume, the option is greyed out. Every other other RAID option is also greyed out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What am I missing?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance- Smarter IT.</p>

            <p>I&nbsp;start out by admitting I have not done this my self but...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Disk Manager cannot create the mirrors in part because it cannot convert the GPT disks to Dynamic. I recollect however that the command line tool Diskpart can do this. Diskpart has more functionality than Disk Manager although it&nbsp;will do some "unsafe"
 tasks that Disk Manager protects you from, it does still protect the O/S drive from catastrophic changes. If you have an internal card reader it would avoid confusion to disconnect it to prevent the drives appearing in any lists. Also disconnecting the existing
 mirror would protect it from any changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open a Command prompt windows at Administrator level and issue the <strong>diskpart</strong> command.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the new command window <strong>List Disk</strong> to identify the disks you want to work with. You need to be 100% certain which ones you want to change. The list will be numbers but I will use letters</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<li>DISKPART&gt;<strong> <span>Select disk A</span></strong><br />
</li><li>DISKPART&gt;<span> <strong>Convert dynamic</strong></span><br />
</li><li>DISKPART&gt; <span><strong>Select disk B</strong></span><br />
</li><li>DISKPART&gt; <span><strong>Convert dynamic</strong></span><br />
</li><li>DISKPART&gt; <strong>Exit</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will need to reboot the PC (possibly twice) to recognise the "new" disks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter Diskpart again, <strong>List Disk</strong> to verify everything is as it should be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then <strong>Create Volume Mirror Disk=A,B</strong> should create a mirror using all of the disks A and B. You can add the parameter
<strong>Size=X</strong>(MB).&nbsp; I have no idea how long this task will take but I think synchronisation is on the fly still so should be reasonably quick.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The focus (Select) then automatically shifts to the new volume so the command <strong>
Assign Letter=&lt;driveletter&gt;</strong>&nbsp; will give the new volume its letter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I can clear a second 3 TB drive I will run through this myself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am having the same issue, but the MGA did allow me to copy and paste its results, which follow. &nbsp;It says I have several "tampered" files. &nbsp;I have the Windows install disc and product activation key. &nbsp;I've tried repairing my installation with the disc,
 but it couldn't find anything to repair. &nbsp;Any suggestions on how to fix this would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            How to completely abort and remove a started game download&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I initialized a new X1 yesterday and started a download, and stopped - so it was never finalized.</p>
<p>But it remained in "to install" or whatever it was called.</p>
<p>But found no alternative to just delete that?</p>

<p>Only way I found was to Delete all saved games -a and console rebooted after.</p>
<p>Then it was gone.</p>

<p>Is there a smooth way, maybe, you can do this?</p>
<p>The interface of X1, compared to 360, is counter intuitive. Really odd UI and takes some time to figure out.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>If you are having issues with installing the game please see the guide below and hopefully this will help you.</p>
<p>If you are not wanting to install the game and would &nbsp;just like to remove the game from the waiting to install list all you have to do is highlight the title in the list press the menu button on the controller and select the option to hide the game.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I found the hide game thingy, so that hides it - but how are you supposed to clear disk occupied unless you uninstall, but uninstall does not exist unless download complete?</p>
<p>If you downloaded so-so-gigabytes but decided not to complete it.</p>
<p>There must be a way to abort-so temporary download files are deleted?</p>
<p>It feels like you in windows would remove an icon from desktop, and consider program removed and uninstalled.</p>
<p>I will make a good read on the help in general and see if I find anything.</p>

<p>This method worked for me, but it can take some time for the download to disappear from the queue.</p>
<p>Step 2: Cancel the download</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;"On the Home screen, scroll to the right and open My games &amp; apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select Queue.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Highlight the game you’re trying to install.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Press the Menu button on the controller.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select Cancel."</p>
<p>I hope it works for you too :)</p>

<p>Pirate fan - thank you. &nbsp;I will try that next time.</p>
<p>It looked very different at first when I started download, from the game in Live(or what it's called).</p>
<p>But when it ran for a good while the console just shut down. I later found the shut down at inactivity setting, and it said 1 hour. So it does not sense that download is in progress, so later changed that setting knowing about it.</p>
<p>But it continued if I activated on queue, no other options that just pause. But will check again and do a download attempt I cancel. But it look very different inside games n apps in console, than at the time you just stop from Live screen.</p>

<p>Hey there BookishFlunky90,</p>
<p>If you wish to cancel an installation, highlight the title in the "install queue" and press the menu button on the controller and select the option to stop or cancel the installation. This removes the partial game install from the console and frees up the
 space.</p>
<p>Did that help?</p>

<p>Mister Mascot, thank you.</p>
<p>On the 360 it was much more clear with various downloads. Everything is hidden in X1 just about.</p>
<p>In 360 you got question if to transfer download to background etc.</p>
<p>360 interface was brilliant and very intuitive - simple symbol right on screen what options are available.</p>
<p>I will wait for my games on disk to arrive and see what mandatory updates are on those first, then test with own inititated download if I find a title, and pause and see if anything is available to stop it. I remember only pause was available. At least from
 live screen - after console shut itself down during download - I came to local screens and will have to refresh my memory, but if stop was available I would have found it. Only thing selecting it continue download as I remember.</p>
<p>And for some reason the icons from the game remain in system, and you have to manually hide those. I don't get that thinking. A normal trash can would resemble how all other software do it - on pc, on my smartphone.</p>
<p>Why fix something that works?</p>
<p>X1 interface is having so many changes that serves no purpose in my view, just introduce new terms for things long time established in industry.</p>
<p>You invent something like snap, that is everywhere else called docking in sidebar.</p>
<p>Here you abort things like a download and icons remain in the ready to install and have to manually be hidden.</p>
<p>I remember for sure that initiated download from live "get it", only had pause. Will check later how local queue says - as I recall it only pause and if selecting again continue.</p>
<p>I will have my first disks here on thursday and will get back and report how it goes with a download once I know bandwidth for the rest of the month will last, installed and ready.</p>

<h2>            wireless mouse stopped working</h2>
                    <b><i>Reinstalling a Microsoft driver</i></b><br />
<br />
My wireless mouse has stopped working. After much re-booting and checking, I've been told it was cause by Windows and that either the driver or the register file has been corrupted and that is what that has caused the problem. There is no software to re-install
 on Windows, as when the USB port receives a wireless mouse transmitter, it has just worked. How do I reinstall those two features?

<p>It is to your advantage not to mark a response as "the answer" unless it is.</p>
<p>Based off your response above - the reply you have since marked as the answer is *not* the answer.&nbsp; However, anyone scanning the forums for unanswered questions to help someone answer will see it and likely pass right by as&nbsp;this conversation is now marked

<h2>            Wireless XBox 360 Controller for Windows won&#39;t sync</h2>
                    I just purchased the Wireless Xbox 360 Controller for Windows from a local large store. I have installed the drivers from the CD, plugged in the receiver and tried to sync the controller to the receiver. The receiver blinks when I push the sync button,
 but when I push the sync button on the controller the lights go around about half a time and then all 4 blink. It never syncs with the wireless.<br />
<br />
I have moved it away from the wireless internet router, unplugged my wireless keyboard &amp; mouse as well as turning off the wireless printer as suggested, but it still won't sync.<br />
<br />
I'm running Windows 7 64 bit, if that makes a difference.<br />
<br />
This controller has been synced to the Xbox in the other room before, so I know it works.<br />
<br />
Is the receiver a dud?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            I got it working.<br />
<br />
It was this program I downloaded called Motion in Joy (lets you use a ps3 controller on your pc)&nbsp; that was overriding my wireless xbox controller drivers.<br />

Stay away from Motion in Joy!<br />

<h2>            Converting a 2007 PST file to a 2000 PST </h2>
                    I have a user that is currently using Outlook 2000. Her email was archived with a Machine using Outlook 2007. She now needs to access the old PST files and Outlook 2000 will not recognize the 2007 PST. Any help on how I can convert the 2007 to 2000 would
 be awesome of any of you.<br />

            I actually found my own answer out. <br />
<br />
Here are the steps in case any of you run into this in the future.<br />
<br />
"
<ol>
<li>Start Outlook. </li><li>On the <strong>File</strong> menu, click <strong>
Data File Management</strong>, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.
</li><li>Click <strong>Outlook 97-2002 Personal Folders File (PST)</strong>.
</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to accept the default name, and then click
<strong>OK</strong> again. <br />
<br />
Outlook 2003 now creates a new .pst file that is based on the earlier .pst file and maintains the ANSI formatting for that .pst file.
</li><li>Click <strong>Close</strong>. </li><li>At the bottom of the navigation pane, click <strong>Folder List</strong>.
<br />
<br />
In the navigation pane, you now see the new .pst file. </li><li>Drag the information from your existing Outlook 2003 or Outlook 2007 folders to the new .pst file. You may also use the Import and Export Wizard on the
<strong>File</strong> menu to move the information from your existing Outlook 2003 or Outlook 2007 folders to the new .pst file.
</li><li>In the navigation pane, right-click the new .pst file, and then click <strong>
Close "file_name"</strong>. </li></ol>
<p><br />
It's a bit tedious if the file is large...but it works...Please remember when you move the folders do a "Copy" not just a drag and place...and as always...make sure you have a backup of the PST file before doing any work on it...<br />
<br />
I dont work for MicroSoft...but I do have my MSCE+ and I stayed at a holiday Inn last night.....LOL</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the make&nbsp;of the Toshiba laptop?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not find Windows 8.1 3D video controller driver from Toshiba and Intel website, then please refer to this link and click on 'Automatically detect and update drivers and software' from this link:
<a href="http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/highlights/graphics/3cp-hd4000gfx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/highlights/graphics/3cp-hd4000gfx</a><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Download and install drivers</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers</a><br />
</p>
<p><br />
If you still cannot find it, you can run Windows Update, it may find the driver.<br />
<strong>Do I need to check for updates? <br />

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there are not able to find any drivers still, then I would suggest you to post your query in Toshiba and Intel forum for availabilty of the driver.<br />

<p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">This issue occurs when Windows previously tested the system and provided an index rating. If the hardware changed since the initial testing process, the original values
 are stored until they are updated. This procedure is performed to support existing software and features that rely on the Windows Experience Index rating information.

<p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">The Windows Experience Index evaluates the scores of hardware configurations and updates items that have high scores. Each score in the Windows Experience Index relates
 to a particular hardware item. For example, the Memory score relates to random access memory (RAM). The Graphics score relates to the video card.

<h2>            USB Mouse device not recognized when laptop is in charge</h2>
                    <p>Original title: USB device not recognized </p>
<p>
</p><p>After several month of use, I have a problem with usb mouse. It says USB device not recognized. Here is a picture, and one in device manager, too.
</p>

<p>It shows only in usb 3.0, in usb 2.0 nothing happens, like nothing is attached. When I put flash drive, it is detected immediately.</p>
<p>This is happening only when laptop is in charger, when I use battery mouse is working fine.</p>
<p>I think it is software problem, because every part is working for itself just fine.</p>
<p>What can I do to solve problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>All the drivers are up to date. And windows is updating them automatically.</p>
<p>When problem started, nothing was installed on computer. Last software installation was a week before, or even earlier, can`t remember, but everything worked just fine.</p>
<p>Browsing the internet I saw a lot of people are having a similar issue with usb devices on windows 10.</p>

</p><p>I did all You said. Step 1 gave no result, so I uninstalled drivers (step 2). Than I installed touchpad drivers from Acer site (there are no drivers for mouse). I can`t find any drivers for my mouse on the internet (this one http://int.ms-start.com/proizvodi/gaming_gaming-zicani-misevi/ms-imperator-gaming-mis).</p>
<p>And now, there is no difference if laptop is in charge or battery.</p>
<p>Here is picture with available drivers.</p>
