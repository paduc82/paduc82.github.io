                    upon starting up I am getting the following error code:&nbsp;
<div>windows xp sp3; stop error code: 0x0000007x (0x00000000,0x00000000,0x00000000,0x0000000)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If the computer sits for several hours it will boot up and operate just fine. &nbsp;All fans are working properly. &nbsp;I have done hardware checks (memory) and all are in OK. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This began when a power fail occurred ( thanks FPL). &nbsp;At the time of the power fail I was sinking my apple iphone. &nbsp;Ever since then start up when the copmputer has been running results in the stop code above.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Any suggestions on how to correct this situation?</div>

<br />
</span><br />
</p>
<p><span><span>What is the make &amp; model of the computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
Letâ€™s follow these methods &amp; check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><b><span><br />
Method 1</span></b></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may run a complete disk check on your machine. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information, refer this link: </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>How to perform disk error checking in Windows XP</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><b><span><br />
Method 2</span></b></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try to update the BIOS (Basic Input Output System) and the chipset drivers &amp; check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
If you need assistance to update BIOS (Basic Input Output System), I would recommend you to contact your computer manufacturer to update the BIOS (Basic Input Output System).<br />
<br />
<b>Note:</b> Modifying BIOS/ chipset incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/chipset can be solved. Modifications of the
 settings are at your own risk.</span></span></p>

            Thanks for your response!
<div><br />
<div>Here is what has transpired so far. &nbsp;I was able to perform disk error checking with no negative results.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Additionally I downloaded several utilities from Intel (my MB manufacture etc.) and am able to perform hardware monitoring of equipment and components. &nbsp;The good news is that all systems operate well within temperature and voltage requirements. &nbsp;While
 at the Intel site I also downloaded various driver updates (for the MB) and installed them. &nbsp;Each time a reboot (restart - while operating) was necessaryand the computer restarted fine (which it also has down in the past). &nbsp;No issues when the system is up
 and operating. &nbsp;Only when the system is powered down manually or via a power supply fail does the boot up process give the BSOD.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then took a deep breath and downloaded the the BIOS update - mine was the original issue. &nbsp;Following Intel's instructions I installed the BIOS setting using their express for Windows installer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Upon installing the BIOS settings, in the DOS window it stated &nbsp;all installs were done correctly. &nbsp;And in the DOS window was the final line saying "....please restart system."&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I had watched the Intel videos before performing the BIOS set up, and the videos showed &nbsp;a screen that appeared at the completion of the BIOS install, after windows booted up, saying the BIOS install had completed correctly. &nbsp;That screen never appeared
 - only the DOS message asking to reboot. &nbsp;I might add that that DOS message screen that I received was not shown in the Intel video.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then took a deep breath, and re-booted the system and the screen began to flicker with the usual indications of the BIOS setting up prior to Windows starting. &nbsp;Then the Windows logo appeared with the moving status bar. &nbsp;I should note that previously
 the moving status bar would only go through 1 and &nbsp;1/4 "trips" and then it would hang and the BSOD appeared with the above string notations.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This time, however the the moving bar went through 2 1/2 trips and then hung! &nbsp;BSOD appeared with the same indicator screen as noted above. &nbsp;Frustrated, I rebooted again, only to have it happen time and time again. &nbsp;Finally in exasperation I simply walked
 away from the computer and let it continue its reboot cycle on its on ( the 30 second clock).</div>
<div><br />
<div>About 2 hours later I went into my office and lo and behold, on the monitor, was the Windows logo screen floating about. &nbsp;Stunned, I moved the mouse and there appeared the Intel window message (as shown in the video) stating the BIOS had updated correctly.
 &nbsp;At that point Windows opened up with my user icon present. &nbsp;I clicked the icon and the system is operating fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, I am deathly afraid to shut it down! &nbsp;The system is operating flawlessly since all of the above have been done. &nbsp;In fact I am using the system to write this message to you!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't know if the system will reboot correctly if it is shut down manually - I am to afraid to try. &nbsp;I fear it will go through the hours on end &nbsp;of rebooting before it does restart -
<b><u>if</u></b> it does. &nbsp;I guess at this point I will let it run full time until it shuts off via a power fail or something other circumstance.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any more suggestions to check while the system is operational? &nbsp;I am also wondering if the heat sink material may be "used up", and a temperature spike happens when manually shut down, &nbsp;Trying to immediately restart cause system failure - maybe because
 of a "high temp signal?" &nbsp;Just a thought....</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thus the hardware operating system is now up to its most current revisions and updates. &nbsp;What would be your next course of action? &nbsp;Any more insight would be greatly appreciated!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Hello Gary-help,</p>
<p>At this point, since the&nbsp;machine is in Windows, it may be wise to go ahead and move any important data on the computer to an alternate location.&nbsp; After doing so, I am afraid that there is no way to know that this is resolved without performing a restart
 of the operating system.&nbsp; As this is the case, I would like for you to choose a time for an "administrative restart."&nbsp; This will tell us if the issue is resolved or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Matthew_Ha</p>

<p>Hi Phil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why Windows Update is not working could be caused by a problem with the SoftwareDistribution. To troubleshoot this issue, let's rename the
<em>SoftwareDistribution</em> folder on your computer. This folder is an essential component for Windows Update, which temporarily stores files needed to install new updates. If you're having trouble with Windows Update, it's safe to empty the content of the
 SoftwareDistribution folder. Windows 10 will always re-download all the necessary files, or re-create the folder and re-download all the components, if removed.<br />
<br />
For steps on how to rename the SoftwareDistribution folder, kindly follow the steps provided by Andre Da Costa found on this

<p>My updates are failing since last year!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It requires every day at least three or four times reboot of PC to install new updates, which I can't do during the day, as it takes 10-15 minutes to reboot and at the end, it says that updates were unsuccessful and the PC is returning back to its previous
 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is really happening every day and sometimes, I just go away from PC for few minutes during the working day and it reboots itself and I have to wait 10-15 minutes, to find out the same message. But then it takes another 10 minutes for all my software
 to start.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On top&nbsp;of the already mentioned updates, KB4048953 also fail to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, my PC is old, but since I installed one update in November 2016, my second graphics card stopped working, so I can't use all four of my screens and don't want to buy another one for hundreds of pounds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is really annoying and I have probably spend 30-50 hours, trying to follow a variety of instructions from the net, but never succeeded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I am not ready to buy a new desktop, as this one, except failing to upgrade is working fine, so why should I buy the new one....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not tech and 80% of the instructions how to fix the issues are&nbsp;alien&nbsp;information, impossible for a normal user to understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHAT SHALL I DO?<br />

<p>I started to follow the original procedure. so I rebooted in airplane mode to turn the internet connection off, but it was still connected, so I turned the PC off, turned off my router, and rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It booted to "Preparing Automatic Repair" and it goes to a screen asking me to pick my language, but I have no keyboard or mouse!!&nbsp; (USBs are inactive) I can boot to the bios setup and have mouse and keyboard, but nothing I try gets me past the "Preparing
 Automatic Repair" roadblock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I've ordered a new PC due for delivery next week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look for my resources to load on the new computer and unearth an old recovery DVD, so I boot to that and get 4 or 5 repair options, none of which work. The final one is to perform a memory test, so I try that, it passes, and the computer boots up!?!?!?!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that I can keep the old computer running until the new computer is setup, I may try to see if I can restart it a second time and eventually see if I can follow your suggested procedure to cure the original problem, which still continues daily.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Stuck At Start Up - Blue Restarting Screen with Spinning Dots</h2>
                    <p>I'd upgraded from Win8.1 to Win10 for about a month or so. It's all been smooth until one day I woke up, booted up my laptop, and after the initial Acer load screen (I own an Acer Aspire E15) , a blue "Restarting..." image appeared with spinning dots and
 it's just stuck there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've left it on for about 2 hours or so and hard rebooted my laptop - but the same screen re-appeared again. I regret the day that I trusted Microsoft to launch a new OS, but I can't even log in to revert back to Win8.1 anymore. Please help.</p>

<h2>            When opening word documents in Windows 7 it opens Internet Explorer</h2>
                    
<p>I had an HP vista 64 bit computer.&nbsp; I bought Windows 7 and loaded it as an upgrade.&nbsp; My spreedsheet docs open with no problem, but when I try to open a Word document, it opens Internet Explorer and a window pops up that says "File Download" and ask if I
 want to OPEN or SAVE or CANCEL.&nbsp; If I click OPEN it goes back to Int Exp and opens another File Download window asking the same as the first.&nbsp; If I rename the file and try to open it, I get the same windows.&nbsp; Anybody know what is going on?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Backup</h2>
                    <p>I Have Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a long time I have purchased an external Hard Drive to backup my PC.&nbsp; The PC disk is 1TB so I purchased a 1 TB external drive - even though the Hard did is less than half full.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Windows 7 backup software I have tried to run a backup but this fails every time with the error "The last backup did not succeed successfully" and very little other information - not a lot to go on I know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone advise me how to ensure that I can run regular Backups, using either File History or Windows 7 Backup and also where to get further info if this is required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Backup and Restore (Windows 7) was intended to make it possible to restore backups that you made on Windows 7 to Windows 10. It was not intended to be used for making backups on Windows 10, although people try to do that anyway with varying degrees of success
 or, in many cases, failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has two backup utilities: File History and System Image. That's what you should be using if you want to use Windows 10's own utilities for backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally use third-party programs for backing up because, in my opinion, they are easier to work with, more convenient and have many more features than the utilities in Windows 10. That's not a criticism of Windows. Many of Windows' own utilities are
 there to provide a basic amount of functionality for people who don't know how to install third-party programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're okay with third-party software, you will find much better choices for backing up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. On the one hand, backups are typically compressed, so you'll need much less than 500 GB of space to store a 500 GB backup. On the other hand, you'll want to maintain a rotating history of backups - say, the last five backups or the last week of backups
 - so it was a good idea to purchase a 1 TB external drive.</p>

<p>Thank you for your advice.&nbsp; Until I can find out more about third party software I decided to stick with File History.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set up File History and it seemed to be running OK.&nbsp; It is supposed to save files every three hours but I don't know if that is everything or just stuff that has changed.&nbsp; I looked at the File History &gt; Advanced Settings &gt;View Event Logs this morning
 and saw that there were 1,486 events which seems like an awful lot (should there be any at all?).&nbsp; Most were warnings stating:
</p>
<p><strong>Directory was not backed up because it is a reparse point: &lt;filename&gt; If you want it to be protected, remove the reparse point.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The errors were few but related to the three same files:</p>
<p>
</p><div><strong>File was not backed up due to an error:</strong></div>
<div><strong>C:\hiberfil.sys&nbsp;</strong>or <strong>C:\pagefile.sys </strong>or <strong>
C:\swapfile.sys</strong></div>
<div><strong>Windows will not attempt to back up the file again, unless it is modified.</strong></div>
<p>
</p><p>What do these errors and warnings mean, do I need to do anything about them and will the backup still be effective if I ignore them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can advise I would be grateful.</p>

</p><p>you do not want hiberfil, pagefile or swapfile to be included, this will just fill up your file history drive because they are constantly changing.</p>
<p>hiberfil.sys is where it saves the system state when hibernating</p>
<p>pagefile and swapfile are used for virtual memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>if deleted they will be recreated by the os when needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>file history should be used only for your data files not the system.</p>
<p>create a system image (or two) as suggested by bulldogXX and exclude the route of c: and any temp folders from file history.</p>

</p><p>I have tried to create a system image using File History but the link takes me to Windows 7 Backup and Restore.&nbsp; I have tried anyway and get the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"The backup failed</strong></p>

<p>Hi,</p>

</p><p>Thanks for providing details about your concern. Just to verify, did you know the location of the

<p>

<h2>            Code 52 for USB Composite Device driver &#40;cannot verify driver signature&#41; after installing August 2014 updates on Windows 7 x64</h2>
                    <p>After installing the August 2014 updates, my wireless USB mouse/keyboard stopped working, and the receiver is marked as "USB Composite Device" with code 52 - Cannot verify driver signature.
</p>
<p>The usbccgp.sys file for Windows 7 is really not signed (unlike the one in Windows 8.1), but I've never had a problem with this until the recent updates.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, those values are not in the reg key you asked for. (Note: I'm not experiencing the issue any more).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to resolve the issue by rolling back a system restore point, and by that time the update&nbsp;KB2982791 was pulled - I wonder if the issue was caused by this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all other August 2014 updates installed, the issue did not reappear.</p>

    <title>Unable to type Other User username or password for Windows 10 login - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kimberly terry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to type Other User username or password for Windows 10 login</h2>
                    I recently upgraded from Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 Pro using the 32-bit CD. &nbsp;I have no issues logging in initially. &nbsp;When I log out or switch users, I click on Other User to log back in as a different user. &nbsp;Sometimes it works fine. &nbsp;But usually I am
 unable to click in either box to enter a new username or password. &nbsp;In order to login as a different user, it requires a restart and then the login works normally. &nbsp;I've only seen this issue on one computer out of about 50 others that were upgraded from Windows
 7 Pro this past summer. &nbsp;Is this some glitch and is there another solution other than restarting every time?

<p>The login issue has nothing to do with keyboards or passwords; those all work fine. There is no box to type in a username or password. Only when I restart the computer am I able to type in the username and password box.</p>

            <p>I am the IT Specialist for a SMB and have noticed the same issue crop up on a few of our computers as well, specifically over the last two of weeks. We run delayed updates, and there doesn't seem to be a rhyme or reason with a specific Windows Update triggering
 the glitch, as some computers are on older and some on newer builds, and it's a mixed bag of who's affected. Every time it's happened a reboot has solved it, but I'm hoping for a faster or more permanent solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We use a Windows Domain, and when a user needs to log in they click the "other user" option. For a very small, random smattering of instances the Other User will pop up with a password field but no username field to type in. Being unable to type in their
 username means they are unable to log in, as both fields are required. Typically the previous user has left for lunch and may have open programs, so rebooting the computer is not an ideal solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried Googling everything I can think of for this issue and this is the first matching example I've been able to find after half an hour of looking. I wish I could contribute a solution, but hopefully someone else posting here will up the chances of
 one being found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to override incorrect album info and art displayed automatically by Media Player&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Some of my cds are private venture albums released by local artists. These post as unknown and I can load the album info manually, but I haven't found a way to manually load the album art.&nbsp; In some cases, the artist later goes on to commercial releases.
 In those cases Media Player finds the art and info for&nbsp;another commercial release and displays that instead of the correct data, or inserts album info and art from a completely unrelated release with some common connection. (Artist name, album name, etc)&nbsp;</p>
<p>SO ... how can I insert album art for 'unknown' albums?</p>
<p>and how can I override the incorrect art Media Player inserts of it's own?</p>

            <p>Peter, Hi - I'll be happy to help you with this...</p>
<p>You can add the correct album art (and any other info) in WMP library view... for the art make sure it is a jpeg file (about 500x500 - not too huge) click copy (important - otherwise you won't see 'paste') and with the album open in WMP library (but not
 playing) click on the album icon and click 'paste'.</p>
<p>To make sure WMP doesn't overwrite corrected info, select 'organize' - 'options' - and make sure the three tabs seen in the image below are set as shown... Cheers, Ric.</p>
<p>(use the 'zoom' on your browser to see these more clearly)</p>

<p>can you give some more info?&nbsp; Such as, what do you mean it's disabled?&nbsp; Are you using the quick launch toolbar, or are you talking about the taskbar (where the clock resides?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What errors are you getting?&nbsp; What is the performance?&nbsp; In short, what exactly happens when you try to access your toolbar?<br />
<br />
The more info the better; that will help us to narrow down the possible causes.</p>

    <title>Starting Windows 7 Slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arkane78  say:</h3>
<h2>            Starting Windows 7 Slow</h2>
                    I recently bought a new computer, it did not come with an OS.<br />
<br />
(Core i7 3820 @ 3.6GHz, 32GB 1866MHz RAM, 2x 240GB Corsair GS SSD, 2x Seagate 2TB HDD - SSDs are plugged into onboard Intel ports, HDDs are plugged into onboard Marvell ports - No RAID of any kind)<br />
<br />
I used Acronis Backup and Recovery 11.5 to restore my old PC OS and data. Removed the old drivers and installed the new ones using Universal Restore.<br />
<br />
All was going well - my boot time (from 'Starting Windows' to Desktop) was around 45 seconds.<br />
Today, that has gone from 45s to around 1m 15s - but the reason is what eludes me.<br />
<br />
All drivers are up-to-date, event viewer shows nothing as failing.<br />
SFC /SCANNOW does state there are some problems, but working out how to fix those is a nightmare, it refers me to a logfile that is less than easy to read or interpret and even if I could interpret it, I'm not sure how to go about fixing it.<br />
To the best of my knowledge, the SFC /SCANNOW issues were present when the OS was cloned and are not a result of cloning.<br />
<br />
Booting into Safe Mode makes no difference, which as far as I understand it, means it's not a driver problem or some software I have installed.<br />
I also have boot logging enabled but this hasn't proved very useful.<br />
<br />
I have tried to use Event Viewers Diagnostics-Performance logs, which seem to indicate that BootSmssInitTime is where my problem lies, comparing it with a previous Event Log it shows this:<br />
<br />
Was: BootSmssInitTime - 6617<br />
Now: BootSmssInitTime - 46476<br />
<br />
Other entries are comparable with each other and aren't massively different, unlike this one.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm lost. I don't know what else I can try with this, I've considered doing a Windows 7 Repair Install to see if that solves anything but before I do that, I thought I'd ask and see if anyone has any ideas.<br />
<br />
I'm happy to try almost anything with the exception of a reinstall.<br />

If you are experiencing problems with Slow start up, I would recommend to use Autorun for windows.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a very good tool for finding&nbsp;, disabling or removing unwanted stuff on start up. However be careful about what you disable and do&nbsp;a research before it.&nbsp;</p>

            I've done more investigation - on a whim, I disabled the Marvell controller (which has 2 HDDs attached).<br />
<br />
Rebooted and my boot time was around the 20s mark, nowhere near 45s.<br />
I re-enabled the controller and rebooted again, back to 1m+.<br />
<br />
Next I disabled 1 drive at a time, rebooting each time, so that I could determine where the problem was.<br />
<br />
Disabling both drives - fast boot.<br />
Disabling drive 1 only - slow boot.<br />
Disabling drive 2 only - fast boot.<br />
<br />
It looks like drive 2 is the culprit, but I can't think why, both drives are the same make/model.<br />
ST2000DM001-1CH164 - running firmware CC24.<br />
<br />
Edit: Yet more strangeness - shrinking the drive size down from 2TB (1.8TB) to 1TB speeds up the boot time by 20s. Wiping the drive entirely, with it having no partitions at all, boot up is back to 20s.<br />
<br />
Both drives failed the seatools short DST so this could be that both drives are somehow damaged.<br />
<br />
So, assuming that both drives could be damaged, how can we fix the SFC errors I get? Do I need to post a log somewhere?<br />

As far as I know, You will require Windows installation disk in order to perform repair for SFC errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Checking your disk for errors might also help to fix the existing problems.</p>

All disks have been checked for errors and none have been found. I haven't checked for surface errors however.<br />
<br />
Will it make much difference if my Windows install is SP1, but my retail media is not?<br />
Whilst I can download SP1 media (if I need to) - I do not have the capability to burn it as I have no DVDs.<br />
<br />
Would it work if I used the Windows 7 USB DVD Tool and put the DVD content onto a USB stick?<br />

I am not sure about this. Better to post a new question for it, so someone else can help you&nbsp;on that.

            I've managed to 'fix' it after a fashion - it turns out that leaving drive 2 alone and wiping all data on it keeps the boot times quick.<br />
<br />
The more data I add, the slower my boot becomes.<br />
<br />
What's peculiar is that windows isn't set to even look at this drive for anything on start, all the drive contains (or should contain) is media files, these aren't part of the libraries.<br />
<br />
Does this sound like a dodgy hard drive?<br />

The more data I add, the slower my boot becomes.<br />
<br />
What's peculiar is that windows isn't set to even look at this drive for anything on start, all the drive contains (or should contain) is media files, these aren't part of the libraries.<br />
<br />
Does this sound like a dodgy hard drive?<br />
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, What is your hard drives specification (The RPM for each?)? (It all depends on this)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have any files on them (large files like media files and photos)? If you have too many files then the only way to improve the performance is to perform disc defragment and clean up. If your drive is very old then checking your disk for error could
 also help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that you have done&nbsp;most of&nbsp;above already. Therefore I would suggest that if you are not using these drives all the time i.e. if you are not going to install programs or Operating System on them then it is better to use them as external hard drives
 and connect them only when you need anything from them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest to have one hard drive&nbsp;with good spec (lot of space say 800 GB)&nbsp;for your Windows Operating System then create a separate partition (say 100GB)&nbsp;for saving your&nbsp;files&nbsp;(That you use more often ) and install your third party programs there if
 you can using custom installation. then leave your drive&nbsp;C: or OS drive alone and try not install too many programs or save files&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing to&nbsp;check if you want to have all drives connected to your pc, is to check your boot order. make sure that&nbsp;the priority is set to drive that has your OS or windows 7 on it. This might helps a bit on boot performance.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general then more hard drives or external devices are connected to&nbsp;your&nbsp;PC , the slower your boot time will be. Therefore they have to be high spec and to have up to date drivers (Compatible with windows 7&nbsp;) to work properly&nbsp;with highest possible performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore if it is not necessary for them to be connected, just use them for back up or keeping your files. This way your files will be safe even if something goes wrong with your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also have you tried minimising your start up programs?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            There are 4 drives in total.<br />
<br />
2 are SSD drives (Corsair Force GS 240GB).<br />
2 are Seagate ST2000DM-001 7200RPM 2TB.<br />
<br />
All drives have been checked for errors, none found.<br />
<br />
SSD Drive 1 is OS, it only has applications installed on it that cannot be installed on a separate drive or give problems if installed on separate drive.<br />
<br />
SSD Drive 2 is Applications, it only has applications installed on it, it also contains my favourites and some parts of my user profile (redirected, so that if the OS drive or OS ever fails, I can restore from backup without losing data).<br />
<br />
Drive 3 is where the bulk of my data lives, it holds Virtual Machines, MP3s and various other kinds of data essential to my job.<br />
<br />
Drive 4 holds nothing but media files.<br />
<br />
Boot order is set to Drive 1 is the only thing listed, if I needed to boot from anything else, I have the boot override menu (F12) in BIOS.<br />
<br />
The strange thing is this:<br />
<br />
If I DISABLE (not disconnect) Drive 4 in Windows 7, my boot time is unaffected.<br />
If I ENABLE it, my boot time slows down (boot time = Starting Windows screen only) a little, although certainly not as much as it did originally.<br />
<br />
Strangely enough, completely blanking the drive and repartitioning it and copying the exact same data back, seems to have dropped the slow down from over 1 minute, to a few seconds.<br />
<br />
My start-up programs are only the bare essentials and most of them are delayed or disabled as required. The issue is that once I get to the 'loading profile' part - everything is extremely quick.<br />

<h2>            WMI host throwing errors and using high CPU percentage</h2>
                    <p>I have an Acer Aspire One (model 725-0487).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This laptop is continually having performance issues because the WMI Provider Host uses between 40% &amp; 80% of the CPU processes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Looking at the event log, I'm seeing the following three errors springing up regularly:</p>

<p>This looks like an issue with the drive, but I've ran diagnostics, and nothing is flagging.</p>

<h2>            Word 2016 -- Word can&#39;t open a file</h2>
                    <p>I've got a 95-page file sent out to authors for review. I've made several dozen comments/questions to author to answer. Upon receipt of file back from the author, I try to open and get "We're sorry. We can't open [file] because we found a problem with its
 contents." I click on the Details button and get</p>
<p>"Details</p>
<p>&nbsp; Unspecified error</p>
<p>&nbsp; Location: Part: /word/comments.xml, Line: 0, Column: 0 "</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click OK, I get</p>
<p>"Word found unreadable content in [file]. Do you want to recover the contents of this document? If you trust the source of this document, click Yes."</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click Yes, the file opens but many (if not most) of the comments I'd made have now disappeared except for a dotted line leading from the now-empty comment "box" to the place within text that my comment referred to. Any changes that the author made
 to the actual text show, but if the author made a reply to one of my comments, it's invisible -- I have no way to tell.&nbsp; Also when I've clicked Yes, there is now a dialog box that says&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Show repairs</p>
<p>Errors were detected in this file, but Word was able to open the file by making the repairs listed below. Save the file to make the repairs permanent."</p>
<p>[and then there's a list like the following:]</p>
<p>Comments 1</p>
<p>Footnotes 1</p>
<p>Footnotes 10</p>
<p>Footnotes 11</p>
<p>Footnotes 12</p>
<p>Footnotes 13</p>
<p>Footnotes 14</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on the "Go to" button, nothing happens except the "Close" button is highlighted. "Close" does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file in question was apparently originally created in Macintosh Word; I edited it in Word 2016; the review was in Macintosh Word, fwtw. (Oh, and if I try to open this file in Macintosh Word, much the same results occur: comments disappear and are incomplete.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never had this problem in Word 2010 but, since going to Word 2016 a few months ago, this problem has cropped up more than once.</p>

</p><p>For word online, just google it. "word online" then log in using yung microsoft account. from there, you can try opening the file that has issues</p>

<p>Thanks for the online Word suggestion. I didn't even know that existed, so that was helpful to know about.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it didn't work this time -- actually, it was even worse than when I used my own versions (I have 2, with 2 different versions of Windows
 at the moment) of Word on this problematic file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Haven't tried phoning Microsoft yet, but that may be a possibility later ...</p>

<h2>            Modem is not installing</h2>
                    After upgrading to W10, now none of my 3 modems are getting installed on my desktop. Theses modems still work fine on my laptop that runs W7. Whenever I connect a modem via USB port nothing happens. One of my friends, who has also upgraded to windows 10,
 is also facing the same problem. BTW, my W10 is yet to be activated. What should I do now to get the modems working on my W10 PC?

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
1. What is the make and model of the Modem?<br />
2. What is the exact and complete error you get when you try to install modems?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to contact Modem vender to check if there are any updated softwareâ€™s or firmware patches that need to be install on Windows 10 to make it compatible.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span>

<strong>Startup Settings</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>5. Tap or click
<strong>Restart</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>6. On the
<strong>Startup Settings </strong>screen, choose the startup setting for <strong>
Safe Mode with Networking </strong>(Generally <strong>F5</strong>key is pressed to select this setting).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>7. Sign in to your PC with a user account that has administrator rights.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not appear in Safe Mode then follow step 2</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Clean Boot
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may follow below mentioned steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></p>

 for business</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://kb.intermedia.net/search/?query=tag%3dfederation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">federation</a></div>
</div>

<p>skype for business/lync federation is a functionality which&nbsp;allows users to communicate with&nbsp;others outside their organization. all features included in your license will be available (read the knowledge base article on&nbsp;<a href="https://kb.intermedia.net/article/2245" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">skype
 for business standard vs. skype for business enterprise</a>&nbsp;for more information).</p>
<p><strong>note:</strong>&nbsp;skype for business/lync federation can be set up on a domain-per-domain basis. if you need federation to be enabled with several domains, each setup will be performed individually.</p>
<p>we cannot set up federation with microsoft.com or office 365 (lync online) at this time.</p>
<p>in order to enable that functionality, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>create&nbsp;<strong>_sipfederationtls._tcp.</strong>&nbsp;srv record:<br />
<strong>_sipfederationtls._tcp.yourdomain.com srv 0 0 5061 lyncsip.xx.xx.xx<br />
or&nbsp;<br />
_sipfederationtls._tcp.yourdomain.com srv 0 0 5061 skypesip.xx.xx.xx<br />
</strong></li><li><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fkb.intermedia.net%2fgraphics%2farticles%2f2538_1.png" /><br />
the correct settings can be found under &nbsp;<em>hostpilotÂ® control panel &gt; services &gt; domain name &gt; click on your domain name &gt; click</em><strong>display dns records&nbsp;</strong><em>&gt; click</em><strong>&nbsp;show system records<em>.</em></strong><br />
read the knowledge base article on&nbsp;<a href="https://kb.intermedia.net/article/2284" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">how to add srv record to your domain</a>&nbsp;for more information about srv record syntax.
</li><li>submit&nbsp;<strong>skype for business/lync: federation</strong>&nbsp;extended service request under&nbsp;<em>hostpilotÂ® control panel &gt; support &gt; extended services</em>. read the knowledge base article on&nbsp;<a href="https://kb.intermedia.net/article/1360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">how do i use
 the extended services portal?</a>&nbsp;for more information. </li></ol>
<p><strong>note:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>even if both accounts are hosted&nbsp;with intermedia,&nbsp;but on&nbsp;<strong>different</strong>&nbsp;lyncsip.xx.xx.xx or skypesip.xx.xx.xx&nbsp;servers:
<ol>
<li>create&nbsp;srv record; </li><li>submit extended service request (<strong>skype for business/lync: federation</strong>).
</li></ol>
</li><li>if both accounts are on the&nbsp;<strong>same</strong>&nbsp;lyncsip.xx.xx.xx or&nbsp;skypesip.xx.xx.xx:
<ul>
<li>submit extended service request (<strong>skype for business/lync: federation</strong>).
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>after the federation is set up, in order to send a message to external contact, search the contact using full email address:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fkb.intermedia.net%2fgraphics%2farticles%2f2538_2.png" /></p>

<p>Hi MihirNayak-Messaging,</p>
<p>We can regard it as a Skype for Business/Lync online <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn771164.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
external communication</a> feature. After completing the steps above, we can communicate with external users.</p>
<p>And if you are using Office 365 account or microsoft.com account such as 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, Itâ€™s not feasible to set up the Skype for Business federation. It means that you are not able to communicate these external users.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Toby</p>
