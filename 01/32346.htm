<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am facing the same issue and the recommended steps did not solve my problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a surface pro 6 and surface pen without clip and single button at the side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that by removing the power cable and USB devices, palm rejection works perfectly fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to be able to write while charging and having a USB device plugged in. Are there any fixes to this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

<p>have your tried the solutions here:</p>
Error 80167611 or 80169E7F occurs when you try to make an Xbox LIVE purchase
<div>
Problem
<div>
<p>You see one of the following error messages when you try to make a purchase on Xbox Live:</p>
<p><b>Can't retrieve information from Xbox Live. <br />
80167611</b></p>
<p><b>Can't retrieve information from Xbox Live. <br />
80169E7F</b></p>
<p>This may mean that there’s a problem with the payment method.</p>
<div>
Solutions
<div>
<p>To resolve this problem, try the following solutions:</p>
<p><b>Solution 1: Check your billing address</b></p>
<p>Make sure that the billing address for your Xbox Live account matches the billing address used by your credit card company. Also make sure that your Xbox Live account payment information, including capitalisation, matches the information that is used by
 your credit card company.</p>
<p>To change the billing address for your Xbox Live account, see <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/change-xbox-live-account-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Change your Xbox LIVE account information</a>.</p>
<p><b>Solution 2: Contact your bank or financial institution</b></p>
<p>The Xbox Live purchase might have failed because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The credit card hasn’t been activated. </li><li>The credit card was declined due to insufficient funds. </li><li>The credit card is not authorised for online purchases or automatic billing. </li><li>The credit card company is blocking the transaction. </li></ul>
<p>Contact your credit card company or bank and make sure that the card that you’re using was activated, that it has available funds and that the transaction is not being blocked for some reason.</p>
<p><b>Solution 3: Try your purchase again later</b></p>
<p>The Xbox Live purchase might be blocked because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Too many recent purchase attempts were declined. </li><li>The Xbox Live account or the payment option is being used from a suspicious location.
</li><li>The payment option that you provided had a violation for non-payment that’s preventing it from being used for new purchases.
</li></ul>
<p>Wait and try the transaction again in 24 to 48 hours. If lots of purchase failures occur, that can prevent transactions from being processed until no purchase attempts have been made for a while (usually 24 to 48 hours).</p>
<p><b>Solution 4: </b><b>Use an Xbox gift card, if available</b></p>
<p>Alternatively, you can buy an Xbox gift card from a retail location and redeem it for Xbox Live purchases.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Not all purchases support Xbox gift cards. Before purchasing an Xbox gift card, make sure that the specific purchase allows use of gift cards.</p>
<p><b>Solution 5: Use PayPal to purchase Xbox Live Gold Memberships and games</b></p>
<p>You can also use PayPal to purchase Xbox Live Gold Memberships and games. For more information, see
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/billing-and-subscriptions/manage-payment-options/use-paypal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Use PayPal with your Xbox Live account</a>.</p>
<p><b>Solution 6: Confirm that you’re using an approved payment method </b></p>
<p>You can use Visa, MasterCard or American Express cards as long as they allow international purchases. Even if your card displays a Visa or MasterCard logo, it may not be approved by your bank or financial institution for international purchases.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> Pre-paid cards, debit cards and gift cards (even those with a Visa or MasterCard logo) do not qualify as international cards and are currently not accepted.</p>
<p>If your credit card is an approved form of payment, try the next solution.</p>
<p><b>Solution 7: Check the card number, expiry date, card security code and name on the card
</b></p>
<p>Retype the credit card number without any spaces, commas or other non-numeric characters. Verify that the expiry date, card security code and name that you entered are correct and match what is shown on the card.</p>
<p>If you keep experiencing the problem, contact Xbox Support.</p>

<p>I use paypal, and I these are the latest things Ive bought over xbox live market place.</p>
<p>Bioshock infinite</p>
<p>Bioshock infinite clash in the clouds dlc</p>
<p>Battlefield 3 premium</p>
<p>As you see, all of this adds up to a way more amount of money than the peice of black ops 2. Bioshock infinite and Bioshock infinite clash in the clouds dlc were bought after failing to download black ops 2.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Photo Viewer  - Can&#39;t zoom in&#47;out of photo using mouse scroll wheel</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to scroll to zoom in/out of photos using Windows 10 photo viewer. &nbsp;I used to be able to use the mouse scroll wheel to zoom in/out of Windows Photo Viewer. &nbsp;Now it, seems to have reverted to the old way it used to work when the scroll wheel advanced
 to the next photo, the way it worked in Windows 7 &amp; 8. &nbsp;Now I have to go and use the + &amp; - buttons to enlarge a photo view. &nbsp;Sometimes the + &amp; - buttons aren't even visible on my screen. &nbsp;If a photo is large, the view of the + &amp; - and other controls are not
 visible. &nbsp;I made no changes to system other than Updating windows. &nbsp;I can't use the touch-screen features to zoom in/out because my laptop does NOT have a touch screen. &nbsp;Is there some setting in the photo viewer application to program the mouse buttons? &nbsp;I
 never changed anything. &nbsp;I updated my system with all the latest system updates. &nbsp;How would this setting get changed.</p>

                    I came home to find my laptop a (Toshiba Satellite C55D-A5333) had restarted itself. I sat down and I saw that the wireless connection wasn't there. After going through the Network options and only finding Ethernet cable connection. I looked in the Device
 manager and I found that the wireless adapter had been hidden, when I looked at it and I received this message:<br />
<br />
"Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer. (Code 45) To fix this problem, reconnect this hardware device to the computer.<br />
<br />
I don't know what to do now.

            HI,<br />
<br />
Either your WiFi device has failed or has been turned off - many Toshiba's have a switch, button, or hot key combination to turn it off. Check with Toshiba Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Try actually updating your driver :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - <strong>click Update Driver (may not do</strong><br />
<strong>anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi</strong><br />
<strong>Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.</strong><br />
<br />
Then check the System/Motherboard Maker's Site and that of the actual device<br />
maker (such as Intel,&nbsp;RealTek, Broadcom, or Atheros) for even newer drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />

<h2>            Earphones with mic as Microphone Dell xps 8500</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering how to use my headphones as a microphone on this computer. &nbsp;To clarify, they are regular headphones with a mic attached called symphonized NRG headphones. &nbsp;The mic works on my laptop which only has one audio jack. &nbsp;However, the dell xps 3500
 has two, one for audio and one for microphone. &nbsp;When I plug it into audio, sound plays from the headphones, but it will not work as a microphone. &nbsp;When plugged into microphone, it recognizes that something is plugged in, but the microphone will not work. &nbsp;I
 have windows 10 installed.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you look at the plug on the headphone, how many rings or divisions does it have?&nbsp; A stereo system with usually have two black rings which separate the tip (one audio channel) from the next area (second audio channel).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your headset has three black rings it should be capable of using one plug and should be seen in the Devices section as possibly a Output device and communications device.&nbsp; Newer systems may be able to detect when certain devices are plugged in and may
 ask what it is.&nbsp; But if the 3500 has two plugs it may need both inputs.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>You might look for an adapter which would turn the one plug into two.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 mail app will not refresh after account password change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kristendouglas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 mail app will not refresh after account password change</h2>
                    I am using windows 10. I am using my outlook email account (@live.com) to login to my computer now. I recently changed my password. It took about a two weeks before it synced back to my computer that my password was changed, as I was not able to login
 with my new password, but the old password continued to work. I am now able to use my new password. However the mail app in windows 10 on my computer has not synced the new password. My emails will not refresh, and I continue to get an error message when I
 hit the refresh button. I cannot delete this email account and re-install it, as it is my windows account that I use for the computer. There is no delete option when I go into account settings.&nbsp; When I click on the settings for the email account, it takes
 me to my account settings to my browser. What can I do?

<p><span>Hello, i'm in dire need for some help from my fellow overwatch fans. For the last two weeks i have been getting the BC 101 Error. "Sorry , we were unable to log you into battle.net. Please try again later. (BC - 101)" Yes, i have talked with microsoft
 xbox suport chat, blizzard and my IPS.Did everything that there is to do.Every troubleshoot. The wierd/funny thing is that i took my xbox unit to a friend house, who i play in duo que, and guess what? After connecting my own unit to his wifi, it worked, no
 error.So now im left in the middle of nowhere, with no apparent fix than changing my internet(which is pretty much impossible, since im living in the country side). Every other game is working, no problem there, i usually have a stable connection. I'm pretty
 much getting desperate/grasping at straws, since i did payed a good amount of money on a game that after one month it stopped working. Thanks for reading and for your time:)</span></p>

<p>Sorry to hear that you were unable to play Overwatch—hopefully we can fix that! Are you still experiencing issues connecting? Servers can sometimes be wonky. Have you gone through the troubleshooting steps for <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/slow-performance-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">experiencing slow performance</a>&nbsp;when playing Xbox One games?</p>
<p>We also highly recommend power cycling your network devices once more. You can do this by unplugging the modem and the router if you're using one, leave it unplugged for 15-20 seconds, then plug everything back in. <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Power cycling</a> your Xbox One console couldn't hurt either. :)&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business Archiving</h2>
                    <p>We have a requirement to monitor Office 365 Skype for Business message conversations in order to stem IM abuse within the organization. By default, the messages are stored in Conversation History in outlook, but there are some users who have intentionally
 switched off the conversation history or purposely delete them.&nbsp; I either want to force enable conversation history or better still keep a copy of every message regardless of whether they have Conversation History enabled or not. I am quite surprised that
 there does not appear to be any way in which this can be done.&nbsp; Has anyone faced the similar challenge or know of a 3rd party hosted service that can do this?</p>

            Hi Martin,<br />
<br />
Archiving for Skype for Business Online depends on the Exchange In-Place Hold feature.<br />
<br />
If you are using Exchange Online plan 2 and In-Place Hold is enabled for a mailbox, none of the items are permanently deleted from Exchange Online.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can recover those items by an Exchange Online admin (who is a member of the Discovery Management Role Group) perform a discovery search to recover those items. For more information:
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd298021(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
In-Place eDiscovery</a><br />

            If the computer came with SP1 already installed you can not remove it.<br />

The easiest way to uninstall SP1 is using Programs and Features.

</li><li>
<p>Click <span>Service Pack for Microsoft <span>
Windows</span> (KB 976932)</span>, and then click <span>Uninstall</span>.</p>
<p>If you don't see <span>Service Pack for Microsoft <span>
Windows</span> (KB 976932)</span> in the list of installed updates, your computer likely came with SP1 already installed, and you can't uninstall the service pack. If the service pack is listed but grayed out, you can't uninstall the service pack.</p>
</li></ol>
<div>
<br />
<br />

            Like Trekdozer said, you can't uninstall it was there from the outset.<br />
<br />
NOTE - I think you're barking up the wrong tree.&nbsp; The problem you're having is not typically caused by SP1.&nbsp; In fact, I've installed SP1 on dozens of machines without any significant problems.&nbsp; If this is a new computer and you've had that problem from the
 outset, you should contact the manufacturer for warranty support.<br />
<br />
If you have used it&nbsp; a while - run some thorough malware scans.&nbsp; Do a full scan with your antivirus program and also the free versions of Malwarebytes from http://malwarebytes.org&nbsp; and SUPERAntiSpyware&nbsp; from http://www.superantispyware.com<br />
<br />
If that doesn't help, try testing with a clean boot and see if the same problem occurs.<br />

<h2>            Redeem Code</h2>
                    <p>I had redeemed a code for a one month free Game Pass and it will not let me in to play. Instead it wants me to pay.? Anyway I had bought the Mortal Kombat 11 game from GameStop a while ago and had put in the code for the bata which is out right now and again
 I find myself not being able to get in to play. Also when I put the codes back in it says I had already redeemed the code. Now Im getting very upset because I paid for the most expensive one and don't want to lose out on any special awards from playing the
 beta. I have no idea what is going on?</p>

<br />Sorry Notepad is just a very basic text editor, there is no dark theme for that

<br />Notepad++ another free and more advanced Text Editor like Notepad does have many dark themes . . .

    <title>XBOX arranhou meu PES 2011 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            XBOX arranhou meu PES 2011</h2>
                    
<p>Galera, certo dia estava jogando o PES 2011, e o jogo tava demorando de carregar, então eu troquei-o de posição e de repente um barulho me chamou atenção.</p>
<p>um console tão caro como o xbox, feita por uma empresa conhecida mundialmente, não poderia cometer um erro tão estúpido - Foi o que pensei.</p>
<p>no dia seguinte ao ligar o console, reparei que não queria sair da cena de entrada, ejetei o CD e vi o arranhão de tremenda importância para o funcionamento do disco, e logo eu, que optei por adquirir jogos originais, optei por comprar jogos mais caros à
 desbloquear o aparelho. Gostaria de saber se aconteceu com algum de vocês, e o que fizeram.</p>

<p>Amigão, há um adesivo no console, várias notas no manual, acho até que na caixa do aparelho diz: NÃO PODE MOVIMENTAR O CONSOLE COM DISCO DENTRO DO DRIVE. O que você pode tentar é levar o disco em alguma locadora de DVDs e fazer um polimento da mídia, mas
 as chances de consertar são mínimas. Vai ter que comprar outro.</p>

<p>E como seu Vg é original....pq vc não instalou o jogo no Hd? Fazendo isso vc diminui 2 coisas:</p>
<p>1- O desgaste do leitor de Dvd</p>
<p>2- O tempo de carregamento do jogo</p>
<p>........Mas não. Vc preferiu virar o console de ponta cabeça enquanto o console estava carregando o jogo pra ver se ele carregava mais rápido....ahh táááá....Acho q não foi a M$ q cometeu o erro estúpido não? O.o</p>

<p>Cara, tipo assim, no meu console não existe nenhum tipo de advertência nem na bandeja e nem na caixa, não copiei pro HD porque meu xbox tem HD de 4gb + um pendrive de 2gbs pra ouvir música, além do mais, o meu HD ta cheio por conta da instalação do disco
 dois do Forza 3</p>
<p>Levando em consideração que os designers da microsoft foram pagos para tornar o (XBOX 360 S) "um aparelho compacto" (parece a gaveta do meu guarda-roupas), o erro foi deles sim.</p>

<p>kra o erro n foi da microsoft, no meu xbox veio uma advertencia na bandeja do drive q avisava para n mover o console com um disco no drive. outra coisa, ja comparou o xbox 360 S com o xbox antigo, ele realmente é bem + compacto e n importa se a empresa eh
 conhecida ou se o aparelho é caro, sempre haverão problemas. dê uma olhada no manual para vc ver a advertencia</p>

<p>Enter the following command:</p>
<span><span>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 7 came preinstalled on my computer,&nbsp;</span><span>how do I find the product key?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;product key is usually located on the COA sticker attached to the bottom of your laptop or in the battery compartment. In some rare cases it can also be found in the memory compartment. For tower systems, look at the top or the side of the system
 unit.&nbsp;It looks like the following:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker is damaged or letters or not legible, you will have to consider the following options:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Use a digital camera to capture a picture of the COA then enlarge it on your computer.</li></ul>

<p>I just asked Microsoft technician uninstall my product key via remote access, didn't solve my activation problem but it seems the message will not haunting me again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I think the only option left is buy a new permenant license, but the link I got is full product, there is no official way to just purchase product key to activate?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Of course I hoping for cheaper cost by purchase the key only, but another reason is I do not want to reinstall again, I just want to activate.</p>

<h2>            Blank Screen after Log In, Cant Open Windows 10 Apps, &#34;Cant be opened using the built-in administrator account&#34; on safe mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,<br />
<br />
I have been using windows 10 about a month ago and everything was fine. But one day when I was using Windows 10, it suddenly occurred screen freezes (i dont know what should i call it, but that time I cant open the start -either by clicking the icon or pressing
 the start button on keybard-, I cant open any apps), the only thing that i can do is move the cursor into any directions, but I cant double-click anything.&nbsp;I thought this is a simple problem, maybe because my laptop has been working for several hours causing
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I decided to restart the laptop. But what happens is my laptop stuck and didnt successfully boot. After a whole day waiting, I decided to reset the windows 10 (about two days before, I'd done the windows 10 reset and the results are going well until
 the day that I get a screen freezes). The resetting windows 10 process takes a long time but it went well. When everything was finished, then I can see the log in screen. Then I entered my password and then after the screen shows the message 'let's start',
 screen becomes blank. I cant see anything other than the cursor. I've searched in internet every way to fix the 'blank screen on windows 10 after log in'. &nbsp;I've tried apply all solutions, but the results are nothing.<br />
<br />
But when I entered the safe mode, I &nbsp;can run some functions of my laptop (but my desktop do not display the background picture, it keep black -see the picture below), and&nbsp;when I opened several settings /windows apps (like microsoft edge, store, weather, photos,
 music, etc) it always appear a pop up message &nbsp;'Cant be opened using the built-in administrator account. Sign in with different account and try again'. I've also search solutions for this problem, but same like the first problem, the results are nothing.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c073fad-6bd8-476f-b5aa-7bcb15e8cac8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c073fad-6bd8-476f-b5aa-7bcb15e8cac8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone that can help provide a solution to those problems?</p>
<p>I really hope my laptop can back to normal because many assignments that awaits me :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>note: i using windows 10 single language</p>

<p>I'm 64 years old so a bit of a techtard but would it possibly be the same as '<span>Resetting the printer to its defaults and then configure the wireless settings as if you were doing it for the first time. ' same as me 'uninstalling'
 the printer and using the printer disk to reinstall again?&nbsp; I thought that worked the last time this happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank&nbsp;you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to a corrupt driver but&nbsp;the exact reason&nbsp;may vary. The&nbsp;real issue can be found through the Minidump files. Therefore, I would suggest you&nbsp;follow the steps by ZigZag3143 and upload the files for analysis.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for updating us on the issue and sorry for the inconvenience. </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The WDF_VIOLATION error indicates that Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) detected that Windows found an error in a framework-based driver. Since the above steps did not help to fix the issue, let’s try simple steps and check if it helps. I would
 suggest you to perform automatic repair and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you do not have media creation disk. Download and Create installation media for Windows 10 from the below link:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you complete creating media. Insert the Windows installation DVD in the DVD ROM and restart your computer.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After you boot the computer using Windows DVD, a black screen appears with gray text "<strong>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD".</strong> Press any key.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select the correct time and Keyboard type. </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>Repair your computer</strong> in the lower left corner.</p>

</strong>screen.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Next, choose the operating system by clicking on its button.</p>
</li><li>Windows will look for problems on hard drives and verify that all required files are intact.</li></ol>

            Unfortunately I now cannot get computer to boot up past the initial screen which says I have aproblem and the computer has to restart.&nbsp; It will then restart and the REPAIR message comes on the screen.&nbsp; It tries to run the AUTOMATIC REPAIR but in a couple
 of minutes I again get the BLUE SCREEN and computer locks up.&nbsp; At this point I cannot get computer to even shut off.&nbsp; The blue screen remains until I un plug the computer....I have tried to go to "SAFE" mode using the start two times suggestion you gave me
 but that did not work either.&nbsp; There has to be a different way to start SAFE mode.&nbsp; This is an HP machine................THANK YOU.........(WINDOWS 10 )

    <title>Front Microphone Jack Not Recognized - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelhopcroft  say:</h3>
<h2>            Front Microphone Jack Not Recognized</h2>
                    <p>I am having trouble getting Windows 8.11 to recognize my front microphone jack. I have a standard headset and cannot get the front mic to work. It works from the rear jack, but that's not especially practical for headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look at my Recording Devices window, I see two "Microphone" entries at the top. The first says 'ready", but the second says "Currently Unavailable". There is nothing on the list to tell me which is which (presumably the software does not know which
 way they face).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I plug the headphones in at the front, the playback works just fine. This implies that at least that piece of the hardware is functioning as desired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I need to know at this point is what the message means, and whether it is something that can be fixed within the software or whether I need to go into the case and adjust things.</p>
<p>
