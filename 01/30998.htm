<h2>            Removal of secondary HD causes Windows 10 to crash.</h2>
                    <p>My pc has 4 hard drives.&nbsp; Two solid states and 2 traditional drives. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason/some how my second SSD was set to hold the system's virtual memory.&nbsp; (I am not sure if this is from Windows 7 or a function of Windows 10 trying to optimize performance. )</p>
<p>I want to remove the second SSD, so I have moved virtual memory to the first SSD that holds ALL my system files and have verified that it is moved, how-ever when I physically remove the drive, Windows 10 won't boot saying it is missing a file.&nbsp; When I press
 F8 for startup options nothing happens.&nbsp; (I know that it is the correct drive I am unplugging because unplugging the other drive reports no boot disc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even used the uninstall option under the control panel, but this fails to change anything an automatically reinstalls it on restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I safety remove this drive physically with out re-installing Windows 10?</p>

    <title>Computer Stuttering - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> purewhitelight  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer Stuttering</h2>
                    <div>Hi and thanks -<br />
<br />
I have had my computer since 2009, and it works like a dream. Recently, however, after an automatic update, my computer has spontaneously began to stutter - both audio and video - exactly like in this video.
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocKfYNV-xHo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocKfYNV-xHo</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/ocKfYNV-xHo?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/ocKfYNV-xHo?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div><br />
<br />
Furthermore, I also get some keyboard and mouse stutters.<br />
<br />
So "when I type this sentence" . . . might appear as<br />
"wheeeeeeeen I tpe this sennnntce" (Notice both the added and the missing characters)<br />
<br />
This started a few days ago, and I have been scouring the messge bords for a solution. There have been messages left on THIS board with the same problem, but none of the suggested fixes (I have tried them all) have helped. So far, I have tried all sorts of
 things, including but not limited to<br />
<br />
Reinstalling video drivers<br />
Reinstalling audio drivers<br />
Openeing the computer and blowing out dust - cooling things down<br />
Monitoring the CPU load (the CPU does NOT spike when the stutter happens)<br />
Running a system restore to a point before the event happened<br />
Running Glary, Norton and CCleaner Registry repairs<br />
Soured the computer for viruses and malware using my Nortaon AV and Malwarebytes (both of which are resident and should be operating prophylactically anyway.)</div>
<div>Changing the power profile to "high performance"<br />
Some other things I can't remember right now<br />
<br />
I believe (but am not certain, of course) that it must be a software issue, because the exact same hardware has been doing a fine job fornearly 4 years.<br />
<br />
My system is a W7, i7 920@2.67Ghz. ATI Radeon 4800 series graphics card. One thing that I have noticed is that in Device manager, the processor is listed eight times. I don't think that's right, but want to check with greater minds before removing any of the
 entries. (There are no "exclamation points" or anything like that.) <br />
<br />
Thank you for your help! </div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/d6828b20-fb90-41da-b62c-d169c9f88d42">
<font color="#0072c6">ajeshdsouza</font></a>&nbsp;and thanks -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran the performance troubleshooter with no resovle, but I did resolve the problem.&nbsp; I'll share for the sake of others.&nbsp; I also posted on techsupportforum - and a fellow there suggested I try a clean boot - amazing not only that I hadn't thought of it,
 but that no one on any of the&nbsp;the many&nbsp;other "Computer Stuttering Message Board" messages had thought of it either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I gradually and eventually added all (100%) of my services back in. Then it was time for the startup programs. I'm not sure which one was the culprit - I just kept adding in all of the old familar start-up programs until my computer is doing everything I
 want it to do - then I just stopped (with a number of start-up programs unchecked.)</p>
<p><br />
But the important thing is that the computer is back running at full efficiency. Thanks so much!

            <p>I think it was because of external drive immunization.&nbsp; There was no problem except renaming.&nbsp; I can access external drives; there was no yellow warning marks; and lastly in Disk Management, all drives are shown with proper name tag in each drive.&nbsp; My only
 worry is that in Explorer, I only see the basic name for each removable drive: that is, for example, Removable Disk G:, etc.&nbsp; But is there a way to regain renaming access for external drives?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Btw, I have tried the Regedit method I read somewhere on this site, and it worked.&nbsp; But I can only rename once, and with the regedit only.&nbsp; In explorer, drives can still not be renamed at all.</p>

<h2>            Display brightness settings non-functional on Samsung PC after upgrading to Windows 10...</h2>
                    <p>I have a <strong>Samsung Series 7 Chronos PC</strong> purchased July 2013<br />
Model <strong>NP780Z5E</strong>-S01UB</p>
<p>Serial Number JA3691HD500308</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">My system uses two&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">display adapter drivers -
</span><strong>AMD Radeon HD 8700M Series</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><strong>Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;- and a&nbsp;<strong>Generic PnP Monitor</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since updating to Windows 10 a few days ago, the sliding brightness settings <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
accessed through the Control Panel&nbsp;</span>have no affect, nor does the brightness icon accessed through the Action Center. &nbsp;The PC function keys which are supposed to control display brightness are likewise unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Microsoft remotely access my PC to no avail - I was told it was a Samsung problem. &nbsp;I had Samsung remotely access my PC (this is NOT a free service) and that fellow updated one of the drivers (the other driver was current) but this didn't help either.
 &nbsp;He reported Microsoft says there was no current solution to this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment, when I start my laptop it operates in full brightness mode which makes my eyes bleed. &nbsp;If I restart it (not turn it off, but restart it) it will open in zero brightness mode, which is what I prefer, but is still not adjustable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far (after reading many answers on these forums and stuff on the web) I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensured everything is up-to-date</li><li>rolled the AMD driver back (the only one which could be rolled back)</li><li>disabled/enabled the drivers and the monitor (one at a time)</li><li>uninstalled the two drivers&nbsp;(one at a time)</li><li>downloaded drivers from the AMD site and the Intel site&nbsp;(one at a time)</li><li>created a shortcut to the Device Manager since it rapidly was&nbsp;becoming my best friend</li><li>installed an update which appeared this am via Samsung Update</li><li>lost track of the number of times I have powered down/restarted my PC</li></ul>
<p>Nothing made any difference. &nbsp;Having spent the better part of two days on this problem, I gave up and restored my laptop to the Restore Point I set before doing any of the above. &nbsp;The only "control" I have is the following sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Power up PC</strong> (display is <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
on full, eye-bleeding, bright)</span></li><li><strong>Restart </strong>(<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">display is on dim</span>)</li></ol>
<p>The sliding brightness settings, brightness icon, and function keys have no affect.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate many of the new features of Windows 10, but this lack of display adjustment is not acceptable as I use apps that work better with some or full brightness&nbsp;<em>and I can't "adjust" this without powering down</em>. &nbsp;This rates a full-throated&nbsp;<strong>Har-umph!</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions? &nbsp;It is tiresome to have to restart the thing so I am able to use it...<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time...</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS &nbsp;The <em>Change brightness automatically when lighting changes</em> doesn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS#2 next day...</p>
<p>Further troubleshooting yielded:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Power up</strong> -&gt; bright screen</p>
<p><strong>Restart </strong>any number of times -&gt; dim screen&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sleep </strong>-&gt; bright screen</p>
<p><strong>Hibernate </strong>-&gt; bright screen</p>
<p><strong>Sign out</strong> -&gt; bright or dim, depending on which state the screen was in when sign out was initiated</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I didn't include this yesterday - it was VERY late and I was falling asleep at the screen...</p>

            <p>I was struggling with the same problem with my Samsung 770Z5E for many many long monthes, and none of the possible solutions indicated so far worked for me. Until today, when I found a solution on another similar thread:</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/loss-of-brightness-control-intel-hd-graphics-4000/64c255eb-517f-44d7-8af3-b5cfd7c4b79d</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case the problem was solved by setting the value of </p>
<p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\Class\{4d36e968-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\000<strong>1</strong>] "FeatureTestControl" to "f008". I'm using the latest Intel drivers.</p>

                    <p>modded controllers are not the problem we shouldn't be banning modded controllers and making them illegal on xbox&nbsp;live. we shouldn't be banning mods all together. the pc gaming community&nbsp;welcomes mods as well as modding itself modded consoles&nbsp;are in a whole nother ballpark then modded controllers. modded console are a&nbsp;more serious problem then modded controllers. the things that a modded controller can do a player that is skilled with the game and controller can easily do the same mods that a modded controller is programmed to do. a modded console that's a bigger problem then modded controllers what we should be doing is banning modded consoles instead of banning modded controllers there needs to be a change in microsofts&nbsp;xbox&nbsp;live policies there needs to be something done about the policies on modded controllers.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>all modded controllers do is enhance the gameplayer vdon't&nbsp;affect the game at all modded consoles on the other hand is basically cheating and changing the game and at point it's pretty much altering the game and console because it's more serious then modded controllers but really we shouldn't be banning modded controllers we should be making modded controllers legal on xbox&nbsp;live&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>As I understand the problem, the computer is running very slow.</p>
<p>Did you make any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue?<br />
<br />
Let's start with this troubleshooter, which will find what is causing the issue and will try to automatically fix the issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Run the troubleshooter and check.</p>
<p><strong>Fix Windows system performance problems on slow Windows computers </strong>
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/slow_windows_performance/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/slow_windows_performance/en-us</a><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>If the first method didn't fix the issue you may try the steps in the article and check if it helps.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Ways to improve your computer's performance <br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/is-IS/windows-vista/Ways-to-improve-your-computers-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/is-IS/windows-vista/Ways-to-improve-your-computers-performance</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
If the issue is not resolved let's boot the computer to Safe Mode to check if the issue occurs in Safe Mode. If the issue does not occur in Safe Mode then you may try to perform Clean Boot to find which startup item or service is causing the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong><br />
To restart in Safe Mode follow the steps.<br />
<br />
a) <strong>Restart </strong>your computer.<br />
b) When you see the computer <strong>manufacturer's logo</strong>, press and hold the
<strong>F8 </strong>key.<br />
c) On the <strong>Advanced Boot Options </strong>screen, use the arrow keys to highlight
<strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>, and then press <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
d) <strong>Log on to </strong>your computer with a user account that has <strong>
administrator rights.<br />
<br />
Refer:</strong> <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</a><br />
<br />
If the issue does not occur in Safe Mode, then you may try performing Clean Boot.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 2: </strong><br />
To Perform Clean boot follow below steps.<br />
<br />
By setting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After clean boot troubleshooting step, follow Step 3 in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.<br />
</p>

            You might try merging or deleting network&nbsp;connections. Open the <strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong> then click on
<strong>Customize</strong> at the right of your current network connection. Click on
<strong>Merge or delete network locations</strong> at the bottom left.<br />
<br />
You will not be at risk but its better to delete it anyway. FYI see this article about assigning Network Locations while away from home.&nbsp;Generally you want to select
<strong>Public</strong> and use Private at home.<br />

<br />
At home make sure you properly secure your wireless network...<br />

<p>The packet loss is rather alarming.&nbsp; During the ping test, your connection sends 250 packets, it should receive 250 packets back.&nbsp; However, your connection has lost 78% of those packets during the test.&nbsp; This isn't a good sign.&nbsp; This is why your Line Quality
 has an 'F' rating.<br />

Is your connection wired or wireless?&nbsp; Have your contacted your ISP?</p>

<h3> talalnajam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help with Plantronics driver&#33;</h2>
                    Hey, That day I was using my headphones Plantronics Audio995 and The computer restarted for some updates. I accidentally shut it down and when i opened it again. All the drivers were either deleted or got corrupted. My USB mouse couldn't work, neither
 did my headphones. But I managed to download them again. However, my headphone's weren't working. I've tried everything possible. When i go to the device manager. It shows a yellow triangle with an exclamation mark. The headphones were working perfectly before
 until the restart. I've downloaded the Plantronics software. I've been on there website but they say that it is a plug-and-play device, for which they do not provide any drivers. I've rebooted my Laptop, and it hasn't helped. I've unplugged the USB and have
 uninstalled the driver, and then rebooted. But it keeps saying "No Driver Found". I'm so fed up now. Its been a month. I've posted a thread on their website and haven't gotten any reply yet. It also used to show the Plantronics option in the "Playback devices"
 which it doesn't now. I hope you guys can help.<br />
Thanks.<br />

<h2>            Copying, paste, file transfer so slow in both Windows Vista and Windows 7 x86 and x62</h2>
                    
<p>I migrated from XP a few years back now. I was very dispointed with Vista due to the amount of system bugs never fixed by Microsoft, one in particular seems to be this Copy and Paste Issue, so I know run Windows 7 on a brand new machine with the same problem
 (this problem also occurs in both 32 and 62 bit computers).</p>
<p>I've had this issue on every one of the 5 PC's I own. Everytime I try to copy, paste, tranfer or delete a file in Windows 7 it copies so slow it's unreal. Especially big files. I never had these issues using XP. I have a very large computer with plenty of
 HD space, ram and everything else.</p>
<p>This problem is really doing my head in, I originally thought it was a problem with My external HD so I replaced it, but it seems to be getting worse. File transfers between external HD, CD, copy paste etc are all just so damm slow.</p>
<p>Sometimes the copying process just seems to freeze and when attempting to cancel the whole computer just slows to the point you end up pulling the plug.</p>
<p>I've tried dozens of supposed fixes listed online but none work, no upgrades required etc. I've heard people using Robocopy etc. I don't feel like I should have to go installing 3rd party applications in order to get something working that used to be such
 a basic task.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Sorry I haven't listed everything i've tried in order to fix this, the truth is, I just can't remember.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nothing is wrong with your hardware. You just have to accept Microsoft's predilection for epic failure. Just download Ubuntu. You will soon see how ridiculous it is to use WINDOWS. ( bugs, virus, trojans, spyware, malware, tracking cookies, slow performance,
 all taken care of, FREE OF CHARGE)</p>

<p>Win 7: $$200-$400, .PLUS Office.. doesnt work, loaded with bloatware/spyware at purchase, constant battle/worry</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ubuntu 10: free, Makes all your hardware work, no spyware malware or other problems ( Google and compare Compiz to Aero..)</p>

            I'm having pretty much the same slow copy issues. Downloaded .avi files get saved on a Windows XP computer. Then they get transferred via a usb hard drive to one Windows 7 machine and a second XP machine. Copying from the XP machine to the usb is no problem.
 USB 2.0 is not lightning fast but it gets the job done. Transferring the files from the USB&nbsp; drive to the second XP machine is no problem. Transferring to the Windows 7 machine is painfully slow. When I pull up the .avi files on the USB drive it pulls the
 page up and proceeds to clock for ages while a green status bar slowly crawls forward. Once it's finished doing that I have to set it to show the files by date rather than title so I can copy just the newest. Again I get the green clocking bar. Once I get
 the donor file setup , I have to do the same thing for the receiving file and again get the green clocking bar. Finally when the green clocking bar is done (10-15 minutes) I can actually do the copying which takes less than half the

<h2>            Desktop icons are scrambled upon restart in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>*-Original Title - How do I keep Windows 7 from scrambling my desktop icons upon restart?</p>
<p>I had my desktop icons arranged by category (e.g. Microsoft Office, browsers, security). This was fine until a day or so ago, when I cleaned some malware off my computer. Now Windows 7 scrambles my icons and wastes all the work I put into arranging them.<br />
<br />
If I right-click on my desktop, Autoarrange Icons is NOT checked.<br />

            <p>Have you tried a System restore back to before you were having this issue?<br />
<br />
To choose a System Restore point,</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Desktop click the Pearl (start) button <br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Search Field type “System Restore” and hit enter <br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once System Restore is open, select the option “choose a different restore point” and hit next
</p>
<p>Once on the next screen, pick a restore point to go back to when it last worked for you. Once you select the restore point, click next, then select finish, this will start the restore process.</p>

            In my case was different. The app suddenly stopped working and says the app was unavailable. It says the app was going to crash (literally) its like the app had been damaged permanently. I thought about Uninstall but it doesn't allow me. I do really need
 it, help, please&nbsp;

<h2>            Current Huawei Matebooks and Future Windows Updates</h2>
                    Hello&nbsp;<br />
I am very keen to purchase a Huawei Matebook 13 or Matebook XPro 13.9 from 2018.<br />
My question is given the issues and Scandals surrounding the US and China ( Google ban on Huawei etc), if Microsoft were to withdraw their Windows operating system from future Matebooks would that affect future updates on the current one for sale?. I would
 not want to be stuck with a computer that I wish to use for hopefully 5 years to have problems further down the line.<br />
I would be very grateful for any responses that can shed light on this<br />
<br />
Many Thanks<br />
<br />
Toby&nbsp;

            Hi Toby,
<br />unfortunately there are no Microsoft employees here, we are just experienced users. So we cannot predict Microsoft actions. 
<br />You may write a paper mail to Redmond and may be you'll get an answer. But even if you'll get a certain answer the situation may change at any time, sorry.

            Hi Toby
<br />
<br />There is no official word from Microsoft on this Hwawei situation as of yet
<br />
<br />Microsoft have pulled the Hwawei products, like the MateBook Pro form the Microsoft Store, whether that is a sign of things to come . . .
<br />
<br />If Microsoft did pull support for Windows 10 on your device, that would mean you would no longer get any operating system updates, however, that drive and Windows licence would still function . .. .
<br />
<br />For the moment it is all speculation, until Microsoft do decide to tell the public, which way they will be going on this Hwawei controversy . . .

    <title>0xC1900101 - 0x40017 Failed in SECOND_BOOT phase during BOOT operation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            0xC1900101 - 0x40017 Failed in SECOND_BOOT phase during BOOT operation - something else to try  - alternative to other solutions -MICROSOFT please make note for future upgrades</h2>
                    <p><strong>This was posted in reply to someone else's issue but will be most prob be lost in the huge number of people responding saying had same issue, as did I.&nbsp;</strong> Hence posting here and hope that Microsoft will take on board for next upgrade version
 of Win10 as may happen again.&nbsp; I have also only just upgraded after waiting a few months as I have an old pc, just to make sure most bugs sorted and other posts are few months ago - sorry if these people ended up clean installing instead, but this may well
 help the next time it is encountered.&nbsp; Anyway here is what worked for me to do this upgrade install when got this error: 0xC1900101 - 0x40017 Failed in SECOND_BOOT phase during BOOT operation:</p>
<p>Make sure you have backed up your system -all partitions before proceeding/retrying the upgrade in case of an error or if solution here fails due to something else the cause - pcs greatly differ (don't rely on the MS Rollback - a backup as you had it is
 best).<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note: this solution is different to most of what I have found</strong> about drivers, antivirus etc, though trying those things may also help.&nbsp; I also changed my region settings and copied etc fully to US and used a US media creation ISO to install
 even though system is in Australia as my orig retail Win 8 system builder ed may have been US when bought (it can be changed back after upgrade).&nbsp; Doing this actually got less errors in my setuperr logs after retry to upgrade so may have helped also.&nbsp; Also
 may want to uninstall Microsoft EMET if you have installed that before upgrade as it is built into Enterprise editions of Win 10 Creators+ vers - in case it is stopping the upgrade, as well as bluetooth drivers and all 3rd party intel and motherboard drivers.&nbsp;
 Uninstall antimalware and AV or at least disable it all.<br />
Reboot and allow Microsoft to install its own drivers for everything you are able to at least before the upgrade.<br />
Try also the upgrade in a clean boot state&nbsp; as said here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows<br />
Disable as many non- MS programs from start up as you can as well as 3rd party AV/Firewall.<br />
<br />
However given specific error being exact same error about 2nd boot phase and also a message on purple initial screen (using media creator tool/iso -gives more info as to errors) towards 100% stage - that flashed quickly - something about EFI System - boot partition.&nbsp;
 Updates seemed to proceed but only to 71% before a win setup rollback entry also appeared in boot menu and normal win 10 which could not boot.<br />
My suspicion was that it was an actual boot issue whereby new entry made in boot loader for this upgrade was not being written correctly to indicate right partition for my upgrade windows -I did have another EFI (Refind) boot manager in place as I have other
 boot entries.&nbsp; My EFI Partition also had plenty of space being around 500mb in size (some errors may be due to lack of space -there are suggestions on google to fix this).&nbsp; However I think this was an actual boot entry unable to write error as I had the space
 for it.&nbsp; In short - try repair boot by finding and adding the correct partition for your upgrade windows install as bcd id may have changed from original and not being written into boot loader - use boot ver same ISO and startup repair or other boot repair
 tool -then hopefully can boot into this and cont. the updates to end-avoiding the 2nd win setup entry which just does a rollback.&nbsp; More details are below for those new to this/unsure how to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence rather than select the 2nd boot entry Win Setup (which rolls back your upgrade eventually) -first try repairing your boot loader with the same ISO put to a usb key - start up repair try - you may need to select custom upgrade then small text at base
 to repair instead -troubleshoot options and start up repair.&nbsp; If this fails with some srt or other error -search on google for manual boot recovery commands for win 10 that you can enter into the repair command prompt instead to fix the issue (depending on
 whether you have old mbr or new efi partition system).&nbsp;&nbsp; Also in your bios check the hard drive you are booting for the upgrade is first to load.&nbsp; Or you can try other tools on backup recovery discs or usbs you can make from their ISOS that fix boot records
 - Macrium Reflect is said to be a good one with a boot repair tool.&nbsp; This should fix your windows bootloader -maybe overwriting others you had but once booted in windows you can reset your preferred loader again and fix entries you had.<br />
If successful you should be able to select the first entry (not the WinSetup which is the rollback - wish MS would label it clearly) and now it should boot as expected and continue the balance of the updates, which took a long time on my pc (but I have a lot
 of software and an old pc).&nbsp; It did however reboot again and I had the upgrade edition as checked by running winver in a command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Really hope this helps others - so many seem to be having same issue.&nbsp; I also tried a number of times with other suggested fixes to no avail and then noticed the flashing EFI boot error which pointed me to trying this as well.&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please Microsoft fix this in the next upgrade.&nbsp;</strong> Your bootloader should be more resilient, I had also done a prior custom install to test my hardware with this edition and had no such issue while using an alternative reFind boot manager over
 the top.&nbsp; It should still be able to find its loader and make the entry without error.&nbsp; Even Xp could do an in place upgrade repair without drama like this by just replacing all motherboard drivers with its own and rebooting as usual.&nbsp; It is essential we can
 do Win 10&nbsp; upgrades and not be forced to clean install every time, especially as the upgrades come frequently every 6 months or so.&nbsp;<strong><em>Too much downtime otherwise and not a good thing for this operating system which is supposed to be improving all
 the time.</em></strong></p>
