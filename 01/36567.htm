<h2>            Stunning and countering a stun</h2>
                    Hey guys. I've been wondering about this game online, as I just bought it recently. I've played for a few hours and I can't tell if countering when someone tries to stun you is glitchy, luck based or just flat-out broken at times. I understand that killing
 someone takes priority, but it seems like there are times when I can CLEARLY see a human player, who is a target, b-lining straight for me (and not using the charge ability), and I face them, lock onto them, and start mashing the X button... and they still
 just casually stroll up in their animation and box my ears, knocking me to the ground. Other times I'll be doing a sneaky approach to a player who is hunting me and he'll be focused on a teammate, I'll sneak up behind and start to stun him, then he counters
 me immediately and stabs me up. What is even more frustrating is that people also seem to go through my smoke at times and kill me, yet I'm always being stunned by smoke. Is this some type of latency issue or something? Basically

<p>I think it is some kind of glitch. I know what you mean, people sometimes stun me even if I press X over and over. It is kind of annoying when it happens to you but when it's the other way around it's hilarious.</p>

<p>Some of it is glitches, but a lot of it comes down to timing that you'll just have to work out through experience with the MP. A lot of people throw down their smoke bombs just a second too late but that's all it takes for them to already be killing you.
 As for sneaking up and stunning people, that's kinda hard to do. There's no guarantee that they're not paying attention and just focusing on your team mate. I've been stunned a few times from behind but most of the time I can see them trying to sneak up on
 me and I just wait for my moment when they're close enough to kill. So really, it's not the best option. You gotta be pretty confident to pull that one off, otherwise I'd stick to using an ability as a buffer before you try stunning someone. The glitching
 is frustrating sometimes and it happens to all of us, but stick with the MP and you'll see how it gets better the longer you play :)</p>

            <p>Hi Jared,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying and sorry for the delayed reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are getting an error when you run the Windows Update Troubleshooter. Do you get any error when you try to install Windows updates?</p>
<p>I appreciate your efforts and time in trying to fix the issue. What happens when you try to set Windows Installer to Automatic?</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li><li>Did you make any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</li></ol>
<p>If you refresh your system you will not lose any data or files but you may lose apps installed and need to re-install them once you refresh it.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If you upgraded your PC from Windows&nbsp;8 to Windows&nbsp;8.1 and your PC has a Windows&nbsp;8 recovery partition, refreshing your PC will restore Windows&nbsp;8. You‚Äôll need to upgrade to Windows&nbsp;8.1 after the refresh has finished.
</p>
<p>Apps you installed from websites and DVDs will be removed. Apps that came with your PC and apps you installed from the Windows Store will be reinstalled. Windows puts a list of removed apps on your desktop after refreshing your PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try to disable Norton Internet Security for some time and then try to install Windows Updates.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-virus disclaimer<span>:</span></strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">When you disable Antivirus:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To do so:</span></strong> Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might
 occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how

<p>If issue persists, after installing all updates go to method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2.</p>
<p>Try to put the system in clean boot and try to install updates. <span>&nbsp;</span>Clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1. It starts Windows by using a minimal
 set of drivers and startup programs.<br />

Word is <em>not</em> and has never been included with Windows, and the same will be true for Windows 10.&nbsp; The free Windows 10 upgrade will not expire or otherwise cost anything after a year.&nbsp;

</p><p>I have a Compac desk top computer purchased in 2010. &nbsp;It has all the programs I need and a great big monitor and all the bells and whistles I need, well almost. &nbsp; It has just been cleared of all virus's and is in perfect working condition. &nbsp;My teck guy is
 a wonder and said he had been doing some testing of the Windows 10 program. &nbsp;He was raving about Windows 10 but I had already reserved a download to be done. &nbsp;Now I find my computer won't be able to and I am so upset. &nbsp;My operating system is Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there nothing that can be done to make it possible for me to download the Windows 10 program on my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your report said "Can't run Windows 10. &nbsp;NVIDIA GeForce 6150SE nForce 430. &nbsp;The display manufacturer hasn't made your display compatible with Windows 10. &nbsp;Check with manufacturer for support? &nbsp;Good luck with that? &nbsp;I looked up NVIDIA and that is a vast array
 of things I do not understand, &nbsp;I am lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You did mention I could buy a new PC that was compatible. &nbsp;DO NOT HAVE THE $$$$$. &nbsp;Am living on a fixed income and it isn't fixed to cover anything new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a senior but need my computer for work for my husband. &nbsp;WORK TO EARN IF POSSIBLE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for anything that you could advise that might help.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 start up programs &#33;</h2>
                    First i'll ask the question straight away &amp; tell my story in the end...
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHETHER I CAN DISABLE THE BELOW PROGRAMS OR NOT DURING THE START UP???</div>
<div>IF POSSIBLE, CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT'S THEIR PURPOSE?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>~ BDRegion</div>
<div>~ Quickset</div>
<div>~ Windows Host Process (Rundll32)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Alright, just like everyone i have the same start up &amp; shut down delay after upgrading to Windows 8.1 from 8. Previously it just takes in seconds to get into my browser after i click the start button but now it takes around 3.5 to 4 minutes. I have tried
 to disable most of the third party programs that used to start with the windows but still no use.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>MICROSOFT TEAM PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS START UP DELAY ISSUE OF WINDOWS 8.1 IMMEDIATELY.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Apart from that, i love Windows 8 &amp; also 8.1</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cheers for your answers people...</div>

<h2>            Stuck on &#34;Starting Windows&#34;, Repair Shows &#34;System Volume on Disk is Corrupted&#34;</h2>
                    Hi all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sorry to repeat a question I see a lot of instances of, but none of those seem to be addressing my problem correctly.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have not done anything new to my computer in recent days, so this problem has caught me off guard (I see most instances of this problem come after upgrading to Windows 7, I have had Win 7 installed for a while now).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is a summary of my problem:</div>
<div>1) My computer recently got stuck on the "Starting Windows Screen." So I manually held the power button to reboot.</div>
<div>2) On reboot, it said there was a need to run a startup repair, which I did. Everything checked fine, except for the last one which said "System Volume on Disk is Corrupted," which it claimed to have successfully fixed.</div>
<div>3) After rebooting from repair, the system gets stuck on "Starting Windows Screen" for a good 10-15 minutes, after which it runs a registry check. After it completes that I get hopeful -- but the screen then gets stuck on an all black screen with just
 the mouse cursor and nothing more.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Additional note: Attempting to start the computer on "safe mode" leads safe mode startup to become stalled on "DRIVERS\CLASSPNP.SYS"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>UPDATE: </b>The lastest attempt to repair yielded this message: "Startup repair cannot repair this computer automatically.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Problem event Name: Startup Repair Offline</div>
<div>Problem signature 01: 6.1.7600.16385</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>In need of help, not sure where to start.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

<h2>            Moving Windows Live Mail system from XP to Win7</h2>
                    I have a version of the Windows Live Mail (Version 2008, Build 12.0.1606) on my XP desktop that has the capability to move messages to "Storage Folders" located on my hard drive.&nbsp; The only program I can find &nbsp;on my new Windows 7 laptop&nbsp;in Windows Live
 is a Hot Mail system that does not allow&nbsp;moving&nbsp;messages to local hard drive location.&nbsp; Where should I be looking to find an application that replicates the XP version.<br />
<br />
The Hot Mail System seems to be "bare bones".&nbsp; There is not even a way to export or import messages that I can find.

            You can download Windows Live Mail for Windows 7 at http://download.live.com/wlmail
<br />
<br />
Version 2008 is an older version that is not compatible with Windows 7. <br />
<br />
Navigate to C:\Documents and Settings\User_AccountName\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Windows Mail<br />
<br />
You will find all folders that must be backed up, in fact, just copy the Windows Mail folder it self and paste it back in the following location in Windows 7<br />
<br />
C:\Users\User_AccountName\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Mail<br />
<br />
You will have to enable Show hidden files on both Windows XP and Windows 7 to find these directories<br />
<br />
Windows 7 &gt; Click Start &gt; User Account folder &gt; Organize &gt; Folder and Search Options &gt; View (tab), select 'Show hidden folders, files and drives<br />
<br />
In Windows XP, open Windows Explorer, click Tools &gt; Folder Options &gt; View (tab), select 'Show hidden files and folders'

<br />
You are two builds out of date.<br />
On the Windows 7&nbsp;machine download and install the latest Windows Live Mail.<br />
<br />
Then copy the mail folders from your old machine into a new folder on your new machine and import them.

<h2>            External SSD for Xbox One</h2>
                    Hello people!<br />
<br />
I was looking for additional storage on my good old Xbox One. And then though it was cool to get a SSD, to also increase speed loading.<br />
<br />
Problem: I found a "Xbox One SSD Game Drive" 512GB from Seagate on Amazon. But it's waaaay to expensive....<br />
Can I just use any kind of external SSD to plug into console?<br />
Or did I need an "official" one?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
S.<br />

            Hi, you could use pretty much any ssd but you‚Äôd need an enclosure too. To be honest for the cost it‚Äôs just not worth it for a few seconds of reduced loading times. You could get a far larger usb 3.0 external drive for your money.

<p>
</p><p>I have&nbsp;a Windows 8 computer that will only show me icons when I am in the file explorer and the pictures folder.&nbsp;I have made sure that the "show icon not thumbnail" is NOT checked in the folder options as well as made sure it is in "large" or "extra large"
 view so I could get the thumbnails. However, all it will show me is the icon. What am I missing?

            <p>THIS WORKED FOR ME AND WINDOWS 8.1!</p>
<p>HOWEVER, I had to unclick or uncheck all items under the custom user setting and then clicked SHOW THUMBNAIL INSTEAD OF ICON. This was a FIX and I will see if I can go back at a later date and add some of the other features that I love and use, regarding
 animation and using the magnifier. I'm on a new ASUS machine with large HD and RAM-no reason in the world that I can't have BOTH the thumbnail photos showing AND the fun Animations, Smoothing of Edges, etc. For now I am happy and want to thank the person who
 took the time to take screen shots. Nothing else worked. I did this before even looking for help but DID NOT choose CUSTOM and unclick all but the one I truly need. I hope this information helps others!&nbsp;</p>

 without success on any of the Computers. Where do I go from here? I have now been 2 months without updates and am getting worried.

            Hello You can try this method <br />
In 6 weeks 42.5 computers corrected out of 46.<br />
With 3 computers most should be corrected.<br />
I will paste <br />
<br />
I have had this problem as well and tried alot of recommendations but none apparently worked.On the update box on my computer has&nbsp; recent time update tried had NEVER.<br />
So if you have this maybe this will work for you I tried quite a path with all having the same apparent result with the error 8024402F Coming up.<br />
This is such a mad mad world we live in (murphies law seems to be in control.)<br />
Do exactly the opposite what is logical<br />
First set your update setting to NEVER RECEIVE UPDATES, then UNTICK the two boxes below if they are ticked (one about any one can update,) and the other about being informed about available updates.(That one a box comes up are you shore you want not to be notified
 etc.)<br />
NOW USING MURPHIES LAW&nbsp; Leave all settings as is eg NOTHING SHOULD WORK<br />
NOW CLICK THE UPDATE BUTTON SURPRISE SURPRISE YOU NOW CAN UPDATE.!!!!!<br />
After updating ,check for further updates after the first batch.<br />
Then the settings can be put back to normal eg Receive updates Automatically, the tick the other two boxes.<br />
<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try a Startup Repair&nbsp;and / or a&nbsp;System Restore using a Microsoft Vista DVD</p>
<p>Manufacturers Recovery Disks do not normally have Repair Options; thay are normally&nbsp;a reinstall to Factory Settings option&nbsp;only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the guide to using the Repair Options while using a Microsoft Vista DVD.</p>
<p>If a friend or work acquantance of yours&nbsp;has one, you may borrow and use it for Repairs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not have or can not borrow a Microsoft DVD there is&nbsp;a download of a Vista&nbsp;Startup Repair ISO file available&nbsp;which you can make into a Bootable disk to do the above&nbsp;Startup Repair and&nbsp;that&nbsp;method&nbsp;is recommended by a lot of posters in these Forums.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you have to buy it.</p>

<h2>            Recorded video is cropped</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I had a conversation on Skype desktop, using my webcam in landscape view and I have recorded the whole conversation by built in Skype recorder. However, in the final result It has combined two landscape views in to one, and it has cropped left and right
 sides of the videos. Since the person who I was talking to was sitting on the left side of the frame, his face cannot be seen in the recorded video. Is there any way to have full sized (not cropped) videos of mine and the other person?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear Agent/Moderator,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also facing the similar issue. I am using Skype version 8.42.0.60</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can share you the screenshot of the video recorded where the other calling party has turned his video off and only my video is recorded but my video is half recorded (only left side) and right side video is cropped (where only hands of the person is shown
 and his face and body is cropped).</p>
<p><br />
In the original video during the call right side person was fully visible and cropped after the call ended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know how to retrieve the original and full video recorded.</p>
<p>

            Hi Frederick
<br />
<br />Did you purchase a Skype number - that is the only way you wold have one of those is if you pay for that . . .
<br />
<br />Log into Skype online - <a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Click the 3 dots beside your name and choose Settings
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Your Account'
<br />
<br />If you have a Skype number you will see it there and whatever payment is associated with that . . .       
        </p>

<h2>            Mapping Custom Keyboard Keys to Windows Apps</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Microsoft Wireless Comfort Keyboard 5050, using on Windows 10.</p>
<p>This keyboard allows you to map 5 custom favorites keys (physical keys on the keyboard) to [whatever - sort of].</p>
<p>I have a Windows Store app (Netflix, as an example) and would like to map a favorites key to that app.</p>
<p>But, the Microsoft Mouse And Keyboard Center software used to do the mapping wants a file path to make this work.</p>
<p>How do I make this nice, brand new Microsoft keyboard open a nice, brand new Windows Store app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>

<p>In normal mode, a few seconds after my computer has booted (after desktop appears), a blue screen fills my monitor. I am getting this problem from past 10 hours. But my system works well in safe mode, safe mode with networking and safe mode with command
 prompt. I was able to successfully stop the restart after the blue screen appears. I tried windows memory diagnostic but it showed no problem. So my RAM stick works properly.<br />
<br />
I use Windows 7 (Ultimate). I have not installed any new hardware or software. I get the following message on my monitor ( On that blue screen ):<br />
<br />
"A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer<br />

<br />
If this is the first time you've seen this Stop error screen, restart your computer. If this screen appears again follow these steps:<br />
<br />
Check to make sure any new hardware or software is properly installed. If this is a new installation, ask your hardware or software manufacturer for any windows updates you might need.</p>
<p>If problems continue, disable or remove an newly installed hardware or software. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. If you need to use safe mode to remove or disable components, restart your computer. Press F8 to select Advanced Startup
 Options and then select safe mode.</p>

<p>The REGISTRY_ERROR bug check has a value of 0x00000051. This indicates that a severe registry error has occurred.</p>

To see the cause I have to take a look at the dumps with the Debugging Tools for Windows.<br />
<br />
Please start to safe mode with network, run the Windows Explorer and go to the folder C:\Windows\Minidump. Next, copy the dmp files to your desktop, zip all dmp into 1 zip file and upload the zip file to your public Skydrive [1] folder and post a link here.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern and we will provide the assistance required to help you resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed,&nbsp;I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>1. What is the version of Windows that you have installed in your PC?</p>
<p>2. Does your computer slow down only while&nbsp;downloading updates? </p>
<p>3. Can you specify exactly what you mean when you stated "HARD DRIVE GETS REAL BUSY APPEARING TO PROCESS UPDATES."?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I would suggest that you open Task Manager (Ctrl+Alt+Delete) while you computer runs slow during the downloading process. Once opened, check the usage of CPU and Memory. If either of the one has a high usage percentage click on it and check which
 of the services are running. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know about the&nbsp;status so that we can proceed further.</p>

    <title>xbox set up for families - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            xbox set up for families</h2>
                    <p>We got our first console and xbox one s.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found it a long arduous process to set up for family use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have given each child a gmail email, given each child a microsoft account, linked tha children to my microsoft family account, set up everyone on x box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However it does not work as I expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems free for anyone to play as anyone else, merely have to choose to be that person. How can this be pass protected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not want the children playing on their sibling's accounts as this will lead to arguments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set up each child with a passkey, yet this is not asked for at anytime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I sign them out, they have to sign in with their microsoft password, not their passkey.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems overly complicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How are your family accounts set up?</p>

<p>You can change sign in options . So it can ask for passkey instead of password. This can be found in account options from the settings page. You will need to sign in and change it for each account.</p>
<p>

<p>It sounds like you have done everything correctly. There is just one more step. Now that the passkeys are created, you need to change sign-in and security preferences. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-go to settings &gt; account &gt; sign-in, security &amp; passkey</p>
<p>
</p><p>-select "change my sign-in and security preferences"</p>
<p>
</p><p>-choose "Ask for my passkey" to sign in</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should then require a passkey to be entered when someone wants to play the Xbox.</p>

<p>Thanks for the replies,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done as suggested and set up sign in preferences so that the passkey is now requested and not the microsoft password, which is much better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when signed in, it is possible to switch between profiles without a passkey being asked for. Therefore is it expected that each player will sign out to prevent others playing on their profiles?</p>

            It is definitely good practice for them to sign out when they are done playing. It might be a lot to expect depending on their age (thinking of my kids, it would be a lot to expect for them to remember to log out, lol) but it is a good habit for them to
 make.

            <p><span>Abdul,</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for responding. I was not home when the update occurred so I couldn‚Äôt tell you if it did install correctly. I have to assume that it did not since the failure occurred concurrently with the
 update.</span></p>
<p><span>If I chose go back to previous build I get a blue screen that says, ‚ÄúWe ran into a problem and won‚Äôt be able to take you back to the previous build. Try resetting your current build instead (Toubleshoot
 &gt; reset this PC&gt;‚Äù)</span></p>
<p><span>If I choose ‚ÄúStartup repair‚Äù I get a screen that says ‚ÄúDiagnosing your PC‚Äù that then a blue screen that says ‚ÄúStartup Repair couldn‚Äôt repair your PC. Press ‚ÄòAdvanced Options‚Äô to try other options
 to repair our PC. Log File:‚Äù </span></p>
<p><span>When I try to load a system image I get an error that reads:</span></p>
<p><span>‚ÄúThe system image restore failed</span></p>
<p><span>Error details: The processor architecture or OS version of Windows Recovery Environment is not the same as that of the computer that was backed up. For example, a backup of a Vista x64 based computer
 can only be recovered by using a Vista x64-based version of Windows Recovery‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>When I chose System Restore there are three restore points The first was listed as 10/13/2015 Windows Critical Update, though now I can longer access. Every time I try, it tells me I must choose
 an operating system first, but no option for choosing an operating system exists.</span></p>
<p><span>When I choose ‚ÄúRefresh your PC‚Äù I also get an error.
</span></p>
<p><span>I tried reinstalling windows, but my product key from windows 8 no longer works.</span></p>
<p><span>Basically, all the options I have return an error.</span></p>
<p><span>Any help would be appreciated.</span></p>

<p>Lets&nbsp;check in the safe mode <strong>:</strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Safe mode </span></strong><span>is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly or that might prevent Windows from starting correctly. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files
 and drivers. To start your system in safe mode follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1. On your lock screen, click on the power button and press <strong>
shift + restart.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. After that, you will be redirect to an <strong>option screen.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Select <strong>troubleshoot&gt;advanced option &gt; start up settings.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Follow the <strong>on screen instructions.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted with the status of the issue, to assist you further.</p>
