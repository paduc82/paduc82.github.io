<h2>            Suddenly no 1920x1080 monitor support for my monitor</h2>
                    <p>Just before the Windows 10 v. 1709 update suddenly my monitor changed from high resolution to basic 1024x786 resolution. From then only 4:3 resolutions were available, and only a basic Windows 10 monitor driver is there.</p>
<p>I have a Samsung B2430L monitor, and yes it is "old", but still in great condition.
</p>
<p>It seems that Microsoft forces me to buy a new one?!!</p>
<p>Is it not possible for Microsoft to supply a "Basic monitor driver" with a 1920x1080 resolution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards, Paul</p>

<p><span>Option 2.&nbsp;</span>Remove AMD drivers completely and Install the legacy ones from the AMD site:</p>
<p><span>What you need to do:</span></p>
<p>1. Uninstall everything of AMD using this:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/AMD-Clean-Uninstall-Utility.aspx%20%20and%20reboot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/AMD-Clean-Uninstall-Utility.aspx
 and reboot</a></p>
<p>2. Reboot.</p>
<p>3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.</p>
<p>4. Download the legacy driver from here(You might have to do a bit of exercise to locate the driver:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.support.amd.com/en-us/download</a></p>
<p>5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.<br />
</p>
<p><span>Option&nbsp;</span>3: See if Windows itself has some history of the Older Driver:</p>

<h2>            Xbox Live Games with Gold - Unable to Redeem free games. </h2>
                    
<p>I have a Xbox Live Gold account that I pay using Prepaid Membership cards. Because of this I do not have a credit card linked to my account and I also have a account balance of $0.00 USD. Ever since Microsoft has switched to using local currency I have been
 unable to redeem any of the games in the "Games with Gold" program. I feel that I have paid for access to those games&nbsp;because of the fact I paid for Xbox Live Gold.</p>
<p>Any help on this issue would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            The Atheros wireless network adapter has either failed or is missing its drivers. Make sure it is enabled (look in Device Manager). Also some laptops have a switch, button, or need a combination of FN + some key to enable the wireless adapter. Make sure
 it is on. If the wireless is on and still not working, reinstall the drivers. Get them from the computer mftr.'s website or, if this is a PCI wireless card, from the wireless card mftr.'s website. If none of that doesn't work, perhaps the hardware itself has
 failed.

            How about giving the name of the "folder" or file you downloaded? Then I can walk you through it. No, you don't normally do anything with Device Manager.

            The file you downloaded doesn't end in .exe? If it does end in .exe (and this is why giving me the full name of the file was important and not ending it with an ellipsis), then just double-click on the file to start the installation process. If the file
 you downloaded was a .zip file, double-click it and there is a folder inside the archive, drag the folder out to your Desktop. Then look inside the folder for an installer; it will usually be called something like setup.exe. What kind of computer do you have?
 If you have a branded OEM machine (HP, Dell, etc.) then post the make/model so I can look up the drivers for you. Or give me a link to where you got the drivers so I can check it out for you.

<p>Because you finally told me your computer make/model, I've downloaded the Atheros driver package. Your experience with it may differ from mine because I'm not running Windows on this machine. When I double-click on the folder, OS X automatically extracts
 the drivers into a folder for me. What you should do is create a folder on your desktop first. Call it "Atheros LAN driver" or the like. Then double-click on the .zip file you downloaded and extract the contents to the folder you just made. One of the files
 inside is called "setup.exe". Double-click on that to start the drivers installation. You don't need to uninstall the old ones first.</p>
<p>If installing these drivers doesn't work then possibly the hardware has failed. Call Acer tech support.</p>

            thank you for your help the wireless device is now passing the diagnostic test although it does not connect to public networks as well as my old laptop that had windows vista even though i have two bars and 54 speed,its very slow and i freeze up a lot,
 which never happened before. do you think its because the adapter is not as good or could the settings be wrong to connect to a public unsecured network?

            It could be that the adapter isn't good or the drivers aren't well-written. I can't answer the question about the public unsecured network because I'm not there to test connectivity to that particular network. It might be worth calling Acer tech support.

    <title>Xbox live accounts and family accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jayjay1271  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox live accounts and family accounts</h2>
                    
<p>Our Xbox was set up years ago by my step son but now I want to take more control of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to reset the Xbox, set up a family account and set up separate accounts for each child.&nbsp; I could then control the time and content for each of them.</p>
<p>I realize this will delete all the setting on the Xbox.&nbsp; But will it also delete our Xbox live account?&nbsp; And also, will I need to set up separate Xbox live accounts for each of my children at $60 a piece?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello jayjay1271</p>
<p>Removing them from the family should not delete the accounts. They are associated with an e-mail address even if they are or were prior child accounts.
</p>
<p>Unless you are using Xbox One to share gold through your family you will indeed have to pt gold on individual accounts since they discontinued the Family Pack.</p>
<p>I hope I was able to provide you the correct information. Please post back in here if you require any further help.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

<p>Yes. You can still be connected to Live as a Free member, they just won't be able to play online. But they can still get game updates and everything else on Live.</p>

    <title>Xbox One Smartglass App&#47;Xbox App remote function in edge cursor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heavyl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Smartglass App&#47;Xbox App remote function in edge cursor issue</h2>
                    
<p>I use my xbox one smartglass app to control xbox edge to navigate websites when my controller isn't around (i.e like a touch screen)</p>
<p>After I returned from holidays I noticed I could no longer see the cursor (in edge) when using the remote function in the smartglass app when I was&nbsp;trying to control&nbsp;edge on the xbox&nbsp;(the remote functioning as the&nbsp;right control stick of a controller)</p>
<p>I thought that was to push me to use the new xbox app on my computer but the remote function acts the same.</p>
<p>Can you confirm if this function was removed from both apps and if so is there any plans to implement it back into the app?</p>
<p>I am running windows 10 on a Lenovo yoga 3.</p>
<p>xbox one smartglass v.2.2.1510.30008</p>
<p>xbox app 11.13.6008.00000</p>

                    I'm doing my taxes with H&amp;R block software and it can't connect to the internet for some reason, even though my internet is working fine. Is there a setting that I need to change somewhere? I can't seem to find anything that works.

    <title>OneDrive sync problem Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajd 62  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive sync problem Windows 10</h2>
                    OneDrive in task bar shows OneDrive up to date and all files are in sync. BUT folder in W Explorer shows several OneDrive folders still in sync including empty ones - and I cannot manage the folders. I am also unable to sync OneDrive on my surface - it
 is stuck on 6 changes. I currently keep it switched off. I wonder if there is a problem file somewhere but how can the task-bar information NOT agree with Windows Explorer info?&nbsp;

<br />Press Windows Key + R
<br />
<br />In the Run dialog, paste this and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />OneDrive should then start syncing again . . .

<p>Hi, thanks for quick reply. I tried this and OneDrive resynced everything quickly with my Dell laptop. One file was duplicated. But the problem with the status symbols in Windows Explorer remained exactly the same. Several folders showed sync pending including
 those with no files. OneDrive task bar shows sync up to date. So they do not agree! There is also another problem. The status in one folder shows all files as sharing (and I do not want that) but properties does not indicate sharing and I cannot change it.
 I do not think that there is a problem with the files, the problem is probably with the status indicators in Windows Explorer. How can the OneDrive status in Windows Explorer be different from the status in the task bar?</p>

<p>1.Installed Windows 7 Pro 32bit to an SSD drive<br />

3.Saved the image to a different internal HDD drive<br />
4.Created a system&nbsp;recovery disc on a USB stick using Windows 7 USB/DVD Download tool</p>
<p>Some weeks later I needed to restore the Windows 7 image back onto the same SSD drive, I booted of the USB recovery stick and selected restore from image I made earlier, Windows found the image and began the restoration, but a few seconds later it threw
 it up this error "The parameter is incorrect.(0x80070057)" and the restore operation failed. I need some help with this, I did everything according to the book so I'm baffled!</p>

<p><span>Question? The HP software your trying to install is it from a disk? If so you will need to go to the HP website and download the program through them for more than likely the software
 you have is too old to use in Windows 7. Another Question? What OS are you running (32bit or 64bit)? If the drivers on the disk are 32 bit and your trying to install them into a 64 bit system it will not work; you will need the 64 bit Windows 7 or Vista 64
 bit drivers to install your printer. If you think the disk is right then you can always try compatibility mode. To do this right click the set.exe file on the disk then go to properties. In here click on the Compatibility Tab and then use an older OS for install.
 You also can hit the check box to run as Administrator to skip the step of right clicking again to run as administrator. I still think the best bet is to go to the HP website and download your driver set from them online.

            <p>If you can't print using the printer's own controls, the problem is almost certainly hardware related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to the Error light are any other lights on the printer on or flashing?</p>
<p>Is there an "E" in the printer's display?</p>
Are any errors or warnings indicated in the Epson Status Monitor (software on your computer)?
<p>
</p><p>The process you describe actually is doing two things:&nbsp; scanning your original and then printing a copy.&nbsp; To determine whether the problem is with the scanning function or with the printing function, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disconnect the USB cable from your computer.</li><li>Make sure that there is paper in the printer.</li><li>Press the On button while also pressing the Ink button.</li></ol>
<p>This should print an operation check page that includes a nozzle check pattern -- what happens on your printer?</p>

            <p>I'm not familiar with this printer; all I've done is read some of the online documentation.&nbsp; I suggest that you use Google to search for Epson Printer Repair in your area and take the machine in for service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The service manual for the Epson Stylus RX420 is here --&gt; <a href="http://diagramas.diagramasde.com/impresoras/EPSON%20Stylus%20Photo%20RX420-RX425-RX430.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://diagramas.diagramasde.com/impresoras/EPSON%20Stylus%20Photo%20RX420-RX425-RX430.pdf</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>According to that manual, your control panel looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ec9bf32e-3b17-45a7-951b-7c4aaeb69e63" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are (at least) 7 lights on this panel and a "7-segment LED" display which is where you might see an "E" if there is a serious error.&nbsp; From your description, I believe the "Power LED" (the green light) is flashing and the "Error LED" (the red light)
 is on (but not flashing).&nbsp; The manual does not describe any condition that results in this pattern (see pages 49-52 of the pdf manual linked above).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If in addition to the power light flashing and the error light on, all of the other lights were flashing and an "E" was flashing in the 7-segment display, that would indicate a "maintenance request" because the overflow sponge is full.&nbsp; That's typically
 a job performed by a repair shop, but a handy user can do it as well.&nbsp; However, that's not the situation that you've described.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I can't be of further help.</p>

            <p>Hello </p>
<p>Thank you for your reply ,I have looked at the site your attached ti your reply and like you cannot see anything obvious . However I have been through the printing process again and would like to add these additional comments . When trying to print either
 test print or print from the computer or manual print the print monitor comes up with the statement that the paper is not loaded correctly ,however having reloading&nbsp; and after having a good look at the loading station I cannot see anything wrong .Also having
 looked at printing preferances and clicking on advanced the message comes up "advanced setting are recomended for experienced users only ,click cancell to return to basic screen ". When I do this nothing happens and thenonly way I can get rid of it is the
 switch the computer off .</p>

    <title>Temporary blackout Surface Book showing &#39;Autorotate on&#39; Wins - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> swisscake2016_04  say:</h3>
<h2>            Temporary blackout Surface Book showing &#39;Autorotate on&#39; Wins 10</h2>
                    <p>I have 3-weeks old Microsoft Surface Book Core i5, 8 GB RAM, 256. Recently (5-days ago) I noticed frequent flashes (1-2 seconds) of the screen blackout preceded by a display of "Autorotate on" at the left hand upper corner. This also includes a temporary
 and brief disconnection of the keyboard. This problem occurs only when the keyboard is attached. It occurs both in desktop and tablet mode. I have checked to ensure the keyboard is always properly attached. I have the latest updates of all software including
 the OS - Windows 10 (64 bit). I have shutdown and/or restarted the Surface Book several times and the problem still persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone else have this problem? Is there anyone who can help in providing a solution. Thank you in advance.&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Music file properties problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> homerjsimpson743  say:</h3>
<h2>            Music file properties problem</h2>
                    I think this is a Windows 7 problem, not a RealPlayer problem:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I'm playing a clip in RealPlayer, I can click on "Edit Clip Info", and change whatever, then click OK and exit. However, the next time I run the clip, or open RealPlayer, the old information is back. There seems to be 2 views - Library view, and this
 "Edit Clip Info" view &amp; they don't necessarily match, correct? And both (the Edit Clip on more so) keep resetting to the earliest configuration.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The other, perhaps related problem, is that file properties for the folder the music files are in keeps changing to partly "Read Only", no matter how often I uncheck the box.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone help me with either of these problems, please? I'm trying to set up my file library so that the "artist" and "song name" are in the correct columns and real player and/or windows won't let me save them!!</div>
<div>Am I trying to change a read only setting? If so, how do I make it not read only? And if not, then why won't the settings save??</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div>Milton.</div>

<p><span>Hi HomerJSimpson743,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Does the issue occur with all the music files or is it specific to one particular file?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue is specific to one particular file, the issue could be as a result of copyrighted material. You cannot change the properties of the
 file that is copyrighted. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As an alternative to editing the properties to a music file from the RealPlayer menu, you could try doing the same from within the folder where
 the music files are saved. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft article for more information:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Change the properties for a file</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-the-properties-for-a-file" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-the-properties-for-a-file</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also take ownership of the folder and then try changing the properties and check if that helps. Taking ownership has helped some users
 in the past.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>To take ownership of a file or folder,</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Right-click the file or folder, click Properties, and then click the Security tab.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click Advanced, and then click the Owner tab.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click Edit, and then do one of the following:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>â€¢ To change the owner to a user or group that is not listed, click Other users and groups and, in Enter the object name to select
 (examples), type the name of the user or group, and then click OK. </span></p>
<p><span>â€¢ To change the owner to a user or group that is listed, in the Change owner to box, click the new owner.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. (Optional) To change the owner of all subcontainers and objects within the tree, select the Replace owner on subcontainers
 and objects check box.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below for more information:</span></p>

            Mmm, kinda. It happens with any file where I try to change the settings, so, probably all of them.
<div><br />
<div>I have taken ownership. There are several "group or user names" that seem to be possible for file permissions:</div>
<div>Administrators (MyComputername/Administrators)</div>
<div>MyUsername (MyComputername/MyUsername) &lt;- this is the owner</div>
<div>Users (MyComputername/Users)</div>
<div>Authenticated Users</div>
<div>SYSTEM</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now "SYSTEM", "Authenticated Users" &amp; "Administrators" generally have full control of each file (there are some variations for some reason, probably cos some files were left on the system from before I went from Vista to 7).&nbsp;I'm not sure which one is important.
 I'm the admin and the only user account.&nbsp;Which of the above owners are necessary, anyway?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Where are the file settings (artist, songname, genre etc.) stored &amp; why do they reset each time I reopen the file?&nbsp;I have asked at real.com &amp; was just told to completely uninstall &amp; reinstall realplayer, which I did but it didn't help. Note that these
 settings are only visible in RealPlayer, not in windows folder view, but I assume they're stored with the file? I have no idea, but like I said, I've reinstalled RealPlayer &amp; that didn't help, so I'm assuming it's some sort of windows 7 problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And secondly, why does the folder these music files are stored in keep changing back to partial "read only" (the box has a square instead of a tick) when i check its properties?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again,</div>

<h2>            Networking Windows 7 and windows 10 computers</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to network a new windows 10 computer to my old windows 7 computer for the purpose of sharing files.<br />
<br />
Both computers are wired via CAT5e cable into a Netgear GS108 Ethernet switch. I can ping the win 7 PC from the win10 PC. I can ping the win 10 PC from the win 7 PC.<br />
Both computers have Network Discovery, File and print sharing, and public sharing turned on.<br />
<br />
I cannot see either PC from the other in Windows Explorer. The Network folder shows empty. (Computer browsing is enabled on both PCs)<br />
<br />
When looking at network properties The Win7 PC shows it connected to the internet via "NETWORK 3". The Win10 PC is connected via "NETWORK"<br />
<br />
I have not found a way to get them on the same Network.<br />
<br />
What do I do next?<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

            Tried that before. It doesn't work.<br />
<br />
The machines can ping each other but cannot see each other because they are on different networks. "Network 3" and "Network".<br />
<br />
I tried sharing with specific people but no matter what I enter they cannot be found.<br />
<br />
How do I get the two machines to be on the same network?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

            What do you Ã¹ean with that ?
<br />The machines can ping each other but cannot see each other because they are on different networks. "Network 3" and "Network".
<br />If you Apply lonk below they will be on the same network
<br />
<br />use the same Microsoft account on every device.

<p>I will get screen captures tomorrow.<br />
<br />
<br />
In Network and Sharing center you get a graphical representation of the connection. On the left you get a box representing the PC. It shows a connection to the middle box representing the network. On One PC this box is labelled "Network 3" on the other it is
 only "Network"<br />
<br />
If you look at the ethernet adapter settings it lists the IP address&nbsp; and lower down, the network name.&nbsp;&nbsp; On one it lists Network 3 On the other it lists "network".&nbsp; I don't know how they can be on two separate networks when they are plugged into the same switch
 but they are.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are invisible to each other in Explorer.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</p>

<p>You should download it and save it&nbsp;- note that depending on your AV, it may complain, because of the file it contains.</p>
<p>If it does, I'll craft a new one that'll get through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once saved, right-clcik on the file, and select Extract all...</p>
<p>Save the content to your desktop, or other easily accessible place.</p>
<p>The content is a registry file with a .reg extension (which is why your AV may complain about it).</p>
<p>right-clcik on that file, and select Merge from the list.</p>
<p>after a couple of seconds, you should get a success messsage.</p>
<p>Reboot TWICE.</p>
<p>Run a new MGADiag report. andpost the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also - open a Command Prompt, and type</p>
<p>SC QC SPPSVC</p>
<p>and </p>
<p>SC QUERYEX SPPSVC</p>
<p>copy and paste the results to your response. ,(to copy the results... click on the Black/White icon in the top left, and select Edit... 'Select All', and hit the Enter key - then use Ctrl+V or r-click+Paste to paste it into your response.)

<h2>            Incorrect information in the &#34;System&#34; window from the Control Panel</h2>
                    
<p>When I bought a new computer, I used Easy Transfer to get my data on my new device.&nbsp; Everything works fine, but for some reason, some of the info on the System display is incorrect.&nbsp; The Processor Type and Speed, as well as the Installed Memory (RAM) are
 correct for my NEW computer, but it lists the manufacturer and model as a Hewlett-Packard HP Pavilion dv7 Notebook PC which was correct for my OLD computer.&nbsp; My new computer is a Gateway FX model.&nbsp; Where could the system be getting that incorrect information.&nbsp;
 Can I correct it?&nbsp; It's not stopping me from doing anything, but it just irritates me that perhaps I installed or transferred something wrong, and now I'm getting this weird mixed info.</p>
<p>Thanks for any and all hints or suggestions.</p>

            Hi Kristy,
<br />Iâ€™m Linnell I'm a fellow Community member here to help.
<br />What a great example of how to show us what is happening with your pen. Thank you! 
<br />In the link I supplied below it seems that the pen works best Surface Pen works seamlessly with apps designed for creative tasks like Adobe Photoshop Elements, Sketchable, Drawboard PDF, and Staffpad. 
<br />Word doesnâ€™t seem to be on that list the workaround in word is 
<br />enter text by using the handwriting panel in the touch keyboard in instructions in help link below.

<br />I hope this helps. Please feel free to ask questions and let us know how it goes.

            <p>I have the same issue, only way to fix it for me is to rollback the drivers and the warning goes away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if i re-update to the 10/14/2014 firmware update and reboot it gives the exclamation point again with Code 10 but the surface overall is working ok. Any fixes for this? And is the dimming display when surface heats up ever going to be fixed.</p>

            Well I could not figure it out so I requested an advanced replacement through the Surface support website. The replacement works great and updated to the October firmware with no issue. The replacement I got came with a newer recovery image that contained
 the January firmware. I tried using that image on the Surface that had the issue and it still had the same error. So it is definitely a hardware problem -&nbsp;I would&nbsp;just request a replacement as the refurbished Surfaces have a one year warranty
