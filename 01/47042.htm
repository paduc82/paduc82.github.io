    <title>3TB hard drive for media won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t format - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hades lady  say:</h3>
<h2>            3TB hard drive for media won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t format</h2>
                    
<p>I recently bought a 3tb WD "My Book". When I plug it into my 360 and go to my storage, the hard drive shows up as "unformatted" so I select to format but I get an error "can't perform action." Is there a way to get by this?</p>
<p>The intent to use it to watch movies and tv shows on my 360 and (hopefully) one, not for games or saves.</p>
<p>I have been successful to format the drive to FAT32.</p>

<p>Hey there :)</p>
<p>The Xbox360 console supports external drives with sizes up to 2TB so the 3TB drive might not work with it.
</p>
<p>I would check the drive's health on a PC with WD Data Lifeguard Diagnostic and see if it's safe to use. Here's a link:

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Captain WD is correct : &nbsp;the 360 will only take an external hard drive up to 2 TB. &nbsp;The xbox One can take larger like a 4 TB. I would say the drive is too large to use. &nbsp;Though the system used to accept larger drives and use what it wanted. &nbsp;Now it doesn't.</p>
<p>XBOX says:</p>
<p>'You can use other USB flash drives to store up to 2 TB of content. Configure these flash drives as memory units to work with the Xbox 360. &nbsp;To learn more -
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-AU/xbox-360/accessories/usb-flash-drive-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../usb-flash-drive-faq</a> '</p>
<p>With the new settings on the 360 you can format the drive on a computer then use it on the console. &nbsp;The question is does the console recognise the drive? &nbsp;Try formatting it on a computer first then connect it. &nbsp;If possible format it to a 2TB size (shame
 I know) then try again or get another drive.</p>
<p>Good luck &amp; happy gaming</p>

<p>Funny thing is i have tried everything that has been suggested in the forums and it still will not work on the 2013 Xbox 360 E, its a seagate 2TB ex hdd it works on vista, its twin works on my Xbox 1, it detects it but it will not format it. Everything says
 it should work but it doesn't. Has anyone at microsoft been checking the code, because since the update things have got worse.</p>

<p>Seagate makes trash drives. They're cheap, and they have problems all the time. Not just with Xboxes, but in general. If you have a drive over 2 TB, you can partition it properly, and have the 360 detect it. &nbsp;Make sure that your sector size is the same as
 the 360's (I believe it was 512, although I'm mistaken). Even if you format it the right file system and your sector size is wrong, your 360 won't detect it.

    <title>Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adapter Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bradkwitz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adapter Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am having some strange issues with the Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adapter on my ASUS laptop. The issue surfaced when I tried to join a party through the Windows 10 Xbox app and was notified that the Teredo address could not be found. After working
 through all the troubleshooting tips provided on that page and countless others I found while researching the problem on other websites, I decided to come here and make this post because absolutely nothing is working and I am having problems that I haven't
 seen described anywhere else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To start off, when looking through my device manager (showing hidden devices) a teredo network adapter did not even exist on the list. I was able to install one through the "add legacy hardware" option but it is not resolving my issue. The adapter appears
 to have no issues when viewing it in the device manager but some seem to be surfacing in my admin command prompt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried every combination of disabling, enabling, restarting, and uninstalling I can possibly think of but nothing seems to work. When I run<strong> netsh interface Teredo show state</strong> in the command prompt, the Type is always disabled. Even
 if I enable it just before checking, it seems to always be disabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bcc844dd-3bb8-456c-a7fe-b9bd48ff099b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bcc844dd-3bb8-456c-a7fe-b9bd48ff099b" /></a></p>
<p>This is where I am stumped. I have no idea what is going wrong and what to do about it. So I come to you lovely people of the internet for any assistance you can provide me. Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it helps at all, I also am having the same problem on my Xbox One recently (it cannot find the teredo address). It did not start happening until I came back from college recently. This makes me think it may have something to do with my modem, router,
 or ISP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note I have tried everything with my firewall turned on and turned completely off and received the same results.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to Xbox forums support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about your Xbox 360 signing in issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would first suggest going to&nbsp;https://account.microsoft.com/ to make sure your email and password work allowing you to sign</p>
<p>into your Microsoft account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I would suggest clearing the cache of your 360 console by clicking on the link below and following the instructions:&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>When you change your gamertag you have to go in and redownload your profile.</p>

<p>Hi, Airborne4905!<br />
<br />
As I understood, you have a list of files that you want to be printed automatically. Well, for this you should create a script. Below I show you a simple script.<br />
<br />
Now, assume that you have a file <strong>d:\print.txt</strong> that contains names of the files in folder
<strong>c:\users\public\pictures\sample pictures\</strong> with one filename on each line, e.g.:<br />
<strong>Greek.jpg<br />
Dock.jpg<br />
Forest.jpg</strong><br />
<br />
Then, you have a file called <strong>print.vbs</strong> that contains the following script code:<br />
<br />
<strong>Set objShell = CreateObject("Wscript.Shell")<br />
Set shell=CreateObject("Shell.Application")<br />
Set objFS = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")<br />
Set objFile = objFS.OpenTextFile("d:\\print.txt", 1)<br />
strFileContents = objFile.ReadAll</strong></p>
<p><strong>arrLines = Split(strFileContents,vbNewLine)<br />
For Each strLine in arrLines<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strFile = "C:\\Users\\Public\\Pictures\\Sample Pictures\\" &amp; strLine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; shell.ShellExecute strFile,"","","Print"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; objShell.Run "mspaint /p " &amp; chr(34) &amp; strFile &amp; chr(34),0,True<br />
Next</strong></p>
<p><strong>objFile.Close<br />
</strong><br />
If you want to print all the files you have listed in your <strong>d:\print.txt</strong> file, you just execute the
<strong>print.vbs</strong> file.<br />
<br />
Note:<br />
1. The line <strong>strFile = "C:\\Users\\Public\\Pictures\\Sample Pictures\\" &amp; strLine</strong> contains path to your pictures folder--if you need to browse another folder, simply edit this string (note that you should keep double-backslash instead of single-backslash
 that you use normally!).<br />
2. The line <strong>Set objFile = objFS.OpenTextFile("d:\\print.txt", 1)</strong> contains path to the file where you list images to be printed. Edit the path to reflect the actual path to your file.<br />
3. If you need a more elaborate version or some further questions about scripting, you are advised to ask questions in the Microsoft Scripting Guys Forum on
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/ITCG/threads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/ITCG/threads/</a>.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>You would probably do better to ask how to install this total conversion mod for&nbsp; Medieval II: Total War</p>
<p>at the forums on the site you downloaded the mod from (or the site below). </p>
<p>There should also be a Read Me with the mod (most big mods have a Read Me, but not all)&nbsp; that may
</p>
<p>detail the procedure, and what tools may be required to install the mod.</p>

            Hey Neo.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please run the Sound Playback troubleshooter at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If no Updates listed this could also be the latest Windows 10 Version 1709 Update which you can check at Settings&gt;System&gt;About and if necessary roll back at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery, then hide with the tool given above to wait for it to mature.  
<br />
<br />Or you can try the most stable method to update to the latest version (which you need anyway) by installing  Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Hard drive wiped-I had a free Windows 10 download</h2>
                    <p>Had downloaded Windows 10 for free. A recent internet/computer glitch put Windows 10 into a never ending circle of trying to update but would not update nor work (endless circles). So, computer store indicated my drive will end up being wiped. Can I get
 Windows 10 again for free? My account shows 2 computers with but of course, no key code.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone answers this, please use non technical English and preferably a step by step guide as there are vast gaps in my computer knowledge.</p>

            <p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation
 Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>
<p>If you are prompted to enter a product key, click 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later'</p>

<h2>            TurboTax causes a windows reboot in the middle of the installation</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to install TurboTax 2017 and in the middle of the installation (47% complete), my computer reboots.&nbsp; The install doesn't complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried reinstalling TurboTax 2016 and it now does the same thing, but used to install a year ago on the same machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 Professional, file system is clean, all updates installed, no malware found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turning off firewall, virus software</p>
<p>Launching the setup.exe in Windows 8 compatibility mode</p>
<p>Starting the computer with minimal system components</p>
<p>Using both a CD install and a download install</p>
<p>Spending 3 hours on the phone with the TurboTax techs who couldn't find the issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can see what is causing the windows reboot?&nbsp; Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Dale, you can browse to that location in the registry to delete the key manually.  But first did you delete all Intuit or Quickbooks folders found in Program Files or anywhere in User Appdata hidden files?  If not do that first and restart PC. 
<br />
<br /> Set a System restore point: <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Type regedit in Start Search, right click to Run as Admin. Browse to the location to delete the key. 
<br />
<br />Then from the edit tab choose Find and type Intuit, search forward, delete each intuit key it finds.  Then do a search with Quickbooks, delete each.
<br />
<br />Restart PC, try install again.
<br />
<br />Did you also try a new test Admin User account to see if this works?

&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a black screen on my laptop that only diplays an error message asking for a Product Key.&nbsp; I am running Windows Vista.&nbsp; I recently installed some software.&nbsp; I can not get to my desktop, but I&nbsp;am able to get online because there is a&nbsp;link with the error

 they don't have the Product Key and they also said that it shouldn't be asking for a product key.&nbsp; Could someone please assist me.&nbsp; I have sooo much saved that I do not want to lose.

            Hi Dneen,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Vista Support forum,<br />
<br />
Did Vista come pre-install on your laptop? If so, try again to locate the product key which might be include some other place than the label at the bottom of your laptop.<br />
<br />
If your Vista unexpectly ask for activation, please go ahead and use the phone activation method to talk to a customer service representative to help you<br />

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to active Vista</a><br />
<br />
Here's what the product key look like:<br />
<br />
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<span><strong><em>Information</em></strong></span></div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>The product key number is a sequence of 25 letters and numbers. The number is divided into 5 groups of 5 characters each. During Vista installation, you must enter the product key number to activate Vista.</td>

<tr>

<td>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>Express</strong> or <strong>Retail Vista</strong> can be installed on any one computer at a time for as many times as you like. A
<strong>OEM Vista</strong> may only be able to be installed on the exact same computer as many times as you like. The product key number for the Vista
<strong>32 bit</strong> version is the same one for it's <strong>64 bit</strong> version. You can only have the
<strong>Product Key</strong> activated on one computer and version of 32 bit or 64 bit Vista at a time. If you had the product key activated on one computer and made some hardware changes to it (EX: Motherboard) or decided to use it on another computer, then
 you will have to remove it from the old computer and do a phone activation. </li><li>You can usually find the product key on the back of your OEM computer or on the retail installation disc holder inside the Vista package. Look for a sticker that looks like one of these below.
</li><li>For the <strong>license terms</strong> for Vista, see: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/legal/useterms/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I had the feature within movie maker but recently just now I found out it's gone, nowhere to be located at all. I thought at first maybe the type of movie file disables this feature but no, I tried opening all kinds off files and still the feature is not
 present anymore. Should I reinstall movie maker? Thanks for any help in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi JxPzzz,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I understand that you cannot see&nbsp;the Video stabilization button in your Movie Maker. To ensure that the compatibility setting is not affecting this issue, kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search for Movie Maker in your computer.</li><li>Right-click on <strong>Movie Maker</strong> then choose <strong>Open file location</strong>.</li><li>Right-click again then choose <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</li></ol>
<p>After following the steps, make sure that the checkbox for <strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for:</strong> is not checked. If it is, kindly untick the checkbox, click
<strong>Apply</strong> then <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the results afterwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nurichorvat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Update</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 Professional installed (on two separate computers - both have the same issues). I have a problem where the automatic Windows 10 Update Service has downloaded the items show below. The attempted installs fail and return the Error message
 as shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q1. Why does the update process not recognize the problem and stop. My internet link is slow and expensive. How do I stop the process ?</p>
<p>I have tried stopping the Automatic download and selected "Delay downloads" but has no effect, even after rebooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q2. Why after the attempted install which fails, does the downloaded applications get deleted and starts downloading the same updates again ? My computer has now downloaded 6 separate sets of "Feature update for Windows 10, version 1607".</p>
<p>Why doesn't Windows recognize the installation failed and keep the downloaded software instead of deleting it ?</p>
<p>That is, the downloaded software should only get deleted after a successful installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q3. The Error&nbsp;0x80240017 is listed on the MicroSoft site as </p>
<p>"<span>0x80240017 WU_E_NOT_APPLICABLE Operation was not performed because there are no applicable updates."</span></p>
<p><span>If this is correct, then why doesn't the software first check if the download is required/applicable ?</span></p>
<p><span>If the Update is required (suspect it is from the information on the MS site) then the Error code would appear to be incorrect. Please advise what I need to do to fix the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>---------------snip from Update and Security in Settings</p>
<p>There were problems installing some updates, but we'll try again later. If you keep seeing this and want to search the web or contact support for information, this may help:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB2267602 (Definition 1.229.338.0) - Error 0x80240017</p>

<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>So I'm kind of new to this Xbox thing, and lately I've been playing Skyrim and I'm really enjoying it. However, for some reason today it kept on being stuck at '' Saving content '' whenever I want to save it. I'm at the point after I release the Miasma (does
 this ring any bells to anyone?) and whenever I try to save it, it's just stuck on ''Saving content.. please don't turn off your console''</p>
<p>I have tried clearing my cache and I know it's not smart to turn off your console while it says that, but it won't allow me to do anything else!<br />
If anyone could help me, that would be amazing..</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>Jay! &nbsp;</p>

<p>Are you doing the quest called Waking Nightmare? If so, I'm guessing you're freezing coming out of the Dreamstride sequence. If so, it's a known bug fixed in the patch that is currently waiting to be certified by Microsoft. However, if this is place you're
 freezing, just don't save until you're back out in Skyrim &amp; you'll be fine -- there's literally less than 5 mins of gameplay after that point, so it shouldn't be any trouble getting outside &amp; safely saving w/o freezing. Also, if you have auto save turn on
 (which you shouldn't, btw), turn them off until you're back outside.</p>

<p>Additionally you could try playing another game, or at least download some content off the marketplace to see if it saves properly. &nbsp;This is simply to test to see if the hard drive is working properly.</p>

<p>Bethesda games always work better w/ autosave turned off. Something to do with the frame rate drop when an autosave is triggered -- this can lead to corrupted save files. Also, autosaves tend to happen after a load screen &amp; I'll tell you this; there's nothing
 more scary in gaming than a Bethesda load screen. Some people have been lucky &amp; not affected by this, many have been unlucky -- myself included. Nevertheless, I'm glad I could help.</p>

<p>I have to agree with you BlackHawk on this one. My game runs soooo much better since I turned off "autosave" and the problems nearly stopped all together.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 updates - Problems with disappearing or corrupt .dll files &#40;MSVCR110.dll &#43; MSVCP100.dll &#43; nvspcap64.dll&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Last year (2015)&nbsp;I&nbsp;changed from Windows 8.1 to the free&nbsp;Windows 10.&nbsp; The Microsoft help-team solved some initial problems (disappearing .dll files for my "Windows Live Mail" program:
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>MSVCR110.dll</strong></span>), thereafter till 09/02/2016 everything worked normally.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But, on 09/02/2016, Microsoft installed a major update on my PC and again&nbsp; .dll files disappeared.&nbsp; The previous problem with
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">MSVCR110.dll</span></strong> reappeared.&nbsp; Why ??? Thanks to the community I could reinstall that file, but will I have to do that each time Microsoft installs a new update ???&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Now also the file <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">MSVCP100.dll</span></strong> is missing (that is new !!!) and the system says there is an error in c:\windows\system32\<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>nvspcap64.dll :</strong></span>
 "Ontbrekende vermelding: shadowplayonsystemstart".</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">QUESTIONS:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>How can I resolve the remaining 2 problems (<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">MSVCP100.dll</span></strong> +
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>nvspcap64.dll</strong></span>&nbsp;)? and</li><li>How can I prevent that future windows10 updates cause the same problems ???</li></ol>
<p>In advance, thanks for your help.</p>
<p>Hugo</p>
