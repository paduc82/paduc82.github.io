<h2>            Restart Loop After Windows Vista Update 3 of 3 &#40;0&#37;&#41;</h2>
                    Hello!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I realize many have had this issue in the past, and I've been Googling for months about it. I decided to give all the tries a go from past threads last night and today and none of it worked in regards to advice given by others in the past, maybe I am missing
 something?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To state my specific problem:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I haven't used my Windows Vista desktop since March of 2012 apparently, one day I went to turn it on probably mid-summer last year (I have a Macbook Pro and only use Windows now to play video games) and it seemed to get stuck after booting up, saying it
 was installing updates 3 of 3 (0%), then it restarts the computer, same thing over and over. I went away to college and did not have this computer with me until I moved this past August. Alas here sits this computer with a lovely monitor that would like to
 work again. :)&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have one problem --- my DVD drive has been broken for a long time. No idea what happened, but for the past 5 months I had been waiting to buy an external disc reader so that I would be able to boot from the CD that came with my desktop, one of the things
 I thought would fix it. Thankfully I received one for Christmas last week!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have gone and tried to do system restores by booting from the disc to every restore on there, the latest being March 2012 (it tells me it may cause problems because it is over 60 days old). For every one it tells me there is an unspecified error in which
 it cannot restore.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried the command prompt method, I am computer savvy to a certain extent I thought, but I can't seem to get that to work correctly. One of the first steps I read was to open the command prompt and type "C:\windows\winsxs" and when I do that it tells
 me it "is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file." When I first open the command prompt through the system restore window, it first comes up with "X:\Sources&gt;". Took me a while to figure it out but now I know how
 to get it to say "C:\&gt;" instead, although that does not change anything. I have a feeling this method, by deleting some files, would do the trick but I am stuck.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Do you guys have any advice? I would greatly appreciate it. I'm so stumped!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>THANK YOU!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>K</div>

<p><b><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></b></p>
<p><span>Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and
drivers. Startup programs do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.</span></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly, or that might prevent Windows from starting correctly. If
 a problem does not reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the 
default settings and basic device drivers as possible causes. If a recently installed program, device, or driver prevents Windows from running correctly, you can start your computer in safe mode and then remove the program that is causing the problem.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Click the Start button
, click the arrow next to the Lock button
, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Do one of the following:
</span>
<ul>
<li><span>If your computer has a single operating system installed, repeatedly press the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears.
 If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again.</span> </li><li><span>If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8.</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press ENTER. For more information about options, see
Advanced startup options (including safe mode).</span> </li><li><span>Log on to your computer with a
user account that has administrator rights.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words Safe Mode in the corners of the display. To exit safe mode, restart your computer and let Windows start normally.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Advanced startup options (including safe mode)</span></b></p>
<p><span>The Advanced Boot Options menu lets you start Windows in advanced troubleshooting modes. You can access the menu by turning on your computer and pressing the F8 key
 before Windows starts.</span></p>
<p><span>Some options, such as safe mode, start Windows in a limited state, where only the bare essentials are started. If a problem does not reappear when you start in safe
 mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device
drivers as possible causes. Other options start Windows with advanced features intended for use by system administrators and IT professionals. For more information, go to the

<p><b><span>What are the system recovery options in Windows&nbsp;Vista?</span></b></p>
<p><span>The System Recovery Options menu in this version of Windows contains several tools that can help you recover Windows from a serious error. You can perform repairs
 to the files that Windows uses to start itself, perform a restore operation using System Restore, and restore your entire computer and system files using backups that you have made previously.</span></p>
<p><span>The System Recovery Options menu is on the Windows installation disc. (The menu might also be installed on your
hard disk if your computer has preinstalled recovery options.)

<p><b><span>To reinstall Windows</span></b></p>
<p><span>If you want to reinstall Windows with a clean installation—possibly to restore the default Windows settings—here's how to do it. (If you're having a problem with Windows,
 first see What to do if Windows won't start correctly, which explains how to use the Windows installation disc to fix problems without completely reinstalling Windows.)</span></p>
<p><b><span>Warning</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Back up your files before you begin reinstalling Windows, even if you're reinstalling Windows on a hard disk partition. A clean installation replaces the current
 version of Windows and also erases all personal files.</span></li></ul>
<ol>
<li><span>Turn on your computer, insert the Windows&nbsp;Vista DVD or CD, and then restart your computer. If you are asked to press a key to start (or "boot") from DVD or CD, press
 any key. When the Install Windows page appears, go to step 2.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If the Install Windows page does not appear and you're not asked to press a key to start from a CD or DVD, you might have to specify that your computer use its
 DVD or CD drive as the startup device. This means that you need to set the DVD or CD drive to the first startup device in the basic input/output system (BIOS). To learn how to do this, see
Start Windows from a CD or DVD. After you have selected your DVD or CD drive as the startup device, restart your computer, and then start Windows from the installation DVD or CD as previously described.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>On the Install Windows page, follow any instructions that might appear, and then click Install now.</span>
</li><li><span>On the Get important updates for installation page, we recommend getting the latest updates to help ensure a successful installation and help protect your computer
 against security threats. You will need an Internet connection to get installation updates.</span>
</li><li><span>On the Type your product key for activation page, we strongly recommend that you type your 25-character product key to help avoid problems during activation.
</span></li><li><span>On the Please read the license terms page, if you accept the license terms, click I accept the license terms.</span>
</li><li><span>Follow the instructions on each page. On the Which type of installation do you want? page, click Custom.</span>
</li><li><span>On the Where do you want to install Windows? page, click Drive options (advanced). Select the partition where you want to install Windows, and then click Format.
 This erases all files on the selected partition, so you can install Windows on a clean partition.</span>
</li><li><span>When the format is complete, select the partition you just formatted as the place where you want to install Windows, and then click Next to begin the installation.
 You might see a compatibility report.</span> </li><li><span>Follow the instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b></p>
<ol>
<ul>
<li><span>Be sure to enable existing, or install new, antivirus software after the installation is complete.</span></li></ul>

            Hey DavidMCandy,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your help!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I heard about the winsxs thing here, where you would delete the pending.xml file because that may be whats causing it to get stuck?:</div>
<div><br />
<div>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-windows_update/latest-vista-update-stuck-in-stage-3restart-loop/2f70b13c-9db4-4bf9-90ee-7ca63a809973</div>
<div><br />
<div>----------------------------------</div>
<div><br />
<div>It won't allow me to boot into regular safe mode unfortunately, doing so restarts the loop.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just tried booting into safe mode with command prompt, it started listing a bunch of stuff on the screen, screen went black, the Windows Vista logo popped up and now it's at the "Configuring updates: State 3 of 3 - 0% complete. Do not turn off your computer."
 screen again, then restarts the computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>----------------------------------</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is what I can do:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Start the computer - press F12 - Select a Boot First device menu - select USB-CDROM - press any key to continue booting from CD or DVD - black screen with loading bar that says "Windows is loading files…" - green loading bar with © Microsoft Corporation
 underneath…</div>
<div><br />
<div>Install Windows screen comes up (select English / US stats and click next) - Windows Vista logo with Install Now button screen is up. I don't necessarily want to install, so I click the button "Repair your computer" instead.</div>
<div><br />
<div>System Recovery Options window comes up and I select the Windows Vista operating system with 466643 MB partition size and (C:) OS Location then click next…</div>
<div><br />
<div>It says "Startup Repair is checking your system for problems…"</div>
<div>Took a while, now it says "Restart your computer to complete the repairs."</div>
<div>I clicked on "Click here for diagnostic and repair details" and it says something like this:</div>
<div>- number of repair attempts: 1</div>
<div>- session details:</div>
<div>System Disk \Device\Harddisk0</div>
<div>Windows directory = C:\Windows</div>
<div>AutoChk Run = 0</div>
<div>Number of root causes = 1</div>
<div><br />
<div>Tests Performed (won't type all of it unless you need it):</div>
<div>- Check for updates (Completely successfully.)</div>
<div>- system disk test (Completely successfully.)</div>
<div>- Disk Failure Diagnosis (Completely successfully.)</div>
<div>- Disk Metadata test (Completely successfully.)</div>
<div>- Target OS test (Completely successfully.)</div>
<div>- Volume content check (Completely successfully.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Root cause found:</div>
<div>System volume on disk is corrupt.</div>
<div>Repair action: File system repair (chkdsk)</div>
<div>Result: Completed successfully. Error code = 0x0</div>
<div>Time taken = 397226 ms</div>
<div><br />
<div>I then closed out of that window and clicked finish. It restarts, I see the DELL start up screen - &nbsp;black background with green loading bar with © Microsoft Corporation - black screen for some time - Windows Vista Logo - Configuring Updates: Stage 3 of
 3…then restarts. :(</div>
<div><br />
<div>----------------------------------</div>
<div><br />
<div>Another route I tried today:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Start the computer - press F12 - Select a Boot First device menu - select USB-CDROM - press any key to continue booting from CD or DVD - black screen with loading bar that says "Windows is loading files…" - green loading bar with © Microsoft Corporation
 underneath…</div>
<div><br />
<div>Install Windows screen comes up (select English / US stats and click next) - Windows Vista logo with Install Now button screen is up. I don't necessarily want to install, so I click the button "Repair your computer" instead.</div>
<div><br />
<div>System Recovery Options window comes up and I select the Windows Vista operating system with 466643 MB partition size and (C:) OS Location then click next…</div>
<div><br />
<div>5 Options here - I click System Restore - I click the last restore point, which is 3/11/2012 - Now a pop up comes up that says "The disk OS (C:) has errors. Windows has detected file corruption on OS (C:). You must check the disk for errors before it can
 be restored." (NOTE: This did not happen before. Last time I was able to go through all of the restores listed and they acted like they were working but had an end result of not). I clicked "Check the disk for errors" that is in blue. A box came up with checkmarks
 to "Automatically fix file system errors" and "Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors" - I checked them both and clicked start.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is taking a while, so let me submit this post before I lose it all. :) Will let you know what happens from here.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />

            Oh my gosh. So, it took a few hours but then a window came up saying it had fixed some things, basically that it was good to go (not something it had done before). I clicked on the last known system restore point and it seemed like things were working
 good. It was taking longer than usual so I figured it was a good thing. Finally it got to the point where it said "finalizing system restore" around 10 pm last night. I went to bed and left it on and it was still doing it this morning.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Just got home from work and it says the same thing as well! I think its stuck even though the loading bar is still moving but if I force shut down I'm afraid it might seriously mess something up. What should I do?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Still had other things I wanted to try that you suggested and never got a chance. X_X</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you!!</div>

            Thanks so much for your help again!!! I can't believe it, but when I restarted the computer after the restoring bar got stuck, my computer allowed me to log in! Now, I get a pop up though that says the system restore wasn't completed, click here to complete
 (something to that extent). It seems like everything is there like before. I haven't gotten the pop up again.

<h2>            &#34;class not registered&#34; message when opening mp3 and wav files.</h2>
                    <p>A Windows update took place a few days ago. </p>
<p>Since then when I try to open mp3 or wav files instead of opening in Window Media Player I get an error message: "class not registered".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I can still listen to these files by opening Window Media and dragging them onto the playlist.</p>
<p>How can I fix this?</p>

<p>My HP printer will print in color but no black. I changed the cartridge but that did not help. The printer is 18 mo old. Is this all the length I can expect from HP before it crashes? I will never buy another HP product.</p>

            <p>Outlook is only available as a paid item as part of one of the MS Office packages.&nbsp; Outlook Express no longer exists by that name and has morphed into Windows Live Mail, which is part of the free Windows Live Essentials 2012 package.&nbsp; You can get it at</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-home</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that you don't have to download the whole suite.&nbsp; The installer lets you choose what you want to download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This (and Outlook) work fine with Windows 8, but not with Windows RT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But perhaps a better approach is to try and find out why you cannot download attachments in the Win8 Mail App.&nbsp; Can you tell us what kind of a mail server you are connecting to?&nbsp; Is it an IMAP connection, or Hotmail, or GMail, or an Exchange server, etc.?</p>

            You will need to use a third party utility for that. The following article suggests some utilities you can use to rename a batch of files using different conventions.

                    <p>My xbox one elite controller is broken. When I&nbsp;play games it moves me on it's own and it can get annoying if I&nbsp;have to stand still somewhere. I tried going to the Repair Center but when I&nbsp;put in the Serial Number for the controller it says that you’re having troubles on your end but it works for my xbox serial number but not my controller. I want to get it repaired but I&nbsp;can’t &nbsp;add it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            GTA San Andreas</h2>
                    I downloaded the game from the Game Marketplace. I have an Xbox 360 and a 250g MS HDD and I've tried downloading and deleting numerous times and it still won't play!!! Why is Xbox promoting an original game for Xbox that is modified for the Xbox 360?!!!
 There is no help or support anywhere. Everything I read says the same thing and I meet the requirements. I just wasted $10 on Xbox points for a game I can't play!! Not to mention my valuable time trying to resolve this issue. Xbox is lacking in customer support
 and failing to explain why and how I can't play GTA San Andreas. But they took my money real quick and in BOLD letters NO REFUNDS!!! Thanks a lot. When this piece of crap breaks I'm buying a PS3. And I'm never downloading anything on the Marketplace again.
 At least at GameStop they will help you. Great Customer Service at GameStop. MS= NOT!!!!!

<p>I'm having this problem as well and it's very, VERY annoying. I get there are no refunds, but honestly when I can only watch the credits and press start to just have my screen freeze there is an issue.

<p>Hopefully this problem will get solved soon. I am willing to pay $10 for a game, but only if I can play the game!

<p>Hello Kristin,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting us. My name is Laura from Xbox Support Team.</p>
<p>I understand and I do apologize for the inconvenience if you are having issues playing a downloaded game.</p>
<p>Please try the following troubleshooting steps:</p>
<p>See if the game is corrupted:</p>
<p>From the Xbox Dashboard, go to Settings, and then select System.</p>
<p>Select Storage.</p>
<p>Select your hard drive or other memory device.</p>
<p>Select Games &amp; Apps.</p>
<p>Select the game that has the problem.</p>
<p>Look for a yellow warning symbol. This icon indicates that the game content is corrupted or incomplete.</p>
<p>Delete and then reinstall the game.</p>
<p>Also make sure that you have the recent dashboard update and that you have a hard drive on your console.</p>

<p>Well, that's frustrating </p>
<p>I understand glitches and such happen but the promotion for these games are on the 'Games' Main Page!
</p>
<p>Pretty sure I've gotten to the point where I just want my points back, I'll just go to 2nd hand game store and purchase it. I at least know that will work and the store will actually take care of me if it doesn't work.

<p>Something that usually helps with download issues...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delete it out of Games and Apps, go down to System Items, delete markeplace system data and rights database if they show up (may have both, one or none).</p>
<p>Back out to where it shows your harddrive, Y for device options, clear system cache.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could start trying to download here, but it wouldn't hurt to turn your console off and remove the harddrive, boot it up without it, shut it back off and put the harddrive back on.</p>
<p>Fixes some odd issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>I followed the email instructions that they sent me (see above), re-downloaded, and it is in working order now. I think there my have been something wrong with the original download. Was very frustrating, but glad it's in working order now.

<h2>            How to&#58; Reformat Hard drive</h2>
                    
<p>Have a Dell Dimension desktop pc and am wondering how to reformat (and wipe clean) my hard drive.&nbsp; All I have is a Windows Vista reinstallation disk, Drivers/Utlitities Disk and a Cyberlink PowerDVD disk.</p>
<p>Back in the day I remember having Reformatting disks, but I can't seem to find one for this PC that is 3.5 yrs old.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on how best to wipe the hard drive clean?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><span><span>Hello zen2882,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I completely agree with Michael Murphy, the best way to do is to contact Dell. However, if you have Windows Vista reinstallation disc you can clean
 install and wipe out data. Here is a link you can follow that will give you information on this:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-Vista#section_3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-Vista#section_3</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer the section ‘To reinstall Windows Vista’ and the section that talks about ‘Where do you want to install Windows?’ page, click Drive options
 (advanced). This will give you the options to format the existing drive.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> You will need a product key and will have to activate your
 Windows again after you complete the installation process. Also note that clean formatting the hard disk on your computer will delete all the data and files.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also I am thinking that you are already aware that performing a clean installation would wipe out all the data and programs installed on your computer.</span></span></p>

 you make any hardware/software changes to the computer after which the issue started?</span></p>
<p><span>The issue here seems to be with the hardware and the CMOS battery which is responsible for preserving the settings of the computer. I would suggest

                    I Have recently brought a Toshiba laptop with vista basic on and it shows limited or no connectivity when trying to connect to the internet. My old pc which is also a Toshiba but running XP connects to the same network perfectly. It connects to the internet
 as it should but the new laptop wont. Everytime i run the diagnostics it comes up with the IP address or the router needs resetting but have done both of these and still no luck. If anyone could help i would be very appreciative as i have a new laptop but
 have to use the old one to go on the net. Thanks Darren

<p>Hi roxiet,</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Are you able to burn DVD using windows application?</p>
<p><br />
As 123 copydvd is an third party program and we are not aware of its features and functions.<br />
<strong><br />
Try the steps mentioned in the one of the post in the 123copyDVD forum.</strong><br />
<a href="http://forum.123copydvd.com/?f=5&amp;m=16240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.123copydvd.com/?f=5&amp;m=16240</a></p>

<h2>            Can we create Password reset disk for more than one computer on same flash drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to put more than one password reset on a flash drive? I don't want to use separate flash drives for each computer if I don't have to.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Dough,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately we can only create Password Reset Disk for one computer on one Flash Drive. To create Password Reset Disk you may try these steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows Key + W.</strong></p>
<p>b. Type <strong>User Accounts </strong>in the <strong>search box </strong>and open User Accounts Window.</p>
<p>c. Your User Account will be displayed.</p>
<p>d. On the <strong>left side</strong> of the window, select <strong>Create a password reset disk</strong>.</p>
<p>e. Follow the instructions.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Controller acting weird</h2>
                    Recently my xbox controller has been heating by the d pad area, and it keeps vibrating for no reason. It also at first kept turning off after every 3 secs. But i changed batterys and it worked. But it still heats up and vibrates. This controller isn't
 even old. I can't find a solution no where. Does anyone have a solution.

<p>Hey there Cosmic, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are running into this problem with the controller. How long exactly have you had it? If it is under 90 days old then of course this controller should be in warranty and you can always set up a replacement order through the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Device Support </a>page. </p>
<p>Of course the controller should not be doing this, But if new batteries aren't working and the controller is still running into problems I would recommend looking for a replacement, Or of course
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contacting Xbox Customer Support</a> to see if there is anything to be done with this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps! </p>
