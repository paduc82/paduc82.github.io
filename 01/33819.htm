            Hi, I followed this thread and as advised, started a new one. That got a response stating to go to an existing thread. Here I am. Please please help!!!!
<div>I have typed this all once already and there was no submit button, clearly it's difficult to keep postng here from a phone... My PC is frozen!</div>
<div>Here's the problem. New four month old ACER &nbsp; Frozen as I presume it's trying to update but stuck in 'shutdown' . It's not that I 'don't like' the replies given above, it's that they're no use to me as my PC is frozen. I can't get beyond the start screen
 to the password page to access anything. I've tried switching off and on again, ctrl alt delete, nothing can break into it. It's holding me hostage for what it advises is 2 days!!! I work from home on this PC and have to get into it! Am desperate, will have
 to take it into john Lewis where I bought it if I can't get into it in the next hour. Please please tell me how to get into it to change the upgrade settings and use the thing! A fix needs to be something that doesn't require me going to troubleshooting or
 going to the right hand swipe panel for any settings, as I can't do these things, it's frozen!</div>

    <title>Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor - VIA Rhine II fast ethernet adapter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rd400guy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor - VIA Rhine II fast ethernet adapter</h2>
                    I'm currently running XP SP3 32 bit on AMD Athlon 64 machine, 2GB RAM. &nbsp;I'd like to upgrade to Windows 7 64 bit.<br />
<br />
I've read this: &nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/is-IS/windows7/help/upgrading-from-windows-xp-to-windows-7
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor - 64 bit version says 9 issues, 8 of which are software (Adobe, shockwave, .NET 1.1, etc.), but the one that makes me nervous is the VIA Rhine II Fast Ethernet Adapter driver needs to be updated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've run Belarc, and identified chipset as VT8237; so I downloaded the latest driver from here: &nbsp;http://www.via.com.tw/en/support/drivers.jsp, and got driver version 3.87a dated 5-May-2011.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I re-ran upgrade advisor, and it's still showing that I need to get the latest driver. &nbsp;<b>I have the latest driver,</b>&nbsp;using my CURRENT OS to pick.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Do I need to download the driver for the VT8237 selecting <b>Windows 7 </b>as the OS?</div>
                </div>

            <p>You need to download&nbsp;and save the Windows 7 driver for the VT8237.</p>
<p>After upgrading, you need to apply the driver. Until you install the Windows 7 driver after upgrading you will not be able to access the internet.</p>
<p>It would be wise to download and save any other Windows 7 drivers you might need for your system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The least expensive upgrade, assuming the offer is available where you are, would be to upgrade to Windows 8 at the launch discount price. You would need the Windows 8 drivers if you did that.</p>
<p>Since you want to move to 64-bit, you would need the boxed upgrade. If you have access to a 64-bit system you could purchase and download a 64-bit online upgrade on that system. The upgrade is not tied to the system on which it is downloaded.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 account hangs after log-in at black screen &#40;after Metro Skype local-to-Microsoft account conversion&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Last week I logged in to Skype Metro on my Windows 8.1 Dell XPS 12 for the first time (it has been installed for a while). I couldn't figure out how to log-in to Skype with my Skype account, as it was asking fora Microsoft.com
 account. I finally acquiesced and used my Microsoft account. After doing that, I noticed my Office apps were all logged into Skydrive, but hadn't realized I'd just converted my user account from local to Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to doing this, however, I was using the PIN feature to quickly log in to my local account for months. This didn't change after logging into Skype. I locked my computer and probably rebooted it a few times since, and
 the PIN worked fin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of days ago, I was repeatedly failing the&nbsp;<a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/DfyHFtf4zuw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">new Windows authentication of Chromes's "show password" feature</a>, by using
 my (old) local account's password (not realizing I was using a Microsoft account and should be entering
<em>that</em> password). After struggling with Chrome's authentication, I suspected it was the PIN and then deactivated the PIN and rebooted. At that point, with no PIN request, I saw my email address and Microsoft account picture in the login screen of windows.
 It was then that I realized the computer was using my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I did finally log in properly using Microsoft.com password (instead of a PIN), I got stuck at a black screen. I can move the mouse cursor, but that's it. CTRL-ALT-DEL gets me the menu with lock, switch user, etc. The
 Task Manager won't start, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've tried with no success:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can open a utilman.exe window and run a few commands like taskmgr, but not really sure what to do with that.</li><li>I can manage to log in to the account and get a running windows access in safe mode (using Shift-restart and the troubleshoot advanced options). But I can't do the refresh option - my system disk doesn't have 16G free to do the refresh option. I can' t
 free up that much. </li><li>System restore only had one recovery point, and it wasn't far enough back to before the Skype authentication.
</li><li>There's no way to unlink the Microsoft account in safe mode.</li><li>Windows easy transfer doesn't work under 8.1 (I would be happy to create a new account and transfer the data from the old).&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Is there a way to see "why" the normal login is hanging? Will system logging tell me something?<br />

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Troubleshooting startup problems can be difficult because every PC is set up differently. Drivers, conflicts with other programs, malware, and memory can all cause startup problems. Startup repair can detect and fix problems that prevent your PC from starting.<strong><br />
<br />
</strong>I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />

            <p>Hi Vijay - it's not a startup problem, but a log-in problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway,&nbsp;<span>I solved the problem as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
Created a new account that is a Microsoft Account</li><li>
Compared its characteristics to the ones of the broken account.
<ul>
<li>
In fact, there are two accounts corresponding to the MicrosoftAccount: a local one and a remote one (I admit I don't understand all the details)</li></ul>

After detailed comparison, I discovered that the local account of my broken Microsoft account was not in the local "Users" group, but was in Administrator and HomeUsers. Once I added Users to the account, it worked.</p>

                    We are visible and have no problem connecting on our computer, tablet, and phone, but our smart T.V. sees others but isn't visible to them and can't connect. I have already updated the T.V. s software. Any ideas?

    <title>Issues with HDMI audio feedback&#47;reverb - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> betadnb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with HDMI audio feedback&#47;reverb</h2>
                    
<p>First post here. I have a 4GB 360 slim. Since the update a few weeks ago I've been experiencing an issue with random audio feedback/reverb. This happens during game play - online or off - and while using Netflix. It happens about every 20 minutes and lasts
 for about 2 minutes. If it were constant I'd look at changing the HDMI cable, but with the cable being only a couple months old and the issue not being constant, I'm not even looking at that as a possibility. My Kinect is turned off and muted and the voice
 volume for the headset is turned down unless I'm using it. I have reattached the component cables and will test that after my daughter is done with her cartoons, but I really want to be using HDMI. Please give me some ideas of what might be going on here.</p>

            <p>I would recommend starting by disconnecting all peripherals (kinect, headset, etc) and then doing what you normally do. &nbsp;Add one piece back at a time until you start hearing this sound again.</p>
<p>When finished, post back with the order you added the items.<br /><br />However, right now I'm thinking it's going to be a conflict between the kinect and the headset.&nbsp; They should not be connected at the same time as they don't play well together.</p>

<p>You can try first two easy things. First try to power cycle your console (all info here:&nbsp;<strong>https://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console</strong>). Look if fixed. If doesnt fixed, you can try to do a
<strong>factory reset keeping all games and apps</strong>, this will refresh the operative system (all info here:&nbsp;<strong>https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults</strong>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If doesnt work, maybe could be more serious and could be some hardware issue, there I suggest too contact directly official xbox support through phone or chat here:&nbsp;<strong>http://support.xbox.com/contact-us</strong></p>

<h2>            BUG - &#34;US &#40;Qwerty&#41;&#34; keyboard is added automatically after reboot - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My current language setting is:</p>
<p>Language: English (United States)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And ONLY "Turkish Q (Qwerty)" is selected under "Keyboards" setting.</p>
<p>In other words I have removed "US (Qwerty)".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is whenever I restart my PC, "US (Qwerty)" is added automatically into "Keyboards" section as secondary option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried adding US and then removing it, but after restart it appears again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want any keyboard settings section in my taskbar, how can I permanently remove US option? Thanks.</p>

            Hi Ibrahim,
<br />
<br />Let us check the Registry to find the root cause. 
<br />
<br />Right click Start and click Run. 
<br />Type in regedit and press enter. 
<br />Then go to 
<br />Go to HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Keyboard Layout\Preload 
<br />Take a snip of the whole window and paste in the next reply.

<br />Note -  It is recommended that you create a backup of your registry before modifying so that if you commit some mistake, you will be able to restore - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756...</a>

            You should do following - 
<br />
<br />Right click on Windows Start &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin) 
<br />Copy and paste below and Enter in Powershell 
<br />Get-WinUserLanguageList 
<br />
<br />Now, you will get the languages which are installed. Make a note of language tag of the language which you want to retain. Let's say that this language tag is tr-TR. 
<br />
<br />Now, Copy and paste below and Enter in Powershell 
<br />Set-WinUserLanguageList tr-TR 
<br />
<br />This will make other languages disappear. (In case, you want to add again or other languages, you can add again from language settings)

<p>Dear Vijay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your effort, I've followed the instructions, restarted the PC, and now I have a third keyboard option :(</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea7522ed-8717-42bf-84a0-523d25ade45a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea7522ed-8717-42bf-84a0-523d25ade45a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The language and keyboard tuple should be:</p>
<p>Windows Language: en-US</p>
<p>Keyboard layout: Turkish Q keyboard</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows OS, is there a requirement that if language is selected as English (United States), "US keyboard" option is required to exist in keyboard language section in taskbar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>US Keyboard did not disappear although it does not show up in Windows settings. So I am not able to remove.</p>

</p><p>Microsoft destroyed everything that older Skypes was with p2p features and fast. Back in days Skype was a real software.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, while the classic Skype is still available, try using the classic version of Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the downloader link for the classic version: <em><a href="http://download.skype.com/msi/SkypeSetup_7.41.0.101.msi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="http://download.skype.com/msi/SkypeSetup_7.41.0.101.msi Ctrl+Click or tap to follow the link"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://download.skype.com/msi/SkypeSetup_7.41.0.101.msi</span></a></em>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with you about the version 8.x of Skype. It should be bug free and should have&nbsp;more functions available like what the classic version of Skype have before the classic version is discontinued.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be forwarding this thread to the developers department to help expedite the improvement of this new Skype version in the upcoming updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time in sharing your thoughts about the new version. This will help Skype's development team consider integrating more features and bug fixes to the new version.</p>

<p><span>The newest Skype&nbsp;program for Windows lacks functionality which has been commonplace in Skype and nearly every Internet-Based Instant Messaging application since their
 creation. It is unsatisfactory in every way imaginable to take a robust program like Skype and over-simplify it to the point where it bears no resemblance to its former utility. Care must be taken to not pursue these changes just for the sake of change&nbsp;or
 because it is fashionable. </span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>At
 the end of the day, the new program must have functionality that is either equal to or greater than the old program. Anything less is unacceptable. The shortcomings of this latest release are as follows (but not limited to):</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>1)
<strong>Lacks Compact Sidebar View</strong>: The compact sidebar view enables the user to manager their contacts in a concise, organized manner without wasting un-necessary space.
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>2)
<strong>Inability to pop-out individual messaging/call sessions </strong>(Related to above).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>3)
<strong>Excess white space/wasted space throughout User Interface</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Example: Dialer keypad is very large with excess white space/wasted space.
</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>Microsoft, Please consider your long time users when continuing development in the Skype 8.0 application or continue support of the well-established and industry standard
 Skype 7.0 Desktop program.</span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t enable or install .NET Framework 3.5 in Windows 8.1 PRO 64-bit</h2>
                    <p>I continually receive the message in a dialogue that<br />
<br />
"Windows couldn't complete the requested changes.<br />
<br />
The system cannot find the file specified.<br />
<br />
Error code: 0x80070002"<br />
<br />
I have not been able to find my way around it.&nbsp; Running on a 4770K system with fresh install, only user, and with Admin privileges, and usually running Command and many other programs as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Can't turn 3.5 on through Control Panel "Turn Windows features on or off", although .NET Framework 4.5 Advanced Services IS enabled.<br />
<br />
No success either, using installers provided with programs that require that version of .NET.&nbsp; As they do require it, I am hoping to get this resolved.<br />
<br />
No success with DISM method of scanhealth &amp; restorehealth, although these run OK.<br />
<br />
No success with DISM method to install from distribuion CD, mounted ISO, or folder Sources\sxs folder copied to hard drive (including using /LimitAccess switch).<br />
<br />
I haven't been able to figure out from looking at the DISM and CBS logs what might be missing.<br />
<br />
No success changing server or path in Administrative Templates, etc. regarding Windows Update, for installing components.<br />
<br />
No success from .NET full download or stub from Microsoft website.<br />
<br />
Microsoft's Windows Update fix-it tool doesn't come up with a solution, either, or point to the culprit with any useful detail.<br />
<br />
I've tried to be reasonably methodical in working this out, but I still don't seem to be getting anywhere.<br />
<br />
<br />
ANY SUGGESTIONS, PLEASE?</p>

</p>
<p>Extract this file using winrar.</p>
<p>Now run DISM command wih administrator privilege &nbsp;with extracted folder as a source path</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Lifecam - how to disable the blue LED&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Could anyone advise me how to disable the blue LED on my LifeCam (HD 3000)?<br />
<br />
I want to disable it for 3 reasons:<br />
<br />
1. It's EXTREMELY irritating.<br />
2. It serves no useful purpose.<br />
3. Above all, it's a huge security risk because most people will assume they can't be spied on when the light's off and are likely to leave it plugged in. But in reality, the light's not going to come on if a hacker is watching covertly. Hackers will just hack
 the firmware to override the light, and it is almost certain that Microsoft have backdoors in all their software and hardware in order to spy on their customers.</p>

</p><p>Yes, I think I'm going to have to do that, but it's not the most elegant solution. I also don't think webcams should be allowed to have lights because, as I said, it confuses people and makes them drop their guard when the light is off.<br />

<h2>            Win 10&#58; MS Store thinks I&#39;m in the US &#40;my Windows region is set to the UK&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Any ideas...? Not that it REALLY matters price-wise, as MS, like most tech companies, uses a parity rate which means we get a raw deal (I was looking at getting a new SurfaceBook, but the parity exchange rate makes it almost £1,000 dearer than if it was
 priced locally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does, obviously, mean that I'm seeing apps that aren't available here; taking music as an example, that rather means most of 'em (Pandora, i Heart Radio, Slacker, 8 tracks (which used to be up to a couple of years ago, and I miss it) and, of course, it
 could also mean that I'm not seeing apps that are available in Europe, but not the US/North America (if there are any).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a very, very, VERY long time since I used any version of Windows (I think the last one I used for any length of time was XP - YUCK!)</p>

            Why do you think it should be higher? Have you compared it to others with the same video card?<br />
<br />
Are you having performance issues?<br />
<br />
<br />
﻿The Windows Experience Index measures your hardware performance. If you want to dramatically increase the score you need to buy new/faster hardware (processor, RAM, video card, etc), or buy a high end computer. To increase your overall score you would need
 to upgrade the lowest rated component.<br />

            mine is a desktop and i've downloaded the latest driver. but there's no changes there too bad. hmm yap that's not the highend one, one thing that i concerned is my friend's graphical score is better, nah, i think there's something wrong with my graphic
 card or the driver itself<br />

    <title>Dell webcam central not snapping pictures - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Dell webcam central not snapping pictures</h2>
                    <p>Just recently noticed that my Dell Webcam central won't snap photos. The camera itself seems to be working, and it clicks when you click the button, but it doesn't take pictures. Also, the video side won't take videos either. Got this error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7be73f47-fa9b-49c8-895f-3777f07b1e54" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I like being behind the camera instead of in front of it, it's not that big an issue. And since I use it so rarely, I'm not sure how long it hasn't been working. It may extend back to when I first upgraded to windows 10. Just wondering if anyone would
 have any ideas about why it no longer snaps pictures.</p>

    <title>windows 10 apps broken - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alex_080  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 apps broken</h2>
                    <p>My computer was full of viruses and I was able to fix that but after running both malwarebytes and bytefence my apps do not open anymore. Things like weather and news don't open and the store, when it does open, says "no internet connection." I tried seeing
 if a firewall was blocking these apps but nothing was a problem there. When I would press the windows key I can see the news headline and weather but when I try to launch the apps they won't open. Would I have to do a system restore or reinstall windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit: I also uninstalled the weather and news app. Is there anyway I can get them back or did I just dig a deeper hole?</p>

<h2>            Xbox Live Rewards sem contabilizar pontos</h2>
                    
<p>Olá,</p>
<p>Quando acesso minha conta pelo console, sempre mostra os meus pontos da Live Rewards, porem nos emails que recebo ou ao consultar saldo e extrato pelo site, sempre estão zerados, acredito que minha conta nem está contabilizando os pontos por compra de jogos.</p>
<p>Sem o extrato não tenho como confirmar se ganhei pontos ou não pelas minhas compras.</p>
<p>Como faço pra tentar resolver meu problema?</p>
