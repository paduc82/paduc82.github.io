            Samsung does something different on each input of that TV. &nbsp;I do not have them memorized, but as an example, input one has CEC control, two is MHL, three is ARC, etc. &nbsp;If I recall correctly you need to use input 3 or 4 on that TV to avoid conflicts with
 many sources. &nbsp;

            <p>There is a reported issue with the docking station and the display port. Microsoft is still enquiring and as far as I know there is no solution still available. At least no one contacted me, but this could also be due to the fact I'm now waiting for more
 than five weeks for my Surface replacement to test...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It generally looks like there is a software issue. Which could have been solved in the meantime. Check for all updates and if possible use another adapter. The official service may also help you.<br />

<p>I have the same Samsung monitor. Cannot get full 3840x2160 resolution in any mode, any port, any cable type although connected with HDMI convertor, the control panel &gt; display &gt; screen resolution advises it is available. With HDMI, no matter the setting
 I get either and off frequency visual for a few seconds or nothing. M/S support says it is a Samsung issue. Samsung says is is a driver issue. Intel says the driver in the Pro 3 has been modified by M/S. All updates to the Pro 3 are installed as of today's
 date &amp; time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This ought to work best in display port mode but the high res doesn't even show up as an option. Running in 2560x1440 and wondering why I spent the extra $ on the 4K.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody know a better driver to install?</p>

            Here's the next thing up to attempt, although I plan to do this with our IT tech on site, standing by. The CD that came with the monitor purports to have additional drivers. Figuring that is not quite good enough, I've downloaded the driver pack from the
 Samsung web site hoping to get a later version. We'll try installing drivers to update the Intel hardware and see if this 1. works, and 2. fixes the issue. A bit difficult to use the CD with the Surface unless connected through an external device, but I don't
 trust enclosed CDs with software and drivers to be up to date with anything, anymore. I'll plan to post results, probably after 1st of the year to advise what happened. RM<br />

<p>Thanks for the tip. I obtained the adapter you describe and the Samsung U28D590D is now operating 3840x2160, True Color 32bit, 29Hz. StarTech adapter I had before just would not do the job. Refresh is a bit slow but not too noticeable and mouse control is
 acceptable. Still would like to be able to use Display port connection: miniDP to DP on the monitor as I think that might actually run at 60Hz, but, by golly, this does work to get the higher res. Using the Samsung as an extended desktop while the Surface
 stays in the dock as the primary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only issue now is when I switch locations and use another extended monitor. The Surface doesn't seem intelligent enough to know when another setting has been made for a different extended desktop/monitor. Poor thing gets confused and scatters my icons all
 kinds of places and doesn't know what screen to use to open a program. Trying to accommodate to it but it is annoying.</p>

</p><p>@ Maximilian P. thanks for the link, you are right I only get 29Hz despite the fact that my

<p>
</p><p><span>Two follow-up questions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Is there are real benefit to 60Hz vs. ~30Hz if I am not gaming on the system?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Your Picture-n-Picture comment is REALLY interesting.&nbsp; However when I tried to download the Intel video driver it says "not compatible" with my SP3.&nbsp; Is there a link on Intel's page that worked for you?</span></p>

            @Abizar: Just glad to know there are others working through this. May still attempt Samsung drivers and the DP connection if my IT guy thinks it's worth a try. I'm probably showing my age to say this but these kinds of issues remind me of hacking on original
 versions of MS DOS to get drivers to make hardware function. The more things change...

<p>La consola no posee ninguna modificación de ningun tipo, aparte que me la han mirado antes de comprarla. Alguna solución?</p>

<p>Saludos</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;al parecer la persona que te vendio la consola te vendio una que ya estaba baneada por alguna infraccion contra xbox, pueden ser muchos los motivos del baneo. una vez baneada la consola asi se queda no hay vuelta para atras, lo que puedes hacer es ir
 con la persona que te la vendio y te devuelva tu dinero ya que en esa consola nunca te vas a conectar a xbox live, mejor compra tu consola en tiendas establecidas asi nunca tendras este tipo de problemas.</p>

    <title>NVIDIA dGPU is rendering certain apps with black screens - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raj shah_1976  say:</h3>
<h2>            NVIDIA dGPU is rendering certain apps with black screens</h2>
                    <p>When assigning certain applications to use the dGPU, I'm getting a black screen. &nbsp;It's clear the application is running, as I'm getting audio, the mouse cursor changes, but the application is not rendering the screens. &nbsp;If I switch back to using the intel
 integrated chipset, the app renders correctly. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is consistent behavior (i.e.. opening the application in a certain chip set always gives the same result). &nbsp;Not all apps do this though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Black screen using NVIDIA dGPU:</p>
<p>- Wunderlist (desktop not metro app)</p>
<p>- The Elder Scrolls Online</p>
<p>- Sword Coast Legends</p>
<p>- Adobe Photoshop</p>
<p>- Adobe Illustrator</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the above work when using the intel chipset</p>
<p>
</p><p>No black screen on the NVDIIA dGPU</p>
<p>- Microsoft Outlook</p>
<p>- Star Wars Online</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is all on stock drivers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have rebooted, I have unistalled the nvidia driver and let Windows reinstall install it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Update: Disabling the Intel HD Graphics 520 device from the Device Manager and then launching the applications actually works (the apps launch and render). I need to test this further to verify the apps actually are stable and work, but it's progress &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Update 2: Apps are highly unstable. &nbsp;It looks like the NVIDIA dGPU isn't actually being used, just a generic windows device. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Raj,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm actually having exactly the same problem as you - I can't seem to run any applications properly using the nVidia dGPU, I keep getting just a black screen. I even tried the same OpenGL test applications you mentioned and this produces the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you found a solution for this issue? I am considering getting a replacement device, but want to make sure that there isn't a fix before I go through the hassle of exchanging my model for a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Hi Andrew</p>
<p>Unfortunately no resolution on this end. I brought it into a Microsoft store over the weekend and had an orange shirt look at it. We reinstalled Windows 10 in place and updated all the drivers and I'm still getting the same behaviors&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The orange shirt's opinion is that because some things work using the dGPU and some don't, this is likely a software/driver issue that Microsoft has to catch up with, not a hardware issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked him if he had a comparable machine in the store we could test the apps on that were failing for me, but he said the machines were locked down and he couldn't install new software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do return your machine and the new one works correctly, please let me know. I have been hesitant to send mine back due to the impact not having my computer will make on my life =)</p>

<p>Did as you suggested. Downloaded MSI version etc etc. boot boot. Driver does not appear in Device manager, only Other devices/ Unknown device/Video Controller (VGA Compatible). Downloaded zip file separately. What is the right .inf file? How will I be able
 to use this file. It looks like I lost the software for this Intel 520 driver!&nbsp; Thanks for any help!</p>

            <p>Richard,</p>
<p>You have two options. &nbsp;Open device manager, If you see a generic device there, then choose "update driver" or &nbsp;"install driver" or whatever. &nbsp;On the next screen, select "Browse my computer" and then select the root folder of where you unzipped the 4/19 driver
 zip file. &nbsp;It should find the driver this way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 2: Per the readme of the zip file, I believe the driver is in&nbsp;Drivers\Display\Graphics and called&nbsp;64gh4409.inf You should be able to right click it and install. &nbsp;If that doesn't work, look in the readme file the other drivers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this doesn't work, I would open a new thread on this board that's titled appropriately so you can get the right attention</p>

<p>Hi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you chose to cancel our turn off auto renew as they are different options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cancel would do the subscription straight away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you just turned off auto renew but if still cancelled it, you should have a chat with Xbox Support here support.xbox.com/contact-us choosing account in step 1 then Other in the next step for the chat option to appear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Recurring billing is a tricky thing to turnoff and you can do it easier in the Microsoft account site. Maybe you tried to do this and cancelled the subscription instead, although it does seem strange, theg usually prevent you from.doing that and keep in
 your acvount whats left time wise. Contact support I'm sure they will help you

<h2>            Windows 7 display problems</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my computer to Windows 7 from Vista. Now I am having display problems. These problems did not occur when I had Vista on the computer, they only started after I upgraded to Windows 7. The picture gets difficult to read, there are random
 lines throughout the screen. Has anyone else had similar problems after upgrading?

<br />
Here are the usual methods to resolve this issue:<br />
<ul>
<li>Reboot the machine with your Windows Repair CD, then use System Restore to set Windows back by a few days (works only if the problem occurred recently).</li><li>Log on under an alternative admin account, then reset the password to your usual account (works only if you set up an alternative admin account).</li><li>Log on as Administrator in Safe Mode, then reset the password to your usual account (the password is usually blank).</li><li>Insert your USB flash disk with the password keyfile (works only if you took the time to create such a keyfile).</li><li>Check your paper records (works only if you jotted down the password somewhere)</li></ul>

 then another restart and then 'undoing changes' kinda thing. HOW TO ENABLE LINUX INSTALLATION FROM STORE?!&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Steps followed so far---</p>
<ol>
<li>Re-installed Windows, 100% clean. Still nothing.</li><li>&nbsp;Created another user account, no help.</li><li>&nbsp;Deleted theme, reset Windows Store, and store cache too. NO HELP!&nbsp;</li></ol>

                    I'd like to know how to configure Windows(7) &nbsp;media player to not automatically start playing a cd when it is inserted into the cd drive.&nbsp; I've changed the autoplay setting but this doesn't seem to stop the cd from starting if windows media player is already
 open when the disc is inserted.

            <span>Media player stops current playback and starts playing media from a CD/DVD when inserted.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
This isn't Autoplay that is disabled and this only happens if Media player is actually open at the time&nbsp; There doesn't seem to be a switch on the Options menu to control this behavior. &nbsp;How do I turn it off?</span>
<br />
<br />
a few weeks ago i was listening to music i was backing up old avi files that i had on several disks that i had made of my lad over the last couple of years
<br />
<br />
the intention was to copy the files to a flashdrive <br />
<br />
but every time i inserted a disk Media player would decide that if i had inserted the disk i must want to watch whats on it and stop listening to Music&nbsp;...... and thats not what i want to do
<br />
<br />
i have set Autoplay to open mixed media files so that i can choose the files i want&nbsp;but&nbsp;the&nbsp;autorun feature in Win 7 chooses to play a disk regardless of what i am doing at the time&nbsp;is not what i want
<br />
<br />
This does not happen on Vista with MP11 Media Player 11 so there must be a way to stop it on Media Player 12<br />
<br />
Just because i insert a disk into the Drive that has MP3's or Avi's etc that <strong>
Does not mean that i want to play them</strong> and the inability to stop media player doing that is madness<br />
<br />
<br />
again please understand this is not the Autoplay or Autorun feature i have disabled those in every manner possible and this still occurs but only if Media player is open at the time<br />
<br />
there is more in this thread here<br />

<br />
but the answers we get is that its Autoplay or Autorun and it is not the issue here&nbsp;

            I saw this and used funman1's suggestion (in <strong>BOLD</strong> below), but with a little difference ( I have Win 7 HP):<br />
<br />
<strong>Start&gt;All Programs&gt;Default Programs&gt; Set Your default Programs and then&gt; <br />
Change Autoplay Settings.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>This works for me<br />
<br />
</strong>I was able to change mine by:<br />
<br />
<em>Start&gt;All Programs&gt;Default Programs&gt;Change AutoPlay settings&gt;</em> then selected each option for Audio-Enhanced-DVD movie..etc etc.
<br />
<br />
Fixed my problem of a music CD starting up everytime something was put in the CDRom. I changed my settings to TAKE NO ACTION.

Like i said all my auto play options are already set to Take no action they are all disabled ....all of them
<br />
<br />
auto-play is totally disabled this is not Autoplay its something in MP12 this is something else trying to be helpful and failing
<br />
<br />
there is no setting in the auto-play section that will stop this particular issue for me and the others that have this problem
<br />
<br />
thanks for the reply though<br />
<br />
currently i am using media centre and when i insert a music disk media centre does nothing if i am watching a film try that with MP12 and the music will start to play and stop the film no matter what

            First off thanks to David Turner &amp; Mr Cairo for a; helping to highlight this issue and b; stopping me going insane.<br />
<br />
First off the first thing I do when I install a system is disable all Autoplay, so that was never the issue.&nbsp; If I put a disc in I know what I'm doing with it I don't need the PC to decide for me.&nbsp; Leave that for Mac users!<br />
<br />
Secondly having discovered the idea of Autorun, I tried disabling that following Vijay KKS's instructions, again no joy.<br />
<br />
Finally I have to install WMP 11 (which was a complete joke as MS are so sure that WMP 12 is perfect they do not allow the installation of WMP 11 on Windows 7.&nbsp; I had to use this one
<a href="http://devrexster.googlepages.com/wmp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://devrexster.googlepages.com/wmp</a> )<br />
<br />
Downside is I now have no Windows Media Center, as that was disable along with the original turning off of WMP 12. (<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7music/thread/dd264fd7-3bb9-4dc1-af24-bc33692b58ee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7music/thread/dd264fd7-3bb9-4dc1-af24-bc33692b58ee</a>
 )<br />
<br />
The sooner MS admits this is a problem and fixes it, the better.&nbsp; Aside from this I love 7 but this is a major issue.

            I'm glad to see it isn't just me that is having this problem.<br />
<br />
It's disheartening to see that the MS representative on the other thread didn't seem to understand the problem even though it was explained perfectly and coherently.<br />
<br />
It's quite obviously a feature (or perhaps bug?) of WMP12. I expected there to be an option in the software regarding how it deals with inserted media during playback but alas there's nothing. I don't want to revert to WMP11 because other than this it's very
 good. I'll just have to use an alternative like Winamp when I'm using DVDs/CDs as storage options or make sure WMP12 is maximised before inserting a disc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If I <strong>insert a CD or DVD</strong> when I'm playing music or video<strong> from my hard drive</strong> WMP12
<strong>STOPS PLAYBACK</strong> and begins playing a file on the disc (whether it be audio or video) but
<strong>ONLY IN THE MINIATURE 'NOW PLAYING' MODE</strong> . <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
When the player is in full-size 'LIBRARY' mode it's absolutely fine</span> . This illustrates that is is
<strong>NOT AN ISSUE WITH AUTORUN OR AUTOPLAY</strong> but an issue with WMP12.<br />
<br />
Now, it's not terrible, it's workable but slightly irritating and a very unusual change indeed.<br />
<br />
Does everyone agree with this? Anything to add?

            Thank you guitarsareboring for stating this problem clearly, and for discovering that playback is not interrupted if WMP is in Library Mode.&nbsp; Bizarre but true.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I agree, this is annoying.<br />
<br />
Most annoying possible scenario:&nbsp; I'm playing MP3s at a party.&nbsp; I pop in a CD for some reason.&nbsp; CD spins up... oops, dancing stops and everyone stares at me&nbsp;while I figure out where my MP3s went.<br />
<br />
Please fix this, MS!

            Hi Adrian, the process is different, depending on what exactly you are doing . . .
<br />
<br />Is there a version of Windows already installed on your PC, if so which one?
<br />
<br />Do you want to clean install Windows 10 Pro from the start, or are you upgrading to Windows 10 Pro

<h2>            Phone call regarding Microsoft updates</h2>
                    I have just been called by what sounded like an overeas technical firm claiming that my computer has not been receiving automatic updates. This sounded like a scam so I put the phone down. Anyone else had a similar experience? I note that my computer has
 indeed not received an update since 24th April but that it was checked this morning and indicates that there are no new updates available at this time. I am puzzled. I have never had this before. Has anyone else had a similar call?

            <p>Hello winhornby,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly this is one of the many Microsoft Windows scams that is circulating. You were wise to put the phone down on these people. All they basically want is access to the personal data on your PC, i.e., passwords, bank details etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to set the record straight, Microsoft will not contact you regarding problems with your PC UNLESS you have entered into a pre-paid support contract with them.

<h2>            MGADiag tool says Validation Unsupported OS</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some person is auditing if my system has a genuine windows 10 or not. I'm pretty sure that it is a genuine version that came preloaded with my machine but the mentioned person keeps using this 'MGADiag' tool to check if the OS is valid or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 10 and I always see `Validation unsupported OS` instead of `Genuine`.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried searching a lot for this tool for windows 10 but only found the ones for windows 7.</p>
<p>Can someone please provide me a link to the version of this tool that windows 10 supports?</p>

            Yes, it's clearly activated.  
<br />
<br />What's happened is it's taken the embedded Product Key in BIOS and added a Digital License in MS Activation servers so it should auto-reactivate if you ever reinstall or change out hardware up to the motherboard which will lose the license if replaced.
<br />
<br />This makes it doubly sure you're covered.  You can even read the embedded Product Key by installing and running ProduKey and lookng for OEM-BIOS key, although you shouldn't need it with the DL.  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a>
<br />
<br />To find out what's running mgadiag I'd go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most through way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Same thought for Vista or 7: Run msconfig.exe, and check the Boot tab. &nbsp;What appears there? &nbsp;You should be able to decrease the timeout value there, or remove a spurious entry altogether.

                    <p><span>I updated Java and saw that about 350 gb of my apps are missing from my PC. They include almost all my games. You see… I didn’t want to update but had problems with watching a presentation using Adobe connect.&nbsp;</span><span>All

            Hello Phoenix, hope this message finds you well.
<br />
<br />Your apps can be automatically deleted only in the case if the hard disk had damaged sectors. You didn’t delete these files intentionally so I suppose that your hard disk has bad sectors. To fix this problem I recommend that you use a utility called Disk Defragmenter. It rearranges files so that the reading speed of your hard drive would increase.
<br />Please, follow the link for further instructions: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026701/windows-defragment-your-windows-10-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402670...</a>
<br />Your problem cannot be caused by updating Java, on the contrary, it helps them to run smoothly.
<br />____
<br />Steve

            Hi Phoenix.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />See if you can System Restore to a point before this happened:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is another reason I would not offload apps to another drive, which only leads to problems.  They should remain on C where they integrate themselves into the registry and become a part of it's image.  If you need space then offload the User folders which are the only ones not impacted by the speed difference between an SSD and HDD.  Then when you need to restore the C drive with a System Image the programs are all still functional and files are current (not dated with the image) and safe in their separate partition vault.  
<br />
<br />Since Java is an infection path, run full scans with the most powerful on-demand free scanners Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner: 
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a>.  
<br />
<br />Clean up anything they find, restart PC and then run both scans again until they come up clean.  
<br />
<br />Then check for damaged System Files:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />If it cannot repair them see Step 10 here to continue:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
