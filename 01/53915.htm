<h2>            I am stuck in an infinite &#34;preparing automatic repair&#34; loop in 8.1</h2>
                    So here's my story. Last Thursday, I was an idiot and ran a program that was built into&nbsp;8.1(I believe that it was called Windows Memory Diagnostics, but I am not 100% sure), and my laptop got stuck in an infinite "preparing automatic repair" loop. I got
 my laptop back in Windows 7, upgraded to 8, and then got 8.1 through the Marketplace. No, it doesn't have a disc drive, if you were wondering. I tried all of the other methods I found online, but none worked. I tried "refreshing", but it said that the drive
 was locked. Also, somehow, when I had left my laptop on all night Friday, when I woke up on Saturday, it was back to normal, but then a few hours later, I got trapped in the loop again. Anybody have any idea on how to fix it? I have files on their that I NEED
 to access by Wednesday.<span><br />

<h2>            Password-protected Sharing in Windows 7 Exposes the C&#58;&#92;Users&#92;Username folders &#40;and files&#41; to others if Public Folders are shared.</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings to all,<br />
<br />
I've tried sharing files in Windows 7 with a computer running XP over a Home network. These are some of<br />
my finding and CONCERN over the files that are actually being shared if Public Folders Sharing is turned ON<br />
in Windows 7.<br />
<br />
I will refer the computer running on Win 7 as Comp A<br />
and the on running on XP as Comp B for the rest of the entry<br />
<br />
In the <em>Advanced Sharing Settings </em>on Windows 7 I've made these changes<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE: C:\Users\Username is an ADMINISTRATOR Profile on Comp A (running Win 7).<br />
</strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Case 1<br />
<br />
</span>In Home or Work (which is my current profile)<br />
<br />
i) I've turned Public Folder sharing ON<br />
<br />
ii) Password Protected Sharing sharing is turned OFF<br />
<br />
Both Comp A and Comp B has been set to the SAME Workgroup name<br />
<br />
Everything is fine, I can view all the network computers on both PC's although I've<br />
have to run a search on Comp B to find Comp A.<br />
<br />
What I can see on Comp B (running XP) are&nbsp;ONLY the Public Folders of Comp A (Win 7)<br />
OK, Good.....it's the expected behavior. BUT......<br />
<br />
There is a PROBLEM if <em><strong>Password Protected Sharing </strong>is turned </em>
<strong><em>ON</em> in Win 7<br />
</strong>as explained in Case 2<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Case 2<br />
</span>i) Public Folder sharing is still turned ON<br />
but<br />
ii) Password Protected Sharing is turned ON<br />
<br />
When I did this, I was prompt for a Username and Password (on Comp B) when I tried<br />
to view the files on Comp A. So I keyed in the Username and Password of Comp A in Comp B
<br />
and I can gain access to the files shared on Comp A. <br />
Here is where the "NIGHTMARE" begins!!!!<br />
<br />
I've noticed that not only the Public Folders (in Comp A) and be accessed, but the<br />
C:\Users\Usersname Folder and every folder and files in it is EXPOSED to Comp B.<br />
Though some files cannot be accessed but I some files CAN be ACCESSED (e.g. files in the DOWNLOAD folders<br />
and DESKTOP).<br />
<br />
What is happening here: Shouldn't ONLY the PUBLIC Folders be shared?????? <br />
Even with the Username and Password, that does not mean that I want all my PERSONAL<br />
folders to SHARED by DEFAULT (if the person has my Password).<br />
This was not the case in Vista... (which was GREAT)<br />
<br />
So this lead me to do some ivestigation on the Properties of the C:\Users\Username folder on Comp A.<br />
This&nbsp;are my findings and it's very SUPRISING and WORRYING and CONFUSING indeed.<br />
<br />
i) By selecting the C:\Users\Username Folder and checking the <strong>STATUS BAR&nbsp;<br />
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; there is <strong>NO indication</strong> that the folder is SHARED (meaning windows 7 is telling that it's NOT SHARED)<br />
<br />
ii) Selecting the C:\Users\Public folder and checking the Status Bar, there IS a indication:&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; State:Shared and also Shared With:XXXX (meaning windows 7 is telling that it's SHARED)<br />
<br />
So, the JACKPOT question here is:<br />
If, C:\Users\Username folder in Comp A is NOT SHARED, WHY IS IT that it CAN BE ACCESSED in Comp B ?????<br />
<br />
FURTHER investigation revealed this:<br />
<br />
By Right-Click on C:\Users\Username, Click Properties, Sharing Tab<br />
The indication here is that&nbsp;C:\Users\Username is&nbsp;SHARED complete with a Network Path.<br />
(wished I can give a SCREEN SHOT here&nbsp;showing the DIFFERENT&nbsp;STATUS&nbsp;in the STATUS BAR and SHARING TAB&nbsp;under the Folder Properties)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So the 2nd JACKPOT question is:<br />
Is C:\Users\Username SHARED or NOT SHARED in Windows 7???<br />
<br />
I've tried turning OFF the sharing but it's NOT successful if the Public Folder is shared.<br />
What I did is to manually UN-SHARE the WHOLE C:\Users folder in Windows 7 (just to be safe)<br />
and share my folder from some other location(s).<br />
<br />
Hope Microsoft will FIX this ASAP as many of us will be caught unaware that our PERSONAL files are
<br />
EXPOSED if PASSWORD PROTECTED SHARING is TURNED ON in Win 7<br />
<strong>&nbsp;(as most of us will think it will be MORE SECURED by using a PASSWORD and not the other around: EXPOSING our PERSONAL files unawared)<br />
</strong><br />

            you have a a few issues here..<br />
1 create a non administrator user and try again and you find it work the way it should.<br />
2. if you log in to any windows computer as administrator in any share then by defaule you can go to the hidden drive shares and see the whole drive<br />
for example<br />
map to share user with administratior/password get in then do a<br />
map z: = //computername/c$ and you be at root of the computer c drive&nbsp;<br />
map y: = //computername/d$ and you be at root of the computer&nbsp;d drive<br />
that becasue you using an Administrator Account - this will not working&nbsp; as a&nbsp;non - adminstrator account<br />
<br />
by the way you can just map to the hidden share as administrator any time<br />
<br />

            @JAYTF<br />
<br />
To cut the long story short I'm not sure what Microsoft did WRONG with the DEFAULT settings for&nbsp; sharing PUBLIC folders in Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Prob: Sharing C:\Users\Public folder AUTOMATICALLY shares the WHOLE C:\Users folder.<br />
<br />
Yes I know if u check , the C:\Users\Username folder is shown as: i) NOT SHARED in STATUS BAR but ii) SHARED if you right-click
<br />
and check the sharing properties<br />
<br />
IF you go to the computer management by right-click on Computer Icon -&gt; Manage<br />
The WHOLE C:\User folder is actually shared.<br />
<br />
This WAS NOT the case with XP or VISTA<br />
<br />
Sharing the C:\Users\Public or C:\Document and Settings\Public folder does not AUTOMATICALLY share it's PARENT directory<br />
and this should be the case.<br />
<br />
You don't want to share any files WITHOUT YOU KNOWING don't you?<br />
<br />
The WEIRDEST thing of all usually the sharing permission is inherited by the CHILD FROM PARENT and NOT PARENT FROM CHILD.<br />
<br />
IN window 7 for this case it's the PARENT FROM CHILD. CHILD: C:\Users\Public , PARENT: C:\Users<br />
<br />
<br />
Anywhere I've found the solution BUT i must remember to check this everytime I share files just to be SAFE and SURE.<br />
<br />
I just go to the Computer Management as mentioned about and unshare the&nbsp; C:\Users folder from there.<br />
<br />
This way only the C:\Public folder remained shared but not the WHOLE C:\Users folder...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

            JimmyLeo, I recently found the same problem, and was amazed such a simple error had been overlooked. No matter how I tried to share Public without sharing my entire directory, I couldn't work it out, but I finally found the solution.<br />
<br />
Your idea of going through Computer Management and unsharing Users meant unsharing Public as well, but if you right-click in some blank space in that management window and select Add Share, the wizard allows you to share Public without sharing Users as well.<br />
<br />
I really hope this major oversight hasn't caused too much grievance to Win7 users.<br />

<p><span>I have notice this same Issue but I want to through a couple of informational facts in here.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
1-&nbsp; With Microsoft and&nbsp;many other OS's and NOS's&nbsp;inherited rights are always assumed.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example - If I share the root of the C: drive - everything on the c: whether they are marked as shared or not&nbsp;is in fact shared.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the root of the issue&nbsp;is that when you&nbsp;enabled Pubic Folder sharing Windows 7&nbsp;do not&nbsp;enabled the public folder but&nbsp;\users folder.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Public Folders are stored&nbsp;in a folder called "public" in the&nbsp;\Users directory.&nbsp; The net effect is that EVERY - USERS&nbsp;folder is Shared&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when you "enable"&nbsp;sharing public &nbsp;through the network and sharing center. <br />
<br />
<br />
2-&nbsp; There was comment made about not wanting your personal files and folders shared even if you share the public folder and given your user ID and password.&nbsp; Frankly, EVEN if this worked correctly and it does NOT, if you have a concern about this, you should
 never share your user id and Password EVER - all someone needs is a few second directly in front of your computer with the password and ID you have given them to get to those files.&nbsp;&nbsp;It does&nbsp;not take much, they already have to be close&nbsp;for you to share the
 files, one visit to&nbsp;the john and&nbsp;files are quickly copied to a flash drive!&nbsp; - &nbsp;Solution create a different ID or an id for each person who you need to share with this should be a non-admin user.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a little more that you need to truly make sure your
 file are truly protected but that‚Äôs for another day.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Since, I brought up the&nbsp;adding of users ids&nbsp;and password -&nbsp;I want to comment on JayTF's &nbsp;reply it does&nbsp;not matter&nbsp;if the users is an&nbsp;admin user&nbsp;or not.&nbsp; &nbsp;The&nbsp;sharing permissions granted through the&nbsp;Networking and Sharing center when "Turn on&nbsp;Public Folder Sharing"&nbsp;is
 enabled grants "everyone" full access to the \users directory. SO every user has full access to the&nbsp;every&nbsp;folder under the \users directory -&nbsp;including the public folder&nbsp;as well as folders and files for any other user that has been added to that computer or
 domain.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
My findings do not support Jimmyleo either - The parent inherent from the child - Only the parent (c:\users) has been shared&nbsp;maybe that has been fixed with a patch and I do not see it today.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So the sum this up.. <br />
If through the networking and sharing center, Change Advanced sharing setting, for Public Folder share&nbsp;you enable ‚Äúturn on so anyone with network access can read and read in the public folders‚Äù<span>&nbsp;
</span>is Shares the %root%\users folder and grant share permission to Everyone with full access.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>This not only grants access to the public folders but all the folders for all the users on that computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is not just administrative users the have this access, it truly sets everyone with full access.
</span></p>
<p><span>To make the issue worse, if you turn off public folder sharing through the network and sharing center it does nothing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The share of the %root%\users and the permissions all remain..<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<span>Surly this is not the intended or proper functions.
<br />
<br />
The work around for this simply do not use, ever, the network and sharing to enable public folder share.. do it either through fsmgmt.msc.&nbsp;
<br />
or go old school drill down through the drive to the specific folder you wish to share - right click go to properties --&gt; sharing tab --&gt; Advanced sharing button --&gt; &nbsp; Click share this folder --&gt; add the permissions for the appropriate users and apply.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
IF you have already enable public folder sharing through the network and sharing center - you will need to follow that old school method to un-share the user directory.&nbsp;</span>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Share Permissions and NTFS Permissions combine to give you the effective permission.&nbsp; So if "Everyone" has full access to share C:/Users it doesn't really mean that they have full control permission on all files in Users directory, the local NFTS permissions
 further restrict access to files/folders same way as if you were accessing locally.
<br />
<br />
When joining a Homegroup and/or enable PUBLIC folder sharing, Windows 7 automatically gives "Everyone" user group full control (read and write) ACL to share C:\Users but your files are still protected by local NFTS ACL permissions that you find under "Security"
 tab.<br />
<br />
"Therefore due to the Most Restrictive evaluation, the easiest way to set permissions is to provide the Users (preferably by Groups), Full Control on the Share side, but lock it down on the NTFS side (Security Tab). It works nicely, all the time, and is easier
 to document and keep track."<br />

            I've got an issue where a user, in a server environment, has three directories (actually more, but for simplicity) nested. It's in their home directory. Folder one has full control share and limited ntfs permissions. I take away ownership and change permissions.
 The first nested directory there has ntfs permissions from the folder above, which is correct but the folder nested in this directory has the inherited permissions from the root of the User directory. It appears to skip the parent folder and just grabs the
 ntfs from \users.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Inheritance is turned on and I used the powershell cmdlet to 'reset' the security and it doesn't seem to have done the job.<br />
<br />
What am I missing? I did try to recreate the structure from scratch and it seems to emulate this blown security. Now what?<br />

            Hey I had exactly the same issue and it worried me, as a side note I really wish microsoft will look into this, after I unshared everything, reset my network settings to the most limited, rechecked everything I discovered something very unsettling. &nbsp;I
 had a friend testing to see what was shared on our network, and he accessed my folders and once he accessed them when I had sharing on they got logged in his start menu search. Now that I have all my sharing turned off he cannot access my files through the
 network window, HOWEVER he can search it on the start menu and open it, not only can he read everything in that file, but he can move up or down the chain and access everything in my user folders....Is there something I am missing or is this a bug in the system?

            I've had my laptop a couple months and I just added a second user in the past couple hours. I noticed some folders that I made in my first user wound up in the My Documents of my 2nd user. Those folders are in the Users/Public folder but show up in the 2nd location of my 2nd Users' documents. So I went digging around in the C:/Users folder and was able to get to every folder in my first users' documents from my 2nd user screen even though both users are password protected at login. On Win XP, password protected users are blocked from being accessed by other users, but this installation of Win 7 doesn't seem to do that this time. 



I'm the only user on this computer, and I had to reinstall Win 7 after one week because Win 7 was stealing permissions from every program installed and rendering them broken within hours after installation. Hundreds of people complained about similar symptoms on the WindowsSeven forum in early October 2012, but may have been totally unaware of what was going on with th

            <p>I think you guys are making this way more difficult than it is. The reason why the entire users folder is shared is because you have the "Sharing Wizard" turned on in the file explorer settings. It basically keeps the folder structure of the shared folders
 similar to the normal file explorer structure. Otherwise, you'd have to share individual folders one by one such as \\MyProfile\Scanner, \\MyProfile\Music, \\MyProfile\Videos, etc. With the wizard on, it maintains the normal C:\Users\MyProfile\Music, Scanner,
 Documents, Videos, etc. available. For the most part, the wizard&nbsp;touches anything within the folder structure all the way up to C:\</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously this is still a safe method of sharing <strong>assuming</strong> that you have&nbsp;password protected sharing enabled... Otherwise, yes, everyone on the network can access every folder and file within that wizard enabled structure.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you prefer the olden style of sharing where you had to enable each and every individual folder without any regard to structure or parent/child relationship, then simply turn the wizard off in the file explorer properties.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are the type where you want the public folders to be always available to anyone but not your personal folder, you will have to turn password protected sharing off since it covers the public folder. This means you will have to turn off the Sharing
 Wizard as well... That's where the "share public folders" or some variant of that depending on which windows you're running comes into play and keeps the folder structure for the public profile since the Sharing Wizard is going to be turned off so that you
 can maintain the folder hierarchy. </p>
<p>
</p><p>... Wow and I thought I was going to type less than you guys...</p>

            Hi Miguel.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />How exactly did you activate Pro?  The error normally means that someone has activated Windows with a Volume License Key meant only for business or organizations that activate a large number of PC's, which need to check in with the organization's server regularly to reactivate.  
<br />
<br />Sometimes this is done by shops unnecessarily because the PC either came with a Windows Product Key embedded in the BIOS/UEFI firmware, or it was already activated for free Upgrade and would have reactivated after a reinstall had they given it the chance and not interrupted this by installing the illegal key.
<br />
<br />If you know Windows was originally activated legitimately by one of these methods then to fix the problem what I would do is go offline to remove the Volume License key and then restore the Generic Product Key that is used to activate with the Digital License issued by Upgrade or Factory install.  Then we'll see if it activates:
<br />
<br />1) Go offline by opening Action center at the right end of Task Bar, then clicking on Airplane mode to turn off internet.  
<br />
<br />2) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click to Run as Administrator, then right click to copy and paste this command in and press Enter:  slmgr -upk
<br />
<br />3) Restart PC and then insert Generic Product Key for WIndows 10 Pro from here:    <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-...</a>
<br />
<br />This sets everything back to default so that if there is a Digital License issued during a proper Upgrade it should reactivate within a few days.  If not we will need to try something else:  
<br />
<br />What Windows Operating System came on that exact model PC originally - you can google it's make and model to read the specs to find out?  If it says Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 Home version then that is a clue you need to reinstall Home instead of Pro to try to activate.  We might even be able to still activate it fresh with a Windows 8/8.1 Product Key read from the BIOS or on the Windows 7 COA sticker on the PC, or any of those retail keys.
<br />
<br />If nothing else works you may need to reinstall the licensed Windows edition that came with that PC, or buy a copy of Windows 10 Home to activate it.  I would buy only from a major retailer who backs their purchases or Microsoft here:  <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-10-Home/productID.319937100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            Hi Miguel_R64 
<br />
<br />Did you purchase a Windows 10 Pro Upgrade licence key before upgrading and if so, where did you purchase that licence key form, was that form the Microsoft Store or from a 3rd party website?
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator' 
<br />
<br />Run or paste this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv

<br />It seems somehow the Windows 10 licence you are running is a volume licence version and is meant to run in a Company or organisation where the activation is re-armed on a regular basis or it is a cracked version of Windows<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9851e3a-a1d3-4bd1-9e5c-edf970147c5f?upload=true" />

    <title>Driver install on USB device failed due to disconnect, windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tuckwilli  say:</h3>
<h2>            Driver install on USB device failed due to disconnect, windows won&#39;t recognized device once plugged back in. How do I get this device recognized&#63;</h2>
                    I'm trying to get Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit to recognize my M-Audio Axiom 49 keyboard/midi controller, which works fine on my other Windows 7 machine.
<br />
<br />
The keyboard's USB port was loose, so when I first plugged it in windows tried and failed to install the drivers from the device multiple times as the device constantly connected and disconnected (due to the loose port). That two-tone 'you just plugged in/disconnected
 a device' noise was going off every two seconds.<br />
<br />
I unplug the device, fix the loose port, and plug it back in. The keyboard lights up, so its drawing power, but no 'you just connected noise,' no attempt to install drivers, no recognition of the device whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Is there a way for me to force Windows to recognize this device? I tried installing drivers downloaded from M-Audio's website to no avail. I also tried using different USB ports on my computer, which failed. Any help is appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Tuck<br />

            Hello Jiri.  I'm Greg, an 8 year Microsoft Windows MVP, here to help you.

If this is a Microsoft account you can change your password online on another PC to be able to sign in:  https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026971/microsoft-account-how-to-reset-your-microsoft-account-password

If it's a Local Account then you must be able to remember the password as we cannot help you crack it since we don't know whether you're the actual owner or not.

If you can't remember it then you'll need to do a Reset via Advanced Startup Options accessed by one of these methods:  https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html  An option will allow you to save files.  

Since you'll most likely need to create installation media to boot in to do this, you can also do the gold standard Clean Install  which compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/wi

            Hi , this is Andre from the Microsoft Community. 

Lets see if we can get your problem resolved.

If you are using a Microsoft Account, see how you can recover your password:

http://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/ 

If that does not work, you are best off performing a custom install.

Step 1: go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy:
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326

Step 2: follow the steps to perform a custom install:

<p>Hi Jim Lee,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay as I was out of office. @Jim, thanks for your reminder and efforts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to my research, Only the users who have the Skype for Business PSTN Conferencing license, can the users create Skype for Business meeting in Outlook or OWA (Outlook Web App), the dial-in phone numbers and conferencing IDs are added to the meeting
 invite automatically, please refer to following link to more details:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-dial-in-or-PSTN-conferencing-for-Skype-for-Business-d01954f1-4f37-4cf5-a636-20039e5c59e9?omkt=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-dial-in-or-PSTN-conferencing-for-Skype-for-Business-d01954f1-4f37-4cf5-a636-20039e5c59e9?omkt=en-US</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To clarify if you have the related license, please contact your admin for confirmation first. If you own the PSTN Conferencing license, the issue is probably related to the client. I suggest update your Outlook and Skype for Business to the latest version
 to see how it goes. In the meantime, would you please tell us if the other users in your organization encounter the same issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Coldwell</p>

<em>Gotham City Impostors</em>, quindi sembrerebbe veramente affidabile. Attendiamo conferme o smentite da parte di Microsoft, probabilmente il 6 giugno all'E3.

<p>Il team di sviluppo Remedy non risponde direttamente alle recenti voci di corridoio riguardanti il nuovo titolo con protagonista Alan Wake, che secondo i nuovi rumor si chiamerebbe
<b>Alan Wake: Night Springs</b>.<br />
<br />
"Siamo veramente molto esaltati dal nuovo progetto su Alan Wake, sar√† qualcosa di fantastico", ha detto Oskari Hakkinen di Remedy a VG247 in proposito, "non vediamo l'ora di poter rivelare di pi√π, ma a questo punto vogliamo tenere tutto coperto fino al nostro
 annuncio ufficiale, restate sintonizzati".<br />
<br />
Considerando la prossimit√† dell'E3 2011, potrebbe arrivare durante la fiera di Los Angeles qualche novit√† sul nuovo gioco in questione, che secondo quanto riferito da varie fonti non sarebbe ufficialmente
<i>Alan Wake 2</i>.<br />

    <title>Unallocated not visible in diskpart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unallocated not visible in diskpart</h2>
                    <p>I was dual booting win 7 and win 10. I had to delete win 10 so that I can do a fresh install. When I deleted the volume it for some reason split into 3 different unallocated spaces. I created a simple volume with one tried to extend it to merge the other
 2 and the option to do so is greyed out. My next thought was to use a elevated cmd promt for diskpart to fix it. Well when I DISKPART&gt;list disk the only disk that shows up is my win 7. The unallocated space is not there to choose. Can someone either tell me
 how to merge all the unallocated so that I can format it for a fresh win 10 install or how to fix the diskpart cmd promt issue? If needed I will download a third party program if someone knows of a good one for this issue. Thank you.</p>

            Using diskpart.exe is the stone age way of doing such things. I recommend you use a fully mature partition manager such as AOMEI (https://www.aomeitech.com/). There is a free version.

            <p><span>Hi David,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the query, I understand that you are getting an error "PnPutil.exe‚Äù when you try reinstalling HP universal printer driver. I appreciate your effort to resolve this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To help us understand the issue better, can you provide us the following information.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Are you getting the same error when you try installing any other application/program?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>I would suggest you to download and install the latest
</span><span>HP universal printer driver for Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may refer to HP website link below to download the latest set of universal printer drivers.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/HP-Universal-Print-Driver-Series-for-Windows/503548/model/4157320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/HP-Universal-Print-Driver-Series-for-Windows/503548/model/4157320</a>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists I would suggest you to install the latest drivers in clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>How to place the computer in clean boot</span></strong><span>:
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update
 or when you run a program in Windows 8.1</span></p>
<p><span>You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality
 returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please refer to the following article on how to perform a clean boot and ‚Äú<strong>how to revert back the changes‚Äù.</strong></span></p>

</p><p>Video cards do warm up with gaming. Nothing to be worried about as they are designed to handle the heat. The fan on the them will ramp up if the thermal load rises too much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Tonga GPU is much more game friendly and it should serve you well looking forward.</p>

<p>You have Skylake which is relatively recent. The CPU is not at fault its Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A better CPU will have diminishing returns so a better bet is a SSD which wll at least solve the boot times to some extent.</p>

    <title>Not all achievements unlocking for the second player in 2 player split - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sidders1989  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not all achievements unlocking for the second player in 2 player split screen mode</h2>
                    
<p><span>Can someone help please! Me and my wife almost have 100% completion for this game and even though I've been awarded every achievement so far my wife has only been awarded the story mission achievements, none of the extra ones for getting collectibles
 etc which is really disappointing as she completed half of them for us! I was awarded the achievements and she wasn't! Microsoft has told me that it's because of the games settings that it only awards the player who first logged in and set up the game, but
 yet my wife still got the main story achievements, just not any of the others? Makes no sense, please help guys, Thanks : )</span></p>

<p>This has been going on for Lego games since Lego pirates I believe. Your only way to get them for her is to get her to start a game save and do them all again. Some of the achievements state in the details single player only.</p>

<h2>            SURFACE PRO 3 KICKSTAND ISSUE &#40;Need Help&#41;</h2>
                    <p>To summarize my ordeal, this is the second defective replacement Surface Pro 3 sent to me from the Microsoft Center.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can anyone render me some assistance on the problem outlined below ?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I can only charge my Surface when the kick stand is fully extended to the widest angle. Once I have repositioned the kickstand to another angle, the `no battery detected` icon appears and no charging takes place. The Surface won`t power on if the kickstand
 isn`t fully extended to the widest angle.</p>

    <title>Black empty desktop windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coochiewarrior  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black empty desktop windows 10</h2>
                    <p>i have a dell g5 computer that i had just restarted to get rid of a bunch of files. After setting the computer up again and entering my pin it brought me to a mostly empty black desktop saying it could not find the windows desktop file and that i needed
 the drive or usb but i never had one that contained the files i need. I still have the recycle bin along with the taskbar which has no browsers. nothing on it will open but the support assistant. I have tried to use safe mode to access/open the windows icon
 but that didnt work and even going to the boot setting and picking the normal bootup did not work but it gave me a message saying that access was denied to the windows desktop. If you have any info please let me know.</p>

            Well I guess a factory reset would solve the problem. But be aware that all of your files and programs will be lost.
<br />Did you also try the windows repair feature?

    <title>DiskManagement does not show internal HDD in W10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sandy_uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            DiskManagement does not show internal HDD in W10</h2>
                    <p>I assume this happened after this last week's updates.</p>
<p>I use Acronis for backup and backup my partitions. Last Sunday, after installing I was able to perform my scheduled backup to an external HDD.</p>
<p>Today the backup failed. The reason was that the only available HDD was my external backup drive. I checked Disk Management and my internal drive, with two partitions, is not shown! I have every removable drive but no internal one.</p>
<p>I can see and open both internal drive partitions in File Manager and This Computer. I can perform a file backup, but Disk and Partition Backup (which also allows me to clone my disk) no longer works. Instead I am taken to a window very similar to Windows
 Backup to select files, but I bought Acronis because it enables me to restore my system, including al programs, if my HDD fails or I have catastrophic corruption. I have used this facility once after a series of power cuts corrupting the disk and although
 it took a long time to restore, I recovered everything.</p>
<p>Now, since last Sunday morning, I cannot perform a disk and partition backup as the only disk shown is my backup disk and&nbsp;need to be able to access the source partitions&nbsp;&nbsp;(my internal Windows and Data partitions) in order to perform this operation. The only
 option available to me now failed because a part of my AV could not be copied.</p>
<p>Is this an unwanted 'feature' or will it be fixed?</p>
<p>I can't access my internal drive in Disk Management from the Computer Management snap-in on Windows 10 Pro now. Only removable drives are shown!</p>
<p>Is there, or is there likely to be, a fix so my internal drive exists in the Management Console again?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have one internal HDD, 1 TB partitioned into 2 main partitions, plus the original manufacturers rescue partition.</p>
<p>I also have an external USB hard disk, and that, plus removable USB drives of other types (all without media).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I upgraded to Windows 10 all of my hard drives were available in Disk Management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They disappeared after one of the recent updates, although I don't know if it was one of the Patch Tuesday ones or one received later in the week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I found the cause and everything is now working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer was that the services needed for these disks had been switched to Manual and not started.</p>
<p>I don't know which were the important ones or if they al were as I changed al of these services to Automatic:-</p>
<p>All Storage services</p>
<p>All Volume services</p>
<p>Volume Shadow Copy</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the storage and volume services had been changed from Automatic to Manual only USB devices were shown in Disk Management.</p>
<p>My SATA hard disk and two visible partitions were visible and could be accessed through File Explorer, but not at a lower level, making it impossible to perform a disk and partition backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had not turned these services off or changed their properties, so I can only assume that one of the Windows Cumulative Updates was responsible. Al services relating to internal hard disks had been switched to Manual and not started.</p>
<p>As soon as I switched them to Automatic and rebooted my SATA hard disk with al partitions became visible and accessible in Disk Management. I know I should have activated one service at a time to troubleshoot but I didn't have time to test a theory by doing
 that at the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for me the problem is solved, but I don't know the cause.</p>

            <p>My problem is almost the opposite (and I do not know how to switch from Manual to Automatic, or vice-versa).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I switched from W 7 to W 10 today. Now, when I plug in my Toshiba external hard drive (3 TB, I think), the computer plays the little tune of beeps it always does when I plug in a USB key, for example, and plays the unplug&nbsp;beep tune&nbsp;too--so my computer knows
 the Toshiba external hard drive is there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the Toshiba external hard drive does not appear in File Explorer, so I cannot drag and drop folders and files from my internal hard drive to my external hard drive, nor from a USB key to the external hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that in Control Panel, under devices, there is an entry corresponding to my Toshiba external hard drive, as it says "3" (but does not say what there are 3 of); when I right click on the icon and then left click on "Properties", the screen says that
 the manufacturer of the device is unknown (it says that for at least one other device, also). It does not say if any of the&nbsp;device is free or any portion of it full.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance for telling me how I can get my Toshiba external hard drive to appear in File Explorer, so that I can use it!</p>

            Hello Reetz,<br />
<br />
Thank you for writing to Microsoft Vista Community Forums.<br />
<br />
1. Make sure that your sound drivers are installed properly and up to date.<br />
&nbsp;2. In some cases the drivers are installed correctly and the error still occurs, open teamspeak, go in the settings menu and open the "Options" window.<br />
3. In the "Sound Devices" tab, change the Sound driver to "Wave" if it was set to "Direct3dSound" and change it to "Direct3dSound" if it was set to "Wave" then, push "Ok". Close teamspeak and reopen it.<br />
<br />
You may also go through the links for more information about ventrilo and try to contact them if the issue persists.<br />
<a href="http://www.ventrilo.com/faq.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.ventrilo.com/faq.php</span></a><br />
<a href="http://www.ventrilo.com/about.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.ventrilo.com/about.php</span></a><br />
<a href="http://www.ventrilo.com/dlprod.php?id=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.ventrilo.com/dlprod.php?id=1</span></a><br />
<br />
Also follow the steps below to verify if the Microphone is properly configured and enabled in Vista.<br />
<br />
Step 1: Testing for an audio signal<br />
1. Click Start, and then Control Panel.<br />
2. Click Hardware and Sounds, and then click Managing audio devices...<br />
3. Click the Recording tab.<br />
4. To test the microphone, speak into it. To test line-in, send a signal to the line-in port from the source audio device (press play from the audio player). Look at the gray bars next to the device name on the recording tab:<br />
* If the gray bars next to the device name change to green, this device is active and an audio signal is being passed through the microphone or line-in port. This step shows that problem is related to sound settings in the software that uses the microphone.
 If you have not already done so, set the selected device to default and adjust the levels. Once the device is set to default and the levels are set, use and adjust the sound recording or voice carrying software.<br />
* If the gray bars remain gray and inactive, the device is not recognizing a signal. Leave the recording tab open and go to the next step.<br />
<br />
Step 2: Check volume levels and mute<br />
The speaker volume for the microphone and line-in may be muted or turned down. Use the following steps to check the speaker volume levels for line-in and microphone.<br />
1. Click Start, and then click Control Panel.<br />
2. Click Hardware and Sound.<br />
3. Click Sound.<br />
4. Select Speakers, and then click Properties.<br />
5. Click the Levels tab.<br />
6. Click the Muted button next to Microphone and any other line-in that is muted.<br />
7. Use the slider bar to raise the level for Microphone and each line-in to at least 75.<br />
8. Click OK.<br />
<br />
Step 3: Update the audio drivers<br />
You may find that a front microphone port does not work, a recording device is missing from the recording tab, a microphone is not recognized when it is plugged in, or other problem. There may be updated audio drivers that can fix these types of issues. Use
 the following steps to make sure audio drivers are up to date.<br />
1. Connect to the Internet.<br />
2. Click Start, and enter device manager in the Start search field.<br />
3. Click the plus sign, next to Sound, video and game controllers.<br />
4. Right-click the name of the sound hardware and select Update Driver Software....<br />
5. Click Search automatically for updated driver software and wait for Windows to update the driver software.<br />
6. Windows checks a remote Web site to see if updated driver software is available.<br />
* If an update is available, let Windows install the update.<br />
* If an update is not available, skip to the next step.<br />
7. Once the update is installed successfully, test the microphone or line-in as was done in step 1. If the problem persists, go to the next step.<br />
<br />
Step 4: Configuring Windows recording settings<br />
By default, Windows Vista automatically enables microphones and line-in ports. Use the following steps to set the microphone/line-in port to be the default port and to configure the recording levels.<br />
1. If the Recording tab in the sound window is not selected, open the Sound window and click the Recording Tab and make sure that the status is set as below.<br />
a - Microphone port - working and set as default<br />
b - Line In - working<br />
c - Digital In (S/PDIF port) - working<br />
d - Stereo Mix (Software mixer) - Disabled<br />
2. If multiple microphones or line-in ports are available, select the port that you want to use. Click Set Default to make this device the default audio input device.<br />
3. If the device you want to use contains a small circle with an arrow pointing down, the device is disabled. To enable the device, right-click the device name and select Enable.<br />
4. With the device selected, click Properties, and then click the Levels tab.<br />
5. Adjust the slider until to 75% of its range.<br />
6. If Mute is on, click the mute button to unmute the device. The mute button should show as a blue speaker without any red circle.<br />
7. If Microphone Boost is available, adjust to +20.0 dB.<br />
8. Click OK to make the changes.<br />
9. Test the microphone as was done in step 1 to determine if Windows is able to detect a signal for the microphone or line-in being used. If you have performed all the steps and the microphone or source device still does not work, the audio ports or sound hardware
 on the computer may be bad.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, contact us back with details below?<br />
1. Has Microphone worked on the computer anytime earlier?<br />
2. Since when are you facing the issue?<br />
3. Did you make any changes to the computer before this issue occured?<br />
4. The version of Ventrilo you are using on your computer.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise editions have access to some special encryption features:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>BitLocker</strong> - allows you to create encrypted volumes on drives.<br />
</li><li><strong>Encrypting File System (EFS)</strong> - allows you to encrypt individual folders and files.<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>To use the <strong>Encrypting File System (EFS)</strong> feature, you can follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the folder you want to encrypt, then choose <strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click the <strong>Advanced </strong>button under the <strong>General</strong> tab.<br />
</li><li>Check the <strong>Encrypt contents to secure data</strong> box.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> These folders are only encrypted when stored on your hard drive, therefore you can't email them securely without encrypting the folders in a different way.</em><br />
<br />
If you want to use the <strong>BitLocker </strong>option, you can post your query to the
<strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?brandIgnore=True&amp;sort=relevancedesc&amp;searchTerm=windows+10+encrypting+winzip+folders+using+bitlocker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet Forums</a></strong> for a more suitable answer.<br />
<br />
There are some third-party software that you can download and install to be able to create a password for your files and folders as well.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have further queries.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

<p>Thanks for that. I was hoping for a simple password arrangement as there is with Excel.</p>
<p>The encryption thing is asking for certificates etc.</p>
<p>All too difficult!</p>
<p>Best.</p>
