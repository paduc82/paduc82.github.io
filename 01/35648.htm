            <p>Hey JEGS009 -</p>
<p>Does this freezing happen with any other game or just this one? Do you experience the same issue if you play the game after you take your <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/using-xbox-one-offline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One console offline</a>? Also, some other things you can try:</p>

                    <p>After an 'update' (not determined if it was a Microsoft action or a malware action) I have received the infamous box pictured on many other problems. I have attempted to go to the directory&nbsp;c:\windows\system32\config in order to create the Desktop and it
 declares "Access Denied". Now, if I make any attempt to open explore.exe, I get a pop-up that reads 'An attempt was made to reference a token that does not exist" and allows me to close it. The Windows Logo (start) does NOTHING and I'm reduced to Command Prompt
 actions.&nbsp;</p>

This unit was bought at Costco with no backup DVD. Am I hosed?</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Sounds like it's signed you into a Temporary Account. Sometimes when a Windows or Version Update fails due to a corrupted account it will create a temp one to sign into.
<br />
<br />You should be able to leave the password box blank to sign in to the temp account.  
<br />
<br />Check at C:\Users if you can see your old account with its files intact.  If not check at C:\Windows.old to see if files were archived there during a version install that fails.  
<br />
<br />If so copy the files out externally so they are safe.  Files should always be backed up if you value them at all.  You can copy or drag them to an external USB flash or hard drive, or into Onedrive (up to 5gb free) or Google Drive (up to 15gb free).  
<br />
<br />Try restarting the PC a few times to see if it will start into your account.  If so go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then from the temp account can try to repair the old account using one of these methods:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/48012-fix-youve-been-signed-temporary-profile-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/48012-fix-y...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.sysprobs.com/fix-temporary-profile-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sysprobs.com/fix-temporary-profile-w...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then you can try to create a new Admininstrator Local Account to see how it works:  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10/how-to-create-a-local-account-in-windows-10/95097c32-40c4-48c0-8f3b-3bcb67afaf7c">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>.   
<br />
<br />If necessary to try to repair the old account or create a new Account you may need to enable and Sign into the Hidden Administrator account used only for emergencies, using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>.
<br />
<br />Once the new account is created: sign into the new account, move your files over, test that all programs run.  If you decide to keep it then you can delete the old accounts when ready. in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and other Users.  
<br />
<br />If the install is too corrupted for even a new account to run well, then see if you can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If not you can run a Repair Install which reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files, programs and most settings in place,  by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This will solve most problems and also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If those fail then you can do a Reset:  <a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/reset-windows-10-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/reset-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can do the vastly superior Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then I'd save time by doing the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You can rescue any files that are not backed up from the booted media using this method:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then More options, then Go back to old Version.  If that fails you can try Command Prompt from Advanced options to enable the Hidden Admin above to try to create and new Account.  If these fail in Troubleshoot options you acn try the  Reset.  
<br />
<br />If these fail close the Repair boxes and choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.

<p>I've tried just about all the suggestions and the computer is basically little more than a DOS prompt at this point. Any attempt at running the ISO creator brings another error message, or the utility just goes away without running.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can verify the computer goes to a temp profile. I also tried to sign on to a second profile (already existing on the computer) and it no longer seems to remember the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already copied off the pertinent files to a USB stick as a backup. A clean install doesn't seem to be the trick either, because I cannot get the ISO creator to work.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 8 Control Panel Not Opening&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dawsonconrad7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Control Panel Not Opening&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I just bought a brand new desktop computer that has Windows 8 on it. I've been trying to install my AV anti-virus but it says that it cannot install because the Norton free trial that came pre-installed to my desktop was preventing it from installing.
 I have been trying to open my Control Panel to uninstall the Norton Security stuff from my desktop. The Control Panel icon pops up in the taskbar but when I click on it nothing pops up. It shows the Control Panel window preview on the taskbar when you hover
 the cursor over it, but it won't open. Please help! Thanks!</p>
<p>Further details:</p>
<p>Computer Model: HP Pavilion p7-1451</p>
<p>Type: Desktop</p>
<p>Monitor: Not touchscreen. It is HD.</p>
<p>Processor: Next Gen AMD Quad-Core A10-5700 Accelerated Processor</p>
<p>Memory/RAM: 10GB DDR3 system memory, 2TB hard drive (1.75TB available)</p>
<p>OS: Windows 8</p>

            <p>Go very carefully, please.</p>
<p>You need to have your new antivirus at hand before uninstalling the old.</p>
<p>To get to Control panel, you may type in on the Start screen</p>
<p><strong>control panel</strong></p>
<p>and click on the blue Control panel tile at top left.</p>
<p>Then click Programs</p>
<p>then Programs and Features</p>
<p>Locate and uninstall Norton.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then Logoff and Restart system fresh</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Norton tools are known to leave behind traces, so download and SAVE and then RUN
</p>
<p>the Norton product removal tool</p>
<p><a href="https://www-secure.symantec.com/norton-support/jsp/help-solutions.jsp?docid=kb20080710133834EN_EndUserProfile_en_us&amp;product=home&amp;pvid=f-home&amp;version=1&amp;lg=en&amp;ct=us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www-secure.symantec.com/norton-support/jsp/help-solutions.jsp?docid=kb20080710133834EN_EndUserProfile_en_us&amp;product=home&amp;pvid=f-home&amp;version=1&amp;lg=en&amp;ct=us</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When that is done, do 1 more Logoff and Restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you can run the setup for your new antivirus.</p>

            I have purchased&nbsp; a PC with windows 8.&nbsp; The action centre is telling me that Norton and Windows defender are switched off.&nbsp; I don't want Norton (which I presume is the free trial) but I do want to turn Defender on.
<br />
<br />
But I have attempted several times from the action centre and from Windows Defender.&nbsp; Defender seems to think that I am running another antivirus.&nbsp; If I remove Norton will Defender turn on automatically?<br />

<p>First since Norton Symantec are infamous for leaving traces behind after an uninstall, get and Save and set aside the
Norton Removal tool<br />
</p>
<p>The sequence to use to totally remove Norton is as follows:<br />
1.&nbsp; Run appwiz.cpl (Program and Features)<br />
2. Locate your Norton antiviurs app in the list<br />
3. Select it and Uninstall<br />
4. Restart Windows fresh<br />
5. Run the Norton Removal tool<br />
6. Logoff and restart Windows fresh<br />
7. Go to Control Panel &gt;&gt; Action Center<br />
and in there follow the prompts to turn on Windows Defender</p>

            Did you ever get this resolved? I am having this problem currently. But its not just Control Panel that won't open properly. Spotify, Programs and Features, Action Center, and many other programs won't open up when I click on their icon n the task bar.
 My computer seems to think they are running, and shows me the preview of them when I hover my mouse over them, but I cannot pull them up when I click on them. Spotify even lets me play different songs and interact with the program by using the shortcuts in
 the preview screen, but I can't bring it up to full screen (or even windowed mode). What is wrong? The computer seems to think the programs are running, but they are not visible!

Sounds like they are being displayed on a second monitor, perhaps unattached.&nbsp;&nbsp; Press Win-P to see the state of Second Screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; Easiest way to show all windows on one screen is to use that dialog.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise you can use the window's Move menu item to bring
 them back.&nbsp;&nbsp;If they are not associated with a second screen you could also bring them back with Taskbar's Cascade windows command, right-click an empty spot in the Taskbar to start that procedure.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
ZIP files are compressed so you have to uncompress them and then play the contents if the<br />
contents are WMP type files.<br />
<br />
Compress and uncompress files (zip files)<br />

Hope this helps.

            <p>The Data Usage recorded from Xbox 1 is inaccurate! Microsoft is not an ISP though they are the biggest software company in the world. You must be trying to download Xbox 1's entire game library off Xbox Live or watching YouTube, and 4k Netflix 24/7 to get that amount of usage. Maybe you need to get your ISP to investigate. Make sure you're with a good ISP too (if your circumstances permit). I'm with Vodafone NZ. </p>

            <p>Hi there. &nbsp;I tried the top two options, but the troubleshooter did not detect any problems and there were no updates waiting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All that shows in my folders [on my computer]<br />
Outbox</p>
<p>Inbox</p>
<p>Deleted Items</p>
<p>Drafts</p>
<p>Sent Items</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my Shaw Webmail, I have more folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I synch with these other folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be able to move some emails to my "Keep" folder.</p>

            I have done everything suggested and I have the same files listed under my Shaw email and no way to add files either. The option is not there. I think Windows 10 Mail doesn't &nbsp;totally sync with some email accounts.

<h2>            Windows 7 wont install updates - constant installing updates on shutdown&#47;restart.</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 7x64 will not install the updates! I have let it go on for a few months now, hoping one boot cycle the issues will resolve themselves, they have not. &nbsp;I have attempted the ms fixit tool for update issues, and have attempted installing the updates
 individually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When installing them individually there is no error code or easily to find log it is simply -</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Some updates were not installed</p>
<p>the following updates were not installed"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When looking through windows update "log" (surely we can export this to csv somehow?? one by one this is painful..... they should probably be in the eventlogs.. success! ..hmmm seems to be completely different codes, helpful. &nbsp;I have copied out the 'setup'
 event logs which seem to contain the attempted updates (both automatic and manual) but I cant attach things? If you want the logs let me know..)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>..anyways it is the same attempted updates and they all have the same error code, listed below.</p>

                    <p>For some reason, Windows Updates are turning off my computer. &nbsp;This often happens on weekends while I'm away, and makes it impossible to use remote desktop from home. &nbsp;I would prefer that my computer restart after a Windows Update, rather than turning off.</p>

            <p><b><span>Hi KristinM54,</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1) Do you get any <b>error message or error code</b>?<br />
2) What <b>is\are</b> the <b>KB article number(s)</b> of the <b>updates</b> that were installed on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
3) Have you made <b>any</b> <b>changes</b> on the computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><br />
<b>Method 1-</b></span></p>
<p><span><br />
Note the <b>KB article number(s)</b> of the <b>updates</b> that are failing.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Refer the steps-</span></p>
<p><span><br />
a) Open <b>Windows Update</b> and select “<b>View Update history</b>”.<br />
b) Make a note of the updates that are failing and let us know by your next post.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2-</span></b></p>
<span>
<p><br />
You need to perform a <b>System Restore</b> to undo the changes made on your computer.<br />
Refer the article-</p>
</span>&nbsp;
<span>
<p><br />
<b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/system-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/system-restore</a><br />

</span>&nbsp;
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Performing a <b>System Restore</b> will undo any changes made on your computer earlier. You may also lose unsaved information as well. Proceed at your own risk.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><br />
<b>Method 3-</b></span></p>
<p><span><br />
I would recommend you to perform <b>Clean Boot</b>.<br />
Putting your system in <b>Clean Boot state</b> helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article-</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing<span> a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></span></span></a></span></b><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: You need to follow <b>Step</b> <b>7</b> from the article to get the computer back to
<b>Normal Startup</b> after performing all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now try and install the updates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Additionally, refer the article-</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>How do I reset Windows Update components?</span></span></a></span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Hope this helps!!</span></b></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows 7 came preinstalled on my computer, </strong><strong>how do I find the product key?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;product key is usually located on the COA sticker attached to the bottom of your laptop or in the battery compartment. In some rare cases it can also be found in the memory compartment. For tower systems, look at the top or the side of the system unit.&nbsp;It
 looks like the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0f490afc-06fb-47e1-92e9-647fed014b3c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d0f490afc-06fb-47e1-92e9-647fed014b3c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker is damaged or letters or not legible, you will have to consider the following options:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Use a digital camera to capture a picture of the COA then enlarge it on your computer.
</li></ul>
<span>
<ul>
<li>If the COA sticker is damaged, then you would need to use the recovery partition to reinstall Windows 7, this will exempt the need to use the product key to activate your Windows 7 installation.</li></ul>

contact the manufacturer </a>of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee. This will exempt the need to use the product key also.</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The above issue may occur due to </span><span>corrupted or missing app files &amp; folders located on the computer. Presence of corrupted or missing app files &amp; folders will result in irregular performance of that particular app on

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for quick update on the above issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since the troubleshooter did not detect any corrupt or missing app components, let us check if similar issue persists on another user profile.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Create another administrator user account by referring to

<strong>Set up accounts</strong></a>&nbsp;on Windows 10 article and check if similar issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The corrupted user profile does not function normally such as not launching
<strong>Start menu</strong>, <strong>Cortana, Search bar, Store </strong>and other
<strong>Windows applications</strong>. In such cases creating a new profile and checking for the same will help in identifying if the is specific to corrupted user profile or the OS.</span></p>

 when requested, click Next, wait while the key is verified, accept the license agreement, click upgrade, wait while the software upgrades, (it might take 10 minutes or more depending on if updates are needed), your computer will automatically restart, after
 restarting, Windows 7 will notifiy you its updating the computer, the computer will restart one more time automatically and the upgrade will be completed, a windows will pop up notifying the upgrade was successful and your computer is ready to use, click close,
 you should be upgraded to Windows 7 Professional your files, programs and settings preserved.</p>
<span>
<p>Please note that Anytime Upgrade does not support OEM, MSDN-Academic, Volume License (student faculty licenses). If you are in posession of any of these media, you will have to back up and do a custom clean install. If you wish to do this, please backup

    <title>WiFi Connection is being drop after a while on Win8, I need to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlosecr  say:</h3>
<h2>            WiFi Connection is being drop after a while on Win8, I need to disconnect and reconect to go live again.</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from Win7 to Win8 but now, my wifi connection is being drop sometime after 30 minutes or after an hour or 2. I have used the same USB SMC Wireless G adapter with no problema with Windows XP and Windows 7. According to compatibility Center, this
 device is compatible with Win8, however, Manufacturer Site does not have a Driver for Win8.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The network icon on the lower rigth side on the task bar shows an exclamation icon, then need to left click to bring the side panel with all Networks available,&nbsp;My Network is tagged as "Limited".&nbsp;so I need to&nbsp;&nbsp;Left Click and then on Disconnect, and then
 Check on Connect automatically and click on Connect. After that, I have Access again.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My USB adapter has an Atheros driver and after looking for Windows updates, I have a message that my driver is updated to the latest level and no need to update.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can imagine, this is frustrating when using Netflix services or playing on line since I get dropped without notice.&nbsp; I'm using a SMC SMCWUSB-G EZ Connect G (2.4 GHz 54 Mbps wireless USB 2.0 Adapter) with Win 8 x86.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any clues if this is a Driver problem, incompatiblity issues on Windows 8?? </p>

            <p>Hi CarlosECR,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s follow the suggestions to fix issues with WiFi connection.</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b></p>
<p>Let’s follow the steps from the article.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/cant-connect-to-a-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Why can’t I connect to a network?</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If Method 1 doesn’t help. Let’s uninstall the Network Adapter drivers and install it in compatibility mode for Windows 7.<br />
Press Windows Key + X Key.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Select Device Manager.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Expand Network Adapter.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right click WiFi Network Adapter and select Uninstall.</p>
<p><span>To install the Network Adapter in compatibility mode, right-click on the
<b>setup file</b> and go to <b>Properties</b> and select
<b>Compatibility </b>then <b>Run the program for compatibility mode for</b> Windows 7.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you any more questions, you may reply and I’d be happy help you.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hello Fahimulla, thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I follow the recommendations on Method 1 altought the one thing I did not try is to connect mi PC directly to Modem/Router via cable, however, I do not think this might be an issue since It was been the same PC and HW and I have move from Win XP to W7 and
 now W8 and only W8 is showing this behaivor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Method 2, SMC Manufacturer has Win7 Drivers for my USB Wifi Adapter. I removed the adapter per Method 2, however, I could not install it with compatibility mode with the steps provided since I don't received a setup file from Manufacturer, only 3 files
 : </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>netathrusb&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setup information</p>
<p>athrusb.sys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; system file</p>
<p>athrusbext&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; security catalog</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked properties in of all them but none is displaying the option to install in W7 compatibility mode.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any other way to install this files in a compatibility mode?? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ONe more thing I just noted is that my son plays on line role games, when playing is when most of the times I lost the connection and switch to Limited instead connected, but as I said before, the problema is not linked only to on line gaming but also while
 I'm browsing the net using ie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            This is also happening with me quite a bit and its very annoying. It is not a driver problem as this worked fine before. Also, I have noticed that several times it appears that the windows http autoproxy service is starting and I have read other problems
 with this in the past. I have manually stopped the service many times and it restarts. In other threads, it looks like that when that service is running and there is no proxy required, it causes disconnects.
<div><br />
<div>It is getting extremely annoying as I know there is not a problem with the router or the modem or anything as every other system but my windows 8 computer maintains connection, but the win8 connection keeps dropping, going to limited and so on.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This might be the result of a recent update as when I first went to win8, this was not a big issue, but after the recent win8 updates it appears to be happening about twice and hour. Please figure this out as I am thinking of just stopping win8 as a result.</div>

            Bump here. &nbsp;Same issue.
<div><br />
I am now on my second wireless adapter hoping this would help. &nbsp;Every other computer/phone/tablet &nbsp;in the house connects fine, except for the W8 Machine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I simply disconnect the adapter from the settings menu and then reactivate it. &nbsp;It connects again, but the time varies.</div>
<div><br />
Any and all help is greatly appreciated!</div>

<p>
</p><p>(old thread I know but anyways ...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into the driver (device manager) and started to change settings until it became</p>
<p>stable. Go into device manager and right click on SMCWUSB-G2 and select properties,</p>
<p>then press the advanced tab. Set 802.11b Preamble to long only. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I also set the receive buffer lower (32) but this should not be related to the crash issues.</p>

<h3> phildo79  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista installation error code 0x80070070</h2>
                    <p>Recently I've noticed that my laptop is running quite slow so I decided to re-install the Vista OS. Straight away I get an error code stating:</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is not enough disk space on partician D. A further 487mb is required. Please create more space and try again. Error code: 0x80070070</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, partician D only has a maximum of 100mb so how am I supposed to get 487mb of free space from it! I have deleted programmes that add to over 500mb from the laptop&nbsp;but I'm still getting the same message. It also won't allow me to restore the system to
 a previous restore point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I try booting the system from CD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>It's funny I had to reinstall my Inspiron 1720 with a new OS, Vista 32, and it wouldn't take it. &nbsp;I found out the Hdd was not being recognized so it gave me stop errors, the usual. It was then that somebody in some forum suggested, to someone else, to use
 a combination setting for the hdd instead of the defaulted one. &nbsp;I kept getting inverter cable failed, which was false because it worked fine and Ohm'd out fine, so I changed it to ATA. &nbsp;The OS installed wonderfully but I had Windows update errors and couldn't
 get that to work, I Hotfixed Update, did fixit, updated windows update agent standalone, then continued to install all the updates, over 100.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically...</p>
<p>Step one change hdd recognition</p>
<p>Step two install Hotfix for WU</p>
<p>Step three install run fixit</p>
<p>Step four Install new WUA with standalone download</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running awesome now....I know its an old product, my computer, but why buy something new, especially when poor where you can reinstall, cleanup, and make it work wonderfully.</p>

<p>You then have to select one of the folders to save your CSV file in. You have the opportunity to make a new folder, so you could for example select the documents folder and then make a new folder called CSV to contain the CSV file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that exporting as CSV will only include one email address (the <em>preferred</em> or
<em>primary </em>one) per contact, and there are some other fields that won't be included. You could have avoided the hassle of exporting and importing simply by signing in in Windows Live Mail. If you sign in on two different computers, with the same Microsoft
 Account, you'll automatically see the same contacts list.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The final release was version 6 in 1998 (now known simply as Visual Basic). <span>
Though Visual Basic 6.0 IDE is unsupported as of April 8, 2008, the Visual Basic team is committed to "It Just Works" compatibility for Visual Basic 6.0 applications on Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 including R2, Windows 7, and Windows 8.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You need to wait for Windows 10 to be released to know whether Visual Basic works or not.

            <p>This is my main doubt about upgrading to Win10. Althoigh I have worked with VB2012, I feel more comfortable with VB6 as a RAD tool. I'm currently working on a project that works on WinXp, Win7, Win8 but is a pain in the **** to have to run XP with VB6 in
 an emulated environment all the time. I wish Microsoft to get seriously the comments/critisism of VB6 developments and make his miracle to support VB6 devlopment in Win10. &nbsp;I own a favour to Bill gates as he gave the opportunity to develop Win apps</p>
<p>in an easy way, back to 1998. Me and other self-taught VB6 developers feel to express our gratitudes for that, and expect some in Microsoft still to share his vision... On the other hand, supporting VB6 in Win10 will make easier for Microsoft to hit the
 tablets market which currently is dominanted from Android machines.</p>
<p>Some user's comments</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">"I just installed Windows 10 Technical Preview today (01-OCt-2014) on VmWare Desktop. Vb6 + SP6 installed easier than Win7/Win8 with no tricks necessary other than 'Run As Administrator'. Initial testing shows
 that Vb6 runs OK without any problems."</p>
<p style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">"Just installed our rather complex vb6 application on it and it worked just fine."</p>
<p style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">"Well boys and girls my VB6 Activex EXE thing works in the first Windows 10 Tech Preview. So we do have yet another stay of execution. Smart Microsoft, Smart."</p>
<p style="color: rgba(20, 24, 35, 1)">"Actually, to refer to an earlier comment, running a VB6 Win10 is superior to running on XP as it manages memory much better, particularly in graphics apps, where my VB6 code will let me handle 220 megapixels
 32 bits graphics files on an old AMD CPU and 2gig ram. This is way beyond what I could do at the time I was still running XP"</p>

            <p>If VB6 is compatible with Windows 10 this good news</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this has been said on numerous websites but VB6 is a great langauges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It still stands upto other the newer langauges.</p>

<h2>            Show estimated data usage feature</h2>
                    <p>Does this show total usage on a wifi network? Or total usage on a network by the device on which you're checking?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, if I have multiple devices on my network, and I click"Show estimated data usage", is that number reflecting usage on the network from the other devices in addition to my computer? Or my computer's usage on the network only?</p>

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Based on the issue description, I understand that you want to know does the Estimated data usage feature shows the data of the current device on which you are checking or all the devices connected to the same network. Correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that you will only get the estimate usage of the data used by&nbsp;your computer on which you are checking (Windows 8) connected on the network.&nbsp;You will not be able to know the usage of the data used by the other device that are connected&nbsp;to&nbsp;the
 same&nbsp;network.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How to See Your Data Usage in Windows 8.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Press the Win + C keyboard combination to bring up the Charms Menu, then click on Settings.</p>

<p>Now click on your network connections.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn5.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2fimage203.png" height="333" width="401" /></p>
<p>This will bring up a list of networks you are currently connected to.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn5.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2fimage204.png" height="327" width="405" /></p>
<p>If you right-click on any wireless network you will be able to “Show estimated data usage”.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcdn5.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2012%2f03%2fimage205.png" height="348" width="405" /></p>
<p>Now you will be able to see how much data you have used for the current session, it also shows you how long you have been connected to the wireless network for.</p>
