<h2>            Windows 10 File Explorer Column Size NOT really adjustable</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe i am not the only one who wants the size of File Explorer as small as possible, as at times, I would open 2 File Explorers and drag and drop file across.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT File Explorer can't get any smaller than it could, exemplified by snap shot below:</p>
<p>The columns wont get any smaller, even though they are needed to be as large as they are.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96c55d61-b315-4424-877c-43e00dbee427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96c55d61-b315-4424-877c-43e00dbee427" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried to adjust by the pixel, to no avail.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c197cb45-d3c3-4727-88d7-16f17062a00c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c197cb45-d3c3-4727-88d7-16f17062a00c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried "size all to fit", won't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ba36dfa-44d5-481a-9452-4bd71c1cd1d2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ba36dfa-44d5-481a-9452-4bd71c1cd1d2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestion please?</p>

<h2>            Player cards- What do you prefer&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Do you like the custom player cards and being able to purchase whatever or do you like them being tied to challenges?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I personally like making a custom emblem, but I think it would be nice to have cool backgrounds/layers/emblems that you earn through challenges. I liked having a unique hard-to-get emblem in MW2...before the mods</p>

<p>I personally like unlocking things by completing challenges. </p>
<p>Although there are negatives to both ways</p>
<p>Being able to create your own allows idiots to create immature pictures of animal s@x or pictures of male genitalia.</p>
<p>And unlocking hard to get ones by completing challenges creates boosters. </p>
<p>either way it gets annoying. </p>
<p>I never understood why a straight male would create a picture of a pen1s. You would think that they would create a picture of a woman, or lady parts.

<p>i agree with silky half of the people i see have women body parts and the rest is the stupid rabit and donkey one. and yes the boosing would only increase if u made it so people unlocked them by completing challenges. and i like the customization becuase
 i like seeing new playercards everyday :p</p>

<p>How bout making it so all the weapon graphics are unlocked by completing the challenges for the corresponding weapon. Kinda like the weapon titles in mw2. That will make some guns more rare to be seen in emblems than others, as some will be harder to use/
 less popular.</p>

    <title>Issues using external USB DVD R&#47;RW drive on Surface Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dlwraith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues using external USB DVD R&#47;RW drive on Surface Pro &#40;5&#41; Win 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I have a bit of a headscratcher here and am looking for some help working it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro (version 5, from this year. Spec: i7, 256GB, Win 10 Pro, build 1709). I had need of the ability to burn optical media so I purchased an external USB DVD R/W drive. It's a generic one, apparently compatible with Win 10 based on the common-or-garden
 ECD819-SU3 unit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plugged in the drive, windows detected the drive and assigned a Microsoft-signed driver and the drive letter, d:, to the unit. I inserted a disc, Windows started to read the data then......lost the drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drive came back a moment later and allowed me to see the disc's directory listing but whenever I tried to read the data, copy it or similar the drive would either vanish momentarily, interrupting the process or simply sit and wait, never completing the
 task at hand. I can see discs in the drive, I can see the dive in device manager, I can read directory listings, I can even eject discs, but I just can't seem to use the drive in any meaningful way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Burning files to blank discs similarly fails, allowing me to get to the burning phase then waiting for 15 seconds before telling me that the burn couldn't complete. Upon inspecting the disc, no burning has ever taken place and these discs then burn fine
 on other PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The obvious place to look was drivers so I uninstalled, updated and retried the drivers. No joy. Whatever I do Windows 10 always pick the device up as a generic HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GT33N USB device. Looking in the events tab for the device I notice this odd
 warning whenever the DVD drive is plugged in:</p>
<p>============================================================================</p>
Device USBSTOR\CdRom&amp;Ven_HL-DT-ST&amp;Prod_DVDRAM_GT33N&amp;Rev_LT30\30303030303030303030303030303030&amp;0 was not migrated due to partial or ambiguous match.<br />
<br />
Last Device Instance Id: SCSI\CdRom&amp;Ven_Msft&amp;Prod_Virtual_DVD-ROM\2&amp;1f4adffe&amp;0&amp;000001<br />
Class Guid: {4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
Location Path:&nbsp;<br />
Migration Rank: 0xF000FE00FFFFF130<br />
Present: false<br />
Status: 0xC0000719<br />
<p>============================================================================</p>
<p>
</p><p>This warning behaviour exhibits when plugged into the local USB port or into the docking station equally. When I plug this DVD drive into my Win 7 laptop or my girlfriend's Win 8.1 laptop, it works absolutely fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My gut feeling is Windows is selecting the wrong driver for this (certainly, the error seems to suggest this) but because the driver selected does sort of work, the Windows troubleshooters see nothing wrong and the Windows device manager keeps showing this
 device back to the generic driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of the generic plug-and-pray nature of the drive, I can't seem to find any manufacturer's drivers for it.&nbsp; Getting a bit stuck on this one - anyone got a clue on a good next move?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Note: The early issues Win 10 had with internal notebook drives doesn't seem to apply here - device manager has no IDE/ATAPI devices listed (this isn't an IDE device anyway) and sees the dvd drive just fine. I also consistently get a drive letter. As such,
 I haven't resorted to the usual registry edits to bring back the ability to recognise the drive and assign a letter)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connecting an external DVD drive to devices requires intensive power. The USB port you are connecting it to may not be able to sustain the drive, resulting to the problem you are experiencing. We suggest you try connecting the drive to the USB 3.0 port on
 your Surface, or plug in the Surface to a power source as you connect and use the DVD drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the suggestions work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            I have an issue with logging into Fable 3.</h2>
                    I am unable to use Fable 3 because I can't access my account for Windows Live. I have tried changing the password and still can't log in. Another thing I noticed is that when you try to use "forgot password" when trying to log in to Fable 3 you are sent
 to a website that no longer exists. I used to be able to play Fable 3 but I am no longer able to. Is there a way to fix this?<br />

            It's on the PC though. I was sent from the xbox support to windows support to the forums here. I've found that I can play the game but only by creating an offline account so I can't access any online functions or any of the DLC's I purchased on Steam.<br />

    <title>How do I log on to a hidden Admin account from a standard account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryanferdous77  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I log on to a hidden Admin account from a standard account&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, I have hidden my admin account through the use of REGEDIT/LOCALMACHINE/SOFTWARE/MICROSOFT/WINDOWSNT/WINLOGON/CURRENTVERSION/SpecialAccounts/UserList. I created a 32bit DWORD thing and hid the account. It worked and the admin account was hidden from
 the log on screen. But when I tried to unhide the admin account from the standard one, it doesn't work. A message shows up preventing it. I honestly have no idea what to do. Please give me a solution on how to unhide the admin account from the standard one.
 Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you :)

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating or removing that registry key requires an Administrator account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a safety net component in Windows that allows you to boot Safe Mode and if all Administrator have been removed, the built-in Administrator account will appear in the Safe Mode logon screen. I'm not sure if this will work if the only Administrator
 account has been hidden, but it is worth a try.</p>

            Thank you for the information but that is not solving the issue that I'm dealing with. Is there any solution that you know of that will allow &nbsp;me to log in to a hidden account from a standard one other than the safe mode solution you have given? If so
 please share. Thank you again for you time :)

Your question is equivalent to asking "How can the apprentice at the bank gain access to the master key that the director uses?" Of course he can't. The only way to access an admin account is by logging on to a different admin account. If you hid the one and
 only admin account you have then you basically threw the master key away. Most people have a spare admin account to protect them against such incidents.
<div><br />
<div>There are several solutions to your problem:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Use your Windows Repair CD to boot the machine into Repair Mode, then use System Restore to set Windows back to a point before you hid the admin account. You will not need a password for this option.</li><li>Use your Windows Repair CD to boot the machine into Repair Mode, then use regedit.exe to load the System hive of the registry so that you can undo the damage you did. This method requires advanced registry manipulation skills in order to load the correct
 System hive.</li><li>Perform a destructive Factory Restore.</li></ul>

Strange - in your original post you said something different, namely <i>"Please give me a solution on how to unhide the admin account from the standard one."</i>

<p>Wouldn't worry about that, no matter how badly worded the fine print may be there is no requirement to own a tuner or cable/satellite box or idd hock them up to through the systems hdmi pass-through connection.

<p>No, only if you want to use the cable feature on the Xbox One is it needed. &nbsp;Kind of like some of the apps.. &nbsp;If you want to use Netflix it requires a separate subscription through Netflix. &nbsp;It is not needed for the Xbox One to function though.</p>

<p>Um, no. A cable box will NOT be required in order for the xbox one to function. It is only required if you want to use the tv functions, which is honestly a no brainer.

<p>That absolutely can't be right as the cable features aren't supported in all regions. See the little superscripted 1? Where does it have that in the specifications? That's what it'll be referring to, likely its features as a PVR.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">Hmm... Yeah I'm a little confused with the whole HDMI in/out thing.&nbsp; An in port means it's receiving the signal coming
<em>in</em>, and out port means&nbsp;the signal is sent&nbsp;<em>out from</em> that port, right?&nbsp; SO, if I can find a digital cable box with the HMNDI output
<em>optionally</em> to antenna, I'm basically hooking up TV set top box HDMi out to XBox One in, and XBox One out to TVoHDMi in, right?&nbsp; CPlease correct me if i've got any of this wrong.&nbsp; Anywya, problem for me is, my HDTV only has 4 HDMI (2 are already in
 use by XBox 360 and PlayStation 3), the rest are 2 component, 1 av, 1 VGA because I mostly use my computer on this TV, sometimes I use picture in picture to do both, sometimes i just change over imputs I'm watching/using.&nbsp; And so that's basically why I'm hoping
 to find a box with HDMI out <em>optionally</em> for XBox One, maybe still be able to sue the antenna.&nbsp; I'm honestly not sure how all this is going to work.</span></p>

    <title>Error After Downgrading From Windows 10 Back to 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianormond  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error After Downgrading From Windows 10 Back to 7</h2>
                    Today I took my laptop, that was upgraded to Windows 10, and tried to bring it back to Windows 7. I did this because it was making the PC run really slow. I followed the instructions in Windows 10 very carefully on how to uninstall Windows 10 and go back
 to Windows 7.<br />
It took almost three hours for the process to complete but when I tried to re-boot I got a Black Screen with white letters saying I had two choices:<br />
Launch Start-up Repair (Recommended)<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
<br />
I went with Start-up repair and I got some pop-up windows that looked like they were from Windows 98 or Windows NT. Basically it said the repair could not be completed and the computer shut down. Next I tried to do Start Windows Normally and I ended up with
 the same&nbsp; black screen/White letter giving me the same two choices:<br />
Launch Start-up Repair (Recommended)<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
<br />
I then went into BIOS and saw that the boot sequence had the PC looking for the CD/DVD drive first! I changed that to have the sequence start with the HDD, powered on, and still got the same condition.<br />
<br />
I tried the Launch Start-up Repair and this time looked as the results from Diagnosis and Repair. Here is an example of what I saw:<br />
Disk Failure Diagnosis: Fault code 0X0<br />
<br />
Every line of analysis gave the same fault code of 0x0.<br />
<br />
The PC is now totally useless.

            <em>You've probably fixed it by now, but in case anybody else is having this problem, something that worked for me was selecting "advanced options" on the same page where it says Windows couldn't automatically fix the problem; and select "restore from
 image", one of the restore points (my guess is one was created right before Windows 10 was installed). It gave an error message first, so then I selected the very last item on the page, about checking troubleshooting memory disk problems, and somehow it restored
 7. I don't know how, but it worked. Hope this helps for anybody with this issue!

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you referring to Pre-boot authentication?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, then <strong>Pre-Boot Authentication</strong> (<strong>PBA</strong>) or
<strong>Power-On Authentication</strong> (<strong>POA</strong>) serves as an extension of the BIOS or boot firmware and guarantees a secure, tamper-proof environment external to the operating system&nbsp;as a trusted authentication layer. The PBA prevents anything
 being read from the hard disk such as the operating system until the user has confirmed he/she has the correct password or other credentials.

<h2>            Anyview Cast on Hisense TV not connecting to Win10 Home Laptop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to connect my Acer Spin 5 to my Hisense TV with Anyview Cast (Intel WiDi/Miracast) it will try to connect, the TV responds, then it drops out saying Disconnected on the laptop and the TV goes back to "Wait for the external device to connect"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a Windows problem or a Hisense issue that I need to take up with Hisense? It's embarrasing when friends come over and we want to watch a movie and I cant cast my screen from the other side of my kitchen bench, even though the TV is right over the
 bench.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any response will be helpful,</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>&#34;An error occurred while Internet Connection Sharing was being - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshhewitt  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;An error occurred while Internet Connection Sharing was being enabled. &#40;null&#41;&#34;</h2>
                    I am on a Windows 10 PC. I attempt to share 1 Network with another and I get this message: "Internet Connectio Sharing is currently enabled for connection 'ethernet_32773'. I DO NOT have any network named 'ethernet_32773'<br />
<br />
Then after I click OK and select the network I would like to share to I receive the error as listed in the title of this post.<br />
<br />
My Windows Firewall is enabled and set to automatic. Sadly this did not fix my issue.<br />
Please help. Thank you!

            <p>Hi, I got the same problem. Same Error message.</p>
<p>I tried to share a different network, and it didn't show me the error. So I think the problem the Network you're trying to share.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try deleting it and reset the network again.</p>
<p>That worked for me.</p>

<h2>            Super slow download speeds - Open NAT, full signal strength, 60mbs connection...</h2>
                    
<p>Hello!</p>

<p>I just picked up a Sunset Overdrive X1 bundle, and am having issues with my download speeds...</p>
<p>I noticed in "Detailed network statistics" that I am only downloading at 0.82mbs (~440kb/s), but my connection is rated at 60mbs (7000+kb/s)...</p>

<p>- I am connected wirelessly to a router</p>
<p>- My network is tagged as "Open" in X1 network settings.</p>
<p>- My signal strength is seemingly at maximum (100% wireless strength)</p>
<p>- My modem is rated at 60mbs and my PC and cellphone both speedtest.net @ 59-62mbs</p>

<p>Anyone have any ideas as to what's going on? Is this a microsoft issue?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>The best way to fix that is to log into the router settings and change the wireless channel.</p>

<p>like I know Microsoft uses AKAMAI Servers to provide content. So if you connect to a Akamai Server too far away speed goes down.</p>
<p>You can change this if you use a DNS Server in your country.</p>
<p>You can try Open DNS an see if you get better speed.</p>
<p>In Network Settings you can set:</p>
<p>208.67.222.222</p>
<p>208.67.220.220</p>

<p><strong>Hello,</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I recently re-installed Windows 7 proffesional but my keyboard won`t install correctly. I tried with the setup program from steelseries website wich lists Windows 7 as supported, I also tried "troubleshoot compatibility" on the setup program without
 luck, also the Windows Update software list my keyboard drivers as an optional update but that fails to install too.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Both drivers show error 52.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>The keyboard works with the generic "usb input device" drivers but i can`t use any of the advanced keyboard functions and keys</strong></p>
<p><strong>I had to reinstall because i had to change my motherboard, the drivers worked before. Could this be related to the hardware change or a recent windows update?</strong></p>
<p><strong>my current setup: gigabyte 890gpa-ud3h rev.1.0, amd x1055t</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thank you</strong></p>

<div>Hi <strong>Paul</strong>,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Thank you for the detailed information and here lets boot into Advanced Boot Options and disable driver signing checking.&nbsp;</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Advanced Boot Options screen lets you start Windows in advanced troubleshooting modes. You can access the menu by turning on your computer and pressing the F8 key before Windows starts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Disabling driver signature enforcement has helped a lot of users in fixing the issue.
</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may also delete the USB "Upper Filter" &amp; "Lower Filter" Entry and check if that helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Before we go any further, please first backup the Registry.</div>
<div>Important This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious</div>
<div>problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information
 about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</div>

<div>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click “Start”, type “regedit” (without quotation marks) in the “Search” bar and press Enter.
<br />
Note: If UAC (User Account Control) pops up, please accept it. <br />
2. Right click “Computer” (the root node) in the left pane, click “Export” under the “File” menu, choose “All” under “Export range”, and select “Desktop” in the “Save” in box and type backup in “File Name”. Click “Save”.
<br />
Note: The backup file is on the Desktop and named backup.reg. We can simply restore the registry by double-clicking the backup.reg file.
<br />
3. Click “Start”, type “regedit” (without quotation marks) in the “Search” bar and press Enter again.<br />
4. Locate the “UpperFilters” value under the following key in the registry: <br />
<strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{36FC9E60-C465-11CF-8056-444553540000}<br />
</strong>5. On the “Edit” menu, click “Delete”, and then click “OK”.<br />
6. Locate the “LowerFilters” value under the same key in the registry: <br />
<strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{36FC9E60-C465-11CF-8056-444553540000}
<br />
</strong>7. On the “Edit” menu, click “Delete”, and then click “OK”.<br />
8. Quit Registry Editor and restart the computer.</div>

<h2>            Microphone problem with newest version of Skype, with a twist&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 user</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using Skype for years and never got any problem using it. Sometimes, the connection while chatting would drop, but that would be quickly solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently installed the latest version of Skype. This version, for some reason, cannot detect the microphone of my headset (tells me my microphone 'isn't working' and suggests I plug it in using another port). I've tried every troubleshooting trick I could
 find, to no avail: my sound drivers are up-to-date; my microphone is properly configured and tested on Windows; yes, I've already rebooted the Windows Audio!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of spite (more than curiosity), I reinstalled in parallel to the new version the old ('classic') version of Skype. And lo! my microphone is detected by that version and I can converse again with my friends!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This post is more of a complaint than a question: I'm going to use the 'classic' version until it's no more useable for the forseeable future. But since this is the only way of 'contacting' Skype and getting an answer (way to go with the customer service!),
 I'm left with no choice but to expose my issue for all the world to see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder, still, whether someone would have a suggestion to make regarding this issue...</p>

</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your feedback. We understand how it is important for you to be able to use an application which have an option to configure the device you prefer to use. Unfortunately, in Skype for Windows 10(new version) audio configuration is not available.
 This option is only available in Skype for Windows Desktop(classic version). However, rest assured we will let the Community know if there will be an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post. Thank you!

    <title>Signed out in Skype when opening Windows Live Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stefenhudson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Signed out in Skype  when opening Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    <p>So, I've started noticing this issue for the past week now, about the time when Skype Kit was retired.</p>
<p>For no logical reason I can think of, opening Windows Live Mail will sometimes cause me to be signed out of Skype. This seems to happen if I open Mail a certain number of times after signing back into Skype. Needless to say it's just a little annoying. Has
 anyone else had this problem and/or know of a solution?</p>
<p>I'm running Windows Vista 32-bit with Skype 6.18.0.106 and of course windows Live Mail.</p>

            <p>Hi Margor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting back. We've tried to simulate this issue on our end (logged in to Windows 8.1 PC using a Microsoft account) but we didn't encounter the same. With this, we'd like you to repair Windows Essentials to isolate that there are no corrupted
 files in the system. To do this, please refer below:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> button +
<strong>R</strong>, input <strong>AppWiz.cpl</strong>, then click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Search for <strong>Windows Essentials 2012</strong> on the list and then select it.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Uninstall/Change.</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Repair all Windows Essentials programs</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>Furthermore, you mentioned that you have Windows 8.1, may I know what type of account did you use to login to your PC, is it a local account, or a Microsoft account? If you are using a local account, do you encounter the same issue when logging in via Microsoft
 account? We need this info for isolation purposes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll wait for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Glenda</p>

    <title>problems upgrading from windows 8.1 to windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            problems upgrading from windows 8.1 to windows 10</h2>
                    after various aborted attempts at the upgrade, I finally got through the download and processing stages. The final stage seems to&nbsp; be when a large circle appears with a completion percentage in the middle. It starts by opening files and I get to 80% open,
 with the completion percentage up to 24% --- then "restoring your previous version of Windows " -- and after a few minutes we are back to square 1 having wasted 3 hours getting this far. Any Ideas ??

            <p>I have had just the same problem with my HP Pavilion laptop. I have worked through all the various procedures in your reply, including the procedure for stopping and restarting BITS etc. three times. I had previously tried various other solutions floated
 in this and other forums. Nothing works. And I have tried about twenty times to use the media creation tool from memory stick. That doesn't work because, after it has downloaded Windows 10 and before it begins to install it, it pauses to download updates to
 8.1, which takes us back to the same utterly stuck situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The history of this PC is that I bought it, in the first half of 2014 from PC World, it was running 8.0. That didn't seem a problem, given that the free upgrade to 8.1 was already available. But 8.1 would not install. Finally, my IT man took it away an with
 difficulty (he said) got the 8.1. upgrade to install. But the same problem has reasserted itself with the upgrade to 10. Windows Updates, set to automatic, works satisfactorily for other updates, but cannot cope with an OS upgrade.</p>
