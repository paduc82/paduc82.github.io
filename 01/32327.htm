<h2>            file history - windows 8 - backing up for the first time - going on a month now...</h2>
                    I just started trying Windows 8 file history.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm backing up to a NAS drive (buffalo terastation).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I enabled the feature, and not too unreasonably, much functionality was disabled at first - with the warning diagnostic "File History is saving copies of your files for the first time".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>OK - I can live with that. But - its been giving me that message now for about a month. I can manually look at the network drive, and see lots of stuff backed up there.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can look in the event log, and it occasionally tells me it backed up some file or other (after having earlier given a warning/error about failing to backup that file).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also - about once a day - see a message like:</div>
<div>+<span>
</span>Unable to scan user libraries for changes and perform backup of modified files for configuration C:\Users\Lewis\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\FileHistory\Configuration\Config</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>OR</div>
<div>+<span>
</span>Unusual condition was encountered during finalization of a backup cycle for configuration C:\Users\Lewis\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\FileHistory\Configuration\Config</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Needless to say, this so far as been a huge waste of time, and not a useful feature addition.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
                </div>

            <p>Thank you for saying this:&nbsp; "0xC004C003 means the activation server determined the specified product key is in use."&nbsp; Some other Microsoft employees say that the activation servers are overloaded, or that I did something wrong in installing the upgrade,
 etc.&nbsp; Mr. Srninivasa, you are the only one who says the key itself has a problem.&nbsp; THEREFORE I NEED YOUR HELP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One PC that I am trying to upgrade came with Windows 7 Starter preinstalled.&nbsp; The Windows 7 Starter key is OEM not MAK.&nbsp; Windows 7 Starter was activated (phone activation succeeded 3 times; the last time was after figuring out that the hard drive needed
 replacing and it worked).&nbsp; Windows Update was up to date with all updates.&nbsp; The reservation for upgrade to Windows 10 Home was a successful reservation but the download didn't start yet.&nbsp; While Windows 7 was running, I attached a USB DVD drive, inserted a
 Windows 10 Home DVD (burned from an ISO download from Microsoft), and executed setup.exe from within Windows 7.&nbsp; The upgrade process worked without any visible problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Windows 10 says it's unactivated.&nbsp; The error code is 0xC004C003 and the explanation is that the key is blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is a valid, activated (though phone activated) Windows 7 Starter key treated as a MAK key?&nbsp; It is from the sticker on a PC, an LG X200 which was made for sale in Lebanon (also made for sale in LG's home country of South Korea, and Brazil).&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not
 think the key is pirated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"slui.exe 4" brings up a phone activation screen like Windows 7 had, but the automated response for Windows 10 says "activation error".</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 days, around 30 failures to activate, and counting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The correct upgrade path is Windows 10 Home, right?&nbsp; How can I get this thing activated?&nbsp; My wife was hoping to return it to her relative this week.</p>

            This is the error code. &nbsp;I have been on the phone all week with Microsoft. &nbsp;I upgraded from 8.1 to 10. &nbsp;Windows 10 would not activate. &nbsp;I was told to do a clean install then. &nbsp;I have done that. &nbsp;The activation will still not working. &nbsp;Now I have been told
 since I clean installed, which I was told to do, my windows 8.1 is no longer valid. &nbsp;I do not have a disk since it was pre-installed. &nbsp;So I MUST PURCHASE a new one. &nbsp;I was never told a clean install would do this!!! &nbsp;I was told this was FREE!!! &nbsp;I don't understand
 how you can tell me to do a clean install, not tell me this would happen and knowing my computer was pre-installed, take my 8.1 away and not allow me to upgrade. &nbsp;

            I'm experiencing the same issue.&nbsp; My network drivers were hosed when I did my update, and the roll back to 8.1 failed.&nbsp; 8.1 came pre-installed on my MS Surface pro 3, and once I did the clean install to 10 it is not activating.&nbsp; Microsoft keeps telling
 me that it will activate "within 24-48 hours", but as I had to do a clean install I'm very much doubting this will work.&nbsp; There has to be a way to get your key when the software came pre-installed on the machine.

            <p>Also the same issue I used the upgrade software to install Windows 7 on my PC. The code was valid and activated for several months before the upgrade. After the install I couldn't get the Ethernet connection to activate. After struggling for some time I
 downloaded the upgrade tool directly from the Microsoft webpage and did a clean install. This got my computer to successfully install windows 10 and its drivers. But almost a full week in and still it claims I need to activate Windows 10. What gives?</p>

<span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft
 Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key
</span></span><span><span>you already own</span></span><span><span>to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hello Sauli,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and we regret for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that you are unable to rollback to your previous operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be helpful for us if you let us know the current difficulties you are experiencing with Windows 10. In case there are any issues, we would try to provide you with ideas and resolutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, let's try to start from the beginning and see if I can walk you through easy and simpler steps to resolve the issue with Rollback in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)"><span>Firstly, to go back from Windows 10 to previous version of Windows, you'll need to:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">Keep everything in the windows.old and $windows.~bt folders after the upgrade.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">Remove any user accounts you added after the upgrade.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">Know the password you used to sign in to Windows&nbsp;7 or Windows&nbsp;8.1 (if you used one).</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">Have the USB drive you used to upgrade to Windows&nbsp;10 (if you used one).
</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>So, pertaining to the situation you are in, there can be two scenarios under which you will face such issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Scenario 1</span></p>
<p>You have modified<strong> Windows.old</strong>, <strong>$Windows.~BT </strong>
and <strong>$Windows.~WS </strong>folders required by the system to perform the rollback operation. These modification can adversely affect the rollback feature in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Scenario 2</span></p>
<p>You have created a new user profile after setting up Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case,&nbsp;y<span>ou will need to delete the account or accounts (if more than one was created) that are specified in this screen before the customer can go back.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>IMPORTANT: Before deleting the user account please make sure to back up any data that is associated with that user profile (Documents, Music, Videos etc.) as deleting the account will also delete the data associated with that user profile</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Again, if during the course of troubleshooting you enabled the <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">built-in hidden Admin Account
</span></strong>(which cannot be ‚Äúdeleted‚Äù) and it is listed as the account that needs to be removed you can remove the profile by doing the following.</span></p>
<span>1. Disable Hidden Admin account<br />
2. Press (Windows Key + R) and type <strong><em><span>sysdm.cpl</span></em></strong><em><span>‚Äì
</span></em>this will bring up System Properties<br />
3. Click on <em><span>Advanced</span></em> tab<br />
4. Click on <em><span>Settings</span></em>&nbsp; under the User Profiles section<br />
5. On the User Profiles dialog select the &lt;COMPUTER NAME&gt;\Administrator account and click&nbsp; on Delete ‚Äì confirm the delete</span>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However, if the above does not apply, follow the below methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This issue may happen due to system file corruption. I suggest you to run System file checker. System File checker (SFC) scan is done to check if there are any corrupted system files that could be causing this issue. Kindly follow
 the below given steps:</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The disk is normally being shown for 80-90% of its original capacity. For Windows tools that will help us manage the size of hard drives and its partitions, refer to the following articles:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc770943%28v=ws.11%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Disk management</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc771473%28v=ws.11%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Extend a Basic Volume</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731894%28v=ws.11%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Shrink a Basic Volume</a></strong><br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Considering the fact that there's a percentage not being shown by Windows 10 or any of its tools, we can look into the page file as one of the major contributors of the hidden/missing percentage. See this

<h2>            Windows 10 Start Button has mouse buttons reversed</h2>
                    <p>Recently reinstalled Windows 10 on my Toshiba Laptop. Now my mouse buttons are reversed BUT only on the start button. In every other program, and windows menu, the left button does what I expect, and the right button does what I expect.</p>
<p>To shutdown the laptop, I have to right click the start button, choose power etc etc. Help! (please)</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 s Will Not Start Up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> silvereagle08  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 s Will Not Start Up</h2>
                    
<p>I have an Xbox 360 slim that I bought back in November of 2010, never had a single problem with it till now.</p>
<p>I was playing a few indy games, then began to play L.A. Noire, this was were the trouble started.</p>
<p>I loaded a level and began to play, I noticed it was kind of slow while playing, then the screen went blank and my controller lost connection with the system.</p>
<p>I shut off the system and turned it back on,</p>
<p>- There is a Green light on the system, though there wasn't a green light circle to show it is starting up</p>
<p>- It will not sync with the controller, even though it would respond when trying to reconnect it, it will not connect</p>
<p>- There is a green light on the power block (I have tried leaving it unplugged and plugging it back in after 30 seconds, still does not work)</p>
<p>- The tray will open and close with no problem</p>
<p>- There is no connection with the TV at all (I have tried both HD and standard connections)</p>
<p>- When turning on the system, there is no start up sound</p>
<p>I would call myself an avid gamer, but I play in moderation (I do not play for 24 hours straight)</p>
<p>It would seems to run fine, only there is no connection with the controller and there is no picture on the screen.</p>
<p>Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!!</p>

<p>Okay, it sounds like your console may be in need of a repair, but there's a few things we can check first just to be sure.<br />
<br />
First off, double check that the TV is on the correct input. Then, with the console hooked up to the display, try
<a href="http://xbx.lv/dl6vbV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">resetting video</a>, to see if that allows any sound or video to come through.<br />
<br />
As for the controller, make sure you're pressing the sync buttons on both the controller and&nbsp;the console to establish a connection. If you are, you may want to try a wired controller, or a Plug &amp; Play kit, just to see if that has the same issue.<br />
<br />
Like I said, though, it sounds like the console will likely need a repair. If none of these steps resolve your issue, then you can use
<a href="http://xbx.lv/alhhR6%20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this site</a> to set one up, as well as check your warranty status.</p>

<h2>            CDC MBIM adapter is not listed anywhere when updating to the latest version of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>not long ago i bought a tablet (cheap one) , AllView Wi8g from some Romanian manufacturer with preinstalled Windows 10. Bought it mainly for watching movies, listening to music and internet while i'm outside, as it supports SIM card. Anyway, it came preinstalled
 with Windows 10 home and kept continuously asking me to update, so today i decided to update (to, what a friend called 'Windows 10 Anniversary' or something, the latest version the 'old' Windows detected via Windows updates ) . After the update process completed,
 everethyng went fine, BUT... There was no 'cellular' in the Networks icon in the tray , Network Settings, the Device manager now saw 5-6 more virtual devices and the WiFi card, and no sign of the Cellular one. I decided to revert back to the old Windows 10
 and everything went fine, when i opened the Device manager, the Cellular adapter was labeled as CDC MBIM and worked properly. What should i do to make it working in the latest version of Win10? As well as i know, Win10 has already preinstalled drivers for
 the CDC protocol, but just does not see the device. Googled, there are a bunch of useless answers such as "Click on Network adapters and change the driver", but what what there is no unknown device, only wireless one shown?</p>
<p>My thoughts are, is there an option to manually add a device.</p>
<p>My other thoughs are, shouldn't the 'new' windows take the driver settings about the devices from the previous one?</p>
<p>P.S. Oh, yeah, forgot to mention, there is absolutely no cooperation from this AllView company.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Alex</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It could be that Windows 10 has not been successfully updated through Windows update. You can download the Anniversary update using the media creation tool instead. To do so, kindly download Media Creation Tool by clicking
<strong><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></strong>. After doing so, follow the steps provided under the option

    <title>No Windows logo key or Alt key on a tablet on-screen keyboard. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john cb  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Windows logo key or Alt key on a tablet on-screen keyboard.</h2>
                    Hi, I have an Asus Vivo Tab Smart ME400C 64GB Tablet running Windows 8.1 the default on-screen keyboard does not display the Windows logo key or the Alt keys.<br />
The on-screen keyboard has a button in the lower right that allows the user to select different keyboard layouts but the icon that displays, what would appear to be a more detailed keyboard is greyed out.
<br />
I suspect this greyed out icon if active would provide a more comprehensive keyboard with the Windows logo key and Alt keys.
<br />
Could anyone assist with how I would enable this particular keyboard layout so I can utilise the Windows logo key and Alt keys.<br />

<h2>            Vista crashes when playing spider solitaire</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Well Vista crashed again while playing spider solitaire.&nbsp; I checked Problems &amp; Solutions in the control panel and it says that the problem was caused by ATI graphics driver and there are no solutions at this time.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I hope someone can find a solution for me.<br />
<br />
Thanks

&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not aware of any of the posters having this problem resolved yet. I have been waiting for someone to post details of there Blue Screen error messages so that we can start to find the cause of the crashes.
<br />
<br />
Sister42 started another thread on this issue with a little more error information from her system. She has an problem report showing up saying that her ATI drivers had a failure.
<br />
http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en/vistagaming/thread/9857d13d-c5fa-42da-b526-161f44125189<br />
<br />
Any error information you can gather will help to get this resolved. <br />
Places to check.<br />
1. Problems Reports and Solutions (In control panel)<br />
2. If you get the Blue Screen crash... All Information from this screen.<br />
3. Event Viewer under Application and/or system. (looking for error messages that might apply to this situation)<br />
<br />
Let me know if you have any new information

                    <p>OT: Please help me with this BSOD minidump analysis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>WinDbg keeps specifying that the ntkrnlmp.exe is causing the BSOD, but I know that this is a windows component. I've run SFC /scannow and it looks like the drivers are up to date. This machine is running a dedicated security camera viewing program, the processor
 and available memory do not get anywhere close to where they might be forcing the system to crash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the specs:</p>

            <p>Hello Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest driver update I changed has made it so that now the crashes are occurring about every 2 hours instead of every 20 minutes which is an improvement, but hardly a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here is the link for my system and application events on the machine.</strong></p>
<p>

<p><span><span>It is always sensible in this situation to run a check for malware</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry
 tool. Do not use this tool as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only -not the Trial version ‚Äìwatch the checked boxes whilst installing), update definitions
 and run in normal mode. Disable other security software whilst you are doing scans.<br />

<p><span><span>Please make certain you
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please upload a copy of the report on what it found as a shared file to your OneDrive and a post a link here.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please download and run ADWCleaner and upload a copy of the report produced to your OneDrive. Remove all that it finds. :<br />

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you take the precaution of creating a system restore point before running ADWCleaner, to guard against unforeseen consequences. Select Start, Control Panel,

    <title>Game Pass gamesharing stopped&#63; SOG - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Game Pass gamesharing stopped&#63; SOG</h2>
                    <p>My friends and I were playing Sea of Thieves online. Previously, one of the friends allowed me, with permission, to add his account onto my Xbox, make it his home Xbox and he shared his games with me. He also subscribed to Game Pass, which in turn, by MS standards and allowances, to share that with me. As of seven minutes ago, we were playing the game just fine before, with no warning, I was kicked, with the message popping up: "<strong>Sign in or renew the subscription</strong> Sign in with the profile used to buy this game, and make sure your subscription to Xbox Live Gold or EA&nbsp;Access is up to date. (0x803f900a)"</p><p><br /></p><p>Now, my Gold is up to date. As is my friend's. I attempted signing into his profile to see if the thing needed to 'update' or whatever, but no luck. It still will not allow me to play any game from Game Pass.</p><p><br /></p><p>Save Our Game, please and thank you.</p>

    <title>Remove Windows NT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lakshmanjay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remove Windows NT</h2>
                    
<p>(Q1)I have loaded windows XP&nbsp;in my laptop, when I boot up the machine, it always gives me the options to select either NT or XP. I tend to believe that NT is still active in my machine. I want to completely remove NT from my machine thus reliveing the disk
 space for XP to run efficently.</p>
<p>(Q2) My harddisk is partitioned into 2 segments C: and D:, C: space is 90% used whereas D: is 2%. C: is formatted for NTFS and D: NAT. How can I integrate these partitions so that both can share OR delete the D partition. D: contains two folders namely CABS
 and INSTAL. Please let me know what these two folders are, or&nbsp;containing NT stuff or XP stuff</p>

<p>It doesn't sound like you have NT active in a dual-boot. Use the System Configuration Utility to check the boot paths.</p>
<p><span>Start&gt;Run&gt;msconfig [enter]<br />
<br />
This brings up the System Configuration Utility. I believe the "check boot path" button is on the boot.ini tab. Just look for it. You don't need to restart immediately, but the next time you do you'll get a dialog saying you've used the Utility. Just tick the
 box that says in effect, "don't bother me about this again".</span></p>
<p><span>To merge the two partitions without losing anything on C:\ you would need to use third-party partitioning software. I use Acronis Disk Director but there are others. Gparted is free.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now we are bringing <strong>Skype for Business Online features and functionality into</strong>

    <title>Minecraft Windows 10 Edition crashes upon pressing play - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chibisteak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Minecraft Windows 10 Edition crashes upon pressing play</h2>
                    Minecraft for Windows 10 for some reason crashes upon pressing play on the front screen. The game itself boots up just fine however the second I press play the screen freezes for a second or two before the cursor shows up and indicates a loading icon before
 simply crashing. This does not happen on any other version of the game on different platforms. I have run a Windows troubleshoot on Windows Store apps but it has given me no results. I've updated everything, my drivers, the app, and Windows itself. This is
 very frustrating as it's worked perfectly fine in the past.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to follow the method mentioned below and check if that helps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></span><span><span>: If updating the drivers
 did not work,&nbsp;try reinstalling the video card driver:&nbsp;Open </span></span><span><strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong></span><span><span>,
 right-click (or tap and hold)&nbsp;the video card driver, and select </span></span><span><strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong></span><span><span>.
 Restart your PC, and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>:
</span><span><span>Repair and reset the app: Select the
</span></span><span><strong><span>Start</span></strong></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>button
 &gt; </span></span><span><strong><span>Settings</span></strong></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&gt;
</span></span><span><strong><span>Apps&nbsp;</span></strong></span><span><span>&gt;
</span></span><span><strong><span>Apps &amp; features</span></strong></span><span><span>. Select the app that's not
 working, and then select&nbsp;</span></span><span><strong><span>Advanced options</span></strong></span><span><span>.
 On the page that opens with information about the app, select </span></span><span><strong><span>Repair</span></strong></span><span><span>.
 (Note: Some apps don't have this option.) If repairing the app doesn't fix the problem, select&nbsp;</span></span><span><strong><span>Reset</span></strong></span><span><span>.
 &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong></span><span><span>:
 Uninstall and reinstall the app:&nbsp;Select the </span></span><span><strong><span>Start</span></strong></span><span><span>button.
 In the list of apps, right-click&nbsp;the one that's not working, select </span></span><span><strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong></span><span><span>,
 and select&nbsp;</span></span><span><strong><span>Uninstall&nbsp;</span></strong></span><span><span>again to confirm. To
 reinstall the app, select the </span></span><span><strong><span>Start&nbsp;</span></strong></span><span><span>button
 &gt; </span></span><span><strong><span>Microsoft Store&nbsp;</span></strong></span><span><span>&gt;
