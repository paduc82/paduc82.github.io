<h2>            Winamp freezes, blocking Windows 10 version 1809</h2>
                    <p>got this freezing .. now 2nd time .. 1st time was more dramatically - system, UI, completely became blocked, after a while, firstly it making entire system slow, while gaming &amp; i about gaming all time, after while looking around wtf is that .. the opened
 new windows(programs) also becoming froze, after the opened, then trying to access Task Manager to end any wanted task &amp; game as to safe stuff in, from being attacked freely, .. task manager also down - no interaction(s) is possible .. entire system went down
 - no interactions are possible &amp; everything is opened, .. watched time, task bar, it was some 11.31 while physical time 11.51 .. so, 20 mins time in task bar was frozen, .. assumed - maybe some freak-hack punched my notebook, ..</p>
<p>this now 2nd time .. listened as ever Winamp with music &amp; .. it is .. its abnormal behavior .. same time issue, &amp; winamp stuck at certain level .. close to end of reproducing, but doesn't coming to end .. one more unknown origin sound became added to winamp
 reproduction .. opened Task Manager - a bit glitching, no interact, freezing, .. stopped to concern it .. pushed from task bar to close winamp - no reaction, .. bullsht is continuing .. finished gaming &amp; secured stuff - turned game off &amp; entire glitch also
 turned off - winamp became closed &amp; system took its time back to current .. </p>
<p>hmmm.. dunno .. what more?! .. <br />
game is EvE Online .. however, i don't trust these as proper Game Space .. it has some grave issues .. with audio too .. as reproduction of russian language stuff through EvE Online Space ..

            Hello my name is Bradford and I'm an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community and I will try to resolve your problem. 
<br />
<br />As far as I know, Winamp's development has struggled in recent years. 
<br />
<br />The original developers have just released " Winamp 5.‚àû " which is available from the website below, please note the disclaimer. 
<br />
<br />Note: This is a non-Microsoft website. The page appears to be providing accurate, safe information. Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products).

<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.winamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.winamp.com/</a>
<br />
<br />If you are no longer comfortable using Winamp there is a replacement for it just named "AIMP". "AIMP" supports all of WinAmps former plugins and skins and is an active modding community with new skins and new features available. It lacks Winamp's built-in internet radio feature but that might have recently changed, please note the disclaimer and AIMP is available at the link below:

            Hello Mental, 
<br />
<br />I really think you should try "AIMP" I mentioned, besides it is to use all of Winamps skins and plugins, I just double checked and it DOES HAVE INTERNET RADIO. Below is the link to AIMP's list of features available in Windows 10. 
<br />

<br />When I left Winamp several years ago (I was a fan of Winamp since it's the first version and it pained me to leave it as well) AIMP was recommended at the time.

<h3> charliebly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio issues with only the left side of headphones&#47;earphones work.</h2>
                    <p>Recently I've noticed that my laptop had issues with the audio when I plugged in my headphones and realised the left side of the headphones only work. This isn't the headphones issue, as I tried it on my phone and it worked perfectly fine, but when I plugged
 it in my laptop, it only played on the left side. I've tried multiple earphones with this laptop and still had the same issue. It's weird because it was working fine until 1-2 weeks ago. I've also tried reinstalling the driver, and updating but still has no
 change. I also tried to go to levels&gt;balance to check if the right side wasn't turned up, but still everything I tried didn't work. I really need some help as I need both sides to work so I can produce music.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Charlie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The port of the device could be the culprit why only the left side of your headphones works. A hardware or software changes could also be the reason for this kind of issue. However, let's not assume anything yet until we isolated your concern. We suggest
 that you run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter in Windows Settings. Simply search for
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong> in the start menu. Under <strong>Find and fix other problems</strong>, click on
<strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>. We also suggest that you run the audio test for your headphones in Hardware and Sound. Here are the steps on how to do so:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to Control Panel, then click on <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Sound</strong>, click on <strong>Manage audio devices</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Headphones</strong>, then <strong>Configure </strong>at the bottom right.</li><li>Run the test, and see if both sides of your headphones are working there.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you think this was useful, feel free to "<em><strong>mark it as an answer</strong></em>" to help those who are facing the same problem.</p>
<p>

<p>Ha, yea, I had to at least ask. Had a guy one time that plugged his HDMI cable into the motherboard socket and couldn't figure out why his dedicated graphics card wasn't projecting to his HDTV. In his defense, it was a brand new PC and he just did a rush
 job of hooking it up. In the end we both got a good laugh out of that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can try, if you haven't already, a different set of headphones in the devices jack (socket) I've experienced that some 3.5mm (stereo) pins can be problematic with some sockets, conversely, 3.5mm (stereo) sockets (or wire/circuit connections to) sometimes
 do go bad.</p>

</p><p>In other words remember, the basics are still the basics.</p>

<p>LOL we all make mistakes right? hahaha&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I wish that was the case, but I've literally tried it with every headphone I have owned. :( It's been an annoying issue because I can't get the full experience on my speakers with one side only playing. Welp guess I just gotta get used to it&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Nah, maybe not. There are some more things that we can try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets start with dumping and reinstalling the audio driver. Right-click on your Start Button and select Device Manager. Then, expand the Sound, video, and game controller (or similarly worded) heading. If you recognize your audio device there (if your not
 sure let me/us know what the entries are) then right-click on it and select Uninstall device, then follow the prompts to uninstall the device and then do a restart (not a shutdown and start) of Windows. After restarting Windows will recognize new hardware
 and will install the driver that it likes through Windows update, this may take a few minutes.</p>
<p>If the problem still remains then in your next reply include the exact Make and full model description of your device as well as the installed driver info from the properties window accessed from within Devise Manager.</p>

    <title>Windows Update pushed Intel Graphics Driver update version - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hippybikergeek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update pushed Intel Graphics Driver update version 2.0.19.15.4531 to Dell laptop, and broke video settings</h2>
                    <p><span>Thought you should know since I expect folks might start asking questions about this.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This happened to most of my team yesterday and myself this morning.</span></p>
<p><span>On November 2nd, Windows Update pushed down a 74MB Intel Graphics Driver update version 2.0.19.15.4531.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This driver appears to think our Dell 6440 laptops with two external screens attached actually&nbsp;have 7-8 screens attached, and that we want them all to duplicate their display settings.
</span><span>Unfortunately it won‚Äôt let us change the video settings to something usable.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The fix is to remove this driver from the list in ‚ÄúPrograms and Features‚Äù control panel applet, and then reboot the system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>At this time (11/3/16 @9:25am PDT) - We're beginning to see this driver being reinstalled to our laptops.</span></p>
<p><span>Disabling "other Microsoft Products" and enabling "Defer feature updates" doesn't prevent this driver from being pushed down again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This likely will become an very annoying cycle of install/uninstall/reboot for each user until this is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>FWIW: The ‚Äúlast known good‚Äù version of this driver before this update was 2.0.19.15.4331, and is about 3MB in size.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>11/09/16 - Update</span></p>
<p>Our team has found that we can "hide" this update so it won't install and we now have stable systems again.</p>
<p>Use the wushowhide.diagcab tool to hide the update titled "Intel Corporation driver update for Intel(R) HD Graphics 4600".</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 time incorrect by many seconds, sometimes fast sometimes slow</h2>
                    I need time accurate to the second.&nbsp; Windows 7 let me manually update to GMT time to the second.&nbsp; How can I do that in Windows 10?&nbsp; My mother board battery is not the problem!&nbsp; I tried "change date and time" but it does not allow seconds to be updated,
 if seconds are 30 seconds off it stays 30 seconds off after manual update.&nbsp; What gives?&nbsp;

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps there is a level of corruption within the system that could be causing the issue. However, you should still be able to change the time down to the second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do so, open <strong>Control Panel</strong> through the Start menu. Click <strong>
Clock, Language, and Region</strong> &gt; <strong>Set the time and date</strong> &gt; <strong>
Change date and time</strong>. It looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0726c1f4-2132-4da4-8f5b-5ff46bbd7516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0726c1f4-2132-4da4-8f5b-5ff46bbd7516" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need admin privileges to access this setting. Once the new window opens, you may change the time down to the seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can verify that this is possible on the Fall Creators Update, the latest version of Windows 10. So, it should also be available for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, let us know. Also, kindly send us a screenshot of the issue.</p>

<p>Also - If the clock is not staying in sync, try not using the default Internet Time -
<em>time.windows.com</em></p>
<p>(If you have Control Panel set to Small Icons view you will be looking for Date and Time).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- My <em>Date and Time</em> Window includes an <em>Internet Time</em> tab (don't know why the one above does not? ).</p>
<p>In the<em> Change Settings</em> button select an option from your region.</p>
<p>For me this is&nbsp;<em> time.nist.gov.</em></p>
<p><br />
- But how do we get seconds to display on the Taskbar clock ?<br />

    <title>After Windows 10 Updgrade Taskbar&#38;Search doesn&#39;t work, Start - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deadbird8  say:</h3>
<h2>            After  Windows 10 Updgrade Taskbar&#38;Search doesn&#39;t work, Start menu Doesn&#39;t work,  DISM Error&#58; 0x800f081f</h2>
                    <p>I just&nbsp;made the HUGE MISTAKE of&nbsp;taking&nbsp;the WIN10 "upgrade"&nbsp;on a week old laptop.&nbsp; This is a DELL Latitude 3550 which Dell proclaims is compatible with Windows&nbsp;10.&nbsp;&nbsp;My last PC upgrade from WIN 8.1 to WIN10 had so many problems I ended up replacing the PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 When the PC restarted after the WIN 10 install&nbsp;I <strong>cannot:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Use the START menu</strong>- click and nothing happens</p>
<p><strong>Use the Taskbar </strong>(like&nbsp;Search,&nbsp;Sound, or &nbsp;WiFi)&nbsp; I am only allowed to access the apps pinned to the taskbar.
</p>
<p>No errors were presented&nbsp;after the WIN10 'upgrade' completed.&nbsp; I went to the&nbsp;DELL site and downloaded and installed all the WIN10 compatible drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spent hours pouring over the countless instances of this problem outlined on the web on forums from here and just about every other Windows&nbsp;site.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lots of things to try but eventually they seem to end up telling you to 'restore health' .&nbsp;&nbsp; However,
 when 'restore health' fails the trail goes cold and&nbsp;I can't find where to go next.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the powershell&nbsp;commands in Admin mode;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>sfc /scannow</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; (get lots of errors-&nbsp; this is on a fresh install!!)</p>
<p><strong>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth</strong></p>
<p><strong>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>"restore health" fails with:</p>
<p><strong>Error: 0x800f081f</strong></p>
<p><strong>The source files could not be found.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to run the 'Troubleshooter' but it seems you have to 'search' for it and part of the problem is<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> Search is Not Working</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did click a link to run 'Troubleshooter' off of one of the MS support sites
 in a reply to a similar problem description&nbsp;but got a window saying 'my OS is WIN10 and troubleshooter wasn't for my version of windows'-&nbsp; the troubleshooter ran and just like the last time I had a problem in WIN10 on my other PC- it dutifully&nbsp;flagged an error,
 but didn't fix it- NICE!&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am stuck-&nbsp; I didn't hide the files, this was a fresh install. Microsoft did the upgrade and it obviously didn't go well but no error messages were&nbsp;flagged or any info on what to do was presented. &nbsp; I can't seem to find what you do next to help the
 WIN 10 OS find the files that the WIN 10 installer was SUPPOSED to put on this machine.&nbsp; &nbsp;How do you get out of this short of rolling back to WIN8.1?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really just like to have something work&nbsp;after a&nbsp;WIN10&nbsp;install or&nbsp;'upgrade'&nbsp;without me having to research for hours and run a bunch of&nbsp;esoteric commands in some command shell to get BASIC FUNCTIONALITY working.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will state the obvious if you didn't
 get it from my tone in this post-&nbsp; I am VERY frustrated.&nbsp; </p>

                    <p>Hi Microsoft users,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem that many users of Windows 10 faced: File explorer not responding.</p>
<p>Mine stop responding whenever I select any of the Office files (Powerpoint, Excel, Word) but not other file types (pdf, jpg etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have encountered similar problem and know the fix to solve this issue. Interim period, I will open the file through the office applications. Really inconvenient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            disable your antivirus (temporarily), update your IDE drivers (hard disk, optical drive) or SSD firmware.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: file explorer options 
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Under the General tab, click in the Open File Explorer to then choose  "This PC". 
<br />
<br />Try WinKey + E now. If it opens fine, then the problem is with Quick access cache, which can be cleared by deleting *.automaticDestinations-ms from the following directory, using Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: %AppData%
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Then navigate to that folder. 
<br />
<br />Could be an issue with your display driver.
<br />
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Display adapters
<br />Right click the current display adapter
<br />Click Uninstall
<br />Exit Device Manager
<br />Restart

            Hi GermanyStcz 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Free upgrade was over around 3 years back. Now, there is no upgrade option. Only way is to buy a fresh license with full price and do a clean install of Windows.
<br />
<br />Best place to buy Windows 10 license is Microsoft Store. Click below to buy it from Microsoft
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/windows</a>
<br />
<br />You will find that there are many online sites selling very cheap licenses, don't fall for them as majority of the times, keys expire after some time. 
<br />
<br />Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10 - <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10startfresh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            There‚Äôs some users who state you can still upgrade for free by using a Windows 7/8/8.1 key. Otherwise you‚Äôd have to purchase Windows 10 upgrade for $119 US/¬£99 UK (other Countries will have a different cost).
<br />If you try the free upgrade I recommend saving an image of the drive first in case of problems via Macrium Reflect or your preferred backup option - if you go with Macrium don‚Äôt forget to create the USB boot drive.

    <title>Adobe Bridge CS4 Won&#39;t Download Images - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Adobe Bridge CS4 Won&#39;t Download Images</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a new computer with Wndows 8.1. I've installed Adobe Creative Suite 4 and encountered a problem with Bridge CS4. When I select File &gt; Get Photos From Camera the dialogue box comes up, but it gets stuck on "Loading Device List... Please Wait".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bridge freezes at this point and the only way I can close the program is to use Task Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if I try plugging an SD card into the built in card reader as soon as the card is plugged in the Bridge Downloader comes (Autoplay settings) up and does the same thing - gets stuck on "Loading Device List... Please Wait".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched the ADOBE forum and the rest of the net and I've seen a number of people with the same issue but no fix aside from resetting the operating system. Has anyone had the same issue and found a solution, or have some ideas?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already ruled out issues with the SD card and card reader - issue occurs with multiple cards and readers. I've gone through the Adobe" Bridge Help / Troubleshoot errors, freezes" and tried everything suggested there. Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Matt</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Gives Firewall-Turned-Off Notification on Every Boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertlongford  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Gives Firewall-Turned-Off Notification on Every Boot</h2>
                    I am running Windows 10 Pro 64bit with Bitdefender firewall and antivirus. &nbsp;On every boot, I get a notification that both my Windows firewall and Bitdefender firewall are turned off. &nbsp;When I click on the notification, I get another small window asking
 if I want to start Windows firewall or the Bitdefender firewall. &nbsp;Clicking to start Bitdefender, I'm asked if I want to let it make changes to my computer. Clicking yes closes all. &nbsp;How do I stop this other than turning off the notifications? &nbsp;I'd like to
 know when there's really no firewall running.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There could be conflict between Windows Firewall and Bit defender firewall due to which this issue might occurred.
</p>
<p>I suggest you to un-install Bit defender firewall and check. </p>
You can also uninstall a program from the<strong> Control Panel</strong>:
<div>1) Press Windows and x key to open a task list from the bottom left corner of the screen.<br />
2) Select <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
3) Select<strong> Programs and Features</strong>.<br />
4) Double click on the program you want to uninstall and follow the onscreen instructions.</div>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

            <p>We should not be directed to a solution where we turn of a security feature. We should be directed to a solution to have the security feature work properly. I too experience a message from Windows 10 that my firewall is off. I can tell that it's on and the
 security center should know that.</p>

<p>To note a couple specifics, "menagerie" and "gone but not forgotten";</p>

<p>It seems that if you don't save, turn off your console when you experience one of these jams, and do the quest over. It saved me trouble in the second hobbe room.</p>

<p>Avoid tapping "a" during boss fights, you may inadvertently whistle to your dog and jam an fmv.</p>
<p>If casting, wait for spell animation to stop, likewise with speeches from npc partners.</p>

<p>If anyone has found a fix to the vanishing act by elliot/elise (or fable 2's lady grey) or the teddy trophy quest, post in this thread to keep them grouped well.</p>

            <p>tl;dr version: Reinstall the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Full version:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A library, also known as a dynamically linked library, is a collection of commonly used functions that a program can refer to over and over, which saves the developers the need to code these functions into their product over and over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 'procedure entry point' is the place inside the library file where the code for a function begins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A file in your game was trying to use one of the functions in a library but couldn't find where the code begins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not uncommon in software. It often means that the library file got damaged, which also happens. That's life. All you have to do is reinstall the program, and you'll get all new files. That almost always solves the problem.</p>

<h3> fammer570  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Gray Screen</h2>
                    <p>Hey there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past month or so, my Dell Laptop running Windows 10 has been suffering from a "gray screen of death". This started happening sporadically and is now to the point where it is almost unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem can partially be fixed by adjusting the screen angle. But that has seemed to pretty much stop working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched the issue and found this isnt uncommon after an update. I restored my laptop&nbsp; (needed to be done anyways) and then updated the Bios, as seen as a fix on google, but it has seemed to just make it worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advise before I bring it to the Geek Squad?<br />

            Hi fammer570, then this issue is caused by your Display (graphics card)  Driver as that action will kick the device in and out . . .
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />If the Roll Back options is grayed out, right click your video card and choose Uninstall, when asked, confirm deletion of the driver files
<br />
<br />Either way, restart your PC once done . . .

<h2>            Windows Live Mail bugs</h2>
                    I am really disappointed at the amount of bugs I am finding in WLM 2012. The latest is that I have a hotmail account set to download messages using POP3 and leave messages on the server for IMAP use. Sending several test messages I have found the messages
 display in the unread folder but not in the hotmail inbox under accounts so I have to save them in storage folders rather than leave them in the inbox. This applies only to messages with attachments, I have checked all security settings and still cant fix
 it. Also WLM 2011 which uses an http server for a hotmail account downloads attachments such as pdf as _pdf so cant be opened by reader and have to be exported and renamed. This didnt used to happen seems MS is introducing bugs as the go along.<br />
<br />
Come on MS is pop3.live.com working or filtering attachments or is it WLM<br />

            <blockquote>I have a hotmail account set to download messages using POP3 and leave messages on the server for IMAP use.&nbsp;
</blockquote>
<br />
Hotmail doesn't support IMAP, so you're leaving them on the server for some other purpose. If you used HTTP instead of POP3, messages would still be left on the server until you delete them either there or in the client.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>I have found the messages display in the unread folder but not in the hotmail inbox under accounts so I have to save them in storage folders rather than leave them in the inbox.</blockquote>
<br />
If you can see messages in Quick views, then they <em>are</em> in an account folder. That's all Quick views is - a view of a messages in folders selected according to the criteria specified. If you can't see them in the inbox, perhaps they're lurking behind
 another message in <em>Conversations </em>view, or else they're filtered out by <em>
Hide read messages</em>. You can check by changing these settings on the <em>View
</em>tab.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>&nbsp;WLM 2011 which uses an http server for a hotmail account downloads attachments such as pdf as _pdf so cant be opened by reader and have to be exported and renamed.
</blockquote>
<br />
If you see that an attachment has an extension like _pdf, this is probably because the filename specified by the sender ended with a full stop. This would give rise to a full file name with two dots before the extension:
<em>Annual report..pdf. </em>Because some programs will choke on file names like that, WLMail converts one of the dots to an underline character. It's just a pity that it converts the wrong one.<br />
<br />
It's generally not a good idea to open attachments from within a mail message. This can&nbsp;circumvent some of the security measures in place to guard against malware. It's always best to use
<em>Save as</em> to save the attachment first. This will convert the attachment to a file, which will be properly scanned by your security software. You also get the opportunity to specify your own preferred file name. My bank sends monthly statements which
 always arrive as <em>statement.pdf. </em>I right-click on the attachment and select
<em>Save as</em> to rename it <em>Statement-2013-03.pdf </em>and save it in the appropriate folder.<br />

            Thanks for the reply. While not the answer its helpful.<br />
<br />
I have changed from pop3 to http (I think WLM is not clear nor is Windows 8 mail) and now mail seems to show up in the inbox as well as quick view. I decided that the pop3 leave on server system was no longer needed but again I will look at view settings. Also
 emails with attachments were showing in quick view but inbox view.<br />
<br />
Apparently the user who is sending the _pdf attachments may well be using punctuation in his file names. Checking the message source he is using Word 12? which I dont have and sending direct from there to email. Looking at the message source I can indeed see
 two dots in the filename and a comma so that begs the question why is Word 12 allowing illegal characters in the filename,<br />
<br />
The file is from a trusted sender and the user who is used to opening the pdf directly has trouble with saving and renaming the file so I may have to do this for him in future but it would be nice if Word 12 didnt allow punctuation in filenames. My understanding
 is that most AV vendors have an email scanner built in and also scan on opening. This particular user is on XP and is using MSE, previously he was using Nod32 as far as I know there should be no difference on email scanning or am I wrong?<br />

<div>why is Word 12 allowing illegal characters in the filename, </div>
</blockquote>
<div>It's not illegal to create filenames including punctuation, in that Windows will normally allow it. It's just that some (especially older) programs will choke on them. WLMail is just trying to save that hassle.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote>
<div>the user who is used to opening the pdf directly has trouble with saving and renaming the file
</blockquote>
<div>Right-click <em>Save as </em>shouldn't be too hard to learn. WLMail will normally remember the last folder saved to, so that could be
<em>My documents</em>. As for renaming, all he has to do is type a new name and end it with .pdf Someday, someone will send him an attachment with no filename (it's not required), so all he will see is something like
<em>ATT000345.txt</em>. If he knows it's a Word doc, then he'll have had practice in renaming files before saving them.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote>
<div>most AV vendors have an email scanner built in and also scan on opening </div>
</blockquote>
<div>Yes, but you're not really opening a <em>file</em> in the normal understanding of that process. It's my understanding that if you double-click on an attachment, WLMail will decode the attachment and ask Windows to pass the decoded text stream to whichever
 application is called for in the attachment's <em>Content-Type</em> header. If this is, say,
<em>application/msword</em>, then Windows will launch Word to deal with the stream. This is all happening in memory; the AV program might not get its hands on it until Word has created its temporary file and written it to disk. If there's a devious hacker at
 work, this might be too late. If you save the attachment first, the stream is converted to a file and written to disk. That's when the AV will intercept it and scan it, potentially saving you from harm.
<font><br />
<br />
</font>One major shortcoming with XP and later versions of Windows is that extensions for known file types are hidden by default. This means that a criminal could distribute mail attachments called
<em>Brad Pitt with no clothes on.jpg.exe</em> containing something very nasty. On a new Windows installation, this will show only as
<em>Brad Pitt with no clothes on</em>.jpg; given a gullible recipient, the temptation to view might be too great and the nasty executable runs. This is one good reason why WLMail shows attached image files as thumbnails in the message header bar rather than
 at full size the bottom of of a message as Outlook Express did. Fake image files won't show in this way.<br />
<br />
Your user is well protected with MSE. However, it's easy for hackers to impersonate 'trusted senders' and so take people unawares. Learning the simple process of saving attachments before opening them might pay for itself in saved grief sooner rather than later.</div>

            The _pdf file extension is definately a WLM 2012 bug as I have just had another email with two periods in it and WLM renames it to _pdf but Windows 8 Mail App opens it as a pdf ignoring the extra period. Needs fixing MS<br />

<p><br />
It's one of many 'bugs' that have been around for at least 2¬Ω years, since the introduction of Windows Live Mail 2011. Only one of them has been fixed, as far as I can remember. Bugs which don't affect basic functionality or for which there is a workaround
 are not likely ever to be fixed, I'm afraid.<br />

<h2>            WIndows Mail and On-Site Exchange Accounts failing due to &#34;Azure AD&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Im trying to add an email address into Windows 10 (Both insider and non-insider), and its erroring saying&nbsp; "Are you sure that's the right email address? This organisation doesn't support joining Azure AD". &nbsp; The domain is for an on-site Exchange 2013 server,
 nothing to do with Azure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typing any email address @the domain in the image, fails with that error.&nbsp; It can be manually setup if you choose "Advanced Setup" and Exchange ActiveSync, but that shouldn't be necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no records on the DNS that are pointing to Microsoft or Azure, and this is a fairly new error, as the original builds of Windows 10 with the Mail app used to add it no problem.&nbsp; You should be able to replicate the error yourself by trying to add
 an account for the domain below, and it wont even let you type in a password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if Microsoft has a record for this domain somewhere in their system, or if it is something wrong with the Autodiscover information that is being spat out by the Exchange Server.</p>

            It does it on every computer with the Anniversary update or later. &nbsp;its not an issue with 1 PC. &nbsp;Running the troubleshooter does nothing. &nbsp;If you looked at my pic before it was edited, you could probably try it there. &nbsp;Any name@ that domain would give
 you that error. &nbsp;Something is wrong with the way the autoconfig is working in the mail app/ windows account setup.

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro clean insteall on cube tablet with Android and Windows</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I want to do a clean install on my cube iWork 11 Stylus with dual OS.</p>
<p>I am stuck during the partition selection, because I got 15 of them, where 12/13/14/15 are respectively SYSTEM/MSR/Primary/Recovery.</p>
<p>For a clean install, should I delete all these partitions, merge them and select the last one displayed (and Windows will still create the partitions for System/MSR/Primary/Recovery) or just format the 14th and select it? Or something else? I really do not
 want to mess things up and couldn't find the right answer. Also, I don't really want to delete the Android partitions because I don't know what will happen to the start up boot where you choose Android/Windows 10, or maybe it will just show Windows 10 but
 since I am not really sure of it, I am here to find the proper answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            For everyone wondering, yes, you can delete every partition and do a clean windows install. This will delete Android (5.1, not even worth to have it imo, but in my personal case, the Windows 10 only tablet was out of stock) but not the initial boot where
 you have to select between Android and Windows (I guess that's built in the BIOS). It works perfect, except my license is not supported for the device, which is fair, since it is only for my PC where I created the ISO. Other than that, the device works. Hope
 this will help people who own this 2-in-1 device (cube iWork 11 Stylus) and wonders how to do a clean install of their version of Windows (the PRO version works just as fine).

<div>The reason for me contacting xbox is because I have recently bought the white xbox one last week and everything has been fine. Upon purchasing the new halo game, I have gone through the game and the achievements for completeing levels don't appear
 until I am actually half way through the next level and in 2 cases now. One achievement hasn't shown at all, even after completeing the mission twice on separate difficulties and the achievement for collecting all the terminals in the first game hasn't shown
 up either, even though I have the achievements for finding the terminals on their own.</div>

            Hi Lani.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you have any computers connected to the PC, you can read the password at Settings &gt; Network and Internet &gt; Wifi, at far right choose Change Adapter Options, then right click Wifi, choose Status, then Wireless Properties, then Security tab, under Network Security Key tick the box to Show Characters to reveal password.
<br />
<br />If you cannot do this then you'll need to reset the router.  Look on the router closely for it's make/model and ask google (or back here) for how to Reset it, usually with a paperclip in a hole in the back, then dial into it from your browser to set it up including a new password for the router, and Security key passcode for Wifi.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p>I believe many people have this prblem. I found out the issue would be sovled everytime when I
<strong>restart</strong> my surface. I know it's frustrating for people who need to work with surface pen. Yeah. so if switching the touch/mouse mode doesn't work, simply
<strong>restart </strong>your surface.</p>

<p>
</p><p>That sounds extreme.&nbsp; Surely there is a less disruptive workaround (for whatever it is that you are seeing)?&nbsp; For a start you may need to disclose your OS build.&nbsp; For example, in an earlier release there was an unfortunate default for the pen which meant
 that in order to do any inking at all the user needed to be pressing on the barrel button.&nbsp; Perhaps you are in a regressed state about that?&nbsp; Have you tried inking while pressing your barrel button?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Using Skype to record messages and send to email recipient.</h2>
                    <p>I am looking to provide the ability for a person to record a message using a cell phone (or any phone) by calling a number.&nbsp; Then that message would get sent to others as an attachment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would seem to me that Skype should be able to do this, but I am not sure where to begin.&nbsp; I am willing to pay for the development, if the process is larger than my abilities.</p>
