 I tried to boot the system had problems trying to figure this out. went on windows site and read &nbsp;that my BIOS and Chipset drivers are out dated maybe also PCI simple communication is another problem too. my system is a GateWay&nbsp; GT5628 series a desk top&nbsp;,I
 know it an older system but these items was not compatible but I did ran windows assistants to find out&nbsp;if my computer &nbsp;was compatible&nbsp;for windows 8 and it was so I bought it at that time. look on Gateway site for updates really do not know what to look for.
 help is needed just to keep my computer from shutting down sometime thank you. tried auto repair too

<h2>            Windows Live ID and Email Adress problem</h2>
                    
<p>Ok so i'm posting this from my other xbox live account because i can't get onto my other one. I can't change the settings on my account or sign into xbox.com with it because i can't figure out my windows id password. My brother is the one who set up the
 windows live id and he can't remember the password, so i tried sending a reset password to the email address connected to it. Since it used to be my brother's account i went and asked him what the password was to his email, and he says he can't remember because
 he made it so long ago. Is there anything I can do to fix this problem or is it permanent? It's just maddening that i'm looking at my profile settings right now, i can play on xbox live but only if i go buy a prepaid card, and i can't change anything about
 the account. Is my account just lost?</p>

<h3> stanquerin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Asus Rog GL753VD</h2>
                    <p>I bought the Asus ROG GL753VD laptop and i bought a M.2 SSD drive with it i used Acronis True Image to clone the factory Hard-Drive to the M.2 SSD drive and it boots up in about 7 seconds now..that i like but i can't seem to install the creators update.
 i used the upgrade assistant it says the upgrade is available, it downloads it and after restart the screen says getting windows ready, then the screen blinks and i get a black screen then i have another window pop up and before i can see what it says it restarts
 and i am back at my original desktop screen, i have tried windows update but it says i already have the most up to date version of windows installed..</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there something i am missing? or is it the M.2 drive (Not being original equipment) stopping the install</p>
<p>
</p><p>i just don't want to have to take the laptop apart again it is pretty flimsy bottom plastic part has to be totally removed to access anything and i don't feel like breaking it YET</p>

<p>Hi Stan,<br />
<br />
Since your M.2 SSD is cloned from the factory hard drive, there's a possibility that the system reserve partition is still the default and no longer sufficient to facilitate the update.<br />
<br />
For us to verify if your computer already has the updated version of Windows 10, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the <strong>Windows</strong> key and click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>System</strong>, then go to <strong>About</strong>.</li><li>Please take note of the Windows 10 <strong>Edition</strong>, <strong>Version</strong>, and
<strong>OS Build</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the Windows 10 Creators Update is not yet installed, then you may need to resize the system reserve partition. Please check out
<em>RichardEiler</em>'s post in this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/small-solid-state-windows-10-system-unable-to/a8b0b382-e02f-4767-9f98-272e8802556e">thread</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to your reply.</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us, Stan. Since using the upgrade assistant failed to install the Creators Update, we suggest that you perform the update using the Media Creation tool. Please check out

<strong>Using the tool to upgrade this PC to Windows 10</strong>. Just click the + sign to expand it.</p>

<p>thanks for your help but it looks like i am going to have to do a complete reinstall as i tried the upgrade assistant and the media creation tool and when it downloaded and says it was installing windows 10 and then the screen flickered and then i got a
 blank screen and then the asus logo and low and behold the original desktop was back and i got an error screen which i am attaching but from the looks of it i will need to remove the M.2 card install the updates and then re-clone the drive sounds like a little
 run around but if nothing else will be a necessary step&nbsp; </p>
<p>The error was <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>0x80070002 - 0x200009 the installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during PREPARE_ROLLBACK operation</strong></span></p>

<p>Got your feedback. If possible, please remove the M.2 drive from your computer before trying the update again. We also suggest that you momentarily disable any antivirus software and unplug other USB devices connected to your computer except for the mouse
 and keyboard when performing the update.</p>

<p>thanks for the info i did remove the M.2 drive and the machine did have several updates as it was still the same os as it shipped with but after i removed the drive it updated then i ran the windows assistant and i now have a windows 10 running:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edition Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>Version 1703</p>
<p>Edition 15063.413</p>
<p>
</p><p>so if i install the M.2 drive again do i need to re-clone the hard drive as it will be running the 1607 Edition 14393.1358
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>or once i install the M.2 do i need to run the windows assistant again</p>
<p>
i will wait before i install the drive as i don't really want a non-functional computer</p>

    <title>Surface Pen Interferes with Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pen Interferes with Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter Connection</h2>
                    <p>I am using a Surface Book 16GB with Windows 10 Pro. I have a Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter (WDA) connected to a projector. I am able to connect to the WDA. However, whenever I use the Surface Pen after having gone about five minutes without using the
 Pen, the connection between the Surface and the WDA drops. Seems to be related to the Bluetooth connection because turning off Bluetooth eliminates the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Surface and WDA are fully updated - software, firmware, etc. Any assistance with the problem would be appreciated as I enjoy to features of the Pen that are not functional when Bluetooth is turned off.</p>

            <div>right, it needs to make the connection using 2.4 but then should use 5GHz.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>if you use the same SSID on your router for both 2.4/5, best to rename one of</div>
<div>them. change the adapter setting back to auto.</div>

<div>On your Surface, connect to the Internet using the 5GHz SSID.. then start the</div>
<div>Miracast session. Don't use any bluetooth devices, including the pen, until the</div>

            <p>What functionality do you lose from the pen with Bluetooth off?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding is that Bluetooth is only used for the button to trigger the opening of OneNote.&nbsp; Everything else should come directly from the digitizer in the screen itself.&nbsp; I'm just curious to know if this is correct or not.</p>

            I lose the Windows Ink shortcuts that are activated by the pen's eraser. I use Sketchpad and Screen Sketch quite a bit during presentations and need to frequently switch between the apps. Without the pen eraser shortcuts, it is a little cumbersome to have
 to click the icon in the system tray to bring up the Window Ink app menu then select an app.

            <p>Hi Sime,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visit the Notebook manufacturer website and download the latest Bluetooth drivers and save it on desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Use the Search Charms and go to Device Manager.</p>
<p>- Browse Bluetooth driver, right click on the driver and click on Uninstall.</p>
<p>- If prompted to delete the drivers completely, press yes and continue the uninstallation.</p>
<p>- In the Search charms, type Uninstall a Program. Locate the Bluetooth software and click on Uninstall.</p>
<p>- Restart the computer and then install the downloaded drivers and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, try to install the latest chipset drivers from the manufacturer website and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if the information helps or if you have any concerns.</p>

    <title>Mail app not working - shuts down - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mail app not working - shuts down</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 (latest update from yesterday) on a Lenovo AMD A10 PC.</p>
<p>I have been having an issue with my Windows Mail app shutting down immediately on trying to start it up. It has been happening for a couple of weeks, and restarting the PC doesn't help, the new update from yesterday has not helped...
</p>
<p>I try to open the app and (sometimes) it seems to start -- I see the list of emails for a moment, but then it shuts down (no error message, nothing at all - it just goes away). I have read that "resetting" the app is what I need to do, but I understand that
 will mean losing all of my email history. IF I must reset the app to get it working again, is there ANY WAY to find my email data (like from the Sent folder, for example) and save it somewhere? I often look back through sent emails to find info for work, etc.
 I can't lose all of that.</p>
<p>I appreciate any help!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Jeff</p>

            Hi Jeff,
<br />
<br />Rest assured, all your e-mails and folders are stored on your e-mail provider's server, and because you reset the Mail app doesn't mean it's gone at all. The Mail app merely serves as a frontend to using that e-mail server under your account, it only shows what you have on that server, and keeps them locally as well, but everything is also stored on your provider's server. After resetting the Mail app, you will need to log into your e-mail account again, which should repopulate with the data just fine.
<br />
<br />When I went to test this with my Mail app, it seems I got stuck in the "Creating account..." screen... so I tried Thunderbird and it seems to prove successful in populating my inbox, sent, and deleted folders.
<br />
<br />In short, you should perform a reset on it (right-click Mail at Start, then App settings &gt; Reset), but you should be warned that when you attempt to log into your account, it might be frozen and will be stuck, maybe infinitely.
<br />
<br />In that case, you might want to use another e-mail client like Outlook 2016 or Mozilla Thunderbird which works perfectly.
<br />
<br />Let me know if the reset works. Good luck.       
        </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current design of Family Safety web filtering is to block the exact name of the&nbsp;website that you added to your blocked list and It doesn't matter if they use http or https when accessing the website as long as the name of the website is listed it will
 still be blocked by Family Safety. Have you tried accessing the blocked website using either of these parameters http:// or https:// and see some difference?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p><span>Thank you for your reply Leonard. I have entered both Google and YouTube as blocked sites in Family Safety. When the child enters either site
 beginning with HTTP they are blocked. When he enters either site beginning with HTTPS they are NOT blocked. And as a side note, it‚Äôs easy for him to use HTTPS as that is how his school site is listed, so he simply replaces the schools address with either Google
 or YouTube, and he is there. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To isolate the cause of the issue, set the web filter to "Allow list only" to check if Family Safety will still block the https websites. After setting the web filter, please ensure that you have refreshed the Family Safety filter. You can follow the steps
 in this link:</p>

            <p>Litton, if I set the web filter to Allow list only, then https://Google or YouTube are blocked. But then everything that is not on the Allow
 list is blocked so it‚Äôs not really a valid test. I can‚Äôt use Allow list only because it‚Äôs impossible for me to create an allow list of all the school‚Äôs pages as they change as school assignments change.&nbsp;It would be a nightmare to manage.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <p><span>Hello, on Minecraft Bedrock edition I cannot download any of the resource packs that I bought on the Xbox One/360 edition of the game. My son has not had this problem except for with the Mass Effect Mash Up (which is unavailable now). I had
 Candy, Natural, Plastic, Cartoon, City, Chinese Mashup, Fantasy, Festive MashUp, Greek MashUp, Halloween 2015, Pattern, and the Birthday+base skin packs. I cannot download any of these now without paying for them AGAIN. This is frustrating. Any idea on why
 my son didn‚Äôt have to pay for texture packs he already owned but I do?</span></p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px">Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. I understand you are having trouble with using some content you had purchased on a previous version of the game. Where you ever able to use the mash up and texture
 packs on the Xbox One or had they been mainly used on an Xbox 360? There was the Xbox 360 Edition of Minecraft that the DLC would not transfer over to the Xbox One Edition. And now the latest version is called Minecraft: Better Together Edition. I recommend
 approaching the <a href="http://www.minecraftforums.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.minecraftforums.net</a> with this situation to see if there is more information or options they may provide you with.</p>

<p>I bought and downloaded most of the Texture/MashUp packs on the Xbox 360, and have used them many times on the Xbox One. I bought a few on the One edition.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I cannot use ANY of the packs I bought and downloaded on the Better Together (what I called Bedrock) edition without repurchasing them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son has confirmed that he was able to redownload all available texture packs he bought on the 360 and One editions on the Better Together edition, WITHOUT repurchasing them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I‚Äôd like to be able to use them again, without repurchasing them like my son was able to.</p>

            The password for the built in Administrator account is blank, In XP Pro, you press CTRL-ALT-DEL at the Welcome screen&nbsp; to get to the classic login. Type Administrator for the name and noting for the password. If you have XP Home, you need to boot into

    <title>Lost work in Movie Maker - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lawrence62  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost work in Movie Maker</h2>
                    I was working on a project in Movie Maker. This is the 3rd day of editing a film. I had saved the work from the other 2 days. I was nearing the end of working today when all of a sudden the film segments on the right went white one by one with exclamation
 points in them. I double clicked on one and a message came up that a file with a slightly different name than the one I was working on had been corrupted and needed to be deleted before I could go on. I clicked no, but nothing happened. Finally, since I couldn't
 work on it, I clicked yes. My whole film disappeared. The file name still shows up in the list of files, but there's nothing there. All of the previous work I had saved is gone, too. How can I find and recover this. It's been many hours of work. Thanks.

            Thank you for your response. When I copy the link in <strong>Richard Jordan_H</strong>'s thread into "search my PC" nothing comes up. Am I pasting it into the wrong place? I'm not the most computer savvy person around, so if you could walk me through what
 I need to do, that would be very helpful. Thanks!<br />

<p>Since you were not able to open it via <strong>Search This PC</strong>, we suggest that you open it manually by searching the folder named

<strong>Autosave.wlmp</strong> and check if your missing Movie Maker files are there.</p>

            Thanks... Tried that and the autosaved file is still blank and says it might be corrupted. I started the project from scratch anyway, but I was told the file might have been too large for movie maker to handle, so I split it in 2. While working on the
 first half, it crashed again and I lost my work, so now, I'm doing very little work each day and exporting it and backing it up so I don't lose it. I was able to do the first amount of editing without crashing, so hopefully this'll work. Thanks again for your
 help!<br />

<h2>            I got falseley accused for Modding&#47;Tampering my account.</h2>
                    <p>Wow, seven years of supporting xbox with their content, games, and devices, and I get suspended for supposedly "Modding my account." I played hard, and true to get to where I am. I've never changed my avatar, Gamerscore, or modded my gamerpic. This is ridiculous. Seven years of working up to where I am and my Gamerscore gets set back 50,000. This is ridiculous, and harassment towards me. I think I might even switch to Play Station because seven years of loyalty, playing games legit, and following all of their rules just to be set back pushes my limit. I can't wait to write a review to one of my critics to write towards Xbox for this. It's unbelievable.</p>

    <title>Screen refresh rate stays at 59Hz even if it is changed to 60 Hz - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Screen refresh rate stays at 59Hz even if it is changed to 60 Hz</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Automatic Reversion to 59Hz Causes Performance Decline</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm running a dual-display setup on Win7 Pro SP1 x64 with a ATI FireGL V5600, Acer X223W, and ViewSonic VA1926w. I'm been having a problem where the screen refresh rate on the Acer monitor automatically reverts to 59Hz from 60Hz and in turn causes a noticeable
 decline in performance when running any graphics-intensive application - specifically that the images themselves are fine, but the screen refreshes in a rather "choppy" fashion.<br />
<br />
It is not the traditional rounding issue where a 59.94Hz refresh rate is displayed as 59Hz:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>There is, as aforementioned, a noticeable change in performance between 59Hz and 60Hz. Specifically, when changing the screen refresh rate from 59Hz to 60Hz, the screen display becomes much smoother, and when it automatically reverts to 59Hz from 60Hz,
 it becomes much choppier.</li><li>The <a href="http://support.acer.com/acerpanam/manuals/acer/0000/userguides/X223W_UG.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
user guide</a> for the Acer X223W verifies that the monitor operates at a 60Hz refresh rate (specifically, a maximum resolution of 1600x1050 @60Hz).</li></ol>
<p>Moreover, when the Acer screen begins to stutter, it is possible to temporarily rectify the issue by opening the Advanced options dialog in Screen Resolution (if said dialog was closed) or closing said dialog (if said dialog was open).<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
Drivers have been updated as follows:<br />
<ul>
<li>ATI updated to the <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/fire/fire-2d/Pages/fire2d_win7-64.aspx?type=2.4.3;2.4.5;2.4.7&amp;product=2.4.3.3.2.3.10&amp;lang=us&amp;rev=8.773.1.1&amp;ostype=Windows%207%20-%2064-Bit%20Edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Thank you for your prompt response. Unfortunately, had you more thoroughly read my post, I have already specified that my Acer monitor does not operate on a refresh rate of 59.94Hz and that there is a
<b>tangible change in performance </b>when switching between 59Hz and 60Hz, and so therefore your KB suggestion is meaningless to me.<br />
<br />
I am still working to resolve my issue. If you have any ideas, please let me know.<br />

            Hi.
<br />
<br />By default when you boot your surface from USB you have UEFI.
<br />
<br />Support article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023511/surface-boot-surface-from-a-usb-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402351...</a>
<br />
<br />Linpis boot. Do you have installed Linux or you would like to get it?

<p>I only get options for EFI usb boot.&nbsp; I am trying to boot from non EFI usb.&nbsp; I have read that I need to choose Linpus USB boot option to do so, but I do not get that option.&nbsp; Have I missed the instructions in the article you linked?&nbsp; I could not find any
 reference to Linpus.</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />I mentioned that it is only UEFI available.
<br />
<br />You can try to use Rufus to do Linux installation media but still keep UEFI: 
<br />

<br />
<br />For more details better to use linux community.

<p>Thank you for the link, I will look into that as a solution.&nbsp; What I am asking though is about the Advanced Boot option to "Use a device" not giving the Linpus boot option as I have read should be available.&nbsp; Has Microsoft removed this from recent decices?</p>

            So I have found that the Linpus option only shows when I have a USB device that is formatted correctly for the Surface Go to recognize.&nbsp; I used the Rufus suggestion from Mark St...&nbsp; I will be investigating further.&nbsp; Don't know if I will be able to post
 here as the thread was locked before an authoritative or correct answer was given.

<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Have
 you installed Symantec anti-vrus software?</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong><span><br />
<span>Go to services and check if all these three services are running and started, if not start it manually:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 on start, type services.msc in the start search box.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>However NMSAccessU is related to CD writer, and Symantec AppCore Service are related to norton antivirus software.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to update your anti-virus software and CD burner software and check if it helps in resolving the issue.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi WannaBeDev,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, you should be able to connect your Xbox One controller to your computer by using its Bluetooth feature or by using a USB cable. From there, it will automatically install the drivers needed to make the controller work. Regarding your concern, there's
 a possibility that your controller encountered a compatibility issue with the driver since you're using a third party controller. I recommend that you reach the manufacturer to further assist you with this issue and provide you a way to make the controller
 work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
        </p>
