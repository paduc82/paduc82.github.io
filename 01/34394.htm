<h2>            How do I allow programs to steal focus in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Tweak UI for Windows XP allowed one to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
disable</span> the feature <strong>Prevent applications from stealing focus</strong>. I have downloaded the program Ultimate Windows Tweaker, but there doesn't seem to be a similar option.</p>
<p>Is it possible to do this in Windows 7?</p>

<p>This option may have been omitted from Ultimate Windows Tweaker for Windows 7. However, to be sure, I'd have you contact The Windows Club for confirmation.

    <title>Multiple sounds cards magicjack installed mic muted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mdoughty1961  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple sounds cards magicjack installed mic muted</h2>
                    
<p>I have a custom desktop with an asus a8n-vm motherboard with on board sound plus a sb-live24bit sound card. It worked fine once. I have since installed windows 7 and a magicjack phone and now I cannot get input from either mic jack for use with my headphones
 for gaming voice chat. The magicjack works fine for phone but cannot be used for chat apps. I have gone through the audio settings and made sure the settings were set to make the mic the default recording device and the magicjack the default communication
 device in the windows 7 audio settings. I made sure the listen to this was set correctly and the output settings to the correct speakers. The speakers all work fine, I just cannot get mic to work other than the input from the magicjack.</p>
<p>In XP there was an old style mixer in addition to the obvious mixer. The oldstyle had muted the mics by default and did not change when mics were turned on in the public mixer. I have not found this mixer in windows 7 if it still exists. But I know there
 is a hidden setting somewhere in 7 that is muting the mics even though they are unmuted in the audio mixer.</p>
<p>Using the audio mixer I go through all the settings up to the point of clicking on configure for voice chat then get no voice input from mic. I know the mic works, I had it working under XP. The differences since the setup was working is the jump to 7 and
 the addition of the magicjack.</p>
<p>Under settings I have set the default com device to not interfere with other devices on recieving a call so that should not be the source of muting. I am frustrated at this point and in need of help.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help</p>

<p><span>Now test to see if the issue is resolved</span></p>
<p><span>You stated ‚Äú<span>magic jack works fine for phone but cannot be used for chat apps‚Äù you may want to check the settings within the application to

<p>As stated in initial query. The advice you offer was allready applied to no availe. Magicjack cannot be used for chat, it is not designed for chat. It is purely an internet phone application. I added it to list of apps simply because it has a working mic
 from the attached phone.</p>
<p>I have used levels tab to no availe.</p>

<p>I think I read elsewhere of a problem like this caused by a compatibility issue with windows 7 and certain sound cards. To be specific the ones in my build are: An onboard AC 97 Soundmax , and a SB Live! 24bit soundcard. I have made all settings on both
 playback and recording tabs. The mic is turned on under both playback and recording, but still get no sound from mic.</p>

<p>Hi Mdoughty,</p>
<p>magicjack appears to be using a USB connection and is likely installed as a sound device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like you're using the on-board sound card and the SB card. Those two maybe conflicting.</p>
<p>Here's the updated drivers for the SB Live card for you to install:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.creative.com/Products/ProductDetails.aspx?catID=1&amp;subCatID=206&amp;prodID=10315&amp;prodName=Live!%2024-bit&amp;subCatName=Live!&amp;CatName=Sound+Blaster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.creative.com/Products/ProductDetails.aspx?catID=1&amp;subCatID=206&amp;prodID=10315&amp;prodName=Live!%2024-bit&amp;subCatName=Live!&amp;CatName=Sound+Blaster</a></p>
<p>I suggest disabling the on-board sound card through the BIOS is possible to see if this is resolved.</p>
<p><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee
 that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can e solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></p>
<p>As the Majcjack is using it's own sound drivers, it's addition maybe causing further conflicts.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;suggest&nbsp;removing it temporarily while troubleshooting the sound system.</p>

    <title>Logon with Microsoft account fails with Windows10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arnaudmichelet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Logon with Microsoft account fails with Windows10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have just upgraded my W8.1 to W10, and have added all my family as users on the PC with their Microsoft account.</p>
<p>I was obviously able to login with my own MS account to do this.</p>
<p>But nobody else is able to logon the PC: when you select the (MS) user and enter the password, the login session closes immediately with the typical message "closing session".</p>
<p>And it never opens the session!</p>
<p>NB: I did the same on another PC in my house (W8.1 to W10, define all family MS users), and no problem!</p>
<p>Have I to reinstall W10 cleanly? If yes, how?</p>
<p>Another solution?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi Nachappa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I am able to sign in with all these family Microsoft account on a browser online, AND on other PCs configured with W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything to log in: switching the user, 1st login user when I start the PC, closing my session and chosing another one. It only works with my own user, the 1st one I define on this W10 PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I do not get any error message: I log in, W10 says loging in (or something similar, I do not remember), and then nearly immediately W10 says closing the session. These messages are not error messages, but the normal messages you see while W10
 logs or closes normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it will be from help!</p>

            Hi Jort.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Can you adjust the Display Brightness at Settings &gt; System &gt; Display?
<br />
<br />2) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />3) Adjust the screen resolution at Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Slow initial update speeds</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm having a problem with download speeds that has started fairly recently. Everything used to be ok but in the last month when downloading updates I get a ridiculously low initial download speed of around 50-100 kbs, it will then go to a normal speed before going back to very slow for the last couple of percent.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am on a wired connection and no other devices are having a problem. My line support 35Mbs and I usually get around this speed. As far as I know there have been no changes to any settings. My detailed network statistics&nbsp;(it's peak time here so a bit slower than normal are</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Download speed 27.89 mbs</p>
<p>Upload speed: 7.13 mis</p>
<p>Packet loss: 0%</p>
<p>MTU: 1480</p>
<p>Latency : 165ms</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Yet I still get around 100kbs when I start downloading for about 5 minutes which never used to happen.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>John</p>

<h2>            Plugging a USB device into my computer locks it up</h2>
                    <p><span>When I plug in a USB card reader into a USB port it freezes the computer.&nbsp; Any Windows Explorer windows become locked (when you click on them they get grayed out, and you have a spinning&nbsp;circle instead of an arrow).&nbsp;
 If you wait about ten minutes, Windows pops up a box saying the program appears to be un responsive, and asks you if you want to kill it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Similar reports in this forum tell the user to turn off power saving; but that doesn't help.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What does fix this is getting Windows to forget about the device (or USB drive) that is problematic, so when you plug it in again, it re initializes everything.&nbsp; Perhaps the drive or card reader was last seen by your
 machine a few OS updates ago, so the cached information about it is wrong.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here is what to do:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Click Start button on your PC and right-click Computer, and then select Properties in the context menu.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Click Advanced system settings link given the left column.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. In the System Properties window, click Environment Variables.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. Click New and you will see the New User Variable dialog box.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">5. Type in ‚Äú<strong>Devmgr_show_details</strong>‚Äù in the Variable name field and ‚Äú<strong>1</strong>‚Äù in the Variable value field.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">6. Click OK to save.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">7. Open Device Manager&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">(Start
 &gt; Control Panel &gt; System and Security &gt; System &gt; Device Manager)</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">8. Once in Device Manager, click

<strong>Universal Serial Bus Controllers</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">10. See that some devices are grayed out (these are devices that your Windows OS has seen in the past, but are not present now).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">11. Uninstall all the grayed out USB Mass Storage Devices and USB Composite Devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">(Right-click

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You boot from it and run StartUp Repair.<br />
<br />
Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 as you boot so watch the screen - set the <br />
boot order to the CD/DVD drive first and then save and boot to the disk. Remember<br />
to set if back to hard drive first. Some systems have a temporary boot meny by<br />
pressing F12 which could also be used.<br />
<br />
See the methods in the first reply in this thread.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you want transfer rights, purchase Windows 8.0 OEM System Builder. If you need Windows 8.1, you need to purchase Windows 8.1 retail package.</p>

<h2>            WINDOWS 10 WON&#39;T PRINT.....AT ALL&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Hello. I was recently subtly pressured (by those stupid popups) into downloading Windows 10. My printer is connected to my computer, and
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">before</span></em> I downloaded Windows 10, life was beautiful and I could print whatever I needed. Now...I'm almost in tears because I can't print an insurance document that I need to sign and fax back! Nothing I've
 tried works. CTRL+P, checking the printer connections, nothing helps. In fact, instead of printing, the stupid system wants to fax the blank document using my address book. And what is the deal with Microsoft Edge? Can anyone help me? Why couldn't Microsoft
 have left well enough alone? Woe is me!!! &nbsp;Desperate Diann08

    <title>Somebody use my phone number through Skype call forwarding, and now I - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tyler23p  say:</h3>
<h2>            Somebody use my phone number through Skype call forwarding, and now I am receiving malicious phone calls, several times a day</h2>
                    How do I remove my phone number from Skype call forwarding? Somebody used my phone number and now I am receiving automated messages, non stop. This phone number is also a business number, and we had to change the phone number once to stop the calls. Who
 ever is forwarding the phone calls, has obtained our new number, and is doing it again. We have had 3 automated messages in the past 30 minutes.&nbsp;Since Skype does not have Tech Support, could somebody help me resolve this issue?&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Hi Tyler,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid there is no option to stop these calls&nbsp;on Skype's side since we cannot track the calls received on another person's account unless it underwent the verification process. Having said this, I suggest you to contact your telecommunications provider
 to get further help with this.</p>

<p>Jomel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick reply. We actually have a telecommunications department and we reached out to the telecommunications company. &nbsp;Needless to say, the only solution they had was to change our phone number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping skype could simply put us on a list that will not allow anyone to use our phone number for call forwarding. I could provide skype with the phone numbers we recieve calls from. 90% of the time its a 559 number that says skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!!!</p>

<strong>What is the Mortal Kombat 11 beta?</strong>
<p>The Mortal Kombat 11 beta will allow players who pre-order to access an early sample of Mortal Kombat 11 before the game launches. The beta for Mortal Kombat 11 will only be available for PlayStation 4,
 PlayStation 4 Pro, Xbox One and Xbox One X.</p>
<p>For more details about the beta, please keep an eye on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mortalkombat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">mortalkombat.com</a>&nbsp;or follow&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/mortalkombat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">@mortalkombat</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/netherrealm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">@netherrealm</a>&nbsp;for
 more information on Twitter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>How do I get access to the Mortal Kombat 11 beta?</strong>
<p>Please make sure your retailer is offering the beta before you pre-order the game. If you pre-order a physical copy of Mortal Kombat 11, you will receive a code to gain access to the beta before it begins.
 The code you receive will be for the same platform that you pre-ordered the game for. Please note, you will be able to redeem your beta code before the beta officially begins, but this will not allow you to download the Mortal Kombat 11 beta until it‚Äôs available
 in March 2019.</p>
<p>If you pre-order a digital copy of Mortal Kombat 11, you will automatically gain access to download the Mortal Kombat 11 beta when the beta is live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Can I pre-order at any retailer and get access to the Mortal Kombat 11 beta?</strong>
<p>No. If you want to ensure access to the beta, check with your retailer before you pre-order.</p>

<p>Hey Allen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us today. In regards to your inquiry for the Mortal Kombat 11&nbsp; Beta access, If you purchase this in a physical store you normally get it printed on the receipt or e-mailed. Now, typically if you order it through the Microsoft store
 (Digital version) you wont get an access code for the closed beta you just gain access to it on the date they specify.
<a href="http://www.netherrealm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NetherRealm's</a> studios still hasn't released information on the beta so keep an eye out for that.</p>

<p>Hello Allen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There would be no way to currently tell if the beta can be downloaded before or at beta launch, it would be best to keep up to date with the developer team handling the game for these types of updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to receive these updates is to head over to the official <strong>
<a href="https://twitter.com/NetherRealm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NetherRealm Studios Twitter</a></strong>, or official
<strong><a href="http://www.netherrealm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NetherRealm Studios website</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try these for those types of topics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have recently installed Windows 7 Ultimate on brand a new hdd in my PC. It passed the upgrade adviser with no issues and all my hardware has installed with drivers. It is an inspiron 1720 which has a Windows Vista sticker on it...</p>
<p>I have had BSOD twice now. Normally in the past I have been able to find any issues using Windbg but this time I can't seem to find the problem from the information..</p>
<p>There is a mention of memory_corruption so I have run the memory checker. When run this warns that there is more than 4 gig or RAM installed so it cannot all be checked. I have 4 Gig so I am not sure about this but I went ahead with the tests which all completed
 with no errors.</p>
<p>I have uploaded the mini dumps to skydrive as suggested in previous posts but the MEMORY.DMP when zipped is 58Megs so will not upload.</p>
<p>I have uploaded it elsewhere and the links are provided below.</p>
<p>Minidump 1</p>

So it looks like your RAM is damaged. Please download memtest86+ [1], burn a new bootable CD (use a CD-RW if possible) from the ISO (download and use ImgBurn [2] to do this), reboot your PC and scan your RAM 4-5hours for errors. If it detects errors, replace
 the faulty RAM.<br />

<h2>            External Hard drive maxed out with storage , but have a bunch of internal hard drives with enclosure.</h2>
                    <p><br />
</p>
<p>My goal is to make a complete external&nbsp;copy of my laptop the way it is right now to use as a restore in case something happens.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have an external hard drive&nbsp;that's full but there is a lot of stuff that can go.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have a bunch of internal hard drives&nbsp; with an enclosure to run them that could be used as additional storage,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I really just want to clean everything up but not sure If I should delete files or format ???</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I know that drives have to have NTFS to make recovery files.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Do hard drives have files on them that I should not touch??</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And what is the difference between saving an operating system and regular files.?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>One hard drive I have has vista on it. I could get rid of that to save windows 8 ?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For some reason I get confused when doing this sort of stuff because I don't understand how an operating system even knows how to load on a devise.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I connect an external usb hard drive and select the drive how come the operating system that is on it doesn't start up?? but I can look at all the programs??</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks Steve</p>

            <p>Before you start using File History to back up your files, you need to first select where your backups are saved. You can select an externally connected drive, such as a USB drive, or you can save to a drive on a network. There are other choices,
 but these two provide the best options to help protect your files against a crash or other PC problems. For more info about using File History, see
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows-8/how-use-file-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Restore files or folders using File History</a>. </p>
<p>File History only backs up copies of files that are in the Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos, and Desktop folders on your PC. If you have files or folders elsewhere that you want backed up, you can add them to one of these folders.
</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
Note
<ul>
<li>
<p>File History doesn't back up files on your PC that you have synced with
<span>SkyDrive</span>, even if they're in folders that File History backs up.
</p>
</li></ul>
<div>
To set up a drive for File History
<div>
<div>
<p>If you're going to use a new external drive, connect it to your PC. If you see a notification asking if you want to configure the drive for File History, tap or click it, and then turn on File History on the screen the appears.</p>
<p>Otherwise, follow these steps to choose either a network drive or an external drive that‚Äôs already connected to your PC.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap
<span>Search</span>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<span>Search</span>.)</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter <span>File History settings</span> in the search box, and then tap or click
<span>File History settings</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span>Select a drive</span>, and choose the network or external drive you want to use.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Turn on <span>File History</span>.</p>
</li></ol>
<div>
<div>
<div>
Note
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the network drive you want isn‚Äôt in the list of available drives, tap or click
<span>Show all network locations</span>. If the drive you want isn‚Äôt listed there either, open File History in Control Panel, tap or click
<span>Add a network location</span>, and follow the instructions on the screen.</p>
</li></ul>
<div>
<p>If you run into problems with your PC, a USB recovery drive can help you troubleshoot and fix those problems, even if your PC won't start.</p>
<p>Your PC might have come with a recovery image that‚Äôs used to refresh or reset your PC. The recovery image is stored on a dedicated recovery partition on your PC, and is typically 3-6 GB in size. To save space on your PC, you can delete the
 recovery image from your PC and use a recovery drive instead. <span>
Windows&nbsp;8.1</span> includes a built-in tool to create a USB recovery drive. Windows will let you know how big the recovery partition is, and you'll need a USB flash drive at least that big.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
Warning
<ul>
<li>
<p>Creating a recovery drive will erase anything already stored on your USB flash drive. Use an empty USB flash drive or make sure to transfer any important data from your USB flash drive to another storage device before using it to create a
 USB recovery drive.</p>
</li></ul>

</li><li>
<p>After the recovery drive tool opens, make sure the <span>
Copy the recovery partition from the PC to the recovery drive</span> check box is selected, and then tap or click
<span>Next</span>.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
Note
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your PC doesn‚Äôt have a recovery partition, then the checkbox is greyed out and the recovery drive will include only the recovery tools and a bootable image, but not a recovery image to use for refreshing or resetting your PC.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p>Insert a USB flash drive into your PC that is at least as large as the size indicated on the screen.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click the USB drive you would like to use for your recovery drive, then tap or click
<span>Next.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span>Create</span>.</p>
<p>The recovery image and necessary recovery tools will be copied to your USB flash drive, which will take a while, depending on your PC and the size of the recovery image.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When the process is done, do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you want to keep the recovery partition on your PC, tap or click
<span>Finish.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>If you want to remove the recovery partition from your PC and free up disk space, tap or click
<span>Delete the recovery partition</span>. Then tap or click <span>
Delete</span>. This will free up the disk space used to store your recovery image. When the removal is done, tap or click
<span>Finish.</span></p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p>Remove the USB flash drive.</p>
<p>This is now your <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span> recovery drive, and you'll need it if you ever need to refresh or reset your PC. Keep it in a safe place and don't use it to store other files or data.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
Notes
<ul>
<li><br />
</li><li>
<p>If your PC came with <span>Windows&nbsp;8</span> and you upgraded it to
<span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span>, your recovery drive will include <span>
Windows&nbsp;8</span>, and you‚Äôll need to upgrade to <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span> after you refresh or reset your PC.</p>

            <p>Very nice description of how to create a USB recovery . Did you write it all yourself or copy and paste??</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I might be asking the wrong questions when I post. Sometimes I jumble to many questions and should</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Probably stick to one question at a time.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I appreciate you taking the time to reply , but I already know how to create a USB flash drive recovery.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>One of the reasons I like windows 8 is because of the simplicity of doing this.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My big question is and maybe I am asking in the wrong forum&nbsp; but how can I clean up my external hard</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Drive quickly with out harming it?? When I write click an external hard drive there is a format hard drive
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In the list of suggestions. What does that mean??? </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Will formatting make the hard &nbsp;drive unable to retrieve recovery information??
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When trying to make a recovery drive you will be told hard drive needs to have NFTS.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Will formatting the hard drive erase NFTS???</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Data cost money almost $1 per gb if you are buying a flash drive and a lot less per gb if&nbsp;I &nbsp;buy a</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A lot of data. I can get 1 TB for $60. It would really be a pain if i had to save files on different
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>external hardware.&nbsp;I want everything in one place.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that the USB flash recovery is not the only way to create a recovery.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Creating a recovery drive will erase anything already stored on your USB flash drive. Use an empty USB flash drive or make sure to transfer any important data from your USB flash drive to another storage device before using it to create a USB recovery drive.</p>
<p>Why would it do this??? Does it do the same thing to a external hard drive????</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would really like to keep an external hard drive connected to my laptop so i can create back UPS every couple of weeks .</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />

                    <p>My Surface Pro came with a 44w charger and I have been to the tech shop as mine has recently been ruined and they advised the 65 watt would work.</p>

    <title>microSDXC 64GB persistent failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terrystewart_38  say:</h3>
<h2>            microSDXC 64GB persistent failure</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a new SDXC 64GB card from Amazon</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; "<strong>SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 30MB/s Memory Card with SD adapter (NEW VERSION)"</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007UXTSTE/ref=pe_175190_21431760_M3T1_ST1_dp_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007UXTSTE/ref=pe_175190_21431760_M3T1_ST1_dp_1</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I plugged the card into the microSD slot on my Surface Pro. All went well for a while. I set up the card to use the Windows 8 File History support and I copied about 5GB of music to the card. All this with no problems.</p>
<p>But, a couple of hours later I noticed that the card was gone from the list of drives (under Computer) in File Explorer. I could not access the&nbsp;SDXC card.&nbsp;I looked in the Event Log and there was a disk error event with
<strong>event ID=11</strong> and the message text:</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>"The driver detected a controller error on \Device\Harddisk1\DRxx"&nbsp; where the xx has varied (increasing with each error)"</strong></p>
<p>I simply removed the SDXC card from the slot and reinserted it. It immediately showed up again in File Explorer. Since then the failure has occurred in a similar fashion about 10 times. The SDXC card seldom is in the slot for more
 than 1-2 hours before the failure occurs (drop from File Explorer, unable to access the card). There always is a disk error event similar to the one above associated with the failure. Each time I simply remove the card and reinsert it. Then I can run a few
 hours before it fails again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have a USB adapter which accepts the SDXC card. I have inserted the 64 GB SDXC card into the adapter and plugged it into the USB 3.0 port. I have run the card this way for over 24 hours and have never seen a failure while the
 SDXC is plugged in through the USB port (but who wants to use a Surface Pro with a USB dongle hanging out). Nevertheless, this does demonstrate that the failure is probably not associated with the SDXC card itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an 8GB SDHC card which I had been using in the Surface microSD slot. I ran several days with this without any problems before I purchased the 64GB SDXC card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just so people know, I am familiar with micro SDXC cards.
<strong>I am certain that this is not a problem associated with inserting the SDXC card into the Surface slot.</strong></p>

            <p>Just to close this problem, I called Sandisk and talked to them briefly. They agreed to replace the SDXC card. Now (several weeks later), I finally received the replacement. As far as I can tell the replacement seems to be working fine so far (a day and
 a half). The original card seldom ran for more than a half hour before failing.</p>
<p>But, even though the replacement SDXC card looks identical (on the front) to the one that failed, the number faintly written on the back of the replacement card (3136DGCGW01Y) is different from the original card (3061GDUX30HR). I assume this is a "version
 number". I have no way of determining the significance of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, thanks for the responses.</p>

<h2>            Removing service pack updates in Win8</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I need to free up hard drive space and want to reduce the size of my Windows folder. It has a reserve.tmp file that is 3GB. Do I need this or can I simply delete it? Also, is there a way to remove old service packs that are already installed? They seem to
 be stored and are taking up valuable disk space. I'm on Windows 8 with a Sony Vaio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Setup has failed to validate the product key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrcalavera  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Setup has failed to validate the product key</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've been having some problems installing a program (VS2017 community edition) and someone suggested that a fix might be to repair my installation of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've downloaded the windows 10 iso and burnt it to disc, but whenever I run it I get the messages "Please Wait"&gt;"We're Getting Some Things Ready"&gt; "Windows 10 Setup has failed to validate the product key".</p>
<p>I can't get any further so I can't see if there is a repair installation option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought maybe it was because I had a few outstanding windows updates to install and tried that but Windows update fails each time too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on what could be causing it and possible fixes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Which edition of Windows 10 is installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which edition did you upgrade from?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft
 Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</span></span></span></span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter,
 you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>you already own</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>to
 reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>If you have the wrong edition installed, this will not work. So check to make sure you reinstalled the right edition - Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Edition.

<p>I'm running windows 10 pro.</p>
<p>The update and security screen says Windows is activated but just to be sure I went through support and gave them my product ID and they then gave me a confirmation ID and activated windows. That all worked, but the windows 10 installer still says Windows
 10 Setup has failed to validate the product key. </p>
<p>I downloaded the iso through the media creation tool, is there a different one I should be using or is something else the matter?</p>

            Hi Mr. Calavera,<br />
<br />
<br />
Inasmuch as we wanted to resolve for you the issue you're experiencing, it would be best if you will contact your computer manufacturer since creating the installation media still didn't work.<br />
<br />
We're just a post away if you have further queries.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Microsoft Edge. Perform these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search.
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register ‚Äú$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml‚Äù -Verbose} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Edge, it should work fine now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!
