<h2>            Usage Restrictions on DLC - Season Pass</h2>
                    
<p>The latest episode of The Wolf Among Us was released and I've been trying to download it. The problem is, I keep getting a message and it won't let me.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<em><code>"The item you are buying is subject to usage restrictions. You can use this item on the first Xbox 360 console that you download it with. Access to this item will also be granted to all users on this first console. If you transfer the item using a
 memory unit or other storage device, you will also be able to use it on other Xbox 360 consoles, but you'll need to sign in to Xbox LIVE with your Xbox LIVE account on that console before accessing the item."</code></em></p>
<p>As well as this message, the Xbox Stores menu only shows three options - Overview, which looks normal, The game title, which has a little red "no" &nbsp;symbol beside it, like the one from Ghost Busters, and Cancel. The only other options are X for Limits on
 Use, Y for Terms of Use and Back.</p>
<p>Whatever the problem, it must have occurred yesterday while I was moving around files. I got a storage device and transfused all the game data from the console onto the USB. When I saw that the USB was almost full, I transferred some back, but I didn't touch
 any of the TWAU files during this. They were purchased online and downloaded straight onto the USB device. This was all on the same Xbox Live account, and all done on the same console. I followed a guide and it said I needed to go to Billing and transfer my
 licence across. I did this and I'm still having the same issues. &nbsp;This is getting really frustrating, and I just really want to play what I've paid for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated, but I'm quite new to all this, so please don't use a bunch of complex jargon. I will have no idea what you're talking about.</p>

<p>The problem you're having is that the game itself is set up so you can download and play the game, but until it is actually released on the marketplace, you can't actually confirm the download.</p>
<p>Simply put, the last episode of the first season of The Wolf Among Us hasn't been released on the Xbox yet. &nbsp;The release date is the 9th of July, but Microsoft works on Pacific Time, so it's not midnight for another 30 minutes(as of this post). &nbsp;Even knowing
 that, the marketplace usually isn't updated until the "work day" begins, which means around seven or eight in the morning Pacific Time(so another eight hours from now).</p>
<p>As for the warning message, that's standard with all downloads. &nbsp;It's basically a warning that says whichever console you're downloading it on can play that item for anyone signed in, but if you download it again on a different console(or transfer it), only
 your account can play the game.</p>

<h2>            people app surface rt</h2>
                    <p>I have three issues with the people app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; the app shows that my Microsoft and Skype accounts are added to the app. However, it seems&nbsp;that only my Skype contacts are there, when I try to add my Hotmail account it says that that the account has already been added.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2, I READ TAHT you can mail directly from the people app. however when I select a contact even with a mail address it doe not give me that option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. when sending a mail from the mail app and trying to get a contact address I select the + that sends me to the people app but it said that its empty and doesn't show me the contacts that appear when I open the app directly from the icon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Jhjg, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could try this: Uninstall your Mail app by touching it for a second or two then sweep slightly down - this puts a checkmark on the Tile and brings up a bar at the bottom of the page. From that bar select uninstall, this will uninstall Mail, Calendar,
 Messaging and People (they are bundled together). After they uninstall bring up your Charms and select Settings, touch the Power icon and select Restart.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sign back into the Surface, go to Store and reinstall Mail,&nbsp;this will reinstall Mail, Calendar, Messaging and People. When they are reinstalled first&nbsp;go into People (not Mail). If you use your Hotmail account as the Microsoft account to login to the Surface
 it should automatically be set up, if not add it. </p>
<p>When you add your Hotmail to any of the four bundled apps it is automatically set up in all four.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully this will resolve the issue you're having with the People app.</p>

            Go to search and type Phone Companion.
<br />If you don't see it go to the Microsoft Store it is there.
<br />Launch that app and start the connection to your Android.
<br />You can use this for now, but it will be retired for now.
<br />Reason why is the cloud, which I know you don't want but Microsoft is unfortunately really pushing it.  Frustrating for users who don't want to adopt it.
<br />I will look to see if I can find another app like Phone Companion for you in the meantime.

<p>I will give that a go, thanks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, any ideas how to make the Microsoft Photo app work? When i connect my phone it asks wherther i want to import pictures i say yes but it then says it cannot find any files. Could this be something to do with the names and location of the files on my
 phone vs pc picture library?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to ideally import from SD card and phone memoryy but just SD card would be a great result.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Still Having Problems with Receiving Messages from Contacts &#47; Group Chats</h2>
                    <p>Still have the same problem since the 20th of June: can't get messages from the most part of my contacts and on most of my group chats. How to solve it?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f25d2a5a-120e-4824-a824-b37d29dfb6cd#user-profile-tab-profile">@Allen[S]</a> please don't give assurances that everything has been fixed. Everything has been working in the same way for seven days...</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Seems, no problems since the 4th of July. Hope they've been completely resolved. 15 days... Half a month... One more upgade like that and Skype will becoma a part of the messengers history...</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPD 03/07:</strong> <em><strong>New problem occured:</strong></em> Messages to some contacts and group chats are sent with significant delay about 3...10 mins. OMG!</p>
<p><strong>UPD 01/07:</strong> <em>First good news:</em> My contacts have started seeing me on-line and I can even receive messages from them. No older messages sync between devices :(</p>
<p><strong>UPD 29/6:</strong> Upgaded Skype to 7.38.0.101 the listed problems are still there.</p>
<p><strong>UPD 28/6:</strong> Many of my contacts still see me off-line when my Skype is on-line. I don't receive messages from them but they do when I'm sending.</p>
<p><strong>UPD 27/6:</strong> Today is working even worse. The only way to get new messages in the group chats is to login to Skype and refresh page time to time. And after that open the group chat for which the last messages should be received.</p>
<p><strong>UPD 26/6:</strong> The missed messages can be received partially by Skype restarting. BUT not all of the messages are synced between all the devices.</p>

<p>Hi Chambers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that your computer is in tablet mode. Tablet mode makes Windows easier and more intuitive to use with touch on devices like 2-in1s, or when you don't want to use a keyboard and/or mouse. To turn off tablet mode, select
<strong>action center</strong><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ec5d0de0-904e-4cc0-8c33-7d107fd3bee9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ec5d0de0-904e-4cc0-8c33-7d107fd3bee9" /></a><strong>
</strong>on the task bar and then select <strong>Tablet mode</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need further assistance, feel free to ask us.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 very slow after roll-back from Fall Creators&#39; Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> louisaldous  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 very slow after roll-back from Fall Creators&#39; Update</h2>
                    <p>I installed the new Creators Update on my laptop but the update caused many of my programs to not work or to crash repeatedly. I did a roll-back of the update and found out that my laptop was running very slowly and it wasn't like that before the update.
</p>
<p>I attempted a DISM image restore scan but it didn't work, saying that I need a source. Upon giving it a source it still continued to not work after constantly checking the path was correct (which it was). However, when looking at the logs I found out that
 I had files belonging to the Windows Creators Update even though I was running the previous version of Windows.
</p>
<p>This means I have some files for the correct version of Windows and some files that don't match the current version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do? The Creators Update also deleted all of my restore points so I can't even go back to that!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Louis</p>
<p>

<p>Update on the issue:</p>
<p>After days of looking for solutions online, I decided to attempt to reinstall the new Creators' Update. The update went very smoothly but, when looking at task manager, the CPU was pinned at 100% for the whole time I was using my PC. This was due to many
 instances of "svchost.exe" being open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This led me to believe that the problem for my slowdown was caused by something&nbsp;wrong with one of the services running on my computer.</p>
<p>I opened the services list and found that one process was still in the "starting" state after my computer had already been on for half an hour. I disabled the service and set the start-up setting to manual instead of automatic. This resolved my problem of
 having 100% CPU usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The service that caused this was called "Internet Connection Sharing (ICS)" so if you are having the same issue as I was having then look at your services list and check that it isn't stuck in a "starting" state. If it is, do what I did and set the start-up
 type to "manual", click apply and restart your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helped someone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Louis</p>

<p>Press the Windows Key + R at the same time and it should open the run dialogue box. In the text field, enter "services.msc" (without the quotation marks) and then you should be able to look through the list and find the service called "Internet Connection
 Sharing ICS".</p>
<p>Right-click on the service and click on properties. This should present you with the options to edit the startup type and also stop the service if it is stuck in a loop like mine was.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>That email is most likely garbage; is it asking you to do anything, click any links, give any info, etc?<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you have a regular retail license, it doesn't expire.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you have a volume license or the like, it might... Depends on how you obtained Windows 10.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For info about your license, open an admin powershell/command prompt and enter:<span style="font-weight: bold"> slmgr.vbs /dlv</span> and hit return, and it will give you basic info about the status of your current license.</p>

<h2>            Resolution issue in Windows 10 after upgrading</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 7 Home basic on my Dell inspiron N5050. My screen resolution is currently 1366 * 768. However after I upgraded my OS to Windows 10 Home, the maximum resolution available was 1024 * 768. I was unable to change the resolution to 1366 * 768
 as it was not available. Hence I formatted my system back to Windows 7 Home Basic. Please tell me is there any way to change the resolution to 1366 * 768 after upgrading it to Windows 10 Home as I will be trying to install Windows 10 again later.</p>

<p><span>Once you logged in with the daughter’s account, you can remove the older admin account (Yours) and use the new one as admin account.</span></p>
<p><span>Go through the below steps to create a new local account.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Create a Local Account</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Create a local account and try log in to your system.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Check if it allows you to log in.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are able to log in. I suggest you to make it as MS Account and see if the issue persists or not.</span></p>

    <title>Terrible picture when using Xbox 360 Slim 250GB using scart lead. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Terrible picture when using Xbox 360 Slim 250GB using scart lead.</h2>
                    
<p>So basically I've moved to university and before I came my xbox worked perfectly on my tv at home which is not HD therefore I was using the scart lead. I've come to uni with a different tv, I don't think its fully HD but it has them Green, Blue and Red components
 which I think use to be a way for HD, anyways I've tried using the scart on this tv and the picture is miscoloured (mostly green) and looks pixelated. I just tried the xbox on my flat mates tv and it has done the same thing, so I used a HDMI cable and it works
 perfectly. Is the scart lead broken or have I got a setting which is wrong? Please help.</p>

<p>Hi there. There may be a problem with the connection between the TV and the Xbox. If you can use a HD input to the TV such as HDMI or Component RGB then do as the quality will be massively improved from the quality seen over a scart connection :)</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick reply however I only have the lead which is R,W,Y into a scart and I wanted to test whether it was my tv, the xbox or cable...before I bought a new tv. The tv I have has B,G,R and scart however I only have a scart lead which was provided
 with the xbox last year. So you saying the scart port / cable is knackered as it doesnt work on two tvs. I tried plugging just the Y,W,R in without the scart attachment still the same outcome. I don't want to buy a new tv and a new cable if its the scart thats
 broken.</p>

<p>There is a chance that the cable is broken, you should try tweaking the Display settings on your console.

<p>Hey Arrested Fox, to be sure, have you tried another cable of the same type, to see if the same issue arises? That's the best way to determine if the cable needs to be replaced, or if the issue at hand is larger.

<p><strong><strong><span>"Catalyst Control Center: Host application has stopped working....Windows is checking for a solution to the problem"</span><span>.</span></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><span>That comes up twice. Then I get another error message behind that saying,</span></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><span>"Runtime Error! Program: C:\ Program Files (x86)\..." And something to do with my Library.</span></strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><span>And I try to log into</span><span>Windows

 Skype</span><span> and a few other games I had installed before this problem and none of these programs let me log in now.</span></strong></strong></p>

<p><strong><strong><strong><span>Today is the first time this has happened to me. Earlier
 I had no problems whatsoever but I did, however.. add on a Texture pack for the game "Minecraft". I had to move a lot of the files around on there to get it to work but i never had any problems after that adding that on. Not sure if that might of caused anything?&nbsp;</span></strong></strong></strong></p>
<strong><strong><span><span><br />
</span></span></strong></strong></span>
<p>I restored my computer, that didn't help the error..<br />
I also deleted the texture pack and uninstalled several games I had on before. Still, I get this error.</p>
<p><span>I've gone to the folder "Catalyst Control Center" (CCC) And Clicked on the ATI: "Restart Runtime" and it doesnt do anything but give me the same message, "Host application has stopped working." Iv'e tried the "help" as well but
 that&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;help..at all. Never came up.</span></p>
<p>Im not sure what to do, I have two errors here.. and I don't know if there both related or both different.. But i know they both came up at the same time. Never had them earlier today.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This is all very confusing to deal with myself, I'm not to sure what's going on.. Could someone please help me with this? &nbsp;It would be greatly&nbsp;appreciated. Dx!!!</span></p>

 I did find this thread helpful to resolve my issue.

<p><span>Hi Double Tapproblems,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Could you please provide the complete error message?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A<em>runtime error</em> is a software or hardware problem that prevents a program from working correctly. Runtime errors might cause you to lose
 information in the file you're working on, cause errors in the file (corrupt the file) so you can't work with it, or prevent you from using a feature. In your case, the runtime error might have caused the the Catalyst Control Center to stop working correctly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on my research, the error for the Catalyst Control Center is related to the Graphics card installed on your computer, you may check with
 the manufacturer if there are any updated drivers for the graphics card which needs to be installed to take care of the issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Update your display/graphics card drivers</span></strong></p>

            So about 2-4 weeks ago i was trying to go to my music app and pressed the search button and nothing came up. Then i tried to press the windows icon and that didn't work either. Then i tried to get to settings by sliding the screen but it's not there. I've
 been going under task manager to the app history to find my music app. And yesterday i went randomly looking for the setting and found it and tried to pull it up but wouldn't let me because it said the settings were suspended. I check for updates because the
 settings won't come up.

<p>Hello Rhiza_E,</p>
<p>Similar problem with Samsung S4 phone - Skype working well for years then finally agreed to update... crash city.</p>
<p>Error message is UNABLE TO CONNECT TO SKYPE. YOU CANNOT BE SIGNED IN AT THIS TIME. PLEASE CHECK YOUR MOBILE NETWORK SETTINGS AND TRY AGAIN.... which is odd because I only use wifi networks. Have tried to clear data/cache&gt;uninstall&gt;reboot&gt;reinstall ... no
 luck - even with older versions.</p>
<p>No problems with account because I am able to access using other devices.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Nick,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are getting an error code.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to know some information.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
When exactly do you get this error code?</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Do you also get any error message?</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to scan your computer with
<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious
 software. It works with your existing Antivirus software. Refer to the link to download and run the scanner:</span></p>

 the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Important:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or
 an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may
 temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the
 computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.

<p>Solutions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Turn off the console and unplug it for 30 seconds and try again. (This clears cache.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Make sure you are on the account that owns the digital game (or make sure you have the disc inserted).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Check this page to make sure you're on the same account that purchased the game:
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders#/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Look for the game in your purchase history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. If you own the game remove and redownload your account: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. If you have the disc and you get this problem see this page to clean the disc or troubleshoot it:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/disc-error" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/disc-error</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Check for a system update and a game update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Settings &gt; System &gt; Console Info &amp; Updates &gt;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And My Games and Apps &gt; Updates &gt; </p>

</p><p>There was a free play weekend this last weekend (or the one before that, I don't remember) so that may be where you got it. It's only free for the weekend and not free after that, you must buy it.</p>

Well, that is the application that makes the IMG####.DAT files for Windows XP.&nbsp; Although unless you already have patched your new installation of Windonws XP to the same service pack level as it was before the wipe/installation - then the version of F.A.S.T.
 you may be trying to use may not be the same one as you used previously...</p>
<p>Or are you moving to Windows Vista/7?&nbsp; Then you may have used <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=7349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Easy Transfer</a>.&nbsp; (I don't *think* you could use that to go from XP to XP...)</p>

            As far as the version of F.A.S.T. I have no idea.&nbsp; I had lost my original Windows disk and had to purchase a new one from Dell and it was supposed to be the same thing.&nbsp; I was running SP3 prior and am still at that level now.&nbsp; It is like it does not recognize
 that I have inserted a disk as it says to Insert Disk 1 and after I insert the disk it still says the same thing

            <p>Hi Anneliz,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the issue description, it appears that you are having issues in uninstalling a program as you are getting an error message "not enough memory to perform the operation". Or "some files could not be deleted, check that you have permission to access
 these files".&nbsp; I will definitely help you in fixing this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Which program are you trying to install?</p>
<p>2) Is the issue confined to a specific program or with other programs as well?</p>
<p>3) Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> I would suggest you to follow the steps from the link to Install or Uninstall the programs in Windows and check if the issue persists.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If the issue persists, I would suggest you to run Disk Cleanup which will reduce the number of unnecessary files on your hard disk to free up disk space and help your computer run faster, use Disk Cleanup. It also removes temporary
 files, empties the Recycle Bin, and removes a variety of system files and other items that you no longer need.</p>
