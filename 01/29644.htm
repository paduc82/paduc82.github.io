    <title>Transfer Xbox Account to a Family Member - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gbarber  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfer Xbox Account to a Family Member</h2>
                    <p>I have had an msn account practically from year one and when the xbox first came out many years ago I bought one for my son, and he has had his own xbox tag ever since (under my account).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to do is get my son (now grown up)&nbsp;his own account and move the xbox and all its associated accounts activity to his own account so he can put it under his own credit card and manage it separately</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just spent more than 2 hours on the phone with Microsoft Support trying to accomplish this and got absolutely nowhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would seem to me that peoples kids grow up, people divorce, etc. and it would be a common thng to move an xbox to someone elses control without loosing the xbox handle and subscriptions - but it seems nobody I spoke with at Microsoft had a clue how to
 accomplish this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone offer a suggestion?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also why is XBOX not a selection category???</p>

<p>There seems to be some confusion on my part as to what is an Xbox account and what is a Microsoft account. &nbsp;As a microsoft partner I don't want to change the email address associated with my msn account. &nbsp;I have business services skype etc attached to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to do is create a new Microsoft Account for my Son and transfer the xbox account along with all it password handles, game licenses etc to him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had another two hour session with microsoft support trying to accomplish something like this and ended up a total mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this so hard (you say a "possibility")? &nbsp;it would seem this was something you would need to do every day?</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. Here are steps on how to set the new email address as your primary alias:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. After you add the new email address, you need to set it as your primary alias to have it displayed when you sign in to all devices and services. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. On the <strong>Manage your account aliases</strong> page, select <strong>Make primary</strong> under the email address you want as primary under
<strong>Account alias</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>*Note</strong> Only email addresses can be used as primary aliases.</p>

<p>
</p><p>B. I cannot change my email associated with my msn account - I am a microsoft partner and there is way too much associated with my email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had phone and email support on this issue and no one seems to have an answer consistent with A and B - and mostly seem to be wild guesses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would seem only natural that children grow up and need their own accounts but don't want to start out from scratch on games that have been involved with for years - it is truly strange to me that this not an easy straightforward thing to do.</p>

<p>Is there any way to make folders always open full-screen size in Vista?&nbsp; This was a setting that was easy to achieve in XP, but it continues to madden me in Vista, as whatever setting I try, it still persistently opens in a smaller default-size window and
 I have to click to maximize it.<br />

I am using Vista Ultimate with a 5.9 Windows experience score.&nbsp; I have&nbsp; Radeon HD 4870x2 graphics and a ViewSonic 21 inch monitor, both with up-to-date signed drivers.<br />

            Hello Skyreburn,<br />
<br />
In Folder Options, Under the View Tab.<br />
<br />
Locate: Remember each folder's view settings.<br />
<br />
Make sure that is enabled.<br />
<br />
So now, if you open IE and maximize it, then close it.&nbsp; When you open it again it should open IE maximized.&nbsp; The same would be true for other folders.

<p>I installed ubuntu with the Grub bootloader a while back, but I now want to remove ubuntu and Grub from the computer altogether. However I'm afraid that if I just delete the ubuntu partition I will run in to problems, and I do not have any Windows installation
 CD/DVDs, as the computer came with recovery disks only, which I have lost.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there any way I can get rid of ubuntu and grub so I've just got Vista on its own? Perhaps there is some way I can over write the Grub bootloader with a windows one, and then remove the ubuntu partition.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks, </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The real issue is with the GRUB bootloader and you need to check with your Linux Distribution<br />
on how to fully remove it. <strong>This is an absolute must do!<br />
<br />
</strong>---------------------<br />
<br />
Afterwards make a Vista Repair Disk on any computer with a CD burner running XP, Vista, or
<br />
Windows 7 as the process uses no files from the host computer.<br />
<br />
Try these from the Command Prompt of a Vista Boot Disk - type in each at the prompt and hit<br />
ENTER after each.<br />
<br />
bootrec /fixmbr<br />
<br />
bootrec /fixboot<br />
<br />
bootrec /scanos<br />
<br />
bootrec /rebuildbcd<br />
<br />
How to use the Bootrec.exe tool in the Windows Recovery Environment to troubleshoot and<br />
repair startup issues in Windows Vista<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927392" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927392</span></a><br />

Sometimes using EasyBCD works when other methods do not.<br />

<br />
If that works then run StartUp Repair Twice from the Vista Boot Disk, run once and then<br />
reboot and run again. (You may even&nbsp;need to run it three times.)<br />

<p>Thanks whilst useful i am unable to uninstall my bluetooth drives loaded when i plugged in a belkin usb stick. Even if i remove the drivers on installing alternate driveres from lenovo or other dell drivers that the forums report may work.&nbsp; i get a message
 that i have to remove the current (i assume Belkin bluetooth) drivers, even though they have been removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts, suggestions, could microsoft create a windows 10 fixit file for a novice like me and possibly many others</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h3> tonyshew  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade admin user and password</h2>
                    <p>I have upgrades to Windows 10 but now have a problem.&nbsp; On Windows 7 I set up a guest user to allow restricted access for data backup across a home network.&nbsp; Now upgraded, I can only see the guest user and cannot access the owner user.&nbsp; No data from the owner
 user is visible and I can't update any software because the system asks for the admin password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never did I set up an admin password on Windows 7 and now there is one that is unknown to me.&nbsp; I can therefore not log in as admin (I don't have the opportunity) nor can I carry out system changes because of the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get round this please?&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.&nbsp; FYI at the point of entering "net user administrator /active:yes" I had access denied.&nbsp; Then tried to exit by typing exit to be presented with a blank screen.&nbsp; I used Ctrl Alt Del to try to reboot and weas faced with the option
 to change user.&nbsp; This I did to owner and rebooted.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>All is back to normal but I am still puzzled by the admin password having never set one.&nbsp; I will see if I need this next time I attempt to change something that requites admin permission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft account service unavailable, try again later</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a laptop with windows 8. I set it up initially with a 'local account' and now that I have connected to the internet, I want to connect my Microsoft account to it, but every time I try, it gives me a message that says "This service isn't available
 right now - please try again later." No matter how late I wait, it never works, and according to the status of Microsoft's service, everything should be working OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Caps lock is not on, my password is correct, I can log in to my account via the Microsoft website, but it just will not connect to the computer. Please help, I can't use any of the real features of this computer without connecting. I've included a screen
 shot of the error message in case that helps.</p>

 the Microsoft website) </p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you are as frustrated as I am considering the limitations that this places on the machines. I know I am not much help but maybe having more people post with this issue will bring it to Microsoft's attention more quickly.</p>

<h2>            Echo sound effect since last update.</h2>
                    <p>I have a sickening echo/reverb effect in the audio since the last update (08.12.2016).</p>
<p>It is unbearable, how do I disable this ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I LEFT clicking on the sound icon (opening the volume menu). I am offered to use either the headset ("casque") or TWO speakers ("haut parleurs")&nbsp;(see image1).</p>

<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06d1e78d-9592-4389-a49f-b84b1f7999e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06d1e78d-9592-4389-a49f-b84b1f7999e3" /></a>
<p>
</p><p>•Haut-parleurs 1 (speakers) and Casque (headset) both have the horrible sound effect.</p>
<p>•Haut-parleurs 2 has a normal sound (no effect).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a laptop, with just the headset plugged in. I don't think it should have two speakers available.</p>
<p>Since this happened with the last update I am guessing there is some sort of problem with it.</p>
<p>If no answer are available, can someone explain me how to rollback the update and get rid of it ?&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Before the usual response:</strong></span></em></p>
<p>•I updated/rollbacked/removed/disabled/reinstalled every single drivers and tried every single combination.</p>
<p>•I used the troubleshooting tool.</p>
<p>•I disabled the sounds effects in windows are any other drivers.</p>
<p>•I restarted my computer multiple times.</p>
<p>•My computer is on and the screen is on.</p>
<p>•I searched online for a similar problem and could not find any good answers.</p>
<p>•This sound effect is present in every sound (windows sounds/spotify/youtube etc.).</p>
<p>•The jack plug or any other component of the computer are in good conditions: nothing has physically changed since the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>•I run on a MSI gs60 laptop.</p>
<p>•Win10 last updated 08.11.2016 (with the new start menu and internet explorer coming back in the bottom bar)</p>

<h3> baxxorz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Dashboard Kid&#47;Adult version problem.</h2>
                    
<p>You may have noticed that there is a new thingy on the the Xbox Dashboard which allows you to change your whole xbox dashboard into a more suitable form if you're a kid/adult.<br />
Of course, I just had to press around and look how the dashboard would look like if it was for a kid. I remember that I saw a text that said something like this" You can turn your xbox dashboard back at anytime", so I said "Yeah, sure, let's test it out". Once&nbsp;I
 changed to the kid version that option just disappeared and I could not find it again. I've searched around in the options but I found NOTHING.
<br />
Could anyone please help me out from this mess and guide me to the adult version again? :)<br />
<br />
Thanks guys.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> acf44  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t remove Windows.old folder after recent Win 10 update because of WinApps resource.pri files</h2>
                    <p>Last week I update my last computer from Win 10 V 10586 to the Anniversary Win 10 14393.&nbsp; After using cleanup and forcing the usual leftover files in the windows.old folder I still had some files under windows/program files/windowsapps/deleted/ (then 2 folders
 with long names referring to a Microsoft get started app and the solitaire games app/ the each had a resources.pri file.&nbsp; The pri files will not delete.&nbsp; I cannot take ownership and you cannot go to advanced settings to change permissions to get rid of the
 file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried Powershell and a few other programs to delete these darn things and the only comment I get back is that I need administrator permission and I am the administrator.&nbsp; Why does Microsoft place files in windows.old that even their own cleanup programs
 won't delete.&nbsp; I even tried starting at the command prompt and I still get an access denied message.&nbsp; Up&nbsp;until now I've always been able to clean out residual windows.old &nbsp;files manually.&nbsp; It seems that these are windows store apps that can't be removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated,</p>
<p>Tony</p>

            <p>Hi Tony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You may try deleting Windows.old folder by performing the following method:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Elevated Command Prompt:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Run the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> as administrator.</li><li>Type the following command and press <strong>Enter </strong>after each one:
<ul>
<li><strong>attrib -r -a -s -h C:\Windows.old /S /D</strong></li><li><strong>RD /S /Q %SystemDrive%\windows.old</strong></li></ul>
</li><li>When finished, you can close the command prompt.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Command Prompt on Boot:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Boot the computer and select the<strong> Advance options</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Command Prompt </strong>and type the following command and press
<strong>Enter </strong>after each one:
<ul>
<li><strong>Note:</strong><em> The Windows 10 drive may not always be <strong>C:</strong> at boot like it is while Windows is started. Verify its drive letter before doing the command.</em></li><li><strong>diskpart</strong></li><li><strong>list volume </strong><em>(Verify the drive letter of your Windows drive. See screenshot below.)</em><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e62fb59-380b-4ca7-933f-3b4361018226" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e62fb59-380b-4ca7-933f-3b4361018226" height="365" width="525" /></a></li><li><strong>exit</strong></li></ul>
</li><li>To delete the Windows.old folder, type<strong> RD /S /D:\Windows.old </strong>
and press<strong> Enter.</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Note:</strong><em> Be sure to substitute <strong>D </strong>in the command above with the actual drive letter of your Windows.</em></li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>
</p><p>Thanks Mel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither method worked, however, it put me on the right track.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The resources.pri files were contained under windows.old\program files\windowsapps\deleted\Microsoft.getstarted**** (very long file name)\resources.pri (the first one)</p>
<p>
</p><p>and</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;windows.old\program files\windowsapps\deleted\Microsoft.microsoftsolitairecollections**** (very long file name)\resources.pri (the first one)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using method 2, Command Prompt on Boot, I navigated to the subdirectory containing the offending resources.pri file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then a simple del resources.pri got rid of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did the same for the other resources.pri file and then started windows normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that I was able to go down the subdirectory chain in explorer and del each subdirectory.&nbsp; The only minor issue was the programs file folder which required administrative permission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know where these files came from and I never deleted any windowsapps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In windows 10, you cannot access the \program files\windowsapps subdirectory.&nbsp; You'd have to take ownership and you still cannot remove a deleted resources.pri file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess this is just another wonder of WIN 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>again, thanks for getting me on the right track,</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 does not have network adapter after I did a clean install of the OS</h2>
                    After doing a complete re-install of Windows 7 from my manufacturer's CD, I cannot connect to the internet either from a wired LAN or wireless, presumably because the OS does not have a network adapter installed, as per the Windows troubleshooter. I re-installed
 the OS over and over, and I still have the same problem. What can I do next to install the network adapter? I am a complete ignorant when it comes to Windows/Apple stuff (I am a Linux user but I need a working Windows PC to run specific software) so I thank
 you in advance for any assistance.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems like the driver for the network adapter is not functioning properly on the computer. It may not have been installed properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer these questions so&nbsp;we can help you better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>2. Was the network adapter (internet) working prior to the reinstallation of Windows 7?</p>
<p>3. What is the status of the network adapter in Device Manager?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To check the device status,</p>
<p>a) Press <strong>Windows Key + R</strong> , type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>b) Expand <strong>Network Adapters</strong> and check for a yellow exclamation.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;Right click the&nbsp;adapter and click <strong>Properties</strong> and check the&nbsp;<strong>Device Status</strong> under the&nbsp;<strong>General</strong> tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may have to download the network adapter drivers from the system manufacturers website and install them on this computer.</p>

<h2>            Alarm App - How do I restore deleted timer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I am still learning 8.1 - but I like the alarm-timer&nbsp;and use it to monitor my Internet "break needed" time.&nbsp; I set a 1 hour timer and stopped it before it timed out.&nbsp; To clear the timer I clicked delete!!! and to my surprise - no warning - no are
 you sure - not even a beep - it just disappeared! Now I want it back, but there is nothing in the settings for this app that allows this to be restored.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks.

</p><p><span><span>I will do my best to guide you in the right direction.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There is no option to restore the deleted timer as it is by design. You need to set the alarm timer again manually.

            Hi Orhan
<br />
<br />I am  independent advisor willing to help you. If Windows 10 has issues or is not working as expected, you can perform a repair upgrade to fix the problem. Performing this can repair broken operating system files while preserving your personal files, settings and installed applications.
<br />
<br />When you download the .ISO file, you can start the upgrade by simply double clicking the .ISO file to mount it.
<br />
<br />You can download the latest .ISO file available for Windows 10 from this link: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Kind Regards,
<br />
<br />Angel.

            Hi Orhan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Unplug power and remove battery, press and hold power button for 30 seconds to release all power from circuitry, plug back in and power up to see if any change.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.  If one of these methods work, then go to Step 3.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC following the steps in the middle of the downloads page here:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>  Make sure to uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose only the licensed version.
<br />
<br />If the Media Creation Tool will not cooperate use the alternate download site at <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   You can also try System Restore to a point before the problem began.  
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media or Repair Mode  Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.

I am independent advisor willing to help you. If Windows 10 has issues or is not working as expected, you can perform a repair upgrade to fix the problem. Performing this can repair broken operating system files while preserving your personal files, settings
 and installed applications. <br />
<br />
When you download the .ISO file, you can start the upgrade by simply double clicking the .ISO file to mount it.

</p><blockquote>Hi Orhan. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />
Unplug power and remove battery, press and hold power button for 30 seconds to release all power from circuitry, plug back in and power up to see if any change.
<br />
<br />
I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files. These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent
 while performing the steps, so please report back as you go: <br />
<br />
1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>. Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options. If one of these methods work, then go to Step 3.
<br />
<br />
2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC following the steps in the middle of the downloads page here:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> Make sure to uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose only the licensed version.
<br />
<br />
If the Media Creation Tool will not cooperate use the alternate download site at <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>. Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:
<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a> <br />
<br />
Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a> <br />
<br />
Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer. If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.
<br />
<br />
3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.
<br />
<br />
If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here:
<a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:

 If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh:

<p>I don't get anything except the error screen. In the error screen, it says me to press Enter to try again and press F8 to go to the Boot Menu. I do both and get nothing. I press my BIOS button and the Advanced Startup button but still get nothing. In short,
 I can't do anything in the error screen. No button works. (Keyboard is still working. There is no problem in the keyboard.)</p>

            I understood that perfectly and that's why I gave you the steps required to interrupt it to get into the Repair Mode.  Did you start yet?  I notice you gave me a bad rating almost immediately after I wrote out the steps, before you could possible have tried any.  Well you're not going to get it started if you don't at least try the steps I gave in order.  If you need any help, just ask back.  
<br />
<br />You can also try to reinstall following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />After install watch performance closely after install of each driver,  group of Updates, programs, etc to try to isolate what is causing the problem.  
<br />
<br />So there you have complete and totally thorough steps to either try to repair what you have (in my first post) or to reinstall following the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<h2>            Windows Media Codecs</h2>
                    I'm creating videos for online sites and the videos look wrong when played back in the MS Edge browser or the "movies and TV" app.&nbsp; They look correct in Premiere Pro and when played back with Windows Media Player.&nbsp; I'm specifically using Vimeo as my streaming
 site.&nbsp; When I play videos in Movies and TV or Edge they have a significant shift toward magenta and a washed out look.&nbsp; It's as if the programs&nbsp;are reformatting the videos for a television (or something).&nbsp; That, or the new codecs included with Windows are
 messed up.&nbsp; Can someone tell me how to get Edge to play back the videos so they look the same as when played in Media Player (i.e. correct)?

            <p>Jesinta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Through more research on various support forums I found the problem.&nbsp; Edge, along with Chrome (surprisingly), and Firefox all "interpret" the embedded color matrix, primaries, and transfer function of H.264 encoded video differently with HTML5.&nbsp; Safari&nbsp;seems
 to be&nbsp;the only browser that properly pays attention to these fields in the H.264 video stream and configures video color rendering correctly.&nbsp; You'll see a whole page of complaints on Vimeo.com's support site where they basically throw up their arms and tell
 their users there's nothing they can do about it because it's the browser vendors who are ignoring these fields and messing up the color.&nbsp; So what I urge you to do is talk to the browser group there in Redmond and ask them to fix their HTML5/H.264 color rendering
 so it works as well as Safari.&nbsp; Since this happens with the built-in "Movies and TV" app in Win10 this&nbsp;is a product of the codec that Microsoft provides, not a third party codec.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are two short and helpful forum topics that explain what I'm talking about.&nbsp;

            <p>I don't have third party codecs installed.&nbsp; This is an issue with a fresh install of Win10 and the MS Edge browser.&nbsp; HTML5 videos are not being rendered correctly by Microsoft's codec.&nbsp; I put an entry on my blog that shows more details on your product's
 problem.&nbsp; If there are more questions please put me directly in contact with the Edge team at MS so I can talk to them as an a fellow engineer.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry you are getting this hilariously poor treatment from these incompetent, copy/pasting "Microsoft Support Engineers" when you're trying to submit a valid bug report!&nbsp; I would suggest that you re-post your discoveries on a new thread in the
 team employee.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; When you create the thread, please post a link to it here, because I would like to follow it as well and try to get someone's attention if nothing happens.&nbsp; This issue is something I have also had trouble with, except with YouTube and Firefox.&nbsp; Only,
 in my case, I believe the problem is YouTube's own video converter not interpreting the colors correctly, resulting in the colors being displayed wrong in all the resolutions except the HD resolution, which would display correctly.</p>
