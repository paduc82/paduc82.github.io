<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The issue is possibly on the receiver of the call. The telecommunications company of the receiver cannot display the number correctly.

    <title>Hard drive partitioning gone horribly wrong - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hard drive partitioning gone horribly wrong</h2>
                    <p>Salutations,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a bit at wits end at the moment, just finished a pristine new computer build and I managed to ruin the moment by accidentally activating some hard drive partitions. I'll attempt to recount my exact steps, as I already perused the forums looking for a
 solution and only seemed to make the problem worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- problem 1: I have two hard-drives on my system, disk 1) my SSD with the install of windows, and boot drive. disk 2) my fresh WD Blue 1TB drive I pulled from another system I never used, it was however formatted to my last system and I was originally trying
 to get the drive recognizable for to begin porting data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Problem 2: I accidentally made both drives ACTIVE, the SSD and HDD, which resulted in my computer not being able to boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Problem 3: In the Command Prompt, with my Windows disk, I set both drives to INACTIVE. My SSD had to partitions, the HDD only had one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm absolutely unsure of how to resolve this issue and salvage both drives and my copy of windows 10. There's no sensitive data on either hard drive at the moment.</p>

<br />How to: Perform a clean install of Windows 10
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-clean-install-of-windows-10/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Don't worry about product activation.
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />After setting up Windows 10 again, shutdown, then install the hard disk.
<br />
<br />Boot up, open Disk Manager (Windows key + x)
<br />
<br />Right click the hard disk, the delete any partitions then right click it again then click New Volume.

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The only partition on the entire system which should be marked Active in a Legacy MBR (not UEFI) install is the System partition.  Active flag points to the System partition.  
<br />
<br />So easiest  now is to create and boot a partition manage like Easeus or Partition Wizard, find the System Reserved partition and right click to Set to Active, Apply.  
<br />
<br />To do this with Diskpart from booted Windows Installation or Repair Media, choose Repair Your Computer-&gt;Advanced Troubleshoot Options-&gt;Command Prompt, type each of these followed by Enter:
<br />
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DISK # (replace # with Disk # of the WIndows disk)
<br />LIST PART 
<br />SEL PART # (replace # with the System Reserved partition, normally preceding C, around 100mb -500mb)
<br />ACTIVE
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Now choose any other partitions you marked Active and run Inactive command.  To check for sure bring the partition into focus by choosing it, then run Detail Partition.
<br />
<br />If all else fails remove the data hard drive, boot the installation media and do the Clean install in this link which compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Microphone deactivated - How to reactivate&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem using the integrated microphone of my laptop:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to mute the microphone for a conference call, I deactivated it by using the sound-manager. Unfortunately, the microphone does not show up anymore in the list of input devices and I cannot reactive it (only the speakers show up).</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f4235e1f-3ca2-4450-a70e-f928a0e9985b" height="502" width="634" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore I would like to ask how I can reactivate my input device/microphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be thankful for a response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much in advance and best regards,</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue might occur due to incorrect system settings, outdated drivers and missing updates. Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us follow these methods and check if this helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Open ‚ÄúDevice Manager‚Äù and <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
click on ‚ÄúAction‚Äù to select ‚ÄúScan for hardware changes‚Äù. Once this is done check if the computer recognizes the internal mic.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If there is an ‚Äúon/off switch‚Äù on the microphone, turn it to the "On" position.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Right-click the speaker icon in the Windows system tray and select "Recording Devices‚Äù. If you do not see the speaker icon, click the triangle to the left of the system tray to open a box containing all active icons.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Right-click an empty area of the "Recording" tab and check "Show Disabled Devices‚Äù.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Right-click the microphone from the list of recording devices and click "Enable‚Äù. If you only see a "Disable" option, then the microphone is already enabled.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Right-click the microphone again and select "Set as Default Device‚Äù. If this is not an option, it is already the default device and should show a green check mark over the microphone graphic.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Right-click the microphone, select "Properties" and click the "Levels" tab.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Click and drag the volume slider to the right to increase sensitivity or to the left to decrease sensitivity. Experiment for the best results. Also verify that the speaker icon, located to the right of the slider, does
 not display a red circle/slash. If it does, the microphone is muted; click the speaker icon to unmute it.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Click "OK" to close both the "Microphone Properties" and "Sound" windows.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>

 the modem repeatedly.&nbsp; Even shut down both the xbox and computer and rebooted to no avail.&nbsp; Microsoft help and xbox help have given me nothing, can anyone out there?

<p>Hi TenshinoAlexiel,<br />
<br />
If you have the exact error details, providing it would be very helpful in performing the troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Since the computer can see the XBOX console, it‚Äôs apparent that both are connected to the same network. Many at times unable to connect to XBOX could be the work of firewall.<br />
<br />
As such, before connecting to XBOX please turn off all your firewall and other security software such as antivirus temporarily to verify if they‚Äôre blocking you from the access. If disabling the firewall helps, you‚Äôll need to open certain ports to be able to
 connect.<br />
<br />
If you have other firewall software installed on your PC, check the software's documentation for instructions about opening firewall ports.<br />
<br />
Refer:</p>
<p><strong>Open a port in Windows Firewall<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-a-port-in-Windows-Firewall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-a-port-in-Windows-Firewall</a>
<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>Use Automatic network settings.</strong> <br />
<br />
If the Original Xbox Networking Settings are currently set to Manual, change the networking settings to Automatic. To change to Automatic settings, follow these steps:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On the Connect Status screen, select Settings. <br />
b. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Select IP Addresses. <br />
c. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Write down the current Manual IP Settings for future reference. Then select Configuration to change from Manual to Automatic. Select the B button to return to the Network Settings screen.
<br />
d. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Select DNS Servers. <br />
e. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Copy the current manual Primary and Alternate DNS settings into your Scratch Pad. Then select Configuration to change from Manual to Automatic. Select the B button to return to the Network Settings screen.
<br />
<br />
If this doesn‚Äôt help you in connecting to the XBOX, please provide us the exact error message so that we can find a specific resolution with respect to it.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Ensure that you enable your firewall and other security software after finishing the steps.</p>

    <title>After upgrading to Windows 7, my volume control says &#34;No Audio - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chadachada123  say:</h3>
<h2>            After upgrading to Windows 7, my volume control says &#34;No Audio Output Device Installed.&#34; How do I fix this and get my sound working again&#63;</h2>
                    I upgraded to Windows 7 from Vista today, and now my sound doesn't work. I have tried downloading/installing the audio drivers from Dell's website, and have tried everything else in every driver menu that I can find, with no results.<br />
<br />
Every time that I try to install the files downloaded from Dell's website, a blue screen appears and then the computer restarts.<br />

I have a Dell Laptop.<br />

None of the advice online is of any use. Either they are far too complicated, they are not applicable, or they simply don't work.<br />
<br />
Please help.

            Hi chadachada123,<br />
<br />
<br />
a) What is the exact error message you get when computer goes to Blue screen?<br />
<br />
Check what error message and the possible causes of BSOD(Blue Screen Of Death) in Event Viewer after rebooting your computer.<br />
<br />
Event Viewer is an advanced tool that displays detailed information about significant events on your computer. It can be helpful when troubleshooting problems and errors with Windows and other programs.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Open Event Viewer by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, clicking Administrative Tools, and then double-clicking Event Viewer .‚Äå Administrator permission required If you are prompted for an administrator
 password or confirmation , type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
b) Are your Display Drivers Upto date?<br />
<br />
You may update your drivers by following the steps in the link given below :<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />
After performing the above steps,To troubleshoot BSOD problems, boot your computer in Safe Mode and check :<br />
<br />
<strong>Here is how you do it :</strong> <br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.<br />
<br />
2. Select Safe Mode when the Windows Advanced Options menu appears, and then press ENTER<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If it works with Safe Mode you may want to perform Clean Boot .<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Note When you perform a clean boot, you may temporarily lose some functionality. When you start the computer as usual, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or you may experience the original behavior.<br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;<br />
Follow the below steps to put your computer in clean boot state:</strong> <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer unless a Microsoft
 support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Click Start button, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup , and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this
 if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.<br />
<br />
5. Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
<br />
<br />
Check the below link for more details on clean boot:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</strong>
<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start button, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab , click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart .<br />
<br />
<br />
After performing Clean Boot, get into Dell's website and try to download the sound drivers for Windows 7.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />

</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is another way that you can highlight the texts from the conversation that you want to copy to a word file. This is through the use of the Skype for Web version. However, the formatting of the text would be different from the one that you can see using
 the Skype app as it wont have any formatting. You could access the Skype for Web through this link:

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick reply. I think i must be doing something wrong can you advice?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the website =&nbsp;<a href="https://preview.web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://preview.web.skype.com</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant seem to highlight the chat text for the person I am speaking too. (Normally done by holding down the left mouse button and dragging over the text).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed at the bottom left of the page there are some tabs marked 'Skype Preview' + 'Download desktop Client'. Do i need to download the client or will that just install the same thing I am currently using?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p><span>Checking all the updates on the New Skype version,&nbsp;before you can export the chat history from your Skype app. It is required that you installed Skype Classic (Skype 7) before in your device.&nbsp;If

<p>This does not work if you want to export a conversation from several months. I dragged for like 2 hours back up to september 2018 from now, copied as said, and only the last synced chatlines were copied.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like it loses earlier copied text when the chat says "updating conversation"</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: This is the problem... Tried to copy a text from 2 days in a row, only copies text selected after last "updating conversation"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Skype-chat is stored on the Skype database, must be a few clicks to export that, isn't it?

<p>Hi Benjie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I (and lots of Skype-users with me) shared their thoughts about exporting skype chathistory. Why is such a basic function for a chatapplication so hard to fix for Microsoft? This once perfect chatapplication is running downhill since Microsoft got its hands
 on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many people voted for this option, but nobody from MS made any reply when this option will be available. Feels like this 'uservoice' as you call it, is just there for the show. Shame.</p>

<p>First turn off the device and unplug it for 30 seconds and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you download the <strong>"Xbox Identity Provider"</strong> app and use that and then try to log in again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other possible solutions:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">1. Check and make sure you have all windows updates.<br />
<br />
2. Please try to update the xbox app by going to Start &gt; Microsoft Store &gt; click the 3 dots icon at the top right &gt; My Library &gt; see if there is an arrow beside the xbox app. If you don't see the xbox app click "Show all" on the right to see them all.<br />
<br />
3. Please click Start, type "Apps &amp; features" select that, Find "Xbox" and click it, Click "Advanced Options", Click "Reset" you see there. Restart the app and try to sign in again.<br />
<br />
4. Please click Start &gt; type Troubleshoot and click it &gt; go to the bottom and click Troubleshoot Windows Store Apps &gt; see if it fixes any problems for the xbox app or shows an error that wasn't fixed.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">If you still can't get it to work there are more advanced things to try.</p>

            Can you try opening the Xbox App and try to log in there to see if you can. Is you can't login to Xbox App then it may mean that the app is corrupt and needs to be Reset. In that case please follow the steps already mentioned by&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5e22253b-68d0-4c57-9b5a-d2efcf23aa0a" title="ChiefJoboo">ChiefJoboo</a>

<p>Where did you get the driver for it? If it came with the scanner, it<br />
may be a Windows XP or Vista driver. Go to the Visioneer web site and<br />
download the Windows 7 driver for it. And be sure you get the correct<br />
(32-bit or 64-bit) Windows 7 driver.</p>

    <title>file copying&#47;moving with destination folder checking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zaptech  say:</h3>
<h2>            file copying&#47;moving with destination folder checking</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to know if there is a way in Windows Vista to move/copy files (in large or small numbers) from one folder to another BUT where the result would depend, for each individual file, on whether or not there is already a file in the destination folder

<p>If there is already a file of the same name but with distinct contents in the destination folder, then the file being moved or copied would be moved or copied but with a slightly different name (e.g., XXX_copy_1 instead of just XXX).</p>

<div>&gt;I would like to know if there is a way in Windows Vista to move/copy files </div>

<h2>            2017-12 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Update Stuck</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have got a new Lenovo carbon X 1 5th Generation. After setting the laptop up, I kept having trouble with the&nbsp;2017-12 Cumulative Update for Windows 10. The installation stuck at 99%, and when I restarted the computer, it just froze at the "getting your
 windows ready, do not power off" screen forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First time it happened I end up using the system repair to reset the computer, as it is new. Then, as the windows was freshly installed, I did the update first thing, and the same thing happened: stuck at the spinner screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I ask what is the cause of the problem? What should I do to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>
                </div>

            Several users are reporting this issue.
<br />
<br />I recommend you block the update until further notice:
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select the update that is causing the problem.
<br />
<br />Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.
<br />
<br />Or you can try installing it manually:

<p>I have Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; What happens if I open start, and click on "lock", with my mouse??. Will I be asked to install a password prior to my PC shutting down and locking, or I will have no way to reboot my computer because I hit lock.&nbsp; Many thanks

            Once you lock it, you can press CTRL + ALT + DEL to unlock it. If you normally log in with a password, you will be prompted to enter that password to unlock it. A shortcut to locking your screen is by using the Windows Key + L (lowercase).<br />

<p>I ran ADW Cleaner and saved the report. Then I changed the NetTcpPortSharing to Automatic as suggested above. &nbsp;I have now restarted the computer but am now unable to find anything by clicking WIN+S - neither Services nor Troubleshooting. &nbsp;I just get dots
 running across the screen. &nbsp;Where do I go now please?</p>

    <title>Windows 8 doesn&#39;t recognize a USB optical mouse&#59; however, the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geyner antonio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 doesn&#39;t recognize a USB optical mouse&#59; however, the BIOS does.</h2>
                    When I plug a USB optical mouse in a USB port, the operating system (Windows 8) doesn't recognize the device. However, some seconds after the laptop is rebooted, the mouse works, then it stop working when the operating system starts.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>This data is when I plugged the device, and it worked.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Device USB\VID_093A&amp;PID_2510\6&amp;f320ae7&amp;0&amp;2 was configured.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Driver Name: input.inf</div>
<div>Class GUID: {745A17A0-74D3-11D0-B6FE-00A0C90F57DA}</div>
<div>Driver Date: 06/21/2006</div>
<div>Driver Version: 6.2.9200.16579</div>
<div>Driver Provider: Microsoft</div>
<div>Driver Section: HID_Inst.NT</div>
<div>Driver Rank: 0xFF3101</div>
<div>Matching Device ID: USB\Class_03&amp;SubClass_01</div>
<div>Outranked Drivers: input.inf:USB\Class_03:00FF3202</div>
<div>Device Updated: false</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, this following data is the event that follows when I plug the device:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Device USB\VID_093A&amp;PID_2510\6&amp;f320ae7&amp;0&amp;2 was configured.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Driver Name: null</div>
<div>Class GUID: {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}</div>
<div>Driver Date:&nbsp;</div>
<div>Driver Version:&nbsp;</div>
<div>Driver Provider:&nbsp;</div>
<div>Driver Section:&nbsp;</div>
<div>Driver Rank: 0x0</div>
<div>Matching Device ID:&nbsp;</div>
<div>Outranked Drivers:&nbsp;</div>
<div>Device Updated: true</div>
</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I solve it?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>By the way, I have done this:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;Run the Hardware troubleshooter and check.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The hardware troubleshooter states that the driver of the USB device is not installed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2.&nbsp;Install latest drivers for mouse from the manufacturer‚Äôs website and check.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This device was working perfectly, and it doesn't need a driver because windows 8 provided it. The manufacturer's website doesn't even have drivers for its product, because they work perfectly with this operating system. The USB optical mouse is from the
 company Klip Xtreme</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3.&nbsp;Perform clean boot and check.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have done this, but the problem persist.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any of these solutions have worked out.</div>

<p>It did help me navigate through W10Pro a bit. Method 1 did not resolve the issue; but the link provided me a path to purchase the Windows DVD app - that did resolve the issue.</p>

<h2>            WORD 2010 Won&#8217;t Start In &#8220;Safe Mode.&#8221;</h2>
                    <p><strong><span>Dear Whomever:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>In addition to my ‚ÄúBSOD‚Äù problem (posted this past Thursday), I discovered that Skype will start properly in ‚ÄúSafe Mode,‚Äù while my WORD 2010 will not.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>No matter what I have tried in terms of updates or drivers being installed, I continue to be plagued by the accursed ‚Äú0x0000003B‚Äù glitch that nothing I have researched properly explains how to correct and/or remove
 the anomaly.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now I do not know if my problem with trying to utilize WORD 2010 in ‚ÄúSafe Mode‚Äù has anything to do with this, but suffice it to say I am totally flummoxed.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<strong><span>I look forward to receiving any and all intelligent replies to this posting.</span></strong>

            <p>Your Word problem will most likely disappear after you have solved the BSOD problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also suggest you expand your problem report. "Word 2010 will not [start]" leaves respondens guessing as to what actually happens.</p>

            <p>Regarding your BSOD problem I have posted a solution in your other thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your word issue go to control panel highlight Microsoft Office, select change then choose to repair office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are getting a lot of application problems you may have bad sectors on your hard disk so it worth doing a full scan by right clicking on your C: drive under My Computer and select properties &gt; tools and check for errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BSOD looks like a driver issue but if you are getting other BSOD's in any other applications and it is not following a Windows update it is nearly always a&nbsp;faulty memory issue, it is worth even just reseating the memory if you are getting a lot of issues,
 if that doesn't help find a memory check application and/or replace your memory (I will re-iterate again though that it looks like the driver).</p>

            <p>Dear Frederick,</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Thank you for your feedback.<span>&nbsp; </span>I would like a clear and intelligent answer to my BSOD problem (<strong><span>STOP:</span></strong><strong><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></strong><strong><span>0x0000003B) </span></strong><span>is the glitch in question.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>As for what is actually happening with WORD 2010 not functioning in ‚ÄúSafe Mode,‚Äù here is the error message:<span>&nbsp;
</span><strong><span>‚ÄúMS Office cannot verify the license for this application.<span>&nbsp;
</span>A repair attempt failed or was cancelled by the user.<span>&nbsp; </span>This application will now shut down.‚Äù</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Also, per another reply I received to the simple question of ‚ÄúWhat is 0x0000003B,‚Äù I received a MS link to a webpage informing that the problem has to do with the
<strong><span>Microsoft IEEE 1394 Driver Stack.</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp; </span>
In addition to all of this, there is a purported <strong>‚Äúhotfix‚Äù</strong> for this problem
<strong>(</strong></span><strong>hotfixv4.microsoft.com/Windows%207/WindowsServer%202008%20R2/sp1/Fix307444/7600/free/406698_intl_x64_zip.exe)</strong>, which turned out to be total garbage.</p>

 speaker.&nbsp; As a result, it thinks the microphone is a speaker, which renders it useless as a microphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is there a neat trick to circumvent this?&nbsp; A driver or anything of the sort?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            When you say you used previously - are you saying on the Surface Book or on a different computer? 
<br />
<br />You might take a look at <a href="http://www.surfaceforums.net/threads/external-mic-via-the-3-5-jack.19814/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.surfaceforums.net/threads/external-m...</a> - probably true for the Surface Book as well. It may turn out that the best solution is one of the USB mikes if you want high quality.. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VA464S/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VA464S/</a> is one of the more popular models.

<p>Ah, sorry!&nbsp; I meant on previous computers, yes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, yes, Ive seen suggestions about usb mikes, and that would undoubtedly solve the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I already have one (jack that is), I should be able to use it, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response, Barb!</p>

            There are some people who claim that if you pull out the jack so that only one ring makes "contact" it works (I've seen this reported on laptops, but never on Surface devices). So if it has two rings, you could try pushing it half in. 
<br />
<br />I suppose I should ask if Voice Recorder sees it as a microphone and if yes, does it work? 
<br />
<br />Does it register AS a microphone?

<p>My microphone only has one ring, sadly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would seem it gets recognised as a speaker, NOT as a microphone.</p>

            Also, file this as a bug using the Feedback Hub app and see if they respond.

<p>Sorry for late answer, but I'll see what I'll do.&nbsp; Perhaps a usb mic is the way to go.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Anyway, thanks again for help, Barb!</p>
