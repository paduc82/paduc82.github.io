            <p>Ok, first I will say thank you for responding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read some posts on similar issues on the suggested website.&nbsp; There is something more to this than I feel comfortable dealing with at my level.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not going to change anymore settings or waste my time&nbsp;on a system for something as SIMPLE as a file copy.&nbsp;
 I have already made changes to the system registry based on suggestions for similar issues.&nbsp; In simple terms I am not the ether dazed mouse that will run mazes and find peanut butter for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I solved&nbsp;my problem by using a 3rd party file copy program.&nbsp; Its not fast, but it does something I consider to be appropriate.&nbsp; It works.&nbsp; I am not an IT rep, I am more like a shadetree mechanic when it comes to computers.&nbsp; I know enough to break something.&nbsp;
 I understand that there&nbsp;may be&nbsp;larger issues going on in the background, and a simple file copy is probably more complex in the computer world than I make it out to be in my mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please add a NO button under if this post was helpful I was looking for one, but there was only a green YES button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion,&nbsp;I do not know exactly what I can do to fix the file copy problem.&nbsp; All that matters is that I have a workaround that allows me to continue my mission.&nbsp; Until then, I would suggest to Microsoft to just&nbsp;continue to refine&nbsp;their file copy program.&nbsp;
 For those that are looking for my low tech advice based on a similar issue, I will leave you with this quote.&nbsp; It helped me to move on.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t access gmail account with Windows Live Mail 2011</h2>
                    I cannot get my gmail account to open anymore with WLM 2011. Using Windows 7 Home Premium. It was working fine until recently. I have multiple accounts and they all work fine. I have tried turning off the firewall and anti-virus software, but still nothing.
 Have checked the settings multiple times and confirmed them with Google. I entered the same account information on a different computer on my network with Windows 7 Professional and it works.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know what might be&nbsp;causing this?&nbsp;

            When I press the send and receive button within WLM for my Gmail account, I get a notice that the IMAP server could not connect to the internet. It suggests that I turn off my anti-virus and firewall protections and try again. That didn't work either.
 It gives an error code cx800ccc0e.&nbsp; I've checked all the settings and the memory but no luck.

<p>If you follow the link given, you'll find four or five steps to take to remove the hindrance that's blocking access to the POP3 server. Work through each one in turn, testing the account in Windows Live Mail after each one.</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>... when did Windows Mail Live become less secure?&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It didn't. Google started using a different authentication method to ensure that users' credentials (usernames and passwords) couldn't be accessed by a criminal hacking into a Google server. Credentials are passed securely to a different site; if they are
 accepted, this site passes a token to the Google server saying that the user has been authenticated. It's an analogous system to the one used at this site (Microsoft Community) - you sign in at a different site (login.live.com), which then advises answers.microsoft.com
 that your credentials are in order. So even if someone managed to access the many answers.microsoft.com servers, he wouldn't find any credentials to steal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Live Mail isn't an 'app' like those for&nbsp;Twitter or Facebook or LinkedIn that have enormous online databases that need protecting. It's a simple mail client that sets up direct communication with a mail server. You have to be authorized to access
 your mailbox so only you can do it, and you do this by submitting your username and password. You can't access any other part of your Google account through Windows Live Mail. It's just the same as when you access any other mailbox - at&nbsp;your ISP, at Outlook.com
 or wherever. And, to cap it all, your credentials are passed to Gmail through a TLS-secured tunnel, which is exactly the same as OAuth uses.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just make sure that your security protocols are enabled like this at Control Panel &gt; Internet Options &gt;
<em>Advanced</em>:</p>

<p>Not here, but Windows includes troubleshooting programs that you can use to automatically fix some common problems with your computer's
<b>performance,&nbsp;</b>or with <b>maintenance</b> of your system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open the <b>Performance troubleshooter </b>by clicking the <b>Start</b> button, and then clicking
<b>Control Panel</b>. In the search box, type <b><i>troubleshooter</i></b>, and then click
<b>Troubleshooting</b>. Under <b>System and Security</b>, click <b>Check for performance issues</b>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Open the <b>System Maintenance troubleshooter</b> by clicking the <b>Start </b>
button, and then clicking <b>Control Panel</b>. In the search box, type <b><i>troubleshooter</i></b>, and then click
<b>Troubleshooting</b>. Under <b>System and Security</b>, click <b>Run maintenance tasks</b>.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>In the future:</p>
<p>I would suggest you to install updates one by one and <b>restart</b> the computer<b>after</b> installing
<b>each</b> update to check which update is causing the issue. Also make a note of the updates you install on the computer. Once you come to know which update is causing the issue, let us know.</p>
<li>
<p>Also change Windows Updates settings to “ Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them”, so that the updates don’t get automatically installed on the computer.</p>
</li><li>
<p>You may wish to change AU to the "Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them" setting. Once you've done that, you will have to approve which updates are downloaded, which updates are installed and<span><b><i>when they're installed</i></b></span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Install Windows updates &lt;&lt;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Install-Windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Install-Windows-updates</a>&gt;&gt;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Change how Windows installs or notifies you about updates &lt;&lt;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-how-Windows-installs-or-notifies-you-about-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-how-Windows-installs-or-notifies-you-about-updates</a>&gt;&gt;</p>
</li><li>
<p>After the you know which update is causing the issue, before trying a system restore I would suggest you to try the hardware and device troubleshooter and check if that fixes the issue.</p>
</li><li>
<p><b>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter &lt;&lt;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a>&gt;&gt;</b></p>
</li><li>
<p><b>My Windows Update is set to require my permission before installing; "Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them" setting.</b></p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>PS . - </strong></p>
<p><strong>Optional Updates - Unless you have an immediate, pressing need to install a specific patch, don’t do it. First Law of Computing: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."</strong></p>
<p><strong>As a rule, it is best to install only security updates. And you should always stay away from Optional drivers from the Microsoft site! Chances are the drivers you have are fine just the way they are. If you did have a need to update them, you should
 go to the actual manufacturer's website to do so.</strong></p>

<h2>            AT2020 &#40;and other&#41; USB Microphones on Windows 10 and 8.1 driver problem</h2>
                    <p>There is a significant problem with the the new generation of Windows which is to do with (mostly) professional USB microphones, mine being the Audio Technica AT2020. The microphone by default is far too quiet, resulting in muffled audio.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution, I repeat, is <strong>NOT&nbsp;</strong>turning up the percentage level, DB, or boosting the microphone. For someone who intends to record professional audio, this solution is effectively what "digital zoom" is in a camera, simply boosting the audio
 in its entirety, even though the input volume is simply not what it should actually be. This results in noise becoming louder, and many other various imperfections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried (most of it copied from the other thread):</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><em>Reinstall/update the driver</em>. There are no drivers. They worked perfectly on Windows 7 but after that they were completely broken.</li><li><em>Contact the manufacturer</em>. I contacted Audio Technica and explained how this is a call they get often, and that it is a problem with Windows. The only way they said it could be fixed is with some form of Windows update which matches the driver format
 of Windows 7.</li><li><em>Boost the volume</em>. Artificially boosting the volume in any way results in quality loss and is in no way a valid solution. This works for some people, but mostly it is just hiding the problem.&nbsp;</li><li><em>Run the recording audio troubleshooter</em>. All this does is check to make sure the audio services are running and that the microphone is detected. Neither of those are the source of the problem, therefore this fixes nothing. Neither will any other
 troubleshooter.</li><li><em>Install Windows updates</em>. As of this post, there is no Windows update that fixes this. I've installed every update for the past 2 years and they've done nothing to address this. Unless an update has been released that specifically addresses this,
 installing updates will fix nothing.</li><li><em>Contact Microsoft support</em>. This helped slightly as it gave me a few different things to do, but all of them have been in vain.</li><li><em>Run a virtual machine of Windows 7. </em><span>Not only is this extremely tedious, but it simply doesn't work correctly. Even if the microphone was working in its original Windows 7 format and as far as I know, a
 virtual machine is simply not made to record audio at high quality. This was suggested by Microsoft Support. VM tried: VirtualBox.</span></li><li><span><em>Install previous audio codecs and drivers.&nbsp;</em></span><span>I have tried to install previous audio drivers from Windows 7 onto Windows 10 with no success. This was also
 suggested by Microsoft support.&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>This problem has been posted numerous times in this forum, but I think doing this is the only way we can get it through Microsoft's thick skulls that something needs to be done. This is possibly one of the both biggest and ignored problems with the new generation
 of Windows, for both Windows 8.1 and 10. I've spend literally 9 hours of my life toiling over this problem. Any kind of solution which is not some moronic copy / paste garbage would be thoroughly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>This problem has been occuring in Windows for more than 2 YEARS.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The ONLY possible way from my knowledge is for there to be a form of Windows update which reverts or uses something similar to the Windows 7 audio drivers for USB microphones.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Microsoft, for the sanity of a lot of your users, fix this problem.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Rowan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue could lie while voices are streamed over the network and could be due to compression and internet connectivity. However, I suggest you to check if you can increase the bandwidth from the Audio Technica settings to improve sound quality.

            <p>Well I was really hoping that the Windows 10 Anniversary Update 1607 would fix the issue, but unfortunately, it did not help. Can we get some help on this ? This has been reported back in 2013 and still has not been addressed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not increase approval rating for Microsoft. Yes we are a minority, so that is probably why there is no priority. How can you just ignore this issue ? I guess we are not a big enough client that we are pushed way down the lower totem pole.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can the real software engineers please respond, you have enough information.&nbsp;</p>

            You stated to: &nbsp;<strong>c</strong>: Install the program in other local disk instead of the default local disk C.
<div><br />
<div>However, there is no option to install on a different disc when I run the install (.exe) file. &nbsp;Unless, there is some other way to make it install to another disc that I am unaware of. &nbsp;Also, I never got the request to install the virtual audio device.</div>

            The default file storage location for the Bluetooth received file is as given below:
<br />
<br />C:\Users\&lt;Username&gt;\AppData\Local\Temp\
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />For the documents and pictures and other files, I suggest you to try searching the documents/picture using Search in Start menu. You can also search it using search option in File Explorer. Every time you pair your device with Windows, Windows will prompt where to save the received Bluetooth file. You can change the location from there.

<h2>            Missing the VCRUNTIME140.dll and the MSVCP140.dll files</h2>
                    <p>I factory reset my computer just to have a clean start, and then I downloaded an Origin game client. Upon completing the installation and trying to open the app itself, my computer had a couple pop-up windows telling me that an error had occurred, and that
 the program could not open because the files VCRUNTIME140.dll and MSVCP140.dll were missing. I had tried talking to a live agent but I lost connection with them, but everything they told me to try wasn't working. Kept saying "Installation failed" or "error"
 or "cannot complete this request". At this point, I don't know what to do and I am just looking for an answer.... This is way more irritating than it needs to be. Please, please tell me someone knows how the heck I can fix this problem so I can get back to
 doing the things I enjoy to do!!!</p>

            Hi  Bryanna, the file VCRUNTIME140.dl is part d the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 
<br />
<br />You should download that
<br />
<br />Uninstall any previous 2015 version of the redistributable (not any other year) and install it to resolve these errors:

            Hi Chloe, this is very common, well done for being suspicious, you would be amazed how many users fall for this! 
<br />
<br />This is a well known Tech Support SCAM just close your browser and re-start it . . .
<br />
<br />All they are trying to do is get control of your PC, they will cause your PC to become corrupt and then require you to pay to have it fixed and even though you might pay them, they will not fix it!

            <p>hey,</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the flash drive is corrupt.</p>
<p>The windows reads the disk as RAW&nbsp;when the file system of It is corrupt and if you cannot format it, it is surely a hardware error.</p>
<p>So I recommend you to buy a new one.</p>
<p>Also check if the Drive works in any other device.</p>

            <p>I agree.&nbsp; This is so frustrating.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, there are no 'charms' so obviously you can't print the same way you used to in 8.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next: Ctrl + P did nothing.&nbsp; Zip.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Next: typing Devices and Printers in the Search box on the taskbar only got me&nbsp;Bing search results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next: I tried the Windows logo on the taskbar, went into settings, blah, blah, blah, only to be given the choice of deleting a printer.&nbsp; Nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next: I used to be able to right click on a Google search and have many options (copy the website address, copy the pic, etc)&nbsp; Now I can no longer do these things.&nbsp; Which I used to do all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the upside, I don't spend near as much money on-line as I used to.&nbsp; Before, I could email my kids ideas for birthday&nbsp;and xmas gifts.&nbsp; We are currently exchanging ideas for an upcoming wedding, bridal showers, etc.&nbsp; Way to go Microsoft, you've made it
 easier to go shopping in our local stores than it is to purchase on-line.&nbsp; I'm certain that your advertisers are totally pleased with this :)</p>

<h2>            Gamer Picture </h2>
                    
<p>I was asked by a buddy why my gamer picture was a hockey player and had no idea what he was talking about until I looked at it. I never made that my gamerpicture and I've tried to change it to the BF4 picture i downloaded from the dashboard. Is there anyway
 I can fix this?</p>

<p>Hi there, when you tried to change it to the BF4 picture did you do it like this:</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>1.Select Gamer Picture on the Edit Gamer Profile menu.</p>
<p>2.Select one of the following options:</p>
<p>◦Change Gamer Picture: This option presents preset gamer pictures that are stored on the console.</p>
<p>◦Change Personal Picture: This option lets you set a personal picture that only people on your Friends List can see.</p>
<p>◦Download Gamer Pictures: This option opens the Xbox Live Games Store, where you can download more pictures.</p>
<p>◦Take Personal Picture: If you have an Xbox Live Vision Camera connected to your Xbox 360 Console, you can use this option to take a personal picture and use it in your gamer profile. For more information, see Set up and use the Xbox Live Vision camera.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Note Personal pictures are available only to people on your Friends List.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>3.Select the gamer picture that you want, and then press the A button.</p>

<p>Yes sir, I did download it from the dashboard and went strait to change gamer picture and personal picture and seen the BF4 pictures there. On my xbox it shows me having the gamer picture i desire, but everyone else sees a different Gamer Picture. Ive tried
 switching to the ones that come on the console but it still shows up as this random hockey player.

<p>As you can plainly see, I'm having the same issue . I'm pretty sure I didn't use a Battlefield gamer pic though. When I click on my account though it shows my Xbox One gamer pic. Why is there a stupid hockey goalie in the forums though?

<p>Hi, unfortunately the backwards compatibility program was pretty extensive but it didn't cover every game ever made for previous generations of the Xbox. Here's a complete list of all the games it did reach:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/backward-compatibility/available-games</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, I don't see your game on the list and there will be no new games added to it. Xbox recently announced they were moving people working on backwards comp on to the next generation of the machine, Project Scarlett.</p>

<p>Not all original xbox games was converted for backward compatibility. As licence rights can prevent it from being added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            If you don't want the Gadgets to run, simply take the component out of the system. Control Panel/Programs and Featueres/"Turn Windows features on or off"/uncheck "<strong>Windows Gadget Platform</strong>", Apply, and restart. The other one runs your
<strong>Windows Live Mail</strong>. Yopu can uninstall that from <strong>Programs and Features.</strong>&nbsp;

            Hi KeithVenable,<span><br />
<br />
</span><span>Thank you for using Windows Vista Forums.</span>
<p><span>Do you get these files displayed on your Startup?</span></p>
<p><span>Sidebar.exe is a part of the Microsoft gadgets and gadget software. This file implements the Windows Sidebar feature of Windows Desktop. It is found in the folder C:\Program
 Files\Windows Sidebar\. </span></p>
<p><span>The Sidebar contains shortcuts to applications such as Windows Media Player or Gadgets which may be used to display information such as the system time and Internet-powered
 features such as RSS feeds. </span></p>
<p><span>Sidebar.exe file under the above location is considered safe and is not spyware or virus related.</span></p>
<p><span>The filename mctadmin.exe is used by objects that are classified as safe. It's a system and hidden file. It has not yet been seen to be associated with malicious software.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: However, some malware camouflage themselves as .exe files. Remember that although many files are always in default file locations, some files can easily be moved to
 different locations or change names like many spyware, adware, or popup programs do.
</span></p>
<p><span>I&nbsp;would recommend you to perform a complete scan on your Computer and check for infections.</span></p>

<h3> uncle aussie bob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update for XP freezes &#40;SP3&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>I have tried to use the Windows Update function (Start - All Programs - Update Windows) without success.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>The link freezes when my system is observed to find what updates are required.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li><li>Have used the Update Agent (WindowsUpdateAgent30-x86.exe) </li><li>Fix It Centre (FixitCenter_Run.exe) without any success.&nbsp; </li><li>Also tried to Repair with XP disk without success, as will not repair due to presence of SP3.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>Sure would appreciate any suggestions, as I've run out of ideas.</p>

<p><br />
Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious] <em>diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without </em>quoting&nbsp;my post: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. REPOSTING: Did you <em>uninstall</em> IE8 (and/or IE7) <em>before</em>&nbsp;you did&nbsp;the
<a href="http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/XPrepairinstall.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Repair Install</a>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2a. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em>&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2b. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2c. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Open <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong> &amp; make sure the <strong>Show Updates</strong> box at the top is checked (and leave it checked); then select the
<strong>Name</strong> option in the <strong>Sort by</strong> box on the right. Now scroll down &amp; tell me if ALL of the following updates are listed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) KB2727528, KB2724197, KB2661254, KB2749655, KB2761226 [<em>or KB2731847</em>];</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) KB2744842, KB2723135, KB2705219, KB2712808 &amp; KB2736233;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) KB2698365, KB2691442, KB2655992 &amp; KB2719985;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) KB2676<u>562</u>, KB2659<u>262</u> &amp; KB2686509;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) KB2393802 <em>and especially <strong>Update for Windows XP (KB971029)</strong></em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows XP</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If IE8 is installed,&nbsp;one (1)&nbsp;will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer 8</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5a. Is Java Version 7 Update&nbsp;9 (or higher) installed? TEST HERE USING&nbsp;INTERNET EXPLORER&nbsp;(<em>ONLY!</em>) =&gt;&nbsp;<a href="http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5b. Is Adobe Flash Player v11.5.502.110 (or higher) installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER&nbsp;(<em>ONLY!</em>) =&gt;
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; PC Doctor;
 TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Comodo System Cleaner; Advanced System Optimizer; CCleaner
<em>Registry Cleaner</em>)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Have you ever had occasion to do <em>a clean install</em> of WinXP for any reason?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Robear Dyer, many thanx for your prompt response and patience.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. No, not uninstalled (either) prior repair.</span></p>
<p><span>2a. Kaspersky Internet Security 2012 (3 licenses), which will expire in 9 days.</span></p>
<p><span>2b. No, other software has not been installed.</span></p>
<p><span>2c. No pre-installed virus protection software.</span></p>
<p><span>3. All of the updates are listed.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Chrome was installed but never used.<span>&nbsp;
</span>As such I uninstalled it some time again prior to these problems.</span></p>
<p><span>5a. Yes, Java Version 7 Update 9 is installed.</span></p>
<p><span>5b. Yes, Adobe Flash Player 11.5.502.110 is installed.</span></p>
<p><span>6. No, I have stayed away from Registry cleaners as I have kept my system fairly
 simple.<span>&nbsp; </span>I will gladly try upon your recommendation if this might help.</span></p>
<p><span>7. About 1 year ago I did a clean install of Windows XP, as a hard disk drive was
 not recoverable.<span>&nbsp; </span>Although I had a Norton Ghost clone on an USB HDD, I could only recovery all data – so not much drama.</span></p>

            <p>Recap: You did a clean install about a year ago and then you did a Repair Install
<em>when IE6 was still installed</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;When (approx. date) did&nbsp;Windows Update&nbsp;start "freezing?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. When (approx. date) did you do the (last)&nbsp;Repair Install?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. What problems were you having that you thought the Repair Install might resolve (e.g., Windows Update was&nbsp;freezing)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. How long (approximately) has IE8 been installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. Your User-Agent string tells me that the Yahoo Optimized version of IE8 is installed. Was IE8 ever offered via Windows Update?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Did you <em>intentionally</em> install Google Toolbar?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. When (approx. date) did you install Windows Live Essentials for WinXP?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Is Windows Live Messenger or Windows Live Mail version 14.0.8117.416 installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tip =&gt;&nbsp;Open either application &amp; click on HELP | ABOUT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Is MS Outlook (not Outlook <em>Express</em>) installed and if so, do you access a Hotmail account in Outlook via Hotmail/Outlook Connector?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>COMMENT: Your User-Agent string is unusually long. That <em>might</em> have something to do with your problem.</p>

            <p>1. Windows update started to freeze about 6 weeks ago, which did not coicide with any other known install/uninstall/new program events.</p>
<p>2. Last repair install was prior to fresh install w/ new HDD, so it was not effective and has never commenced.</p>
<p>3. Main suspected problems were with Adobe Flash Player and/or Java.</p>
<p>4. IE update shows date in May 2012 this year, so suspect close to this time.</p>
<p>5. No I do not remember being&nbsp;offered the Yahoo Optimized version -&nbsp;I tho0ught I&nbsp;downloaded&nbsp;it myself.</p>
<p>6. Yes, I intensionally installed the Google Toolbar without using Chrome and not using any of their defaults for home pages etc.</p>
<p>7. Date shown on Add/Remove is 13/3/12.</p>
<p>8. Around March 2012.</p>
<p>9. No Hotmail account or Hotmail/Outlook connetor.</p>

            <p>1. I believe I installed separately even if it was offered, which I don't recall seeing.</p>
<p>2. Windows Live Essentials 14.0.8117.416 (not messenger) is intalled.</p>
<p>3.MS Office Live add-in Installed but never used.</p>
<p>4. Absolutely possitive that no pre-installed Norton or McAfee software offered or ever existed.</p>
<p>5. New computer and most familiar with vendor, as 3rd purchase in succession and reliable.</p>
<p>Appreciate assistance but still puzzled as no apparent reason seems to have surfaced.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I had same issue, according changed keyboard layout as US English or reset that was not workable at my side.</p>
<p>We try on hot key"Ctrl + Shift + F3" to skip OOBE, it could pass through in to OS,&nbsp;</p>
<p>after that when you reset or shut down yours OS, In next setup the OOBE was still occurred.</p>
<p>Would you mind shared yours suggestion to us?</p>

<p>Hi Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got the same issue as Neil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I met this issue, I installed Windows 10 1803 version for comparison, but there was no issue as same as this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I also installed&nbsp; Windows 10 1809 and 1903 on E3827 and E3845 system, but there were not this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's very, very funny, this issue was only happening to E3815 CPU, I didn't know and could not figure out what the root cause about this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could anybody can help me to fix this issue?</p>

<p>I used the workaround that Neil provided, it does work.</p>

<p>Did Microsoft anyone can pick up this issue and fix it in next version or a patch?</p>

<p>Besides, I strongly suggest Microsoft should release a document to solve this problem!!!</p>
