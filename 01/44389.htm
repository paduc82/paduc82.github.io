<h2>            How can Autodesk 123D Catch be made to run on Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    The program ran fine on windows XP service pack 3&nbsp;and Windows 7, However, it fails to upload the photos to the cloud for processing into a 3D image. I have tried different compatibility modes, no luck. I ran the compatibility mode trouble shooter, still
 no luck. does anyone have any ideas?

            <p><span>Hi Henry,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft forums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From your issue description, I understand that </span><b><span>Autodesk 123D Catch is not running on your
</span></b><span>windows 8 computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would like to tell you that <b>Autodesk 123D Catch </b>tool by Autodesk has not been designed to support by windows 8 yet. However, windows 8 supports this tool and it is compatible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To check the same, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer:</span><span> </span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/ProductViewerWithDefaultFilters?TempOsid=win8&amp;Locale=en-us&amp;TextSearch=autodesk%2B123d%2Bcatch%2B&amp;Type=Both&amp;CurrentPage=0&amp;TotalPages=1&amp;ShowCriteria=0&amp;SortCriteria=Relevance&amp;Compatibility=Unknown&amp;LastRequested=14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/C<span>ompatCenter/ProductViewerWithDefaultFilters?TempOsid=win8&amp;Locale=en-us&amp;TextSearch=autodesk%2B123d%2Bcatch%2B&amp;Type=Both&amp;CurrentPage=0&amp;TotalPages=1&amp;ShowCriteria=0&amp;SortCriteria=Relevance&amp;Compatibility=Unknown&amp;LastRequested=14</span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method1: Since, you have tried to run in compatibility mode and still not working. I would recommend you to perform clean boot and then try to run it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Put the computer in Clean Boot state to see if there is any software conflict as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Note: After performing the troubleshooting steps in clean boot, follow Step 3 from the link to return the computer to Normal startup mode.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows Update Preventing Connected Standby</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a Dell Venue Pro 8 and have been experiencing terrible battery life with it.</p>
<p>I ran "powercfg /sleepstudy" to see why this was happening and saw that Windows Update was active for 99% of the time and sucking my battery since it prevents connected standby.</p>
<p>During this state if I manually perform a windows update check, it will keep searching forever and never finish.&nbsp; The same behaviour happens if I perform a manual check for app updates through the store.</p>
<p>The only&nbsp;temporary solution&nbsp;I have found is to restart the machine entirely which brings my battery drain back down to acceptable levels and then it properly goes into connected standby.&nbsp; But&nbsp;over the course of a day or so, that windows update process will
 start to drain my battery like crazy again having me to force a restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does this happen?&nbsp; I can't even leave my tablet on overnight or the battery will give out...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
I am having trouble resetting the components.&nbsp; Here are the issues that I'm seeing.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I have tried running the automated fixit reset method for Windows 8.1 and it did not work when my computer was in the battery drain state.&nbsp; I had to restart&nbsp;the machine and then run it and it finished however it said a couple of things were not finished.</li><li>When I try the manual method, when my computer was in the battery drain state, it would not even stop the Windows Update service "net stop wuauserv".&nbsp; It would get stuck in the Stopping state and just timeout.&nbsp; After restarting and then running the command
 it would work, but then I can't get past the "Del "%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Application Data\Microsoft\Network\Downloader\qmgr*.dat"" state because it says now the files are being used by another process.&nbsp; I see that the "Application Information" service is using
 the files and when I try to stop that service it fails...&nbsp; What a mess.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Some more information when I'm in this battery sucking state:</p>
<p>Not only is the Windows Store not able to update any apps, I can't install any apps either because it says my "internet connection is too slow".&nbsp; Restarting the machine fixes the problem "temporarily" until it gets back to this useless state.&nbsp; It seems like
 the&nbsp;whole product is broken because of Windows Update.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

            <p>Hi Anil,</p>
<p>I would prefer to not refresh my tablet since I will lose all my app saved data and will have to setup any customizations again.</p>
<p>Can we&nbsp;not debug this issue by looking at the windows update logs and seeing why it never finishes?</p>

            <p><span>Thank you for getting back.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To debug this issue, we will install the Windows Updates manually and check.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Try these steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Go to Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Services and scrolled down to the bottom to find the "Windows Update" service and stop it.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Then restart it again and go back to Windows Update, it will show all the available current updates. You need to deselect all the updates and select just the first two and install it, it should install successfully
 (reboot required).</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After the reboot, chose two more and install them. Then chose 5 updates and install them. They should install successfully (reboot required).</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The reboot will take a long time. You may see "Configuring Windows updates" for about five minutes. After rebooting, select the remaining current updates, including an Optional driver update. They should install
 successfully as well (reboot required).</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, I would suggest you to place the computer in
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>clean boot</strong></a> to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: After troubleshooting, see the section “<strong>Reset the computer to start as usual</strong>” to return the computer to
 a <strong>Normal startup</strong> mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi Anil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already installed all the latest updates so that is not the issue.&nbsp; The updates that I am getting daily are just the ones for the Windows Defender definition updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I had said, when I restart the computer I am able to search for windows updates properly.&nbsp; However over the course of a few hours or so, it stops working and then my computer gets into the power draw state.&nbsp; It's as if Windows Update gets corrupted
 after initial boot.&nbsp; I can install updates, but searching stops working and so does the Windows Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this state, I can't even start and stop the Windows Update service as it says the service is unresponsive.&nbsp; Can I reinitialize Windows Update somehow?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Anil,</p>
<p>I did a full factory restore of my tablet.&nbsp; I am still seeing the same issue.</p>
<p>I looked a bit further into my "powercfg /sleepstudy" output and see that when windows update runs, after a certain number of time the report will say "Event Data Missing, Stop event not found".</p>
<p>Because windows store is somehow linked to windows update, if windows update is running, you cannot install apps with the windows store, and since windows update get stuck in that searching state, windows store also becomes unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no choice but to keep restarting my machine every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is windows update broken in windows 8.1?</p>
        </p>

    <title>Fall Creators Update installation error 0x1900208 - TPM related - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slurmmckenzie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fall Creators Update installation error 0x1900208 - TPM related</h2>
                    <p>Today WindowsUpdate offered me the installation of the Fall Creators Update (1709).</p>
<p>I am currently using version 1703.</p>
<p>I allowed the download but the installation fails.</p>
<p>Then i tried the&nbsp;Windows 10-Update-Assistent. But it faild too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It tells me that i have to manually uninstall seven apps, all called "Infineon TPM Professional Package".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the catch, i don't have that installed.</p>
<p>My PC is an i7-3770k on an Asus P8H67-V.</p>
<p>This board is from 2012 and does not have TPM as far as i know.</p>
<p>There is no option for TPM in the BIOS/UEFI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched the whole harddrive for this.</p>
<p>There is nothing related to Infineon or other TPM stuff.</p>
<p>The file "ifxspmgt.exe" does not exist on my drive.</p>
<p>There is no mention of this file or the ID anywhere in the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know where, how or why windows thinks that i have this on my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can i get the update now ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the relevant part from the logfile:</p>

            Ok, i finally found the problem and the solution.<br />
And it is super ridiculous.<br />
It is not a compatibility issue, it is a problem with the updater tool itself.<br />
<br />
Reminder, i had a problem with 7 instances of Infineon TPM packages on my PC, that blocked the upgrade process,<br />
and had to be uninstalled manually. But my PC does not have TPM and there was no sign of these packages.<br />
<br />
I have two harddrives in my PC.&nbsp;<br />
Drive C: is a SSD and drive D: is a HDD.<br />
I use the HDD to store various things.<br />
Among those things is an archive of old device driver installers for a bunch of old laptops from work.<br />
These driver do in fact contain the installation files for Infineon TPM drivers.<br />
However, they are not installed on this PC, and they are stored on a secondary harddrive.<br />
The Upgrade-Tool should not even look at files that are stored on the secondary drive, but it does.<br />
Or maybe it checks the Windows Search Index and does a simple but stupid check of every file against a list of known files that are incompatible...<br />
<br />
For some ridiculous reason, the installer found these drivers (seven different versions for different computers)<br />
in the archive on the second drive while doing the compatibility check.<br />
And then told me that i have to uninstall the TPM stuff in order to proceed, but did not tell me where it found those files.<br />
I then made the mistake to start a file search for the filename "ifxspmgt.exe" only on the C: drive.<br />
I just assumed that the tool would only check for installed drivers and apps, and they are all on C: .<br />
<br />
Only when i did some debugging with "Process Explorer", i noticed, that the tool accessed files on the second drive.<br />
I quickly removed the drive letter assignment for the second drive to block access to it.<br />
And the compatibility issue just disappeared.<br />
<br />
At that time i was using the "Windows-10-Update-Assistant".<br />
I quit the tool and tried to get the Update now over the regular windows updates.<br />
But that still didn't work. Maybe i had to reset it, but then i just used the "Windows-10-Update-Assistant" again and it worked&nbsp;<br />
on the first try.<br />
<br />
So that did the trick for me. Blocked access to files on second drive and used the Update-Assistant. (ISO image should work too now.) Windows-Update maybe too, after reset.&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Software conflicts could be one of the reasons why you are getting this error code:
<strong>0x1900208</strong>. For us to diagnose the error, we suggest downloading the
<strong>Windows Update Troubleshooter</strong> on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027322/windows-windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.
<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> Make sure the device is connected to the Internet before downloading and running the troubleshooter.</em><br />
<br />
If the issue still persists, we may really need to download the <strong>Media Creation Tool</strong>. Locate

<p>Странно - сегодня пришло информационное письмо от Хбокса майкрософта с новостями и оно почему то было&nbsp; на польском языке, хотя везде прописан русский.

    <title>Windows 10 Freezing after bios the second Automatic Repair appears - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deadrobots  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Freezing after bios the second Automatic Repair appears</h2>
                    <p>So, this isn't exactly an Automatic Repair loop, it literally starts up. Passes BIOS (which for some reason 8.1 and 10 thought it was smart to remove being able to access advanced windows options from here, which is what I need) and then automatic repair
 starts. Well it doesn't really. It freezes the first frame it appears on screen. Nothing moves. Nothing happens. I've left it for hours still "Preparing Automatic Repair". Due to this I cannot access Windows Advanced Options to reset my widows 10 and fix the
 problem. I really really don't want to have to do a full reinstall since I got 10 off the free upgrade and can't really reinstall back to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone knows a way to bypass Automatic Repair or skip straight to bios pls let me know. Or any other way to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I realize you didn't use to go during bios select but right after, it has the area you'd do that right before it freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I tried restarting more and one time it randomly after a bit actually went to a "sorry your computer needs to restart" message and restarts instead of auto repairs. then it happened again. I'm literally auto repair looping before getting to auto repair
 so I can't even access advanced windows options ORZ</p>

<h2>            BB Torch 9800 is not recognized in Windows 7 Computer. It lists the Peripheral Device Manager as being the problem and I am not sure how to address this.</h2>
                    <p>I am having trouble with my BB Torch 9800. I managed to load the Bluetooth device drivers for Windows 7 and they seem to have worked. I can however not see the phone content from my PC and it comes up with a yellow triangle and doesn't recognize the phone
 as BlackBerry. Tried to update the driver as per Windows' internal troubleshooter on the Broadcom Website but this procedure fails outright.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It lists the Peripheral Device Manager as being the problem and I am not sure how to address this. I see others have the same problem. Anyone with a solution?</p>

<p>Hi Sage,<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's see if the same issue will occur if we install the update from a different and new administrator account. Here's

<br />
You may also perform a <strong>Clean Boot</strong> to make sure that no application is causing the issue.

<strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</em><br />

We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

            Thank you for the reply. I had to reinstall Windows for another issue and that has resolved this issue as well.

            Hi
<div><br />
<div>I've the same problem, so far this thread seems to be the only one discussing this error message...</div>
<div><br />
<div>The "image" in my case is a ppt attachment, otherwise downloading in iPhone and Outlook, however the error message (red) is stating "There was a problem downloading images." I can see the rest of the message, but can't access the attachment. No reason
 why, nor abilty to try the download again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Other messages do download.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried to run the Apps troubleshooter, but it doesn't help. The account type is Exchange.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Configuration: Windows 8.1, newest Mail app (updated today 20/11)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

<h2>            Fake Windows Live ID</h2>
                    
<p>I've got a problem with the account DoomUpdated. This account has been made with a impossible Windows Live ID:<strong> [Mod Edit]</strong> &nbsp;I wish to chage this ID, but I forgot my password and now I am incapable of changing the e-mail and/or password, and
 because of that I can not activate new bought Xbox Live Gold. As I have no clue of whatever my secret question is or which name and address I've filled in, there is no way of accessing it. I'm hoping that someone else has a solution for this problem.</p>

<p>Ok, first you need to find your password for that email. What you do is you need to click that you forgot your password. After that it should tell you how to get a new one. Then after that, you going to need to change your Windows Live ID:

<p>In order to reset your password you need access to the email address, as you are sent a confirmation email with a link you need to click.<br />

Since the OP has said his email address is not genuine, he will not be able to get that confirmation email.<br />

That being the case the advice you've provided <strong>Prince Leo II</strong> will not help him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There might be ways of proving it is my account, but I do not know if it is enough. I could change my Bio, showing in it that in principe, DoomUpdated and Tomster1001 are the same, but I will first need some kind of approval from a Xbox Forum Moderator,

<p>lolz...... hate that maybe you'll put in the correct info in future. for now though go to windowslivehelp.com/passwordreset.aspx and set up a password reset ticket. they'll ask for loads of info on the account(provide as much as you can). Then they'll set
 up a private forum with one of their support staff </p>

<p>windowslivehelp.com/passwordreset.aspx has changed. i found that after entering the wlid and picture code and clicking next, you need to then click on customer support, then click customer support again. that's the only way to get to the form for sending
 the password reset email to another email address.</p>

<p>I've done that before, but sadly, the information is wrong or too little is filled in. Now I did answer almost everything, but I still got a e-mail back that the info isn't enough to let me change it. Therefore, the ideas mentioned above do not work for
 me. Even though it doesn't work, I'm pleased with the amount of help I'm getting, but I do hope there is a moderator who could at least tell me if there is any possibility to recover this e-mail, or that all hope is lost...</p>

<p>Potential Windows Update Database error detected&nbsp;0x80070490 &nbsp; &nbsp; Fixed</p>

<p>Once I run the troubleshooter again it shows the same message.</p>
<p>also every so often it will ask me to choose update settings which I already have done, I choose install updated automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything to fix this as it is stopping me from updating my video card and causes problems with my internet. Any help will be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Cannot find script file error message</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just purchased a new computer running Windows 8.1. After installing a few apps, I got the dreaded black screen and believe I traced it back to ITunes, which I uninstalled via CCleaner (I was able to get to Safe Mode to do so).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, I am now getting the following error message every so often (I cannot track it to any specific action).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cannot find script file:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"C:\ProgramData\{911F79DC-C19D-A85A-701B-D8D8A0990B56}\1.9.1.1\fiber.js"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am contemplating simply uninstalling and reinstalling WIndows 8.1 from the reboot disk, yet I'm still worried that once I start downloading the apps I need (Dashlane, Microsoft 365, Skype, Quicken, etc.) that I'll have conflicts like last time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Right now, I'm scared to turn my computer off! A few days ago (after the CCleaner did its thing), the computer wouldn't turn back on and it took three tries to get it back to the login screen. Something is amiss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any guidance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kate</p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.
</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Does this script error appears in safe mode as well?</span></p>

<p><span><span>Mostly these errors message appear when some important system files get removed from Windows or get corrupted while installing or uninstalling third party programs. CCleaner is one of such third party program which tries to clean junk and registry
 files on your computer, but sometimes during this process many important system files gets removed resulting into such error messages. In some cases this can become fatal and you may not even be able to access your computer and can result into data loss.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>It is recommended to not use such third party registry cleaner programs on your computer.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let’s try these methods below to check if that helps. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>First, I would suggest you to start your computer in safe mode and check if the issue appears there as well. If it does not appear in safe mode place the computer in clean boot state to identify the culprit program running in the background creating
 this error. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Step 1: Safe Mode</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you’re using.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Refer the article below to start your computer in safe mode</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the problem does not exist in safe mode, try to perform a clean boot and check.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Step 2: Clean Boot</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer: <strong><span>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows.

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)"><span>If the issue persists in clean boot mode as well, I would suggest you to run Microsoft System File Checker tool SFC /SCANNOW to scan the system integration and fix any corruption.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to&nbsp;get&nbsp;clarity on your query, we would need some more information regarding the issue, so that we can recommend you with the better suggestion. When you say "I don't need Cortana to stimulate sight and sound every single use", could you please elaborate

            While it is possible to change user names and profile names, this is not recommended because some traces of the old name remain. The preferred option is to create a new account.

<h2>            Windows XP - invalid boot.ini</h2>
                    <div>Original TTitle : HELP ME PLEASE :''( - No end of frustration<br />
</div>
<div>Hi, </div>
<div><br />
I am currently having probelms with an old Dell Latitude D610 (My sisters old computer) running Windows XP. I purely want to use this as a computer to run iTunes on in order to keep my iPhone updated as my other laptop is a works machine and I am unable to
 have iTunes installed on. <br />
<br />
Anyway, after updating it to the latest iTunes last night and dwonloading the new software update for my phone i proceeded to run the update this morning. This started fine until it was noted that there wasn't enough disc space on the computer in order to carry
 out this opperation. <br />
So i could continue with updating my phone i decided to free up some space on the hard drive I first used the disk cleanup utility and then the add/remove programs wizard to remove a selection of unwanted software.
<br />
After removing all the unwanted software (mostly drivers and programs for an old phone and TomTom) I proceeded to restart the computer as normal.
<br />
<br />
On start up i recieved the error message:<br />
<br />
<i>Invalid Boot.ini </i><br />
<br />
and then:<br />
<br />
<i>Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: <br />
Windows\System32\Hal.dll </i><br />
<br />
Ok, i thought, there must be a way to get round this. after trawlling the internet to find out what i needed to do to get over this initiall hick-up i discovered that I will need a Windows XP CD to start the recovery console. I didnt have a disk available so
 created a new one on my other laptop and used this on the machine i was experiencing problems with.
<br />
<br />
The setup started as expected and I hit 'R' in order to repair the Windows XP installation using the recovery console.
<br />
<br />
I followed the steps as detailled here:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/330184" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">"Invalid Boot.ini" or "Windows could not start" error messages when you start your computer</a><br />
<br />
but when it came to typing <b>bootcfg/list</b> I was told that this command is not reconised. This has happened with every
<b>/cmd. W</b>hen i inserted simply <b>bootcfg</b> as expected it gave me a list of
<b>bootcfg/</b> commands but when tried no onf these commands work. <br />
<br />
After failing this I attempted to completely re-install windows XP onto the machine and just start over but when reaching the setup screen and hitting 'enter' to start the set up i get:<br />
<br />
"Setup cannot find End User Licensing Agreement"<br />
<br />
This is the point where I'm stuck and really don't know where to go next. someone please help as i'm just

<div>... you need to use the Dell-branded Windows XP Home Reinstallation CD if you want to reinstall Windows.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you downloaded a Recovery Console CD .iso, it is certainly handy to have. But it won't do what you need (assuming your goal is to lay down a fresh install of Windows).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Perhaps your laptop has a hidden recovery partition on it accessible by the Ctrl+F11 key combination. (I don't think it does, but it's possible.) This would be PC Restore by Symantec. If so, the CD is not necessary:</div>
