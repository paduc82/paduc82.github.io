<h2>            Some attachments won&#39;t open through Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    I'm running Windows Live Mail 2012 under Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; It's been working flawlessly for a long time, but all of a sudden I am unable to open some attachments simply by double-clicking the attachment icon in the incoming message.&nbsp; Image files open Windows
 Photo Viewer and display, but .pdf, .doc and .xls, for example, just do nothing.&nbsp; Hyperlinks within the message text open my browser just fine, however.&nbsp; I can right-click the attachment icon and Save as... onto the Desktop, then open the attachment from there,
 but I can't drag it from the mail message to the Desktop anymore or use the right-click/Open option.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any tips on this.

            PS I forgot this bit: You mention .doc and .xls files. Those are old (pre-2007) Office file formats. It's not certain that Windows is geared to opening them with your current Office programs. You can check this in
<em>Settings &gt;&nbsp; Apps &gt; Default apps &gt; Choose default applications by file type</em>.&nbsp; The app listed for
<strong>.doc</strong> should be the same as the one for <strong>.docx</strong>, and similarly
<strong>.xls</strong> and <strong>.xlsx</strong> should be associated with the same app.

<p>Hi, Firedog, nice to be back (perhaps not under these circumstances, however) and thanks for the info.&nbsp; All this happened all of a sudden, I made no changes to anything on my system.&nbsp; WLM was opening boththe old and new 'x' versions of Word and Excel documents,
 as well as the PDFs.&nbsp; In addition, I now see that VLC Media Player no longer opens any audio or video files, as it did so well before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Through its right-click interface with attachments, WLM does give you the option of Open, Print, Save as... and Save all..., as shown here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that just double-clicking the attachment automatically chooses the Open option, but Save as... is the only one that does anything anymore; thank heaven that works so I can transfer the attachment to the Desktop where, fortunately, a double-click
 does what it's supposed to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I went to the 'open-what-with-what' Windows utility and double-checked the usual suspects anyway, and they hadn't changed at all; either the default or user-specified programs were still listed as the ones to open the file types in each case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did go ahead and do an MS Office 'repair.'&nbsp; My version is the 2010 suite, so there was no 'quick repair' or whatever it was you recommended, just 'repair.'&nbsp; That didn't help, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: would an overall Windows 'repair' do anything, you think?&nbsp; I believe under System Restore there might be a similar repair option, but it's been a while since I was into that part of the system and I would be hesitant to use it without a promise
 that I wouldn't lose anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I notice that's different lately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually when I start Windows from cold, or do a restart, early in the process a DOS-like window pops up on top of the initial Windows starting screen.&nbsp; I believe the pop-up window is headed "C\Windows\System32\reg.exe".&nbsp; I've watched this window in the past
 and have seen perhaps one line of text come up before the window just completely disappears and Windows resumes its normal starting operation.&nbsp; But now the DOS-like window comes up, nothing ever displays on it, and it lasts a bit longer than it did previously
 before disappearing for Windows to start.&nbsp; Just wonder if this might be a clue.</p>

<p>Hi again, and sorry to keep you waiting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2010 file associations have always been a bit dodgy, I think. I do have a registry file to recreate all of them if you're up for that, but it won't help with your VLC problem. You forgot to mention which program you use to read PDFs - Windows 10 has
 a reader built-in, in the Edge browser. You might check which program is set as the default and perhaps try a different one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's odd if file associations for several different types of file have gone wonky, but I wouldn't recommend any sort of general Windows restore yet. As to your little DOS window,
<span>it's quite normal for reg.exe to run during start-up as Windows and programs check registry keys.
</span>You may be able to see what that belongs to in Task Manager (Ctrl-Shift-Escape). Make sure you're not looking at TM's compact view(click
<em>More details</em>), then look on the <em>Start-up</em> tab to see what's going on when you start up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to make sure that it's not Windows Live Mail at fault, compose a test message and

<p>My turn to apologize for a delayed response; somehow I'd set WLM to not check my msn account when downloading messages. Thanks for getting back on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation has been fixed, though I have no idea how.&nbsp; I might have known a couple of weeks ago, but forget now what I did.&nbsp; At any rate, as we used to say back at the phone company, 'the trouble has come clear.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really do appreciate your interest, and am awed by the 'claim' beside your signature.&nbsp; Although WLM has taken its place beside the washboard and buggy whip, I still find it an ideal mail client for my purposes, and only wish that: 1) Outlook could be stripped
 of some of its unnecessary bells and whistles, and&nbsp; 2) that the client associated with Windows 10 was a bit more like WLM.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, I reverted back my computer to Windows 7 so I can not reproduce this on any other image files and I am, at this point, unwilling to upgrade again to Windows 10 due to other issues (like default programs resetting, among others).&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Copy is greyed out for every photo file. &nbsp;This morning I took several photos during a walk and emailed them to myself using Outlook from Microsoft Office. &nbsp;When I opened the attachments each had the greyed out problem. &nbsp;It's not just today--I always have
 this problem and have had ever since Windows 10 was installed.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In complement of the request I confirm that the issue persist and for a lot of people ! Here are my comments and verifications :&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Tried to see / change attribute of the file (read-only) without success (using "attrib" command and properties tab)</li><li>Checked the access right and the owner of the files</li><li>Checked the access right configured for the network share</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I've tried to move one file to another location (local location) and the option "Copy" is available. It seems that the issue is only encountered with network shares.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried this with network share in Windows Server 2012 R2, 2008 R2 AND Windows 10 (anniversary update) !&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone from the MS support would have a look it would be fine !&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Geoff</p>

            Any update on this? I can confirm from several experiments that is has indeed to do with network shares. Local files are no problem, but SMB network shares cause the "make a copy" to be disabled in Photo Viewer under Windows 10

<h2>            CPU usage is very high for seemingly no reason.</h2>
                    I have an Acer Aspire V3-771G that I&nbsp;received&nbsp;for college. I've had the thing for about a month and it's already having problems. Now I've already contacted Acer support and they told me to do a System Recovery. That is sort of the last thing I want to
 do, but considering I've done everything else I can think of it may just be the right thing to do. I don't want to re-type everything so I'll just post here what I told them.<br />
<br />
<b><span>Hello, I have had some issues with my notebook. At first it had the problem of getting a blue screen whenever it enters sleep mode. That started happening about three weeks ago and still does that now. I had other things on my plate though
 so I just stopped using sleep mode altogether. Then about a week after that the CPU usage just went up for no reason. I turned on the computer and it was all slow. I went to task manager and the CPU Usage was wavering between 80-100. Once it finished up loading
 and was idle it went to 20-40. I've been dealing with this problem ever since. It isn't the case of one program taking up all of the CPU, but instead every program just uses up more usual. I went to System Configuration and Selective startup to attempt to
 isolate any individual services that might be using the CPU a lot, but I couldn't. Like I said everything just seems to require more CPU power. I checked and both processors are being used so that's not the issue. I have noticed that if I boot up in Safe Mode
 the CPU usage is normal.</span><br />
<span>I've done everything I can think of to try to fix this problem: I've updated drivers, deleted anything recent I had downloaded, disk defragment, disk cleanup, check disk, updated the BIOS, and performed scans for viruses, malware, spyware multiple
<span>I've done everything I can think of to try to fix this problem: I've updated drivers, deleted anything recent I had downloaded, disk defragment, disk cleanup, check disk, updated the BIOS, and performed scans for viruses, malware, spyware multiple
 times. All the scans have turned up nothing and even with updates to the drivers the CPU is still running unusually high. I am officially out of ideas now, and am hoping that someone can help me.</span></b>
<div><b><span><br />
</span></b></div>
<div>Now I'm not against System Recovery, but I do see it as a sort of a last resort. I've downloaded Process Explorer to get a&nbsp;better&nbsp;look around but that didn't help much (is more helpful than task manager though). I downloaded Malwarebytes to perform a more&nbsp;thorough&nbsp;scan,
 and it caught one file, but that changed nothing. &nbsp;I have looked all over the internet and tried everything it feels like, but I'm hoping there is just something else I haven't done and someone can give me a different solution. Thanks ahead for any help at
 all.</div>

            In most cases the recovery disks will work just as well as the Installation CD/Media<br />
The point here is that the system will be restored to a state that was intended to be stable.<br />
Then update from Step 5 onwards<br />
<br />
It's not likely that the problem will carry over (if it's a software issue) as the Recovery disks are made from the recovery partition on most systems - not from the active partition.<br />

            There is a problem device in Device Manager.&nbsp; It is the Security Processor Loader.<br />
We usually see this problem when damage from malware has caused problems with the security systems within Windows.<br />
<br />
If you've scanned for malware multiple times and are certain that there are no traces on the system - then try this:<br />
<br />
1 - run SFC.EXE /SCANNOW from an elevated (Run as adminstrator) Command Prompt.<br />
2 - perform an in-place upgrade of WIn7:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.sysnative.com/forums/showthread.php/3900-In-Place-Upgrade-Install-Windows-(Windows-7-Vista)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sysnative.com/forums/showthread.php/3900-In-Place-Upgrade-Install-Windows-(Windows-7-Vista)</a><br />
<br />
If that doesn't fix things, then I'd suggest a backup/wipe/and clean install of Windows (from this link:&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.carrona.org/canned.html#clean" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.carrona.org/canned.html#clean</a>
<br />
<br />
<u><b>Backup/Wipe/Clean Install of Windows:</b></u><br />
For testing purposes, it's best to install Windows "clean".<br />
This is, basically, installing it the way that Microsoft intended (using drivers from Windows Update).<br />
This procedure is for Windows 7 and Vista.<br />
<br />
You will need your installation/recovery DVD(s) before you start.&nbsp; Once you wipe the hard drive there's no going back!!!<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Backup all your data.&nbsp; <br />
This will wipe everything off of your hard drive, so anything that you want to keep will need to be saved elsewhere.<br />
<br />
 on them once you're done.&nbsp; Don't forget that, if this is due to an infection, the additional hard drives may be infected also.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Connect the system to the internet (if the system says disconnect from the Internet, then do so).<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Use one of these free utilities to wipe the hard drive clean:<br />
KillDisk ( <a href="http://www.killdisk.com/downloadfree.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.killdisk.com/downloadfree.htm</a> ).&nbsp;
<br />
DBAN ( <a href="http://www.dban.org/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dban.org/download</a> )<br />
This will also delete any recovery partitions on the system - so the installation/recovery DVD's are essential!!!<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; Install Windows by booting from the installation/recovery DVD - <span style="text-decoration-line: underline; font-weight: bold">
DO NOT tweak any settings!!!</span><br />
<br />
5.&nbsp; Visit Windows Update and get all updates<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp; Check Device Manager for any unknown/disabled devices - if there are unknown/disabled devices, fix them with the latest drivers from the device manufacturer's website (not the PC Manufacturer)<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp; Visit Windows Update and get the Service Packs for your system. (usually under Important Updates).&nbsp;
<br />

<h2>            Cannot find Minecraft purchased theme</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have just bought the "Around the World" theme for Minecraft, however I cannot see anything different.</p>
<p>I did see the download complete.</p>
<p>Do I need to do anything after the purchase.</p>
<p>(I have had the purchase confirmation from Microsoft)</p>
<p>If I attempt to buy it again will I be charged again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>2.Go to Social, and then select your avatar.</p>
<p>3.Select Change Theme.</p>
<p>4.Select a theme.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p>I believe that you need to start a new world and select that theme but if that isnt an option you may need to delete it and redownload it. it should not make you pay for it again as you already own it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try download and installing Direct X 11 from </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some games require different version of Direct X. If installing above version didn't help check on the CD/DVD's of your games for Direct X and install it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>There are hundreds of different types of mov file, as mov is just a container that holds the file within it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ensure you have the right codec for the file installed on your machine.</p>
<p>Often having quicktime installed will do, but sometimes you'll need to find the codec that made the file. So try installing any software that came with the camera.</p>
<p>Or use a programme like avicodec to identify the codec required and then search the net for it.</p>

<h2>            Start Menu hangs for about 2 seconds between keystrokes</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having an issue on my computer where the start menu is not allowing me to type searches like it used to. Essentially what is happening is there is a pause between keystrokes where I cannot type anything. For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Key -&gt; c -&gt; Wait 2 Seconds -&gt; a -&gt; Wait 2 Seconds -&gt; l -&gt; Wait 2 Seconds -&gt; c</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After doing a little digging, it appears to be something to do with an access denies issue, but I am not sure what wer.dll is. Here is the log from DebugView:</p>

            I have tried the first three items on the list, however they didn't solve the issue. As for the last 2 items, I can't perform those actions as this is a work computer and a domain joined account. This issue started happening after the fall creators update
 was installed.

<p>Hi Christopher,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to do the last two steps contained in the link given above, please try to start your PC on safe mode to isolate the issue further. To do, it please refer to this link:

<p>Something I forgot to mention in my original post is that this issue only starts to occur after the computer has been on for several hours. This issue is happening on two of my colleagues computers as well. This issue also seems to affect Microsoft Edge
 browser, which I can confirm. Based on my computers specs (see below) this issue should not be happening...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found this link where others are also experiencing the same issue:</p>
<p>https://www.tenforums.com/performance-maintenance/12860-windows-10-start-menu-lag-delay.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My PC Specs:</p>
<p>CPU: Intex Xeon E5-1650 v4 (6 physical core's, 12 logical cores at 3.60GHz)</p>
<p>RAM: 32GB DDR4 @ 2400MHz</p>
<p>Disk: 512GB Samsung Pro 960 M.2</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried to capture this issue in a video. It's kind of hard to see without physically using the keyboard, but perhaps this will help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Since this site doesn't allow animated gif's, here is the link...)</p>
<p>https://image.ibb.co/dd7tMv/00_F8669_F_6_AD7_49_E4_A954_19_B369045_B4_E.gif</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice in this image, when I type "calc" the second time an the start menu only receives "cac", you will see the calculator app go from being selected to not selected and back to selected. This is the behavior I see every time I type a character (unless
 I am really fast). While it is doing this, the search box is completely blocked and I cannot type.</p>

<p>FYI, I just wanted to mention that I found out what the issue is and was able to fix it. In my case, it was an issue with McAfee using an API which had a breaking change in the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update.</p>

            Solved. CCleaner, Defraggler and All Norton Products were the issue and were making Kaspersky's Pure 3.0 to Fail.

            Hi Donny.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />How was Windows 10 originally activated on the PC?
<br />
<br />Free Upgrade uses no key except the generic version key which must not be changed or it won't activate.  
<br />
<br />Preinstalled Windows from factory uses an embedded Product Key that can be read by installing ProducKey to look for the OEM BIOS key only.  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a>  You an insert that key in that scenario.  
<br />
<br />Were any changes made to your hardware or on the PC at all?  
<br />
<br />Run the Activation Troubleshooter in Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I have a windows vista system on desktop. I installed Phoenix flight simulator on it and am having sound issues with it. The indoor flying site the sound is just fine (no problems) but on the outdoor flying sites there is little sound. If I listen very carefully
 I can barely hear the plane engine before takeoff. I've uninstalled it and installed it again still the same problem (like a silent movie) I also intalled it on my laptop with windows vista and have no problems (good sound&nbsp;at all flying sites) Anyone have
 any ideas on what I need to do, i sure would be grateful. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello MarcyDarcy1003, <br />
<br />
Thank you for posting.&nbsp; I thinking that the file is a type not supported by DVD maker.&nbsp; We can try to import that file into Windows Movie Maker and then publish movie to make it a WMV file type.&nbsp; I've included the steps to do this below.<br />
</p>
Import video files, pictures, and audio into <span>
Windows</span> Movie Maker
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can import files with the following file name extensions into
<span>Windows</span> Movie Maker to use in your project:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Video files:</span> .asf, .avi, .dvr-ms, .m1v, .mp2, .mp2v, .mpe, .mpeg, .mpg, .mpv2, .wm, and .wmv</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Audio files:</span> .aif, .aifc, .aiff .asf, .au, .mp2, .mp3, .mpa, .snd, .wav, and .wma</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Picture files:</span> .bmp, .dib, .emf, .gif, .jfif, .jpe, .jpeg, .jpg, .png, .tif, .tiff, and .wmf</p>
</li></ul>
<p>You can also import files into <span>Windows</span> Movie Maker that have a different extension from the ones listed above, but not all file types will work when you try to use them to make a movie.</p>
<p>Microsoft Recorded TV Show files (with a .dvr-ms file name extension) that are not protected using digital rights management can be imported into
<span>Windows</span> Movie Maker if your computer is running
<span>Windows&nbsp;Vista</span> Home Premium or <span>
Windows&nbsp;Vista</span> Ultimate.</p>
<div><span>
&nbsp;To import files into Windows Movie Maker
</span><span>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click <span>File</span>, and then click <span>
Import Media Items</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Navigate to the location that contains the digital media files you want to import, and then click
<span>Import</span>.</p>
</li></ol>
</span></div>
Tips
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can import several video clips at once. For consecutive clips, click the first video clip in the list, press and hold down the SHIFT key, and then click the last clip in the list. For video clips that are not consecutive, press and hold
 down the CTRL key, and then click each clip that you want to import into <span>
Windows</span> Movie Maker.</p>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can also import video files and pictures by dragging the files from
<span>Windows</span> Photo Gallery into <span>
Windows</span> Movie Maker.</p>
</li></ul>
Publish a movie in <span>Windows</span> Movie Maker
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you finish working on a project, you can publish the project as a movie. A movie is a
<span>Windows</span> Media file with a .wmv file name extension or an Audio-Video Interleaved (AVI) file with an .avi file name extension. When you publish a movie in
<span>Windows</span> Movie Maker, you can share it with others in a number of ways—through your computer, on a recordable CD, on a recordable DVD, as an attachment in an e‑mail message, or on videotape in a DV camera.</p>
<div><span>
&nbsp;To publish a movie to your computer
</span><span>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click <span>File</span>, click <span>
Publish Movie</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <span>This computer</span>, and then click <span>
Next</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the <span>File name</span> box, type a name for your movie.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the <span>Publish to</span> box, choose where you want to save your movie once it's published, and then click
<span>Next</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Choose the settings you want to use to publish your movie, and then click
<span>Publish</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you want to watch your movie after it has been published, select the
<span>Play movie when I click Finish</span> check box.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <span>Finish</span>.</p>
</li></ol>
</span></div>
<div><span>
&nbsp;To publish and burn a movie to a DVD
</span><span>
<ol>
<div>
<p>To publish and burn a movie to a DVD, you must have <span>
Windows</span> DVD Maker, which is included in <span>Windows&nbsp;Vista</span> Ultimate and
<span>Windows&nbsp;Vista</span> Home Premium. You also need a DVD burner.</p>
<li>
<p>Insert a blank recordable or rewritable DVD into your DVD burner.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Open a project in <span>Windows</span> Movie Maker.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <span>File</span>, and then click <span>
Publish Movie</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <span>DVD</span>, and then click <span>
Next</span>. <span>Windows</span> DVD Maker opens.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Complete the steps to create a DVD using <span>
Windows</span> DVD Maker.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if thsis was helpful for you</p>

<h2>            RDP From Outside Network</h2>
                    I have a server running Windows Server 2008 Standard R2.<br />
<br />
I have activated one Per User Remote Desktop CAL on this server, and added a user into the RDP group.<br />
<br />
My server has an IP address of 192....., which I am aware is a private address.<br />
<br />
When I use a laptop to connect remotely, it allows me to do so using that IP address as long as I am on the same network as it.<br />
<br />
Obviously, this does not work once you are on a different network.<br />
<br />
How do I set this up so that I can access remotely through any internet connection?<br />

            <p>You would need to forward/open <strong>TCP Port 3389</strong> on any firewall/router the server is behind. Call from a remote location using the public IP of the firewall/router, ie. the IP assigned by the servers ISP, or a fully qualified domain name.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Could you suggest a page that gives you step by step instructions to fix this issue so that someone other then a Microsoft Support Engineer can understand. Your suggested link is of no help what so ever to someone who is not tech savvy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the page you suggested and it says it applies to Windows 8 not Windows 10. Following the bottom of the screen link to Windows 10 help was about as useful as your link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assist in rectifying this issue in easy to understand instructions, not tech jargon.</p>

            I had the same issue. When I upgraded to 10. &nbsp; I found this solution in another thread and it worked for me. &nbsp; Apparently SQL2000 is not needed and is not compatible with windows 10. &nbsp; Go into the task manager, start up, and disable the SQL manger. &nbsp; Reboot
 and the error message should be gone.

            <p>This was helpfull. On my system&nbsp;in the startup file called "Service manager" was activating the file SQLmangr.exe. Removing the file&nbsp;from the startup resolved the problem.</p>

<h2>            Cannot zoom in Windows Picture Viewer &#40;Win 7-64&#41; using Microsoft mouse</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using a microsoft mouse on Win 7-64. In Windows Picture Viewer the mouse wheel won't zoom the image in and out. (yes I make sure I left clicked it, and yes it scrolls fine everywhere else (internet, word, etc))</p>
<p>What could cause this? Something I can check in the registry?</p>
<p>The mouse drivers are the vanilla drivers you get when installing Windows 7-64.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the System File Checker found nothing wrong.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that the wheel also doesn't zoom in Windows Picture Viewer if I plug the mouse into a Windows 7 Professional 32 bit laptop.</p>
<p>In fact I've tried the mouse on 4 different pc's (all Windows 7) and it doesn't zoom in Windows Picture Viewer in any of them!</p>
<p>It scrolls windows and webpages perfectly fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the standard black Microsoft mouse you get with the Wireless Microsoft Desktop 800 Keyboard and Mouse.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought a mouse wheel could zoom Windows Picture Viewer images in and out. I must have remembered it wrong?</p>
