<p>Hi, just found something that worked for me - on windows 7. It happened with Outlook. Anyway, this is what worked</p>
<p>I am using Task Bar with "small icons" and that you cen get by accessing the Properties after click-right on the Task Bar and selecting Propertis-&gt;Task Bar.</p>
<p>Here is what I did:</p>
<p>1) start the app in question</p>
<p>2) if you see nothing except the icon on the start bar, click on that until you see the outline of the app</p>
<p>3) move the mouse on that and click right. You will&nbsp;see a pop-up&nbsp; with the posibility of "Restore, Move, Size, Minimize, Maximize". CLick on Size!</p>
<p>At this point your mouse will move to the middle of teh screen. Now ... do nothing except press the direction keys, Up, Down, Right, Left. Any will do. Suddenly the app will appear.</p>
<p>This problem seems to come from a window somehow being "resized" into one pixel, or even zero pixel, or perhaps only zero pixels high.</p>
<p>For me ... it worked. Bye!</p>

 this be a Microsoft problem? I hope someone can tell me how to fix this problem. Thank You !</p>

<h2>            computer controlled by remote access</h2>
                    I know this is going to sound crazy but I am very serious and sane. &nbsp;I think my computer and all access has been altered by background apps that are being controlled by someone else. &nbsp;I was able to get into event management, finally, and there seems to
 be programs set to run or be triggered by me. &nbsp;Also, it is my computer but I am denied access to any and all adm settings. &nbsp;I cant reset the computer because those functions are blocked as well. &nbsp;It also appears that there is a platform implemented and I was
 changed from a adult to a child. &nbsp;Trouble shooting not an option as I have no access as well. &nbsp;Can someone help me and is there anyway that I can trace who did this?

    <title>USB power cycling automatically - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nikolai polkov  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB power cycling automatically</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's my problem: when I plug a certain USB device into my laptop, the UBS port it rhythmically power cycles itself. It'll go on for about 2.5 sec, then off for 2.5 sec.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the specs:</p>
<p>- Laptop: Acer Aspire, Intel i5 running Windows 8.1. I bought the laptop not more than four weeks ago and to this point haven't been doing anything but uni on it.</p>
<p>- Device: Suunto ambit (so a GPS watch, it charges via USB and uploads data via web-based software called Movescount)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stuff I've already tried:</p>
<p>- Plugging the watch into mains power to recharge, thus proving the cable and the watch itself.</p>
<p>- Plugging the watch into another computer to recharge/upload, and this also works fine</p>
<p>- I've tried all three USB ports, all have the same cycling problem</p>
<p>- Tried using other USB devices on all three ports, this watch is the only one the exhibits this issue</p>
<p>- Control panel &gt; Device Manager &gt; USB controllers &gt; USB Root &gt; Properties &gt; Power management &gt; unchcked "Allow the computer to turn this device off to save power"</p>
<p>_ And yes, turning the computer on and off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure it's not a physical connection because when it goes through its power cycle, it's really rhythmic.&nbsp; I've trawled the internet for answers but I found nothing really applicable. I've also posted this thread on Suunto and Acer forums.</p>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Nikolai Polkov, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing with information and I appreciate the steps that you have tried to resolve the issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the model number of Suunto ambit device? </p>
<p>2. What is the model number of Acer Laptop? </p>
<p>3. What happens when you connect other USB devices to these USB ports? Do you get any error messages?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like USB controller cannot control the power when this device is connected and this could be due to many issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:<br />
<br />
</strong>I would suggest you to update the chipset drivers to the latest by visiting the computer Manufacturer website.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The Motherboard chipset has a driver which can affect the speed and stability of many of the devices built into your motherboard. It is fairly common for computers to be running with old chipset drivers
 or to use the basic default drivers built into Windows. It would be a good idea to install the latest chipset drivers.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to work with other USB devices, you may have to uninstall and reinstall USB controller devices.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Method 2: Uninstall and re-install the Universal Serial Bus Controller</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the Bluetooth drivers and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Press <span><strong>Windows Key + R,</strong> type
<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b. Expand the <strong><span>Universal Serial Bus Controllers</span></strong> section by clicking on the<strong><span>"+"</span></strong> sign.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. <strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong> each of the devices under the<strong><span>USB Controller</span></strong> section by right-clicking on each one, and then clicking
<strong><span>Uninstall.</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d. Close the <strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong> and<strong><span>restart</span></strong> your computer. Windows will automatically re-install the USB controllers in your computer, without you having to
 do anything further. Your computer will now run USB devices properly.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope this information helps. Reply with the status so that we could help you further.

</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong> not only failed to power the USB ports properly, but also resulted in the touchscreen being disabled with no (known) way to re-enable. After about 24 hours of trying to remedy this, I eventually performed a factory reset on the
 laptop. (Aside, this reset the laptop to Windows 8 (not 8.1), which still exhibited the original USB issue).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2 </strong>I had previously tried but gave it another shot to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. </strong>Doesn't have one on the unit, although I guarantee it's a Suunto Ambit (original, not the Ambit 2 or anything)</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>V5-572PG</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>No error messages, nada. This is the only device not working. So when I plug the watch in, it takes a second or two to handshake with the laptop, then it locks (so you can't edit settings etc while data transferring). It does this whenever
 plugged into any computer). Then once it has locked, the connection drops and then re-connects, thus continuing this annoying cycle.</p>

            <p>Hi Eliyas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately this is process is impossible to follow. As my watch repeatedly disconnects and reconnects every 1-2sec, the device manager list of HID's is refreshed every time it power cycles, so I have less than 2 sec to right click, open properties and
 get the details. Frustrating would be an understatement.</p>

            <p>You can follow the process even without the device. Unplug the device, go into the device manager and in the view menu, select "Show hidden devices" option. Now you should be able to see all disconnected devices. Follow the instruction in the blog to apply
 the registry setting. I'm assuming your device is a HID device. So the first step is to make sure the device is a HID device or not.

            <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got the same problem - and frankly these proposed fix routes are rather poor. there should be a simple way of identifying which device is connected and configuring the settings for that device connection to avoid this issue. It worked fine with previous
 windows versions, some more thought and testing should have been applied to this release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the above the best proposed 'fix' for this issue?</p>
<p>

    <title>Importing Folders From Hotmail.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rustyfender04  say:</h3>
<h2>            Importing Folders From Hotmail.com</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
Recently, Windows Live Mail became stuck in some sort of of update loop with Hotmail's calendar, and I could not receive or send emails either. Frustrated, I checked Hotmail's account settings, and they did not show an advanced tab so I could check the pop3
 settings. I deleted and then recreated the account, but Live Mail is not syncing with my custom-made online Hotmail folders like it did before.<br />
<br />
My hotmail settings are below...<br />
<br />
pop3.live.com (port 995)<br />
smtp.live.com (port 25)<br />
<br />
Both ports require secure connection (SSL)<br />
<br />
<br />
Are these settings correct, or is there an automatic way to setup a Hotmail account in Live Mail so I can download messages from those custom folders?<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />

            <p>POP3 only downloads new messages in the inbox. If you allow Windows Live Mail to set up the account for you, it will apply&nbsp;HTTP settings so that all folders will synchronize between client and server. This is not POP3, so there isn't an
<em>Advanced </em>tab with port settings to worry about. Press Ctrl-Shift-T to start the wizard, enter your address, password and display name and the program will do the rest.
<br />
<br />
However, the problem you experienced earlier (the calendar update loop) sounds like a symptom of an errant registry value. This can be cured by running the fixit on this page:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2842520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Live Mail Error: 0x8DE20003 or Server Error: 3204</a>.&nbsp;It works for Windows 7 and 8.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Do that first, then set up the account again; when it's working properly, you can remove the POP3 account (right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select
<em>Remove account</em>).<br />
<br />

            Thanks. I'll keep the Fixit tool in mind if this happens again.<br />
<br />
Before you posted, I did a system restore, and it fixed my problem for now as well as restoring my custom folders too. I'm wondering if the latest Windows Defender update for Windows 7 caused the calendar glitch.<br />
<br />
I wonder if the Live Mail wizard would import custom folders from a Yahoo account?<br />

<h2>            Disabled Startup Programs will not re-enable.</h2>
                    I disabled a few startup programs (one of which is&nbsp;the Toshiba Flashcard function -- whiched turned out to be necessary for some of my Function key-controled commands) and now even though under Run&gt;&gt;msconfig the program indicates it is enabled, it does
 not actually start up upon booting. I have tried disabling and enabling again but nothing seems to work? This seems to be the case for at least three different programs. All of the start ups are enabled but they just don't seem to be running on the computer.
 Help!

<h2>            Bitlocker Recovery &#34;Process&#34; Does not help clients in need</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Dell XPS 15 9570. It is less than three months old. This morning after a restart, I was prompted to enter a Bitlocker recovery key. I had no idea what this was. After searching the internet and calling support it is determined that my Bitlocker
 recovery key is lost and my drive is locked. I don't understand how Microsoft could create such a process to 'protect' the client that would have NO avenue to recover if the client did not even understand the process or made a mistake.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I lock myself out of my house, I can call a locksmith, show my id and get back in. With this process. I have no alternative but to factory reset my PC and lose my files. In my case, I lost everything on the C drive, but my D drive is still locked and
 looking for this stupid key. ...This is spinning in circles. What is the solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I will do when I recover is to permanently disable Bitlocker, so I won't have to deal with this again....</p>

<p>Johann,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a resolution to my issue. A Dell Level 1 technician was able to find the Bitlocker Recovery Keys for my system on the MS website for my account. My D drive is unlocked and works normally. The C drive is not recoverable and I am loading my backup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently a fault with TPM at startup caused the problem with Bitlocker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Recovery Keys were on the MSN site. Unfortunately the links on the MSN site, the Dell site (you provided here and I accessed previously), plus the links provided aand used by the MSN level 1 tech to find the recovery keys ultimately led to a dead end
 even though we logged on to my account properly each time using multi factor authentication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the issue was not me forgetting to save or write down the Bitlocker recovery keys. They were always there in my MSN account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Dell website encourages users to contact Microsoft regarding Bitlocker Recovery Key retrieval. I escalated this to Dell management because had I contacted them first, perhaps a great deal of frustration could have been avoided on all parts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your thoughtful help with this. I lost my C drive for a while but gained some knowledge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I got it to install using the hints in this thread and some extra work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll go through this step by step and hopefully it will help someone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. press win+r and type<span>&nbsp;</span><span>diskmgmt.msc</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. click on your C: drive</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. below the list of drives there will be a partition map, the first partition will be Data or some such, listed at 100MB, right click on it and go to change drive letters and paths -&gt; add -&gt; now choose Y: for the drive letter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. open an admin cmd prompt, in win8 you can press win+x and choose command prompt (admin), in win7 you have to create a shortcut for<span>&nbsp;</span><span>cmd.exe</span>, then go to compatibility in the shortcut properties,
 and choose run as admin</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. type: Y: &lt;enter&gt; in the cmd window</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. run these commands:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">takeown /f . /r /d y</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">icacls . /</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">grant administrators</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">:F /t</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">attrib -h -s -r bootmgr</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I got it to install using the hints in this thread and some extra work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll go through this step by step and hopefully it will help someone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. press win+r and type<span>&nbsp;</span><span>diskmgmt.msc</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. click on your C: drive</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. below the list of drives there will be a partition map, the first partition will be Data or some such, listed at 100MB, right click on it and go to change drive letters and paths -&gt; add -&gt; now choose Y: for the drive letter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. open an admin cmd prompt, in win8 you can press win+x and choose command prompt (admin), in win7 you have to create a shortcut for<span>&nbsp;</span><span>cmd.exe</span>, then go to compatibility in the shortcut properties,
 and choose run as admin</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. type: Y: &lt;enter&gt; in the cmd window</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. run these commands:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">takeown /f . /r /d y</span><br />
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">attrib -h -s -r bootmgr</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">NOTE: for the icacls command you can use your username instead of administrators, to find out your username type 'whoami'</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Hi Applefanboy,

<div>The upper instruction is for the solution for the user who his computer had a small system reserved partition. But for the error code: 0x80240031 is about the corrupted windows 8.1 update file while the downloading.</div>

            <p>No fix. I just kept clicking the "Try Again" and the update finally went through (4th try)&nbsp;- no rhyme nor reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>personally, I think their servers are just slammed and at 50% install mark there is some type of license verification which at the moment is timing out / throwing the 80240031 error</p>

            Same problem here when I try to download the ISO from Volume Licensing. &nbsp;However, when I change the download method from "Download Manager" to "Web Browser" I can get a complete download. &nbsp;Or do I? (NO!) &nbsp;I've downloaded several times and I get a different
 CRC hash value with each ISO. &nbsp;Can't find the official CRC values from Microsoft so it's a guessing game. &nbsp;I think that if I can get two ISO downloads with the same CRC it must be right.

            <p>Hello Karen,</p>
<p>First, some general information. Memory in this case refers to your RAM, the memory that programs use to operate in. Your hard disk is your storage media, where you store your data (pictures, letters, emails, etc.). Your hard drive can be virtually empty
 and you can still be low on memory if you have lots of programs open. Understand?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the question to ask is, "Just how many programs do you have open?". The easiest way to answer that question is to open Task Manager. Right-click on the taskbar and select Start Task Manager. When it opens, click on the top row of tabs, Applications. How
 many applications are open? If its a lot, can you close some without stopping whatever work you're doing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next question to ask is how much memory do you have on your computer? Go to Control Panel, click on System, scroll down till you see memory (both total and available); what are those numbers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the last question to ask is how much virtual memory do you have? From Control Panel | System, look to the left and on the list of additional items choose Advanced System Settings. Choose the Advanced tab, Performance, Advance Tab, scroll down to Virtual
 Memory. What is that number, and what is recommended?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please post back here with the answers to these questions, or if you don't understand something, or&nbsp;need more specific instructions on how to do something I've described, or.....I'll do my best to assist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

            <p>It is a question of driver availability.&nbsp; Check the Dell website for XP drivers.
</p>
<p>Keep in mind that XP will go out of support entirely in a year and a half.&nbsp; Windows 7 is a much better choice but you need to check the Dell website to see if your computer is compatible and what drivers are available.&nbsp; Use the links on this page to determine
 if you can upgrade to Windows 7:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/win7_support/win7_portal?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;~ck=mn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/win7_support/win7_portal?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;~ck=mn</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you choose Windows 7 buy Professional and then you can use XP mode for software that does not run on Windows 7.&nbsp; Software designed for Vista runs on Windows 7.</p>

            I'm afraid Microsoft does not support downgrading from Vista to XP. You will have to perform a backup of you data, and do a fresh install of Windows XP.
<br />
<br />
I would reccomend installing Windows 7. Judging by the specs for of the Dell Inspiron 1501, you may need to install more memory. Dell Inspiron 1501 supports up-to 2GB of RAM if I'm not mistaken.<br />
<br />
Please reply if you're are in need of assistance.<br />

<h2>            Screen Flashing after WIndows 10 March 2016 Update</h2>
                    <p>When I upgraded to Windows 10, my desktop PC began experiencing the flickering screen issue.&nbsp; I followed the instructions to disable the Reporting and Error Reporting options through msconfig and that fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after the March 2016 update (3/8 or 3/9?), it's doing the exact same screen flickering again.&nbsp; My graphics drivers (NVidia GTX 970) are up to date as of this week.&nbsp; Is anyone else experiencing this issue?&nbsp; I'm sending this from my laptop, but I
 can't use my desktop GAMING PC at all.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Nobody can tell you that without more information about your system.<br />
<br />
They can guess and suggest things like the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts":<br />
<br />
<i>"Increase the value of the initial and maximum size to a higher value"</i><br />
<br />
That makes no sense at all, but it is advice from these Microsoft engaged Support Engineer alleged "experts".<br />
<br />
Do you increase by 10, 100, 1000, a <i>meelion</i>?<br />
<br />
If your paging file is out of whack you might see stuff like this:<br />
<br />
Virtual Memory Minimum Too Low: Your system is low on virtual memory.&nbsp; Windows is increasing the size of your virtual memory paging file.<br />
<br />
That means Windows XP is letting you know it is doing it's job.&nbsp; The message is not an error message - it is an informational message.<br />
<br />
If XP thinks the size of the paging file (usually c:\pagefile.sys) is too small to accommodate your current operations it will adjust the paging file to make the paging file larger and display that message as it does so.&nbsp; It is not necessarily a "problem",
 but the message is annoying.<br />
<br />
From my notes:<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless you know more about managing memory that Windows XP, it is usually best to just let XP handle the size of your virtual memory paging file.<br />
<br />
To see what your current settings are, right click My Computer, Properties, Advanced, Performance Settings, Advanced tab, Virtual Memory, then click the Change button.<br />
<br />
Make a note of the current settings in case you need to change them back later.<br />
<br />
The best setting for the Paging file size is usually going to be:<br />
<br />
<b>System managed size</b><br />
<br />
Right click My Computer, Properties, Advanced tab, Performance... Settings, Advanced tab, Virtual memory... Change.<br />
<br />
Make a note of the current setting so you can change things back later if you have a problem.<br />
<br />
If it is not already, set the Paging file size to:<br />
<b><br />
System managed size</b><br />
<br />
Be sure to click Set (to set it), OK a few times to save the adjustments and then restart your computer.<br />
<br />
Windows XP will try to allocate a paging file approximately 1.5 times the total amount of the RAM installed in your system.&nbsp; Letting Windows XP handle the paging file size is adequate for most configurations.<br />
<br />
If your system is <i><b>not </b></i>set to System managed size, you need to determine how it got changed and why (usually some wrong reason), make a note of the current settings so you can change them back later if needed, then change the setting to System
 managed size, click the Set button and then click Apply to commit the changes (you will be asked to reboot). &nbsp;<br />
<br />
"Because somebody told me to" is not a good reason to start making adjustments to the paging file size.&nbsp; Just adjusting it to make it larger by some arbitrary value may relieve the symptom of the problem and stop the message, but may not result in the best
 configuration for your system. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Any advice to "Increase the value of the initial and maximum size to a higher value" are uninformed ideas that come from not knowing how XP works - how much do you increase it and what if you increase it too much?<br />
<br />
If you want your system to run as efficiently as possible, you need to figure out what is going on and fix it properly and not just start trying things or make some arbitrary adjustments.<br />
<br />
The size of the paging file may really need adjusting, but you should at least try to know what you are doing and why you need to do it.&nbsp; It is unlikely that anybody can tell you how to adjust your settings properly without more information.<br />
<br />
If you are not sure what the best settings are or if you are not sure what your settings need to be and need some help looking at your stuff, do this:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete the personal information from the pasted information. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork and assumptions.<br />

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 screen shaking &#47; flickering, ghost image for words</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface Pro 4 sudden started to have this issue two days ago.&nbsp; At first I noticed the screen was shaking/flickering. &nbsp; The problem sometimes went away, but it always returned.&nbsp; Then a day later, the problem got worse.&nbsp; I noticed the words were blurry,
 and at first I thought it was my eyes.&nbsp; A closer look I saw every word had double image.&nbsp; As it is on the third day since the problem started, it sometimes got worse and sometimes it is slightly better, but the computer is quite unusable most of the time.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Even the boot screen was flickering.&nbsp; Yes, the Surface logo was flickering during booting up. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6505b987-761b-49de-a658-3107281cc640" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6505b987-761b-49de-a658-3107281cc640" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to reinstall the device driver for the graphics card, and I even reinstalled Windows itself.&nbsp; Everything is updated to the latest Nothing fixed it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I searched online and found I am not alone to have this problem.&nbsp; Yet with all the complaints, there is no real solution.&nbsp; No one had said they have fixed it. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I have tried many of the solutions provided by Microsoft posted in the discussion section.&nbsp; Nothing worked.&nbsp; Nothing...&nbsp; :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The device, the keyboard, and all the accessories cost me more than $1,500 over a year ago (yes, out of warranty unfortunately).&nbsp; I checked the support online, and it says I need to pay $450 to get a replacement of "a similar device". &nbsp; To think something
 was not cheap only last for less than two years... and I have to pay extra (not cheap again) to just get a replacement of "similar device" (new or used?), this is quite unacceptable to me. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">My last laptop, a Dell lasted me more than 7 years, and it was a few hundred bucks cheaper.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since I have never had any serious problem with this Surface Pro 4 until a few days ago.&nbsp; I have always recommended people to buy it.</p>
<p>Just last week, I recommended another friend to buy a Surface as she is in the market for a new computer for work. &nbsp; Now I am not really sure I have made the right decision myself. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not pay over $1,500 just to have it last for less than two years. &nbsp; :( &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am wondering if anyone with similar situation had a satisfying conclusion?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Flickering screen in Windows is usually caused by an incompatible app or display driver. To determine whether an app or driver is causing the problem, check to see if Task Manager flickers.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>If Task Manager doesn't flicker, an app is probably causing the problem.</span></li><li><span>If Task Manager does flicker, a display driver is probably causing the problem.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Also, <span>three apps were previously known to cause screen flickering in Windows 10: Norton AV, iCloud, and IDT Audio. In most cases, updating the app or contacting the app manufacturer for an update will fix the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is recommended to uninstall <span>Duet Display if the app is <span>installed.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Go to <strong>Start </strong>and select <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>
System </strong>&gt; <strong>Apps &amp; Features</strong>, and check to see if Duet Display is listed under installed software.
<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, we suggest that you take your device a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/find-a-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Store</a> near you and have it assessed. If you're outside the US, check the

    <title>Black Screen at Getting Devices Ready - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul plusa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black Screen at Getting Devices Ready</h2>
                    Hello,
<div>I had a system failure (CPU fan component shattered, stopping the fan completely without me noticing), which caused the system to shut down to protect itself. Windows didn't want to boot after that; as I've had similar issues in the past, I figured the
 sudden shutoff caused a hard drive crash and went down the path to reinstall the OS.</div>
<div>As a precaution I unplugged my 2 extra hard drives (since they act as my backup and primary data storage).<br />
<br />
Since then I've been getting a black screen at the "Getting Devices Ready" screen (after the first reboot). &nbsp;It also seems to lock up completely at this point, as after a few minutes all hard drive activity stops.</div>
<div>One thing that makes this confusing is that, as stated, this is a reinstall - I installed Win 8 about 6 months ago on this same rig without issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Things I've tried:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Booting up with only required peripherals plugged in (monitor, mouse, keyboard + network).</li><li>Booting up without the network cable plugged in (same as above minus the network)</li><li>Booting up with only the monitor plugged in</li><li>Booting up with nothing but the power plugged in (internally, just one hard drive, graphics card, RAM and DVD drive)</li><li>Switching which port the monitor is in on the graphics card (my motherboard doesn't have on-board graphics).</li><li>Refresh and Repair installs</li><li>Install on a completely new hard drive</li><li>Just letting it sit at the black screen (in case it was just slowly crunching through stuff - I let it go for about 6 hours with no result)</li><li>Switching to an old keyboard</li><li>Installing Windows 7 (worked perfectly fine) then upgrading to 8 (same issue occurred)</li><li>Reseated internal components (hard drive, graphics card, RAM and DVD drive)</li><li>Disabled all unnecessary items in the UEFI (network card, floppy ports, serial ports, etc.
<div>Grabbed a copy of the log files too; setuperr.log was empty. &nbsp;The others are at my personal website:&nbsp;<a href="http://paulplusa.com/win8logs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://paulplusa.com/win8logs/</a></div>

            As mentioned, the Windows 7 installation was only a temporary, clean install, just as an alternative way to try installing Windows 8. &nbsp;This was also all occurring on a hard drive with no previous Windows installations, and occurred the very first time
 I attempted to install 8 on it.
<div><br />
<div>I was noticing some small graphical glitches during the early steps of installation, so I borrowed a friend's graphics card to replace mine (temporarily). &nbsp;I was able to install 8 without any issue using his graphics card. &nbsp;Once I reinstalled my card (after
 the os was fully installed), a very similar issue popped up (Windows splash screen -&gt; black screen).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will be contacting the graphics card tech support group to get a replacement.</div>

            I switched off HDMI cable from video adapter. It helped.

<h2>            &#34;Send to Mail Recipient&#34; is missing</h2>
                    There is no "mail recipient" listed on the right-click drop-down for "send to".&nbsp; I never noticed whether it was there when I first upgraded to Windows 10, but it is not there now.&nbsp; Is this a deliberate omission, or is there something I need to do to get
 it back on the list.&nbsp; There are workarounds that I can live with, but having it there on the drop-down for all these years has been something of a convenience I would like to continue using.

            Thanks, but I had seen that and some other solutions to problems that don't seem to match mine exactly. I have a default mail with all its default properties enabled—Eudora.&nbsp; My problem is that there is no entry on the drop-down menu for "sent to email
 recipient".&nbsp; No error message appears, because I am not being offered the possibility of sending anything by email on that list.&nbsp; I need to know how to create it or get it back.&nbsp; Meanwhile, I'm surviving with drag-and-drop.<br />
