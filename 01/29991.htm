            I do not have any kind of problem with my desktop looking or while I am using any app. Everything is ok all the background colors and whatever it is on my screen everything is perfect. However, my only issue here is: when I go and click on ''PC Settings''
 option than everything is messed up and does not look right. I can not personalize my computer because of this. Now, coming to your questions: about uninstalling and installing simply I have tried many options without using any 3rd party tools but the official
 Nvidia drivers. I used clean install option than I uninstalled them properly and tried normal install. I have tried also custom install and the result was negative, the issue is still there. Lastly, I have tried to upgrade my native GPU drivers (again officially)
 and I selected the CPU GPU from Nvidia's software and the result was negative again. I really do not know what to do else.

<h2>            How to get ahold of a live person that can help with an issue</h2>
                    
<p>I have been passed back and forth for two hours now about activating my xbox gold account that I purchased when I bought Office 365. After two hours, 3 different phone numbers and 8 different people&nbsp;I was put on hold by the last person I spoke to and was
 then disconnected. The last guy said that if I did everything right I would have had teh account, but as far as I know I did everything right, since they charged my charge card. It might have been a good thing that I was disconnected since as am about to lose
 my temper, but I do not want to go through their phone system again. Is there an email address I can send to, since all MS seems to want me to do is phone chat, after a 15 minute wait.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 not recognizing Radeon 580 4gb GPU cards</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone! I'm stumped and would love your help. I'm building out a new mining rig but the GPU units are not being recognized by the OS. Grabbing the drivers and device recognizer from the Sapphire website when run cannot detect the GPU devices. In device
 manger the PCIE cards come up fine but no additional hardware is found. I uninstalled the previous driver for the onboard display driver in safe mode and restarted it but it didn't help. I made sure all connections are seated and I can't seem to get anything
 to work from the forums. Here is the specs on the system:</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I currently have six of the GPU's physically installed but only one with power in on it. I read that the configuration is easier with one then to do them all at once. It's running the latest version of Windows 10 with all the current updates. Originally
 I wanted to do Linux but I couldn't find drivers that would work with Ubuntu so opted for windows instead. &nbsp;I have it switched to the bio mode on the physical GPU unit. Going into the bios I don't see it show up under the display options in the GUI. I'm guessing
 theres either a compatibility issue or conflict that I am missing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas would be helpful! Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>My only thought for this. Just to check you do have your monitor plugged into the card when trying to install the drivers.?</p>
<p>Have you tried drivers from AMD for the Radeon.?</p>

<p>I didn't have the monitor plugged into it. Right now it's into the motherboard. Would that force the system to look for the new card if the only monitor is plugged into the GPU?</p>
<p>

            If you are trying to use the Radeon then you need the monitor plugged into it. With the monitor in the motherboard graphics it could well default to onboard graphics and ignore the card.

            I plugged the monitor into the GPU and restarted it but it didn't do anything. No lights or fans kicked on and no image from the computer. Do I need to boot to safe mode, delete drivers for the onboard card, and reboot with the monitor plugged into the
 GPU to get it to register?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you may try that procedure as it is possible that a third party software is blocking you from registering the GPU. Uninstall the driver, go to the manufacturer to manually reinstall the GPU's driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to contact us if you need assistance with Windows.</p>

<p>Sounds to me like the card isn't inserted correctly, or there is a setting in the bios that is not allowing it to be detected. Take the card out and put it back in again, make sure it is fitted square into the socket. Try without using the fixing for the<br />
backing plate. Does it require any additional power to the card, make sure the power connector is fitted correctly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit. It does sound like you have a hardware problem rather than a OS problem. Disconnect all drives and any extra USB devices. With just the keyboard/mouse plugged in connect your monitor to the Radeon and boot up. If the card is working it should boot
 to the bios. If it doesn't there is no point in trying to work out why windows isn't loading drivers.</p>

<p>It appears that the author of the page I mentioned got things back to front. His title says that he can disable&nbsp;<strong>long</strong> file names. What he actually means is that he can enable or disable
<strong>short</strong> file names. The technique is well known.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect there is no way to disable long file names in Windows Explorer. For testing purposes you could use the batch file below. When executed inside some folder it will copy all existing files to the subfolder "83Folder", using their 8.3 names. Note that
 the script is primitive. It could trip over certain "poison" characters in the file names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The script expects a colon to be used in the files' time stamps (e.g. 07:15).</p>
<p>@echo off<br />
if exist 83Folder rd /s /q 83Folder<br />
if not exist 83Folder md 83Folder<br />
dir /x | find ":" | find /v "&lt;" | find /v /i "Directory of" &gt; "%temp%\Dir.txt"<br />
for /F "delims=" %%a in ('type "%temp%\Dir.txt"') do call :Sub %%a<br />
goto :eof<br />
<br />
:Sub<br />
copy %4 83Folder\%4</p>

<p>This does <strong>NOT </strong>work.&nbsp; When you go to that link, answer all the questions, the only support option that you get is to contact the Community. I have tried this at least a dozen times over the past few days.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This is VERY frustrating and MANY people are having the same issue with not getting message notifications on both Android and iOS devices and also not being able to have any support option other than Community.</p>
<p>Microsoft needs to address this issue ASAP.</p>

<h2>            Unable to download and run Desktop Themes on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Original Title:Windows 8.1 Desktop Themes very slow to download, often do not activate upon completion of download</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 1Mbps DSL connection with my machines, and rarely do I have any trouble downloading any files.&nbsp; But each and every time I try to download
<strong>Desktop Themes</strong> to my laptop and run them, some of them take much longer to download, and even though I click
<strong>"Save and Open",</strong> too often a theme would finish downloading and would not run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is my DSL download speed too slow, compared to the MS server, or is there a problem with the MS server that has never been fixed?</p>

            <p>Hi Cooky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to know that you are unable to download and run desktop themes. It could be due to issue with the browser or you have got slow internet connection.</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you have issue only when you download themes?</li><li>Are you using the Desktop Internet Explorer or the Modern UI Internet explorer to download the themes?</li><li>Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</li></ol>
<p>You can try the methods below.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Run the Internet Connection troubleshooter. Follow the steps below.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap </span><span>Search</span><span>.</span><br />
<span>(If you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then click
</span><span>Search</span><span>.)</span></li><li><span>Type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. Click on it to open.</span></li><li><span>Under </span><span>Network and Internet</span><span>, click </span><span>Connect to the Internet</span><span>. Follow the instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>Try to put the system in clean boot and try to install updates.&nbsp; Clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1. It starts Windows by using a minimal set of drivers
 and startup programs.<br />

Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" in the above link.</p>

            <p>Hi Kushal,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused with Windows updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may follow the below methods and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 1: </span><span><span>Run the <span>Hardware and Devices </span>troubleshooter and check<span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hardware and Devices troubleshooter checks for common problems and makes sure that any new device or hardware connected to your PC is installed correctly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click on the start menu and select control panel.</li><li>In the category select small icons.</li><li>Select <span>Troubleshooting</span>.</li><li>Select <span>View all</span> on the top left corner.</li><li>Click<span> </span>on<span> Hardware and Devices</span>.</li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions to run the troubleshooter.</li></ol>
<p><span>Method 2: If the issue still persist, as you are facing this issues after installing the updates, let us try to perform a system restore and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>System restore</strong>: This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point. Restore points are generated when you install a new app, driver, or Windows update, and when you
<span>create a restore point manually</span>. Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the section <strong>Restore from a system restore point</strong> in the following article:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Recovery options in Windows&nbsp;10</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Though it is said that System Restore does not affect your personal information such as email, documents, photos, videos, etc., but there is highly possible that some of your personal files are deleted while system
 restoring. </span></span></p>
<p><span>During System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead
 to loss of important files as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>After the system restore, you may block the update which was installed recently and check if it helps.</p>

<p>4. Driver tab</p>
<p>5. Roll back driver</p>
<p>6. Restart the system</p>

    <title>How can I prevent minimizing or closing of a window&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dean42  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I prevent minimizing or closing of a window&#63;</h2>
                    I am setting up a PC running Windows 7 using group policies to restrict use of non-administrative accounts to a single purpose. The program these accounts can run is within an IE browser window. I have maximized it (force full screen) and turned off context
 menus, but it is still possible to right click on the top bar of the IE window and minimize or shut down the browser. I'm not concerned about the shutdown option, but how can I make the minimize option unavailable? Can I prevent that context menu from appearing?
 Prohibit minimizing or restoring a window? I cannot find a group policy that would do either in Windows 7.

<h2>            Problem creating Windows 10 Installation media on a USB drive</h2>
                    My laptop running windows 10 Home ran into problem and it could go to windows desktop screen but can't do anything. Super stuck. As I restarted a few times I went to system reset and it didn't offer reset keeping my documents so I reset and delete all
 the files on system drive. Well that ran into problem so the system can't reset itself. I then got a new laptop and tried to create the Windows 10 installation media. I had a USB drive that's big enough(8G). And everything seems fine after I downloaded the
 tool from the Microsoft website and pick the system etc according to the instruction. And it started downloading. But after a while it finally came back as 'There was a problem running this tool. We are not sure what happened, but we're unable to run this
 tool on your PC. Error code: 0x80070456-oxA0019.' &nbsp;So I've downloaded and run the tool several times and every time I got to this screen without being able to actually create the USB installation file. My new laptop that's download

<h2>            Problem registering a &#39;.dll&#39; with Command Prompt</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to register a '.dll' file (ntdll.dll) with Command Prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I enter the command 'regsvr32 ntdll.dll' in command prompt, I get the error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>'The module "ntdll.dll" was loaded but the entry-point DllRegisterServer was not found. Make sure that "ntdll.dll" is a valid DLL OR OCX file and then try again later.'</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Just because a file has a .dll extension doesn't mean it is registerable (sorry Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts").</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the DLL does not have inside it the DllRegisterServer() (and also DllUnRegisterServer()) functions the regsvr32 program does not know what to do with it - it does not make sense to register it so hence the error message:</p>
<p>the entry-point DllRegisterServer was not found </p>
<p>
</p><p>It was not found because it is not inside the DLL you are trying to register.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once it was suggested that the message should be changed to something like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Why are you trying to register this DLL? It's an ordinary Windows DLL, there's nothing to be registered"</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use something like <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/dll_export_viewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
DLL Export Viewer</a> and search to see if you can find DllRegisterServer anywhere in that file (and you won't) then the "expert" can explain why they suggested the idea in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f88b1cf0-baf8-47d2-b253-91a9bad0cdf9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f88b1cf0-baf8-47d2-b253-91a9bad0cdf9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Repeat the process on a DLL that is regsiterable like jscript.dll and you WILL find those functions inside so therefore the jscript.dll file is registerable - no error message there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/00274d60-8cb4-4195-89da-2610930ddd1a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/00274d60-8cb4-4195-89da-2610930ddd1a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So if somebody gives you advice to register ntdll.dll you immediately know a few things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; They don't know what they are talking about</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; They have not recreated your issue themselves and solved it by registering the ntdll.dll file</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; They have not attempted their own advice to register ntdll.dll on their own system to see what happens or they would know it doesn't work</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of referring you to another topic with more impossible to work advice, what Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" Jayant Gupta should to is take 10 seconds and see what happens whey they try to register the ntdll.dll file on their own system
 and when they see that it doesn't work don't suggest that you do it because it isn't going to work for you either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when it doesn't work explain why it doesn't work and give you a solution for how to register ntdll.dll but that will never happen because it is impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you should do about <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/entry-point-procedure-could-not-be-located-in/377cd36c-fa30-436c-9238-3a1640ef31ae">
your problem with AC3SP.EXE</a> is look out in the UBI or Steam community where your error message is discussed and not follow the impossible to work advice from the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" to register a DLL that is impossible to register.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you have multiple Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts" giving you impossible to work advice - register the ntdll.dll file...&nbsp; it just won't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This advice from the "experts" will not magically make the ntdll.dll file registerable::</p>
<p>
</p><p>Register the ntdll.dll (impossible)</p>
<p>sfc&nbsp; /scannow&nbsp; (not the problem = I have no idea what the problem is or how to fix it)</p>
<p>Clean boot (will not make the missing function magically appear in ntdll.dll)</p>
<p>New User Account (will not make the missing function magically appear in ntdll.dll).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How will any of those things make a missing function appear in ntdll.dll?</p>
<p>How much time have you wasted on that advice from the "expert"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error you see for AC3SP.exe "The procedure entry point RtlUnsubscribeWnfStateChangeNotification" means that AC3SP3.exe is looking inside the ntdll.dll file looking for that function called RtlUnsubscribeWnfStateChangeNotification and not finding it (and
 it is not there on Windows 7 32-but at least):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea1825f0-0055-47a7-bbff-0d86e8e11ed3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea1825f0-0055-47a7-bbff-0d86e8e11ed3" /></a></p>
<p>So you have a mismatch of files somewhere, you have the wrong or incompatible version of AC3P3 installed or are missing some Windows update where that function is in the ntdll.dll file (and I don't know what that is).</p>

                    Hi, I recently purchased a new computer with windows 8. I turn on the power and&nbsp; boot it up. Then an error message appears saying this: The computer restarted unexpectedly or encountered and unexpected error. Windows installation cannot proceed. To install
 Windows, click "OK" to restart the computer, and restart the installation. I click "OK" and then it pops up again after the computer restarts. I'm stuck in this loop and can't proceed or do anything since this is a brand new computer. Any help would be aprpreciated
 and welcomed. Thanks.

Are you saying that the computer came preinstalled with Win 8, never worked and you keep getting that message?

            Reinstall Win 8 using the Recovery Partition you probable access through the BIOS to put it back to original factory settings.&nbsp; If it does not work and you have a warranty, return it to the vendor for replacement.

    <title>Solid Red Light on power button after attempt to update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Solid Red Light on power button after attempt to update 1&#47;25&#47;15.</h2>
                    
<p>I took my Star Wars Xbox 360 Edition out of the box last night after it was in storage for about a year. I set it up and thought of just by passing the update for now. I start to play a game and was once again asked if I wanted to update in order to go online.
 "Sure, might as well get it done now," I thought and preceded to update the Xbox.</p>
<p>So the Xbox begins to update and resets then completes update (I think) but now it won't work right? It turns on (blue light is normal around power button) but nothing shows on screen then the power button light has a single red light in the middle of the
 power button. I receive NO error messages... Just a single red light..</p>
<p>I've noticed on these forms it could be related to a power brick but I tried with a friends power supply and am getting the same results. Does anyone have any idea if the latest update sent out has caused this with others systems?</p>

<p>I am having the exact same problem too. &nbsp;I haven't touched my Xbox for almost a year. &nbsp;It was working just fine and I also did the updates. &nbsp;It was when I decided to play DMC4 today that I had a problem. &nbsp;The game was running just fine and then the screen
 froze and became pixelated. &nbsp;I turned off the Xbox and turned it back on again only to have one still red light come on the power button. &nbsp;I tried using an air duster to see if it was just the dust that caused it to freeze but, to no avail, I still can't get
 my Xbox to do anything.</p>

<p>I removed the HDD, turned it on and still had no connection to the TV. My HMDI sensor could not find a connection. I placed the HDD back inside and still the same issue. Thinking it had to do something with the video settings needing to be reset, I tried
 to use the video/audio reset method. </p>
<p>Now, I don't seem like I can get the controller to connect with the Xbox as it continues to blink even after multiple attempts to Sync. I found a help-video on Youtube stating to turn off the TV before turning the Xbox on and went 1 step further and turned
 off WiFi in the home, turned cell phone off to no avail... </p>
<p>There are times where I had the blue (working fine) light on my xbox for over an hour but no screen connection and the controller lights blinking. Then, when I would start turning off and turning it on I would go back to getting the single red light after
 a few moments. </p>
<p>Again, this seemed to start after I updated my Xbox last week. I do remember it turning back on after the update was downloaded, seeing the first miliseconds of the Xbox Logo on screen then going blank or losing the connection as if the video/ audio were
 reset on its own. </p>

<h2>            Troubles with Windows 7 64 bit and printer HP CP 1215</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have never had any troubles with this product before. My printing machine CP 1215 started to do strange things arround this New year. It is printing with mistake making strips on pictures printed from program MS Word. But not only that. If I try to print
 some picture in jpg it is printing just black all the space of picture - instead of picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My system is Windows 7 64 bit and I am bit suspicious that it is some software trouble because of when I connect printer to another PC with Windows Vista, there are no problems at all. But if I connect to another PC with Windows 7, it&nbsp;makes the same trouble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I removed my old HP software and tried new. No changes, same trouble :-/. I was trying to find mistake in HP software for removing software troubles, nothing. I tried to print mistake page, it was printing strips.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure that my printing machine is not broken as it would not be able to print with another PC without any troubles and mistakes and strips. And why it prints the same mistake with the same operation system on another PC?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope to find help here as I quite need that it will start to work properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are getting issues with your HP CP 1215 printer with Windows 7. It prints strips and black space when pictures are printed from Microsoft word and JPG files respectively. The issue reoccurs with a different Windows
 7 computer as well, however, it prints fine with Windows Vista computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</p>

<li>Have you checked printing pictures from internet? Do they print fine?</li><li>Do you use any color management settings from the application you are trying to print?</li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Since the issue occurs only while trying to print from Windows 7 computer, and it works fine with Windows Vista, problem could be directly related to the printer driver.

            Hi Wyatt.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Photos app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Photos &gt; Advanced Options.  
<br />
<br />If that's not enough re-register the app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have other performance problems you can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            I never got the System Update after turning on my xbox.</h2>
                    
<p>So I have two unmodified Xbox's and yesterday when I turned the Xbox on downstairs It applied the system update. Later that night when I went upstairs, I recovered my gamertag and signed on to live but never got the system update on that one. What gives?</p>
<p>I know it never updated because I don't have the option to use my paypal account on it.</p>

<h2>            What are other options available&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This is a QUESTION - Which option Microsoft would take : option a) or option b)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 update killed a perfectly working laptop. </p>
<p>This laptop remains in&nbsp;endless "Reboot n' Crash" loop.</p>
<p>I have tried everything including downloading Windows 10 ISO on USB with Rufus utility, no luck.</p>
<p>The F1 to F12, Delete at reboot, Ctrl + Alt etc., all the usual stuff seems to be totally redundant and&nbsp;is no match to security update patch pushed by Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no way or&nbsp;avenue to get into BIOS or revert back to Win 7.</p>
<p>The screen remains blank forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering the amount of time, energy and resources&nbsp;spent in trying to fix the laptop are worth more than&nbsp;$1200/-</p>
<p>Me and many others have landed into this situation because of Microsoft forced updates policy,&nbsp;and no fault of their own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us fondly call this Windows 10 update as "Kill Computer"&nbsp;&nbsp;software update.</p>
<p>But this is not funny situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either Microsoft itself or the MS team responsible for this "Kill Computer" software update, should pay me $1200/- to compensate for my time spent, resources invested, and energies wasted - we are not talking about frustration, bad sleepless nights and total
 distraction from regular activities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OPTIONS:</p>
<p>A) An MS Tech can setup a meeting and visit me to repair the laptop </p>
<p>or</p>
<p>B) MS to&nbsp;send me a brand new machine</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope somebody at MS will pick one or the either option!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand&nbsp;how frustrating it can be when things are&nbsp;unusual&nbsp;and I am glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are unable to get into BIOS, you have to get in touch with your Computer manufacturer.</p>
<p>Once this is fixed, set the USB device as the first boot device and run <strong>
startup repair </strong>with Windows 10 installation media which should fix the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows updates <span>are released or offered to enhance the computer's performance. if the installation of Windows updates were not done properly then problem arises.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this post helps. Get back to us for further queries. We are happy to help.

<h2>            Windows Store Error Code - 0x80240017</h2>
                    <p>Trying to download the trial to Toy Soldiers Cold War: Touch and I get this error code. I was actually about to buy it first but with it being $10 I figured I'd do the trial first which was a good decision considering I would've bought something I can't
 have. My laptop has downloaded the trial and my laptop is almost 10 years old, had vista, wind 7, then 8.1. The error code I'm receiving is on my brand new 8.1 Tablet, not even a week old. I have tried everything suggested in the help, in the community, the
 troubleshooter says it fixes the issue every time I run it but I still get the same error, I've also done a clean boot with no success... Only now the troubleshooter fixes a different error code and not the one it was pulling up. What can I do to fix this?
 If it's only one game then sure it sucks but so be it, but I have a feeling that I will come across this again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Daniel.</p>

<p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this is an older thread, I will be locking it down. We encourage you to continue the conversation by creating your own post. As far as backwards compatible games go, it is up to the developer to bring it to the catalog so reach out and let them know how
 much you want your favorite titles back. Cheers :D</p>

    <title>Surface Book 2 overheats while charging and doing non-intensive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Book 2 overheats while charging and doing non-intensive applications&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Let me clarify because I get annoyed that MS agents just suggest 'make sure you update!' so I will go over what I have done myself to troubleshoot the issue.&nbsp; Now the issue is when I charge my device the CPU runs on average well over 80-95 degrees Celsius.
 That is hot !! However, when it is disconnected from the charger it runs between 52 and 56 degrees Celsius.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Updates are installed</p>
<p>-Power mode is on LOWEST.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-The room I am in is 69 Fahrenheit<br />
-I have three Edge browsers open and OneNote, so nothing intensive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-No background apps that are unusual.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The device is on a wooden table.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/8fb1f78c-f9e6-4312-81ab-a08dde6b36aa" title="SantiagoCanon">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you bringing this attention to us. We do apologize for the inconvenience. For further assistance, we would like to ask&nbsp;some questions in order for us to isolate the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Does your&nbsp;Surface device&nbsp;shut down immediately when it's warm? If <strong>Yes</strong>, do you see a large thermometer icon when you boot up to Windows?</li><li>May I know, what troubleshooting steps you performed?</li><li>Do you have any other apps installed aside from Edge and OneNote?</li><li>Have you tried to check the app usage that might affect the battery life? If <strong>
Not, </strong>kindly go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; tap <strong>System</strong> &gt; click
<strong>Battery</strong> on the left side &gt; click <strong>Battery usage by app.</strong> Please attach a screen shot.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Just a heads up, your device may become very warm during normal use. It complies with the user-accessible surface temperature limits defined by the International Standards for Safety (IEC 60950-1 and IEC 62368). To reduce heat-related concerns, follow these
 guidelines:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Allow for adequate air circulation under and around the device.</li><li>Use CAUTION when operating your device with a pillow, blanket or other soft material contacting the device, because the material can block the airflow which may result in the device overheating.</li><li>If your device is used for long periods, its surface can become very warm. While the temperature may not feel hot to the touch, if you maintain physical contact with the device for a long time, for example if you
 rest the device on your lap, your skin might suffer a low-heat injury.</li><li>If your device is on your lap and gets uncomfortably warm, remove it from your lap and place it on a stable work surface.</li><li>Never place your device or AC adaptor on furniture or any other surface that might be marred by exposure to heat since the base of your device and the surface of the AC adaptor may increase in temperature during
 normal use.</li></ul>
<p>We also suggest you to perform&nbsp;<span>a long press shutdown on your Surface Book 2. Just press and hold the power button for around 10 seconds or until the device shuts down. Restart your surface and tell
 us if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can also check <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surf2-surfupdate/surface-book-2-overheating-problem/3dc4b84f-410b-4cc5-ad77-16b57f9bd89d">
here</a> for more information.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Keep us posted of the outcome. Thank you!</span></p>

<p>Typically, the scan takes 15 minutes or less, but can take longer on some computers. The Windows Update progress bar is not updated during the scan, and progress seems to stop at 60% complete for some time. This behavior is expected. The scan is still running
 and you should not cancel the update. </p>
<p>The System Update Readiness Tool (CheckSUR for short) is a program that does a one-time scan for problems that could prevent you from installing updates on your computer. The problem above is one of the conditions that the CheckSUR tool can check for and
 repair.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the CheckSUR tool encounters problems while running, it records them in a file called CheckSUR.log, which is located in your Windows folder, under Logs\CBS\. On a default installation of Windows this will be
<b>C:\Windows\Logs\CBS</b>.</p>

<h2>            Web Credential Manager</h2>
                    <p>I was looking for a password in the Web Credential Manager. I came across an entry I did not recognize. The credential is for http://E93EC0BD-87BD-4933-9E3A-89160C088DA9/. I can find a few people asking about this entry on their computers, but I cannot find
 an official response from Microsoft as to what this could be. I don't want to delete this if it will interrupt Microsoft services, but I have no idea what this is.</p>

            Hi JMC_1972
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.

<p>Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick reply. I don't think I would have reason to visit this site. It looks like it's for an app developer. I do use a good deal of software-as-service, and I wonder if I agreed to create an account in a EULA I clicked through. Anyway...
 I'll remove the credential. If one of my online services stops working, I'll post back and let you know what it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

            Well, it certainly does not relate to any Microsoft Services or apps, so, you should be fine deleting it.

            I recently had Norton's take control of my computer for some work needing done. remote viewing I thinks it called. I believe that showed up on mine because of this connection to Norton's. I just deleted it.&nbsp;
