<h2>            Windows 10 Display and Desktop Control Issues</h2>
                    Initially installed Windows 10 successfully, &nbsp;and worked fine, but after a few updates, it has become unstable. &nbsp;Acer mini tower 8G with a standard off-the-shelf LG HDMI monitor. &nbsp;Notification pop-up now tells me I should up the monitor resolution to 2300
 pixels (???) but that is not an option in Settings. Now it also won't display the traditional Desktop with icons on the left, I cannot resize windows, and like others have reported, the Start button does not work properly. This Windows 10 installation has
 gone downhill steadily. &nbsp;Two hour waits for Microsoft chat or call backs. What a nightmare

<h2>            Lexmark x4530 not working on my Window&#39;s 8.1 64 bit wireless network</h2>
                    <p>My Lexmark x4530 is not working on my Window's 8.1 64 bit wireless network. I've downloaded the latest drivers from Lexmark but they are only for Window's 7, which the computer also has, so&nbsp;I was hoping it&nbsp;might suffice but alas it doesn't appear so. I have
 checked all other settings like making sure that it is online and recognized by computers network, which it is. But it just doesn't print. It spools the document but nothing comes out of the printer. Does anyone have any ideas?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted Lexmark but they currently don't have drivers for Window's 8 or Window's 8.1 for this model. They made sure that I had downloaded the correct Window's 7 update and then they really didn't have anything else that they could suggest at this
 time. The technician that I was speaking with didn't know if or when they would have an update for 8 or 8.1. So my only hope before having to go out and buy a brand new printer, which I really don't want to do, is ask for help from the Microsoft Community.
 I really hope someone has a solution for me. Thank you. </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was the printer installed on the machine before a upgrade to Win 8.1, or is this the first time on this computer ? It makes a difference as to how to attempt to install the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a new computer, right clicking on the "SETUP" or "Install" file for the printer driver... selecting PROPERTIES... Compatibility tab.... checking the Compatibility Mode box, and selecting Win 7 from the menu may be all that is needed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to try and install it as a wired printer first, then switch to wireless...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have made multiple attempts to install, you may need to uninstall before reinstalling... There is a bit of a trick to this to get it to work though...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what was required to get my USB Lexmark X5340 to work...</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>1) Turn on and hook up your printer... This needs to be done just this one time to get it to show up in Devices and Printers.... Otherwise, all I get with my machine is the Lexmark Fax, and as a result, you can't "Remove" the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Once the printer is visible in Devices and Printers, unhook it..</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) "REMOVE" the Lexmark Printer and Lexmark Fax (if you have one) in Devices and Printers. If you have a FAX, REMOVE it first...</p>
<p>Just right click on it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Stop the Print Spooler in "Services" .. Control Panel... Administrative Tools... Services</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Uninstall the software\drivers... In the process of doing this, I got a popup Security message from Windows Firewall concerning "Allowing" Printer Communication"...
</p>
<p>I unchecked "SHARED" on the 1st message and left the 2nd as is... "Allow"...</p>
<p>On the some reinstalls, the Security message never even appeared.</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>6) At the prompt from the Lexmark uninstaller, Reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) After rebooting, stop the Print Spooler again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8) Reinstall software\drivers... I used both XP SP3 and Vista Compatibility Mode on different attempts, and both worked... Hook the printer back up when prompted by the installer.</p>
<p>Before steps 9 + 10, check to see if Bidirectional support is Enabled... It may already be, and if so, skip to Step #11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9) Unhook the printer again and reboot. Bidirectional Support must be Enabled, and the setting won't stick if the printer is hooked up.. You need to reboot to clear things up before the next step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10) Enable Bidirectional Support and Reboot. To do this, go to Devices and Printers and select "Printer Properties" and then the "PORTS" tab... The check box is near the bottom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>11) Set any Printer Preferences you use, if any, and it's ready to go.</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... I actually used the original XP SP3 installation CD... the newer downloaded driver was missing the scanner driver.</p>

    <title>Random Devices Showing Up and Power Management Settings Changing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Random Devices Showing Up and Power Management Settings Changing Without Changing Them</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I have some strange things going on with my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, I have a Logitech Headset, Keyboard, and Mouse connected. &nbsp;I also have an AOC monitor connected along with a USB receiver for the headset. &nbsp;These are all showing up just fine. &nbsp;But, sometimes I get some random devices that seem associated with
 generic devices. &nbsp;Basically, I get a generic pnp monitor, an HID Compliant Mouse and Keyboard as well. &nbsp;I am trying to figure out why these are showing up. &nbsp;I get rid of them in settings, yet in a day they are back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I normally have my computer go to sleep after an hour. &nbsp;Lately it won't go to sleep and that is when I noticed the random devices showing up. &nbsp;I also noted that the sleep feature was changed to "never". &nbsp;I change it back to an hour and it works for
 about a day. &nbsp;Then suddenly it changes back to "never".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea as to what is going on? &nbsp;Also, no one else uses this desktop so no one else has access to it or uses it.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Patrick,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Have you made any changes in settings prior to the issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Do you receive any error code or error message on the screen?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform the following troubleshooting steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Run the Troubleshoot Hardware and Devices.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Hardware troubleshooter reviews, diagnose and identifies operational or technical problems within a hardware device.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press <strong>
Windows Key +R</strong>, type <strong>Control Panel</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type <strong>
troubleshooting </strong>in the search bar, click on troubleshooting.&nbsp; </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on <strong>
Hardware and Devices.</strong>&nbsp; </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Follow the steps from the wizard to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Also perform Power Troubleshooter and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:
<span>Run the Power Troubleshooter.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Power troubleshooter will automatically fix some common issues with Power Plans. Run the Power troubleshooter to adjust your computer's
 power settings. The Power troubleshooter checks things like your computer's timeout settings, which determine how long the computer waits before turning off the monitor display or entering sleep mode. Adjusting these settings can help you conserve power and
 extend your computer's battery life.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press <strong>
Windows key + W</strong> and type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select <strong>
Troubleshooting</strong> and click on <strong>System and Security</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on <strong>
Power</strong> and follow the&nbsp;onscreen steps.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Check if it helps. If the issue persist,
<strong>create a new local account</strong> and check if it resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following article
<strong>Create a local user account in Windows 10</strong> and follow the procedure.</span></p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p><span>Have you made any changes in settings prior to the issue?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>-No, no hardware changes were made prior to the issue.<br />

<li>
<p><span>Do you receive any error code or error message on the screen?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>-No error code was given.</span></p>

<li>
<p><span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>No real make and model since it was built. &nbsp;It is an Intel i7 running Windows 10 on an SSD.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I did the devices troubleshooting and restarted and the devices showed up again. &nbsp;This first image is what it normally is when it comes the the devices:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I don't have a mass storage device attached to the computer. &nbsp;At one point I did but that was removed once I uploaded my back up files to OneDrive. &nbsp;Also, the HID-Compliant things...I know they are my mouse and keyboard, but why does
 it show that and then the actual mouse and keyboard? &nbsp;The other thing that sometimes shows up and a "non-pnp Monitor" or something like that. &nbsp;It just was not on the list this time but it has shown up.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, I tried to do the "Windows Key + W" but nothing happened when I did that. &nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Compte XBOX Live pirat&#233; ... que faire &#63;&#91;XBOX Live account hacked... what to do&#63;&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Bonjour √† tous, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Je vais vous r√©capituler bri√®vement la situation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>J'ai une Xbox 360 avec un compte que j'utilise depuis sa sortie avec mon mot de passe pr√©enregistr√©. J'ai acquis la Xbox One X r√©cemment et j'ai souhait√© transf√©rer mes donn√©es. Probl√®me, mon mot de passe ne fonctionne plus. J'ai donc lanc√© la r√©cup√©ration
 du compte via le browser de la Xbox et l√†, j'ai tout de suite tiqu√© pourquoi cela ne fonctionnait pas. La question de s√©curit√© qui est pos√©e est dans une autre langue (on dirait du danois ou un autre langue du nord). Aussi, la boite mail de r√©cup√©ration li√©e
 √† mon compte est une boite gmail que je ne connais pas ... Conclusion, mon compte a √©t√© pirat√©.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Je suis donc pass√© par le formulaire en ligne en remplissant un max de r√©ponse, c'est √† dire pas grand chose vu que ce compte n'est utilis√© que pour le live et que le paiement au gold se fait par paypal (et le formulaire ne reconnait que la carte bleue).
 J'ai quand m√™me entr√© le num√©ro de s√©rie de la Xbox ... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sauf que voil√†, ca fait maintenant 4 jours que je n'ai aucune r√©ponse de la part de MS et je me dit que mon compte est grill√© ...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dans l'hypoth√®se o√π mon compte ne pourrait √™tre r√©cup√©r√©, est il possible de transf√©rer tout le contenu de ma Xbox 360 sur la One ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Merci</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[Translation -&nbsp;Hello everyone, I will briefly summarize the situation.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have an Xbox 360 with an account that I use since it came out with my pre-recorded password. I acquired the Xbox One X recently and I wanted to transfer my data. Problem, my password no longer works. So I started the recovery of the account via
 the browser of the Xbox and there I immediately winced why it was not working. The question of security that is posed is in another language (it looks like Danish or another northern language). Also, the recovery mailbox linked to my account is a Gmail box
 that I do not know... Conclusion, my account has been hacked. </strong></p>
<p><strong>So I went through the online form by filling out a max response, ie not much since this account is only used for live and that payment to gold is made by PayPal (and the form only recognises the Blue card). I still entered the serial number of the
 Xbox... </strong></p>

            Well it could be a software cause which could be corrected. You could try re-installing Windows<br />
to see if that corrects it. And if those fail some hardware issues can be corrected so you might<br />
want to have&nbsp;a real computer shop look at it (one that does its own in-shop service on that<br />
make and model laptop) or the system maker's support.<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Could be heat related - try using a small fan to blow into the air intakes to see if that helps.<br />
Does it just act like it loses power or does it shutdown in a normal manner? Heat related<br />
does not always mean too much heat as it is very possible that something is too sensitive<br />
to even normal levels of heat<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) -<br />
actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Remove the dust bunnies and clean&nbsp;the<br />
vents. Check that the fans work (before and after opening the case). If a laptop about all<br />
you can do is reseat the memory and clean the vents (still can try adding a small fan as a<br />
test).<br />
<br />
This sounds like hardware so if the above does not help then you probably need the help<br />
of a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a Best Buy or other Big Box Stores) or the
<br />
System Maker's Support.<br />

This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though it is
<br />
"possible" that it is driver related (rare). Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory
<br />
and cables (on both ends) - actually remove and replace&nbsp;- do not just snug. Make sure
<br />
the system has adequate ventilation - add a small fan blowing into intakes. Carefully
<br />
inspect the motherboard and other cards for damage. Pay attention to the <strong>

Check the processor seating, heat sink, and the compound between the processor and<br />
the heat sink which are common causes.<br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />

You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is because this program is designed for an older version of Windows, as such, the program is most likely 16 bit. You probably have Windows 7 64 bit, and since you have the home premium edition, you aren't eligible to use Windows XP mode/Windows Virtual
 PC.</p>
<p>Basically, this means that in order to run this program, you need to upgrade to Win7 Pro and use XP mode, or get Virtual PC 2007 (not supported on Windows 7), and buy a copy of Windows to install in Virtual PC 2007. Of these, if you absolutely need the program,
 I would recommend an upgrade to 7 Pro.</p>

            I am trying to get a floorplan 3 plus program, probably 16 bit to run on windows 7.&nbsp; This program will run on my desktop that has the 32 bit version of windows 7, but will not run on my laptop that has windows 7 64 bit.&nbsp; I was told to upgrade to windows
 7 pro 64 bit and use xp mode.&nbsp; I have upgraded to pro but still can't get the program to run.&nbsp; How do i use the xp mode?&nbsp; I went to control panel and used the option to "fix programs ran on earlier versions of window" but none of the options I choose will
 make this program run.&nbsp;

            You will need to run and install&nbsp;<strong>Virtual PC</strong> in&nbsp;<strong>XP Mode</strong> to have any chance of a fully operational 16 bit subsystem. If you are running Windows 7 Professional, Enterprize or Ultimate,
 you can use Windows XP Mode and Virtual PC.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You need to install XP mode.</p>
<p>First enable Virtualization in the bios.</p>
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/support/configure-bios.aspx</p>
<p>Then, install XP mode.</p>

            <p>I run Floorplan Plus 3d v3.0, yep the old one on Windows 7 ULTIMATE. When I bought the new computer I'd only buy a 64 bit computer if they could run this easy to use program. They explained at Best Buy that you can create a "Virtual 32bit machine, but only
 on Windows 7 Ultimate, and it works.</p>
<p>It does however put the files in a different register, so if you back up the computer it doesn't automatically save&nbsp;these files. I'm just about to take this computer back for the umpteenth time, it goes for service, they erase everything, I get it home,
 the screen doesn't work, this is the worst... but the program, which was my purpose for responding will work this way.</p>

    <title>Combining a Wireless Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikey mouser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Combining a Wireless Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard</h2>
                    
<p>I recently purchased the Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 by Microsoft and a wireless Microsft Arc Keyboard separately.&nbsp; Both devices work fine, but they take up 2 usb ports on my laptop.&nbsp; When I go to devices and printers I see two "Microsoft wireless transceiver"
 Icons side by side.&nbsp; My question is can I combine the mouse and keyboard to one transceiver so it doesn't take up 2 usb slots? &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Unfortunately no.&nbsp; They are both designed to use a unique and separate transceiver.</p>
<p>You could add a USB hub to&nbsp;get extra USB ports</p>
<p>These are not recommendations, just examples of what is out there.</p>

            This is not really a question for the Community Participation Center, but if your phone and computer are both Bluetooth-enabled, I find that the easiest way. If it's a smartphone, you could email the pictures to yourself. If the phone&nbsp;has a USB charging
 cable, you may be able to connect it to a USB port and move content that way.

<h2>            Windows 7 computer crashes during file moves</h2>
                    I have a new computer with Windows 7 installed.&nbsp; Whenever I try to move large amounts of files the computer crashes about half way through the transfer.&nbsp; I have 6 gigs of RAM.&nbsp; Any file move that much exceeds 5 gigs will cause a crash.&nbsp; It doesn't matter
 whether I'm moving files to an external hard disk or to an internet backup site.&nbsp; I can move smaller numbers of files but that adds considerably to the amount of time it takes to get things done.

            Still me.&nbsp; Just to clarify, I am now getting crashes when moving only one gig.&nbsp; The system will copy very large numbers of files between two different subdirectories on the PC's hard disk (by very slowly) so the problem seems to occur when transferring
 files to an external disk.&nbsp; The problem first appeared when I tried to move a very large subdirectory to one of my 1 TB Seagate external drives (both fairly new and working perfectly under Vista).&nbsp; Just a short while ago I tried connecting an old, smaller
 Seagate external drive and got the same results--a total crash from trying to move just one gig of files.

                    <p>I want to be able to hit a keyboard shortcut or click something that will immediately lock the computer so I can walk away immediately and not wait for Sleep to activate. &nbsp;(I never use Sleep.) &nbsp;Is this possible with Windows 7? &nbsp;Tried this but it didn't do
 anything:</p>
<pre>%windir%\System32\rundll32.exe user32.dll,LockWorkStation</pre>
<p>When I navigated manually to rundll32.exe in the System32 folder nothing happened when I clicked it.</p>
<p>I see people do this all the time in business environments. &nbsp;They type something and immediately the screen locks. &nbsp;That's exactly what I need. &nbsp;</p>

                    <p><strong>Computer:</strong> HP Pavilion Laptop, which came with Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem</strong><strong>:</strong> Windows 10 downloads and expands into the D: Recovery partition of the computer, which is limited in size. Due to the size of Windows 10, it can't complete because there is not enough space.</p>

</p><p><strong>Additional Information:</strong> The C: drive has plenty of space and also includes our Windows and Users folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Troubleshooting completed:</strong> </p>
<ol>
<li>We have attempted to install Windows 10 through Windows Update, through Microsoft's web site and also with the standalone upgrader. All lead to the same error that the disc (D:) is full.</li><li>We attempted to remove files from D: (enabled hidden/protected files) but the only ones available are the computer recovery which we would prefer to leave.</li><li>We attempted to extend the D: partition. Although we were successfully able to add unallocated space after the D: partition, there was no option to extend the protected partition.</li></ol>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your attempt in troubleshooting the issue.</p>
<ul>
<li>On which drive is your Windows 8.1 is installed?</li></ul>
<p>Recovery partition consists of some important boot files and other tools. Recovery partition is created by the System Manufacturer, in case you may want to revert back to the factory settings and for troubleshooting purposes. It is not recommended to delete
 the recovery partition. If you wish to delete this partition, then you will have to get in touch with the system manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case I would suggest you to perform an In place Upgrade of Windows 10 Using the Media creation tool. When you perform In place Upgrade it provides you an option to choose the drive where to install the Windows 10 Operating system.</p>

    <title>windows 8 phone update is stuck, samsung ativ s - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            windows 8 phone update is stuck, samsung ativ s</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am very worried and I don't know what to do. I have a Samsung Ativ S windows 8 phone and yesterday a got a message that I could update my phone to OS&nbsp;<span>8.0.10327.77 ( I am
 not 100% sure if this was the exact update). I started the update and when the update animation with the two spinning wheels appeared I went to bed. When I woke up today ( after 8 hours) the animation was still on the display and the update has still not finished!
 I restarted the phone a couple of times but the animation appears again and again. Can you please tell me if this is right or not and if it is wrong how to fix it? I am travelling in to days and I need the phone<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />
Bogomil</span>

            <p>What do you mean by System Restore?</p>
<p>System Restore is putting your Computer Settings back to an earlier time which does not cause problems with Data.</p>
<p>But a lot of people wrongly&nbsp;call putting the Computer back to new condition System Restore.</p>
<p>What exactly did you do?</p>

<p>It sounds like you reinstalled Vista without deleting the existing Vista installation that you were having problems with.</p>
<p>Do you have a windows.old folder?</p>

            <p>First thing is where did the Backup come from and why do you have a backup at all.?</p>
<p>Which goes back to my question which you never answered as to how you reinstalled Vista.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you have a backup of the previous Windows&nbsp;installation folder&nbsp;of course it will be bigger as it would have all the accumulated Service Packs, Updates, etc installed in it.</p>

            Not sure where the back up came from.&nbsp;&nbsp; I reinstalled the operating system from a disk i received with the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; I kind of remember a question when reinstalling about backing up data.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I could be more helpful but it is kind of fuzzy,&nbsp;&nbsp; the
 system is operation like before with the exception of the disk space.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did run a program looking for dulicate files and found plenty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Deleted some files under back up but it would not let me delete windows files.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Many thanks Praseetha,</p>
<p>All good stuff and I was so pleased you replied. I have tried all your suggestions but alas none of them worked. I am wondering now if Soluto has altered my Group Policy and have locked me out. I am sure you are well aware of the Soluto program and of course
 when running they would want all problems and the ability to fix them to be delivered exclusively&nbsp;through them and not through the Microsoft system. I didn't change it by the way and to be honest I wouldn't know how. It worries me that it has been changed
 and I don't have control of my computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for your info. If you do have any other ideas I will be only to glad to give them a run.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi and thank you for your support. I have certainly learned a lot about computers over the last week or so. I have carried out all of the procedures you have sent me and opened another account but it seems that the problem transferred over to the new account.
 The clean boot went well and I survived in tact even though I had to peep through my fingers with everything crossed. My computer is really running well and can highly recommend the Fix It program. I just have this one annoying problem and am trying desperately
 to hang on to what little hair I have left. It just wont change to the recommended settings. I right click to use the Administrator settings. I seem to be connected to a Network called (Network 4) with a Home group. I am the sole user of the computer. Its
 all rather confusing. I don't know if that is significant but will try anything you can come up with. Many thanks. &nbsp;

            Just a quick update. I am still having the same problem and do any update manually. I have noticed on the Microsoft Update page it say, Install updates Never. I must have by now missed several updates and it is becoming a worry. I feel that I have tried
 everything I can do but would appreciate any advice. &nbsp;

            <p>Hi Rabinson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked&nbsp;in my Windows 10 PC and&nbsp;I was able to right click on the pinned items without any issues.&nbsp;So, it looks the issue is caused by some incorrect settings or corrupt&nbsp;files in your PC.&nbsp;I would suggest you create&nbsp;a new user account to check if the issue
 is related to User account files or if it is related to Windows system files. If the issue doesn't occur in a new user profile, then it is possible that the user account files are corrupt. Try these steps and let us know the results for further assistance.</p>

            I have a similar problem except right click does not work on the Desktop, Start Menu or in applications such as Excel. I have switched the button on the touch pad and the right button performs the left button action normally.&nbsp; I have rebooted, closed the
 cover of my laptop and spun my chair around clockwise but the problem persists.&nbsp; I am learning all the ways to get around this limitation but I would like my right click back.

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there no response when you right click on 'Desktop'?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could mean that there is a driver issue or a some settings issue with Windows 10. Since you have tried changing the buttons, we can rule out any hardware issue. First I would suggest you to uninstall the current driver, visit the PC manufacturer's website,
 download the latest mouse driver and check if the issue persists. If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to create a new user account and check if the same issue occurs. Try these steps and let us know the results for further assistance.</p>

            No change Faiz.&nbsp; Since my external mouse works fine it's not a big priority for me anymore.&nbsp; Lenovo may get around to releasing an updated driver someday.&nbsp; I'll probably get a new laptop before then.

            <p>I have a Lenovo u310 and the right-click topped working after a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, I had customized the touchpad to not support advanced finger methods and disable palm detection due to sensitivity issues.&nbsp; Right-click worked for a months ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suddenly, right-click stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>RESOLUTION:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control Panel</li><li>Mouse</li><li>Device Settings </li><li>Settings</li><li>Synaptics Control Panel&nbsp; (in my case)</li><li>Restore Default Settings</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click immediately started working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So,&nbsp; goto Mouse and restore settings, especially if you have a touchpad with advanced features.</p>

<p><span>Hi
<span>kell and co,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you recall making any changes to the printer settings?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does this happen when you print from any specific applications?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong><span>Run the
<strong>Fixit </strong>available in the link below to fix printing issues</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Try to change print options and printing preferences, follow the steps mentioned in the link below</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Choosing-print-options</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Choosing-print-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Choosing-print-options</a>
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: Print a test page</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You can print a test page to check if a printer is printing graphics and text correctly. A test page also displays information, such as the printer
 name, model, and driver software version that can help you troubleshoot printer problems.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps mentioned in the link below</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Print-a-test-page</span></strong></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, you may want to check with the HP for any known issues
