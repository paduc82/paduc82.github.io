                    <p>When I try to download apps and click the "get" button, the "open" will show for half of a second and then the page is just refreshed and nothing is "opened". Frustrated.</p>
<p>I've tried multiple apps, and none is working.</p>

            Hey ChangxuFan,
<br />
<br />Sign out and back in, it worked for me.
<br />
<br />On the top right of the Microsoft Store window, you should see your profile picture, click that. Click on the account you're logged into, and you should see a new window that says "Account you've added to this app". Under that account, click Sign out.
<br />
<br />Sign back in, and attempt to download an app again, and see if this does it. Good luck.       
        </p>

<br />Search for an App you want to download and click 'Get' 
<br />
<br />Sign back into your Account

<p>This game will not work on the xbox live network anymore. &nbsp;They pulled the plug about two years ago. Your only option for multi-player is using a local lan link or using one of the home brew game networks like xlink kai. I doubt you would even see another
 player to go up against.</p>

    <title>Account Compromised &#47; Dispute - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maldernon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Account Compromised &#47; Dispute</h2>
                    
<p>A few weeks ago I came back from holiday to find that around ¬£80 worth (10000) Zune/Xbox Live points had been added to my account. I immediately did a password reset and changed my password (I cant see how my account was hacked though, as I am very security
 conscious and use very secure passwords and nothing on any other service has ever been compromised).</p>
<p>As far as I could tell nothing else was changed on my account, and the points that had been purchased were still there</p>
<p>Anyway I rang Xbox support and was told that there was nothing they could do, and that I should go through my credit card company. So now I have filed a dispute with the credit card, and they have let the charges go into dispute status and thus not need
 to be paid off, however, now I have recieved a letter saying that microsoft have assured the credit card company that the charges are genuine and to remind me that Microsoft points are non refundable...</p>
<p>Thats all very well, if I had purchased the points... but I didn't purchase the points?! Why would I have purchased points just to leave them sitting in my account. Surely one only purchases points when you actually have something to spend them on?!</p>
<p>There are a few things I want resolved then - I would be quite happy to have the points removed from my account, I'm not looking to have my cake and eat it too. I would also like to have my credit card removed from the Xbox live account. I have never experienced
 anything like this on any other service and I now have serious reservations about the security procedures Microsoft have in place. However even though I have set my account not to auto-renew it will not let me remove the card due to it being used for an active
 service...</p>
<p>My credit card company have said I could further write to them detailing the reasons why I think the charges are invalid.. but I'm really unsure on what to say other than I DIDN'T AUTHORIZE THE CHARGES!</p>
<p>Any advice / help you could give me would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>You need to call Xbox Support again and get them to open an Unauthorized Access claim (UA) so that they will actually investigate this themselves. Did you at any point have to recover you gamertag or anything? Basically write down everything you remember
 about what happened and call them, stay on the phone and keep talking to supervisors if they won't open one. It took me several calls between Xbox Support, GfWL Support and even EA Support before I could get them to open a UA. And just to let you know after
 they open it you can't access live (I'm honestly unsure of how I can use my GT in the forums as I currently have an investigation running) and it will take at least a month. Also if I were you I would cancel my remaining live service to get your cards deactivated
 on the Xbox servers (there appears to be no option to fully delete them and no one will give me a straight answer about whether they can be turned back on without my consent), they will generate some codes for your remaining months (at least that is what they
 told me) and supposedly e-mail them out with your finished claim.</p>

<p>As above. but remove your card details and warn everyone you know to do the same. Get an unauthorized access investigation started and wait up to 6 months for your account to be unfrozen and funds returned. This is starting to get too much at this point
 with the amount of compromised accounts in the last 3 or 4 months. I've asked for security safeguards in the accounts to prevent unauthorised spending, I've even offered MS a suggestion which would cost them nothing, secure spending of money and points and
 still give them access to card details for auto renewal so everyone's a winner. I doubt anything will get done though.</p>

<p>Hey strigoi you seem to know a lot about this so I will ask you, do you have any idea why I am still able to use my same GT that is under investigation to post on the forums? Most of the posts I have seen about the UAs people mention that they are using
 a different GT as they couldn't log in with the one under investigation. Is it because I have a WP7 with my GT linked to it?</p>
<p>P.S. I have called Xbox Support twice to ensure that my UA had actually been started and on Friday they told me it had been opened by PET so I am pretty sure its under investigation.</p>

<p>I have no idea what a GT is as I only use a pc but my account is under UAI and I can still come here and post but looking at my account part of the settings are ghosted and cannot be accessed so I'm assuming as I log in through my PC and nothing in my account
 was changed just points bought and used that the account itself is still viable now my password has been changed. But I'm probably wrong.</p>

<br />
<br />D.  As a last resort if nothing works - I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            Hi Shay.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything else possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works: 
<br />
<br />Which network icon is showing in System Tray:  the Wireless waves or Ethernet TV with plug?  Left click to see if any Networks show up to sign into.  
<br />
<br />If not right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-to-default-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; WIfi &gt; Manage Known Networks, highlight and remove the network having problems, restart PC to see if it shows up again.  
<br />
<br />Try plugging in by ethernet cable to the router to compare, then plug the ethernet cable into the modem (if separate) to see if this might be an issue with the router.    
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected and optimized.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br /> 
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 Update, if it's too late to roll it back  I can help you shrink C by about 50gb in Disk mgmt to do a test Install to the shrink space, which will configure a Dual Boot you can sign into to set up to see if the problem goes away.  If so I'll then help you move into the new install and eventually delete the old one and recover its space.  Steps here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            unbable to connect external hard drive, getting error&#58; newer version is found while trying to install the driver therefore the install will not continue</h2>
                    <p>have used Seagate goflex external hard drive shared for backing up with memeo, &nbsp;and home personal use&nbsp;on 2 computers on Windows 7 and then used on window 10 upgrade since October 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the drive is wireless and connected to the att uverse gateway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 On one computer, I suddenly lost the icon and listing of it in my pc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have repeated notices that I need to reconnect the drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried to use the installation disk to do so, but keep getting notice that a newer version is found, though I can not seem
 to locate it anywhere on the computer,&nbsp; so therefore the install will not continue.&nbsp;&nbsp; cannot uninstall, because I do not see it listed to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The only thing that I see now in my pc is axentraserver: root---- and that seems to be back up and contents,
 but not useable to me because &nbsp;I do not know how to deal with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I no longer am able to right click and send a file or photo etc &nbsp;to go flex as I had before.&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot just use it at all as before.&nbsp;&nbsp; on the other computer it works fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Have tried rebooting
 the entire household system as suggested by a quick call to Staples.&nbsp;&nbsp; not real computer literate.&nbsp; Thinking I need to reconfigure the drive or something, but do not have a clue as how to do that as Staples set it up along with set up of the 2 computers when
 new.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thank you for any help----- especially if&nbsp;is not real technical.&nbsp; I need to be able to back up and save again.&nbsp;</p>

            Removing accounts can be done by going to start - settings - accounts.
<br />Click access work or school and you will see the account.
<br />Then click it and select disconnect.
<br />That should do it.

<h2>            Desktop icons moved to taskbar menu</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking after someone's PC, where some unwanted action has caused all desktop icons to move to a taskbar menu:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9953271d-8b50-4bbc-ace2-9e7bfe6af58a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9953271d-8b50-4bbc-ace2-9e7bfe6af58a" /></a></p>
<p>All shortcut files are still in the Desktop folder of the user profile, so it seems to be some display setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never seen this. Can someone please help me restore the icons to the desktop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

                    <p>Hello guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently bought a laptop with Windows 8.1 (normal) one year trial installed (product key not activated).</p>
<p>I then bought a Windows 8.1 PRO (product key only) from another retailer, </p>
<p>and now I am wondering if there is any way I can use my newly bought Windows 8.1 PRO product key for my Windows 8.1 trial OS?<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

            AFAIK there is no "Trial" so this may not work but you can try changing the key by typing slmgr /ipk in an elevated command prompt and type the new key.

            <p>If you're lucky, and you've had to change the installed&nbsp;Key to the COA one in the past, you may be able to retrieve it using Belarc Advisor -
<a href="http://www.belarc.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.belarc.com</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do you need it?</p>
<p>If you use the manufacturer's Recvoery Media for a reinstall, then that already contains their Key, and yours shouldn't be needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To properly analyse and solve problems with Activation and Validation, we need to see a full copy of the report produced by the MGADiag tool
<br />
(download and save to desktop - <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

&nbsp;Once saved, run the tool. <br />
Click on the Continue button, which will produce the report.<br />
&nbsp;To copy the report to your response, click on the Copy button in the tool (ignore any error messages at this point), and then paste (using either r-click/Paste, or Ctrl+V ) into your response.<br />

<p>Option 1:</p>
<p>If the COA sticker is damaged, then you would need to use the recovery partition to reinstall Windows 7, this will exempt the need to use the product key to activate your Windows 7 instalaltion.</p>
<p>Option 2:</p>
<p>If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee. This will exempt the need
 to use the product key also.</p>
<p>Option 3:</p>
<p>If the neither options 1 or 2 is possible, then you need to invest in a new retail full version license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes</p>
<p>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 flashing purple can&#39;t access anything</h2>
                    When I turn on my windows 8 hp laptop it comes up with the log in screen and I enter my &nbsp;password. But it doesn't log in as me instead it logs on as a temporary user and then the screen starts flashing purple and I can't click anything or do anything apart
 from press control alt delete! I have tried restarting the computer, doing a system restore, resetting to factory settings but it won't rest or restore to an earlier point. I've logged in as safe mode and tried to restore, refresh and reset and it tells me
 the same thing. Something went wrong with your pc. I can't log on as me what so ever I can't swipe to the right hand screen to get to settings I have to shut down through control alt delete. What do I do?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to be an issue with the User account corruption. I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could assist you further.<br />
1. What happened when you try to perform Reset and Refresh? What are you referring by "Same thing"<br />
2. Do you get any error code or error message?<br />
3. Were you able to sign in to Safe Mode Successfully?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Boot to Safe Mode and place the computer in clean boot state and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Boot to Safe Mode.<br />
Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode):<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Clean boot. Clean boot will help you determine which third party app/program is causing this issue.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
If you are not able to login to the user account successfully, then try to enable the Built-in Administrator account and then create a new user account and check if it help.

            Hi thank you for your reply, I tried method one and no luck with that as nothing changed. When I was following the steps I noticed that when I went to task manager-startup tab I had no program's on the startup tab to disable. (I'm not sure if that means
 anything?)
<div>Method 2 I could not do because it wouldn't let me press windows key + x in safe mode and I can't press anything logged in with the temporary user.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I try to do a system restore it says I don't have a restore point. If I try to reset my laptop it says: unable to reset your pc. A required partition drive is missing. If I try to refresh my pc it says the drive where windows is installed is locked.
 Unlock the drive and try again. When I tried automatic repair it says: automatic repair couldn't repair your pc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm not too sure about the error codes as there wasn't any with any of those messages.</div>
<div>I can sign into safe mode fine by pressing shift as I turn on my laptop.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just incase it's relevant my laptop is a hp pavilion G6.&nbsp;</div>
<div>This same problem happened 2 weeks ago but I was able to do a system restore and when I logged in it was back to my usual user profile and all my files were still there etc and that time the screen didn't flash, but this time the temporary user that it
 logs me into is flashing like crazy, it's empty (no apps on the opening screen and no files) and I can't do anything apart from press control alt delete.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

<p>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to know if you have tried Methods 2 which I had provided in my previous response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, please try Method 2 provided in my previous response. This issue usually occurs when the user profile is corrupted and the only option is to create a new user account. Here in your case, you will have to enable the Built-in Administrator account,
 so that you can create a new user account.</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I managed to get method 2 to work, I think I did something wrong the first time. I opened the administrator account and deleted my current user and remade the new user and all seems to be working now. Thanks so much&nbsp;for helping me.<br />
<div>I have one more query, during the process of fixing my laptop my friends laptop did a system recovery and she made a recovery on her WD passport 1TB external hard drive. All was fine and it worked. Then I plugged her hard drive into my laptop to put try
 and put some of my documents on. After not being able to access any of my files I reset the computer as I was in safe mode. When my computer reset it said scanning and repairing the G drive at the bottom of the page and I realised that must be scanning the
 external hard drive that was plugged in. Now my friends hard drive has none of her original files, music etc and comes up as Recovery (G)&nbsp;when she plugs it in instead of "my passport." It also says it's 31.9GB instead of 1TB, and has used 16.5GB and the file
 system in FAT32.<br />
I think that my laptop has reformatted her hard drive when I reset my laptop for some reason&nbsp;and lost all her files, how do I recover the missing files and get it back to 1TB?<br />
When it has been plugged in to a laptop in the past it has said that it needs scanning and fixing but have always ignored this option as formatting would erase the all the data. The hard drive has been working fine for the past few months and never had a problem
 with any corrupt files, viruses etc. so I don't know why it decided to scan and repair it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Any help on this matter would be greatly appreciated as there are lots of files the hard drive.<br />
Thank you again for finding a solution to my user profile problem.</div>
<div><br />
Many Thanks,<br />

<div>My pavillion g6 has just started the same thing about 30 mins ago. &nbsp;The laptop turns on and opens up a temporary blue login screen (my usual one is pink) it lets me log in however it then diverts to a screen that has the store app and desktop button. This
 screen constantly flickers and doesn't allow me to do anything!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please help I have so much stuff I need on the laptop. If I were to set up a new profile as mentioned as method 2 would I lose everything in my normal log in.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Windows 10 adding inbound rules to firewall without asking my - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 adding inbound rules to firewall without asking my permission</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Windows 10 on my PC is adding apps to both inbound &amp; outbound rules sets to the windows firewall without warning or asking for my permission.<br />
The inbound rules it adds always allow inbound connections without warning and without asking for my permission.<br />
<br />
I have the "Notify me when Windows Firewall blocks a new app" option selected but it still does it.<br />
When I had this option selected on windows 7 (before I upgraded to win 10) I would get a notification box pop up with the option to allow or block inbound connections from new apps. However, I get no such notification on win 10 and it just adds &amp; allows it
 without my permission.<br />
<br />
Deleting these inbound rules windows 10 added does not work, since after a reboot and starting any of those apps again it just adds a new inbound rule again allowing inbound connections again without asking my permission.<br />
Setting the option to block any of these new inbound rules which win 10 added without my permission does not work either, because it just adds a another new inbound rule allowing connections &amp; without asking for my permission.<br />
<br />
Is there a way of getting this pop up notification box that asks for my permission to allow or block inbound connections like I had on win 7, to work on win 10?<br />
<br />
Or is there any other way to stop win 10 from adding &amp; allowing inbound connections to every single app automatically without any warnings &amp; first asking for my permission?<br />
<br />
It does this with any &amp; all apps no matter if Microsoft or not, even Firefox.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
Mark

            <p>Hi Natchappa CK,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is not on Domain &amp; I do not have a third party firewall installed.</p>
<p>Tried the clean boot procedure and I still have this issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also my wifes PC with windows 10 has the same issue and so does my friends with win 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of us had this&nbsp; issue on win 7 and only happens after upgrading to win 10 for my wife and I &amp; in my friends case a fresh install on a clean formated c:\ drive with win 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary this issue seems to be the default for win 10 &amp; 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>

            Hi AlanBates10 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. Try these and check after each step.
<br />
<br />1. If Reset/repair doesn't work, then you should uninstall using Powershell and reinstall the Photos App
<br />Windows+X &gt; Click Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below command and paste in Powershell and Enter
<br />
<br />get-appxpackage Microsoft.Windows.Photos | remove-appxpackage
<br />
<br />Now, you need to reinstall it
<br />Use below Powershell command to install
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.Windows.Photos | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register ‚Äú$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml‚Äù
<br />
<br />(If you encounter problem installing it, you can always install it from Microsoft 
<br />Store - <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJBH4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a> )
<br />
<br />2. Re-register All Store apps
<br />Windows+X &gt; Click Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below line and paste in Powershell &gt; Enter &gt; Restart your computer
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            The Microsoft Office Store app is not working; Photos open with PowerDVD ONLY, Calculator does not open and even Microsoft Store app states "I need to install an app - HOW??? All of this resulted from the Windows 10 Update to my computer on August 12,
 2019. Although I have reached out to Microsoft, no troubleshooting or updates work. Additionally, it was posted on one of the major news station (WPLG - Channel 10/Miami) that Microsoft WILL BE sending out an update to repair the issue Windows 10 Update caused.
 My question is WHEN; this is ridiculous. Now I am looking into purchasing a MAC so I don't encounter this problem again. It's as if you have to beg Microsoft to fix what they damaged!

<h2>            Can i convert Earthlink account to Microsoft account in new PC so that all devices can sync&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 on my desktop, and set it up with my Earthlink account. Currently my desktop and Android sync perfectly, but I purchased a laptop yesterday with Windows 10 and set it up with my Microsoft account (oops). Can I revert either setup to match
 so I can sync both my desktop, Android&nbsp;and laptop simultaneously?</p>
