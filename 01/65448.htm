<h2>            Can the Windows 10 app &#40;all ready to go&#41; overwrite a windows 10 upgrade installed and working on my PC</h2>
                    <p>My first installation of windows 10 and eventual revert back to win 7 ultimate - was a disaster (see previous posts) that destroyed my Win 7 ultimate, trashed my boot mgr and I had to do (with the massive help from Answer Tech) a clean installtion of Windows
 8 pro 64 bit. Subsequently upgraded to Window 8.1 pro 64 bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not like Windows 8.1 at all (who does?) and have decided to try to install windows 10 upgrade from USB ISO upgrade media. This was created using Microsoft Media Creation Tool. I also have the Windows App on my desktop waiting impatiently to upgrade
 me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT my internet connection has been a little flaky and I thought that the Microsoft downloaded upgrades could have file integrity problems. Once bitten twice shy!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went to the Microsoft Media Creation site and downloaded the ISO file and created a DVD and a USB windows 10 installation tool. Ignoring the dangers of the windows 10 upgrade (see the hundreds if not thousands of problems reported by community members)
 I have decided to try again from physical media. If all else fails I thought I could do a clean install using my windows 8.1 product code. My main question asked to Answer Tech and completely misunderstood by the is</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do a successful (hopefully) upgrade using hard media (USB or DVD) will the windows 10 app (crouching in the wings of my desktop and waiting to explode into action) automatically overwrite my new and working Windows 10 upgrade from physical media? The
 answers from Answer Tech offered guidance on how to upgrade and links to sites to teach me how to upgrade plus a link :</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which gained me the helpful response "site not found" for about 10 retries until I gave up!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question is</p>
<p>Can Windows app for win 10 upgrade on my desktop together with the $WINDOWS.~BT files on my C:\ drive overwrite a new windows 10 upgrade? (For the avoidance of doubt - will the deskapp version try to install a duplicate windows 10 upgrade over the top of
 my&nbsp; upgrade using hard media (USB or DVD)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help me I am losing it :(</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked your link out and I understand your feeling that the reply is relevant BUT it does not go anywhere near answering my question. To try to clarify :</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Wndows App download with Windows 10. This was downloaded (actually uploaded by Microsoft to my PC).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the time of the upload / download (depending on from whose point of view you are&nbsp; looking at things) my internet connection was not consistently good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I therefore decided to creat physical upgrate media via (by way of) windows media creator and the download (by me, this time with fibre optic internet connection was solid and consisent). So I am assuming the iso file is good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no problem in using the iso file / usb media or even the DVD media I created on running the media creator tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HERE IS THE QUESTION </p>
<p>If I upgrade my windows 8.1 pro using physical media (USB Drive / DVD Disk) will the Windows App sitting on my computer try to install "its own" version (corrupt or not) on top of my Windows 10 uprade using my physical media. i.e will the Windows 10 App
 "Fubar" my upgrade. By the way I have already uninstalled the windows <span>KB3035583 update.</span></p>

<h2>            How can I stop mailto&#58; and email address links from opening an Email program</h2>
                    Hello. &nbsp; I would like to stop mailto: and email addresses from opening up ANY email program. &nbsp; I understand that I can open up "Internet Options/Properties" and choose a different Email program from the "Programs" list, but what if I do not want any email
 program set?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a way to make this setting blank, or not work at all?&nbsp;&nbsp; I've accidentally clicked on email addresses in so many different programs only to have Outlook;/Hotmail/Gmail (depending on what was set) open up, and I really would like to stop
 this...<br />

<p>Hey Frederik, I searched for the hidden files as well, no such file. By the way, the restore option was &nbsp;not disabled on the damaged profile, but when I starts the restore application (from the damaged profile) it gets the error message of no permissions,
 that's what I meant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Try this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log on under an admin account.</li><li>Launch an <strong>elevated </strong>command prompt with cmd.exe.</li><li>Type these commands and press Enter after each:<br />
cd &nbsp;"\Users\{Name of user profile}" (e.g. cd &nbsp;"c:\Users\Jack")<br />
attrib &nbsp;-s -h -r &nbsp;*.*<br />
dir nt*.*</li></ol>
<p>You need to launch System Restore with rstrui.exe while logged on under an admin account. The process is not sensitive to permissions.</p>

<p>Are you saying that you disabled System Restore? If so then this is not a good idea. System Restore would let recover from your current predicament in less than five minutes. The alternative solution is much more painful. It works like so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log on under an admin account.</li><li>Activate System Restore.<br />
</li><li>Create a manual restore point.</li><li>Run RegEdit.<br />
</li><li>Click <em>HKey_Local_Machine</em> in the left-hand panel.</li><li>Click <em>File / Load Hive</em></li><li>Open this file: <em>C:\Users\{Name of damaged profile}\ntuser.dat</em></li><li>Give the hive a name, e.g. <em>Damaged</em>.</li><li>Navigate to <em>HKLM\Damaged\</em><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)"><em>SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies</em></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">Do your repair.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)"><span>Right-Click&nbsp;</span></span><em>HKLM\Damaged</em></li><li>Click <em>File / Unload Hive</em></li><li>Close regedit.</li></ol>

    <title>Are there any advanced configuration settings for disc burning in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ruby j.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Are there any advanced configuration settings for disc burning in Vista&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been having this problem on and off since I first started using my computer with Vista in the spring of 2008, and since I've tried so many other things, I thought I might as well ask.&nbsp; I'll give as much detail as possible, which will need to include
 some background - sorry for the length.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I download a fairly large amount of files on a semi-regular basis, and I archive some and keep others on my local HDD with backup somewhere else.&nbsp; For a long time on my system previous to my current one, my sole back-up media were DVD+RWs - and some DVD+Rs.&nbsp;
 However, late in the life of that system, I purchased an external hard drive and ceased backing up to DVDs.&nbsp; Then my previous computer died, and simultaneously,&nbsp;with impeccable timing, my external harddrive failed and lost 95% of the data on it.&nbsp; Thus I learned
 that hard drives fail, and shouldn't be relied on as your only backup.&nbsp; So I uploaded some files to a online storage service as secondary backup, and began to use DVD+RWs again, in addition to my external HDD.</p>
<p>Just to get this out of the way,&nbsp;I don't close any rewritable discs.&nbsp; Both my default burning settings and settings in Roxio and Nero are set to Track At Once/Open/Live File System.&nbsp; If I need to burn a mastered disc, I always change my settings back to
 TAO/open when I'm done.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Both my version of Roxio and Nero are incomplete/non-retail, if that could possibly be an issue; Roxio came with the "basic" package preinstalled on my computer, and Nero "Essentials" came with the newer DVD+RW DL drive I purchased.</p>
<p>Burning DVDs/CDs on Vista was problematic for me right from the beginning, for the record.&nbsp; It's a multi-symptomatic illness; the main characteristic is either the error message "That drive is read-only" or "Cannot read from source file or disk", often in
 the middle of data transfer.&nbsp; The different things that go wrong, some by example:</p>
<p>* Whenever I put a blank disc in either drive (discs that are mastered do not usually give this error), Event Viewer gives me the same message: "There was an error in a paging operation on cdrom0/cdrom1."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>* It is utterly inconsistent in whether or not it chooses to write to a DVD+RW with some information already present.&nbsp; Initially, all my DVD+RWs (that had been used already) had been formatted with Roxio Drag to Disc (Creator 6), so the fact that it would
 add data to some and not to others is not logical.</p>
<p>* Regarding discs that have data already on them, sometimes it will show that there is space left when the disc is inserted in the drive, but sometimes it will show 0 mb free, even though it will only say 1.2gb full.&nbsp;&nbsp;A disc that had previously shown empty
 space can suddenly develop no empty space without any events occuring besides the disc being taken out and put back in.</p>
<p>* Depending on how touchy it's feeling, it will let me: add files to a disc but not delete any; tell me there isn't sufficient free space (see above issue - this is always the cause of that); attempt to copy files and fail, telling me that it cannot read
 from the source file or disk; attempt to copy files and fail, telling me that the drive/disc is read-only; successfully copy a certain amount of data and then fail, telling me that the disc is read-only; successfully copy a certain amount of data and then
 fail, telling me that it cannot read from the source file or disc; successfully copy a certain amount of data and then stop and eject the disc, stating that I must put a blank or rewritable disc in drive E/H; not bother trying to copy and simply opening the
 tray, stating that I must put a blank or rewritable disc in drive E/H.</p>
<p>* By far the most common error is the most obnoxious one - where it will copy data successfully, and then - sometimes after 3.5GB has already transferred - it will tell me that the disc/drive is read only.</p>
<p>What I&nbsp;often have to do is&nbsp;insert a DVD+RW, pull&nbsp;the&nbsp;contents into a holding directory on one of the hard disks, add, delete, rename, and otherwise manage files on the HDD until the folder size is approximately that of a DVD+R/RW.&nbsp; Then I have to erase the
 DVD+RW, and recopy all the data (plus the added and fixed files) to the DVD+RW using either Vista's Live File System or Roxio/Sonic.&nbsp; This process is lengthy and time consuming.&nbsp; It is less lengthy and time consuming than say, recovering a bad hard drive,
 but seems like unnecessary hassle.</p>
<p>It struggles with non-rewritable discs as well, but generally lowering the burn speed solves those issues.</p>
<p>I would like to note that I never had any errors writing to open, rewritable discs on my XP machine.</p>
<p>Through the long gauntlet of troubleshooting I went through, I tried using different brands of disks - several, in fact, and that seemed to have no effect.&nbsp; Sony, Memorex, TDK, hp, and imation give me the same results overall.&nbsp; (Note: Memorex disks do have
 a slightly higher fail rate, and ironically, that seems to be the only brand our local stores carry now.)&nbsp; Once I had decided that the make of the disc was not the issue, the next thing information sources indicated was that it was my DVD drive at fault.&nbsp;
 It's an OEM hp drive, so I thought getting another couldn't hurt.&nbsp; I purchased a reasonably priced Samsung drive and added it in the second bay, and hoped that all my problems&nbsp;were solved.
</p>
<p>Nope.&nbsp; Not a difference between the two.</p>
<p>Recently, when analyzing two discs (one which was acting like it should, the other not) in DVD Decryptor, I noticed that the "book type" on the one that was working correctly was set to "DVD+RW", but the one that wasn't working was set to "DVD-ROM".&nbsp; Like
 I've said, all of my settings (that I can find) are set to Live File System/TAO -- but my guess is that somehow my Vista machine is changing the book type of some of the discs to DVD-ROM during the write somehow, thus causing all the subsequent issues.&nbsp; Is
 there somewhere besides the Properties menu on the DVD drive to set Windows burn settings?&nbsp; At the moment I'm suspecting that this is the root of my problem.&nbsp; I'm fine applying registry fixes when necessary, if anyone knows one that could solve this issue.&nbsp;
 Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the Fix-It link; it didn't find anything wrong, though, unsurprisingly, due to the nature of the problem.&nbsp; I did run it a few times, too.</p>
<p>Roxio and/or Nero aren't the issue, because the easiest and most common way I burn data DVDs is using Windows Explorer drag and drop -- thus what I would like to do is make it so that Windows itself burns rewritable media correctly.&nbsp;

            Thanks, but no.&nbsp; My drives both arbitrarily make RW discs read-only, and nothing on that FAQ addresses that.&nbsp; I attempted to use a new program this weekend, but there was no change.&nbsp; I was almost done adding files to my disc when it decided it was read-only
 (on the second-to-last file) and I had to reformat it and start over.&nbsp; It's overly time-consuming.&nbsp; Is there no way to adjust Windows' more detailed burning options?&nbsp; I cannot seem to find a way into any sort of configuration for the burning engine.&nbsp;

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The link you provided was for an external drive. In my case the drive is internal - just a partitioned drive. It is a brand new computer so I am doing backup first time.</span>I didn't make any changes
 just now but this started working but <strong>only partly and occasionally</strong> (sounds silly but that is what it is).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I sometimes I can initiate the backup manually and sometimes the scheduled backup also runs - it shows total space available total needed (I have plenty to spare). But after much huffing n puffing
<strong>it fails</strong> - error reads - 'the backup failed - your files have not been backed up'. Does not provide any specific 'reason'.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see my backup has never succeeded the /data folder is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But sometimes when I try add the backup drive- it is the same problem 'no usable drives found'.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></span><span><span><strong>Turn off and turn on System Protection to repair File History</strong></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Right-click on <strong>Start</strong> and open <strong>System</strong> &gt; Select

<p>No my problem is not solved.</p>
<p>Did not try Clean Reboot. I had tried that for another unrelated problem - need to disable all the services and then there is no practical way to re-enable them in the same state. (Also my problem did not get solved).</p>
<p>I think the issue is space, even though I have allocated enough space and I am choosing the option 'let windows decide' for managing space (rather than delete). So it should work but seemingly does not, I don't know what other issues that could be causing
 the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally it does not let me 'add drive' even though it is already added - and Windows tries running the back as an auto job (and job fails).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the whole thing is simply not adding up- something is totally amiss.</p>

</p><p>The issue seemingly should not have anything to do with drive letter. I get mixed messages (error) from Windows. Sometimes it cant find the Drive itself (when I try configuring backup) - even though backup is &nbsp;already configured and it does actually run
 (at least tries to). </p>
<p>And then sometimes it complains there is not enough space- when it tries to run backup. Not enough space could be true but should not be true. I have assigned 200GB to the Drive and that should suffice, if Windows correctly manages the space - as configured
 - 'Windows should manage space'.</p>

<p>This problem remains unresolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I deleted existing backups - to create space, as windows was unable to manage space. There are 2 options to manage space tried both neither work:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c94f9309-3dd8-436e-842a-ef1aa7df5272" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c94f9309-3dd8-436e-842a-ef1aa7df5272" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>My entire C drive is 167GB, and my backup D drive is 195GB - so space should not be an issue - but it does not work.</p>
<p>The error msg is, I don't quite understand what it means(?)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have already tried almost all of the basic steps that can be tried to resolve the issue, let's proceed further on the troubleshooting steps that you can try which can be found below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Run the<strong> System File Checker</strong> tool that checks for any system corruptions and fixes them on which the steps can be found on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: <strong>Configure System Protection</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">In case the System File Checker tool doesn't the trick, you can also open
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, then go to <strong>System</strong> and select <strong>
System Protection</strong>. Under <strong>System Protection</strong>, activate the protection for the partition as follows:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Win+E</strong>. This will open<strong> File Explorer</strong>. in the File Explorer window, right-click on
<strong>This PC</strong> and click on <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>The<strong> System applet</strong> will open up. Click on the <strong>System Protection</strong> link.</li><li>In the System Properties, select the drive <strong>WHERE</strong> you are creating the image and click
<strong>Configure</strong>. It will not be the System Drive - but will be the drive
<strong>where are creating and saving the system image file</strong>.</li><li>You will get a <strong>System Protection box for the chosen drive</strong>. The box will show
<strong>Restore Settings</strong>. under that, select <strong>Turn on the system protection</strong>. Further, under Disk Space Usage, set the Max Usage slider to a value lower than is already set at.</li><li>Next, click on <strong>Delete</strong> to remove all restore points for the drive. After you do so, click on
<strong>Apply</strong> and then <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Once you're done with that, close System Properties.</li><li>Try creating the System Image back-up again and see if it has worked.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Do get back to us for the results and if you have any other questions, don't hesitate to post back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            Hi Gina
<br />
<br />This might be a server sync issue on their side or they need to sign out of Skype then sign in again.
<br />
<br />You can try changing to another picture you might have then change it back to the one you want to display to see if it resolves the problem.

Along with the HP Stream were a variety of 8 inch Tablet devices such as such as the Dell Venue Pro. With the introduction of Windows 10, migrating these devices to Windows 10 might prove difficult because of their low storage capacity, but it is possible to do so. One of the limitations of introductory devices such as the HP Stream or Dell Venue Pro, they come with limited amounts of disk space, sometimes 32 or 16 GB configurations.

<h2>            How best to sync a USB flash&#47;thumb drive with folder on my laptop&#63;</h2>
                    I need to be able to work off a flash drive when at work or traveling, and I want to sync that (only the changes) with a folder on my home PC.&nbsp;I need it to sync both ways so that if changes are made in the home C folder it is transferred to the USB drive
 (once it is inserted), and vice versa. &nbsp;I'm using Windows 10, and everything important is on OneDrive. &nbsp;I've read that synctoy is not a good option with Windows 10, and really isn't even compatible &nbsp;ALSO, once I have syncing of the flash drive set up I think
 I can sync the PC folder to OneDrive...and then if I make changes to a document on OneDrive through the internet, those changes should sync with the home PC folder, which will sync with the removable flash drive....or the other way...changes done to documents
 on the flash drive will be synced with the hoe PC folder then synced with OneDrive. &nbsp;First though, what is the best option, software, or whatever to sync that portable thumb drive with a folder on my pc

            Interesting. I have used the SyncToy 2.1 with the laptop running Windows 7. Upgraded to Windows 10 and it ran fine. Now I got a new Microsoft Windows Surface Book and downloaded SyncToy and it didn't work. Installation says that you need .NET of certain
 build and computer spits message that it is already installed. I would look for alternatives (I am looking myself).

<p>
</p><p>If you do not have the net framework installed or if it is corrupted I would remove and re-install it.&nbsp; Sync toys definitely works.</p>

            <p>Thank you for advice. I did remove the Visual ++ from the system. Tried to install SynToy 2.1 and still got the message that I need .NET 2.x version. I have tried to install the .NET version 6.x and it says that I already have it on the system. How do I
 remove it and re-install it? Alternatively, is there another program that does the sam thing that SyncToy does without the pain of installation/

<p>Highly configurable and very light weight.</p>

</p><p>Takes some getting used to, so be careful at first... maybe experiment on a folder.&nbsp; I use newest file updates older files.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sort of back up OneDrive to a router attached SSD so I don't need to fiddle around nor download onedrive on my slow 15mb/s dsl every
 time I install windows fresh, plus it updates when I dual boot insider with same one drive... my wifi drive is much faster than dsl .. 450mbit/s.. sometimes I wonder why I need OneDrive.</p>

            Hi Mary, this is a known bug in Windows for a long time . . .
<br />
<br />One thing you can try is:
<br />
<br />Press the Ctrl key and use the scroll wheel on your mouse to make your icons slightly smaller
<br />
<br />Then right click your Desktop and choose Refresh
<br />
<br />If the icons stay in the same position, restart your PC (must be a restart, not turn off and back on)

            NO, you can't do what you are planning to do.<br />
<br />
The files available to download called "Windows XP Service Pack 3" are <span style="font-weight: bold">
updates</span> to a complete installation of Windows XP.&nbsp; You may either download an ISO file (or "image") -- which is what your link is -- or an executable file (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=24</a>).<br />
<br />
The ISO or image file is used to create a CD by using software capable of doing that, such as (free)
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ImgBurn</a>.<br />
<br />
In either case, what you are getting is the "service pack" and not the complete Windows operating system.<br />
<br />
You need a Windows XP installation CD.&nbsp; These may be "gold" (as initially released) or you may find one that incorporates service pack 1 or service pack 2 or service pack 3.&nbsp; If you obtain a pre-sp3 install CD, you'll have to update the installation promptly
 after installing.&nbsp; You can go from sp 1 directly to sp3 without needing to install sp2, but if you get a "gold" install CD you must first install sp 1 or sp2 before installing sp3.<br />
<br />
Because Microsoft stopped selling Windows XP some time ago, genuine installation CDs are getting more difficult to find.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Although the rep from your computer's manufacturer was correct that you could buy any Windows XP installation CD and install it, the manufacturer was obligated by its license from Microsoft to provide you some method of re-installing Windows when you purchased
 the computer.&nbsp; This may have been a hidden restore partition on your hard drive or some CD/DVD supplied with your computer.&nbsp; I assume that you have lost or damaged whatever was first supplied and the manufacturer is no longer able or willing to replace it
 with a CD.<br />

<p>Hey War Hamer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding. I see you are still having some trouble accessing the DLC on your BI complete edition. When it comes to dual disc games, you may have to install or play the game in a certain way. Try
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/troubleshooting/free-up-hard-drive-space" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
uninstalling the game</a> and then install and launch BI using the 2nd disc. Let us know if you are able to play or if you are still unable to access the extra content. :D</p>

<p>I recently purchased bioshock infinite, however after playing it once, it asked me to update the software for it, repeatedly resulting in an "update failed" and a status code:&nbsp;4099-0000-D080-0200-8015-000A. After searching through forums unsuccessfully,
 I decided to both clear the xbox live system data from my hard drive (by pressing LB, RB, X, LB, RB, X on the storage settings), as well as clearing my system cashe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again i attempted to sign onto xbox live and update to the latest live software, resulting once again in a failed update, however this time with the status code:&nbsp;4099-0000-3080-0549-8015-000A.</p>
<p>Until this is sorted i am unable to sign onto xbox live, please help</p>

<h2>            Power loss during disk defragmentation</h2>
                    I was&nbsp;using the Windows XP disk defragmenter on a NTFS-formatted volume and during defragmentation of my external hard drive, the power went off in my house suddenly (I tripped a circuit breaker). When I got the power back on, the drive seems okay but
 I scanned the drive using Chkdsk in Windows. I checked "Automatically fix errors" and all it said after it was done was "Disk Check Complete". My assumption is that the file system is healthy, but&nbsp;could the power loss&nbsp;during the defragmentation affect the
 files on the disk?

=====================================<br />
I would suspect that your drive is safe but you can view <br />
the Error-checking (chkdsk) log at the following location:<br />
<br />
In Windows XP to find the Error-checking log file...<br />
go to...Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer /<br />
Application / [Source] Wininit or Winlogon<br />

<h2>            How to use BRAVEN BRV-1 bluetooth speakers on Windows 7 Ultimate</h2>
                    <p>Good Day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to request some assistance on how to use my BRAVEN BRV-1 speakers on my desktop PC. The specs of my PC are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>OS Name and Version - Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate 6.1.7600 Build 7600 32-bit</li><li>Processor - Interl(R) Core(TM) i3 CPU 530@2.93GHz, 2933Mhz, 2 Core(s), 4 Logical Processor(s)</li><li>RAM - 4.00 Gb</li><li>Graphics - AMD Radeon HD 6800 Series</li><li>Motherboard - ECS H55H-M</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, the device is visible in the "Devices and Printers" (see attached pic1) but it won't produce any sound. It was connected via a bluetooth dongle which I recently bought at a hardware store. Upon checking the volume icon in the lower right part
 of the taskbar, the speaker does not appear in the list (see attached pic2). I would really appreciate any suggestions, I have already tried some methods that were suggested by various forums/sites to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>windows defender offline doesn&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            windows defender offline doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Windows Defender will now work even when Kaspersky is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the Windows Offline Scan tool in the services app does not work.&nbsp; I have tried it several times.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first times since updating WD, I got no admin popup asking yes or no.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now at least the popup comes up but it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run a full scan while off the web.&nbsp;&nbsp; No problems were found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A secondary concern is that when rebooting, I usually have to reboot twice to get the sign in window.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has been the case for a day or two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hesitant to uninstall Kaspersky, since the reason I installed it a few months ago was that WD wasn't doing all it should.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
From the Command Prompt of the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk - if you do not
<br />
have a Vista disk you can borrow a friend's (they are not copy protected) or make one. Also your System
<br />
maker will sell the physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
Command Prompt <br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
<br />
Space after k and before /&nbsp; and after f and before /<br />
<br />
And if needed check here :<br />

                    <div>So I recently updated Intel HD graphics to the latest version.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I had some issues with Windows update installing an update and not completing, I tried to fix it using System restore.</div>
<div>After the restore, the lenovo logo showed and loaded, then a black screen showed up. After a while, Lenovo veriface (Its a face recognition software,I use them to login) showed up but it was flickering/flashing.( The camera was also blinking). After it
 verified my face, I couldn't see anything it was full of black screen, if I closed the lenovo veriface, it wouldn't show the windows graphics interface.(The&nbsp;metro&nbsp;one)</div>
<div>I tried to press F8, shift +F8 in the beginning , nothing seemed to work.</div>
<div>I could open UEFI bios settings by pressing f1 though. In that, I tried to change the graphics to UMA from discrete, it also didn't work. F10 also worked, it opened windows boot manager but it only displayed my hard disk.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a lenovo g50-80 with windows 8.1 &nbsp; 64 bit.</div>
<div>I think by reinstalling the Intel HD graphics, it could be fixed but since I couldn't login in normal boot or safe&nbsp;mode, i can't</div>

<p>
</p><p>It also says that, basically, you're on your own, kemosabe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, Lenovo has plenty of problems...</p>

<p>You are getting further than most.&nbsp; Typically when you get that far you can press Ctrl-Alt-Delete to get into Task Manager and proceed from there to diagnose your symptom.&nbsp; Or just find out if explorer.exe is running and Restart it.&nbsp; Etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>In that case you may be seeing a phantom monitor scenario that others have had.&nbsp; In that case your Ctrl-Alt-Delete prompt would be appearing on the primary monitor (not your screen) and you would have to pretend that you could see it and use only keyboard
 commands to try to bring it back.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. End and Enter would start it but it might still be on the other screen so then you would have to move it to your screen.&nbsp; I don't know if Win-Shift-CursorLeft would do it then but that would be the simplest.&nbsp; Otherwise
 you would try Alt-Space M and a Cursor key to engage the mouse pointer with the Task Manager Title bar in order to move it back with your mouse or if you were sure of the direction you needed to drag it, continue pressing the Cursor key.&nbsp; You could get a hint
 about which direction it might be coming from by moving your pointer all the way to either side in order to try to decide which side the pointer might be passing through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, in the same scenario what should work even before you get a chance to login is to use the Project dialog from the Charms bar, e.g. press Win-P CursorUp, Enter (as if you could see the Project dialog and switch from Extend to Duplicate).&nbsp; There
 would be two main consequences of that procedure.&nbsp; First it would refresh the video system and it would cause the current display to be rendered on your monitor.&nbsp; In some cases I can "hear" the reset as well as see it, so it would help to be extra observant
 when trying this.</p>

<p>Good luck</p>

            <p>You know. I don't know how to do that without being able to start the laptop.&nbsp; But I just have to say I HATE "System Recovery" I keep the damned thing shut off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd rather do a complete and clean&nbsp;reformat and reinstall than mess with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't get any of these conflicts then between various hardware manufacturers and THEIR software and Microsoft and ITS software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Lenovo...talk to the hand, man. I think Dr. Fu-Manchu must be behind that spyware-ridden company.</p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b0d4811-962b-4205-808b-9c25ca45b142" />&nbsp;As I said...I leave it off. But, then, neither do I install a ton of third party software and shareware and
 the Lord knows what else most people seem to install (although they usually blame that on their kids) so maybe for them it makes sense.&nbsp; Because otherwise they would be CONSTANTLY reformatting and that would drive anyone crazy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's one of those options each of us have to decide for ourselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I hope someone can give you more help than I can (I'm sure someone can) and I hope its soon!</p>
