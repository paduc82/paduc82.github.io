<h2>            Blue Screen UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP 0x0000007f ntoskrnl.exe</h2>
                    
<p>I bought an HP Pavilion 6520y in August (Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit, 6Gb RAM, Norton Internet Security 2010) and have not changed any hardware.&nbsp; I've gotten 7 blue screens since that time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a home network setup via a router.&nbsp; A family member can log in to the HP&nbsp;without the workgroup server computer being turned on.&nbsp; The blue screen seems to happen when the workgroup&nbsp;server is subsequently turned on (and possibly logged in).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've run HP diagnostics and&nbsp;Win7 memory check, checked for new video/audio/network drivers, and run sfc /scannow, all with no issues appearing.&nbsp; I've uploaded the minidumps to:<a href="http://cid-9926437d314db0d5.office.live.com/self.aspx/Minidumps/2010-09-20.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cid-9926437d314db0d5.office.live.com/self.aspx/Minidumps/2010-09-20.zip</a></p>
<p>Please let me know what else I should try to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

            <strong>Bug Check 0x7F: UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>0x00000008</strong> , or <strong>Double Fault</strong> , indicates that an exception occurs during a call to the handler for a prior exception. Typically, the two exceptions are handled serially. However, there are several exceptions that cannot be
 handled serially, and in this situation the processor signals a double fault. There are two common causes of a double fault:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * A kernel stack overflow. This overflow occurs when a guard page is hit, and the kernel tries to push a trap frame. Because there is no stack left, a stack overflow results, causing the double fault.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * A hardware problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
The minidumps are not useful for UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP bug checks.<br />
<br />
Configure your Windows to create a kernel dump [1] and upload the zipped dump (C:\Windows\memory.dmp) to your SkyDrive [2] and post a link here when the PC still crashes after removing ZoneAlarm and updating the drivers.<br />

<h3> viafax999  say:</h3>
<h2>            Logitech unifying receiver doesn&#39;t work following Windows 10 upgrade.</h2>
                    <p>Upgraded a windows 7 ultimate x86 system to windows 10. &nbsp;System has a logitech unifying receiver which runs the bluetooth keyboard, mouse and media pad. &nbsp;All working fine in win7 however after upgrade the usb device unifying receiver is not installing so
 have no keyboard or mouse.</p>
<p>A year or so back MS release a KB that did the same thing which I backed out and marked as hide to WU. &nbsp;I'm thinking that that KB is integrated into the win10 upgrade which is why it's not working.</p>
<p>The system is tied into part of the TV system and it's not feasible to run it with wired keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>Anybody have any hints how to resolve this? &nbsp;I have tried downloading drivers from logitech but the receiver still won't install.</p>

            <p>The Unifying Receiver is not a Bluetooth adapter. Only a Bluetooth adapter can operate a Bluetooth device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Logitech Unifying Receiver uses Logitech's proprietary WiFi technology. Bluetooth adapters use the industry standard Bluetooth stack.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.logitech.com/software/unifying" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This web page</a> from Logitech's website shows that the original Unifying software, which dates back to 2010, is supported on Windows 10. I can speak from personal
 experience that my unifying receiver works fine in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, there is no need to pair your Logitech devices again after upgrading or clean installing Windows 10. If you do so, you may find that your Logitech devices no longer operate, and you have to drag out your ancient USB mouse and keyboard from storage
 to uninstall and reinstall the Unifying Software and re-do your pairing from scratch. Please don't ask how I learned this.</p>

<p>

            I think it depends which device version you have. &nbsp;Mine most certainly does not work and Logitech support were useless. &nbsp;I reverted to windows 7 and it immediately worked fine with no intervention. &nbsp;As soon as I upgraded to Win 10 it ceased operation again.
 &nbsp;I would purchase a new hardware device if I knew which one of the plethora that logitech appeared to have produced would work with the mouse, kb and media pad that I have however Got NO response from Logitech when I inquired as to which devices are supported
 for my configuration. <br />
I tried it on other windows 10 machines and got exactly the same failure in every case.

            <p>It appears that Microsoft Windows 10 has, several days ago, removed proper support the Logitech Unifying USB Receiver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logitech Performance MX mouse was working with Logitech unifying receiver for months now with Windows 10, as was my Logitech K810. A few days ago my Windows 10 announced that is had upgraded, and in the days that followed repeatedly updated. Now none of
 my above-mentioned Logitech equipment is working. I tried:</p>
<p>(0) Tried all 3 USB 2 and one USB 3 ports at every step below, Win10 makes a proper sound when plugging in and out the Unifying device, but there is never any mouse functionality</p>
<p>(1) downloading the latest Unifying device driver</p>
<p>(2) disabling the USB power save features</p>
<p>(3) reinstalling the device drivers via the hardware manager</p>
<p>(4) 30 minutes of searching for fixes online.</p>
<p>(5) I plugged in my unifying receiver to a windows 7 computer and everything works properly<br />
(6) Logitech Unifying software update Performance mouse firmware update fails when Mouse is powered due to failure to sense mouse.</p>
<p>(7) The Unifying software directive to re-pair fails due to failure to sense unifying device</p>
<p>(8) re-pairing fails with inability to detect mouse</p>
<p>(9) HID compliant mouse Events include the following:</p>
<p>- Device HID\VID_0461&amp;PID_4D51\7&amp;5791374&amp;0&amp;0000 could not be migrated.&nbsp;Last Device Instance Id: HID\VID_046D&amp;PID_C52B&amp;MI_01&amp;COL01\8&amp;236CB223&amp;0&amp;0000</p>
<p>- Device HID\VID_0461&amp;PID_4D51\7&amp;5791374&amp;0&amp;0000 was configured.&nbsp;Device HID\VID_0461&amp;PID_4D51\7&amp;5791374&amp;0&amp;0000 was configured.</p>
<p>- Driver Name: msmouse.inf<br />
Class Guid: {4D36E96F-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}Driver Name: msmouse.inf&nbsp;Class Guid: {4D36E96F-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}</p>
<p>Indicate as 12/14/2015 and 12/16/2015 events.<br />
</p>
<p>It appears as if the Windows 10 update, which Windows 10 referred to as, I forget the exact words, not an update but a Windows 10 upgrade, &nbsp;which occurred automatically several days ago, does not properly support these of my Logitech hardware.<br />

            <p>I have the same issue and I finally figure out how to pair multiple logitech device on windows 10.</p>
<p>At first it only recognize my K700 keyboard and not my M510 mouse.</p>
<p>After multiple attempts, my fix was to connect two logitech usb unifying receiver then the software pop-up allowing you to pair the second device. Installing the software by itself will not pair your device you have to force windows 10 to recognize that
 you have multiple devices and you want to use it with just one usb receiver.</p>
<p>Now that I have the extra usb, I can plug it into my other laptop and pair it as well so I can share my devices between two laptops (not at the same time of course). Hope this helps all the folks out there that was struggling with this issue and is cheaper
 than buying a new wireless mouse or keyboard.</p>

            <p>Lol ... Windows 10 doesn't 'remove support' for hardware, because it doesn't provide support in the first place. Hardware manufacturers choose whether to support Windows 10, not the other way around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, your conclusion makes no sense. How would Microsoft gain by decreasing the number of hardware devices that work with Windows?</p>

            I was having this exact same problem, unable to link My Logitech M570 trackball on Windows 10, tried a bunch of approaches with no luck. But when I ran the the Unifying software as administrator, it worked perfectly. Try that if you haven't.

            Before you can upgrade to the latest version of Windows, Setup performs a compatibility check to make sure you don’t have any apps installed that are known to be incompatible with that version of Windows.
<br />
<br />If you are blocked by an app you don’t appear to have installed, it is likely that the compatibility checker is detecting a file associated with the app, rather than the app itself.  You will need to delete the file it is detecting before you can install the upgrade.  You can determine which file is triggering the block by examining a hidden log file.  To do this, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />Open File explorer and click the View tab. Make sure the check box for Hidden items is selected.
<br />
<br />Select This PC, and then in the search box, search for a file named {Symbols)_APPRAISER_HumanReadable.xml.
<br />Right click the file and open with Notepad.
<br />
<br />Press CTRL + F and search for DT_ANY_FMC_BlockingApplication. Look for the value, it should be True.
<br />
<br />Press CTRL + F and search for LowerCaseLongPathUnexpanded. The value contains the file path of the program that should be removed or transferred to another drive.  (It should be located approximately 28 lines under the DT_ANY_FMC_BlockingApplication).
<br />
<br />Make note of the file path listed in the value for LowerCaseLongPathUnexpanded.  You can select the file path and copy it to the Notepad by pressing CTRL + C.
<br />Navigate to the file path’s location in File Explorer.  (Click in File Explorer’s address bar and press CTRL + V to paste the file path you copied earlier.)
<br />Once you’ve located the blocking.exe file, transfer the file to another drive or Delete the file.
<br />
<br />Once the blocking file is moved or deleted, try installing the Windows 10 upgrade again, or return to the Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant and select the Refresh button.
<br />
<br />Some versions of the following apps may trigger a compatibility block for the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, including:
<br />
<br />Trend Micro
<br />PGP 8.1
<br />Nero
<br />Symantec Endpoint Protection
<br />Infineon TPM
<br />Roxio
<br />Norton Ghost
<br />Spy Sweeper
<br />Realtek PCI-E Card Reader
<br />Microsoft Office Starter 2010
<br />Sonic Studio DLA Application
<br />Dell Storage Drivers
<br />Webroot/McAfee

            Hi Liz ,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To reset your password, click on the below link and follow online directions
<br /><a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/password/reset</a>
<br />
<br />If you have security info on your account, Microsoft will send a one-time code to the alternate phone number or email address you gave to Microsoft. After you enter the code on the next screen, you'll be able to make a new password.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.       
        </p>

            Hello Liz,
<br />
<br />My name is Patricia and I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to help you today.
<br />
<br />Is it a Microsoft account or a local account ?
<br />If Microsoft account, you can reset it from there
<br /><a href="https://account.live.com/resetpassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/resetpassword.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />If local account and no security questions defined, the only way to reset the password is to reset the pc.
<br />
<br />Anyway, another solution is to connect with your pin
<br />create a new account
<br />define it as an admin account 
<br />and then from this new account, you can delete the other one.
<br />Caution: save the data of the first account before deleting it.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
It is possible that the drivers you are using, even if the latest now available, are not<br />
100% Windows 8.1 compliant. Check with your System Maker's Support (Motherboard<br />
Maker for custom systems) and/or the actual device maker. The latter, such as Intel,<br />
RealTek, Atheros and others may have newer versions not available at the System/Mother<br />
-board Maker's site. And continue to check with them regularly over the next year +.
<br />
Also update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate
<br />
device drivers.<br />
<br />
Get your apps and devices working in Windows 8.1<br />

<br />
=========================================================<br />
<br />
Be sure to check for updates to the router firmware since that can have a definite effect<br />
on Windows 8.1 connections even though other OS&nbsp;systems connections are fine.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Check with&nbsp;the System Maker's Support (Motherboard&nbsp;Maker for custom systems) and/or
<br />
the actual&nbsp;device maker for driver updates. If there are no newer versions&nbsp;re-install the same<br />
ones. Ask in their forums&nbsp;(if any) about any known issues.<br />
<br />
===================================<br />
<br />
General troubleshooting : (<strong>after the above if needed</strong>) <br />
<br />
Wired and Wireless Connection Problems<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/network-connection-problem-help#network-problems=windows-8&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/network-connection-problem-help#network-problems=windows-8&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1</a><br />
<br />
Note&nbsp;using <strong>Win Key + X</strong> and <strong>Win Key + W</strong> (to get to Control Panel, Run,
<br />
and Settings as needed). <strong>Win Key + D</strong> calls the desktop and the using<br />
<strong>Win Key</strong> toggles Desktop and Start Screen.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------- <br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network and Sharing Center - Troubleshoot Problems<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7 and Windows 8.<br />
</strong><br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible<br />
solution?&nbsp;And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are <br />
you positioned from the router? Are there obstructions in the way?<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - click Update Driver (may not do<br />
anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi<br />
Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated <br />
drivers as Windows&nbsp;8&nbsp;loves updated drivers.<br />

<p><b><font color="#000000"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>Ok here's the download...sorry couldn't help it, I'm a bit batty at this point. I have been working on my home pc which is a Dell running Windows Vista on a 32-bit system, for over a week now
 and am close to a nervous breakdown or living out the rest of my life with a bib on because of a Hijacking virus called Conduit or WiseConverter.&nbsp;</span></span></font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>That was the beginning of the nightmare. I have moved past the evil viruses and their Damian-propagating-registry-babies, taking over my pc.&nbsp;</span></span></font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>I feel confident after many scans of every nook and cranny in my pc, after running Hijackthis, RKill, RegAssassin, Spybot, Problem Reports and Solutions in Windows, Regedit, msconfig, EVERY safe
 mode diagnostic offered in that old DOS screen. System Restore, I believe about 4 to 6 times now and I know a lot more fixes I haven't even listed. At least The DEMONIC malwares are gone!</span></span></font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>But in their wake after innocently trying to just download an update to my Media folder that would update my HP PSC 1610 ALL-IN-ONE printer/scanner/copier, along with some codecs, the demons left
 a discombobulated mess of my Startup folder, C; drive; D: Recovery drive; Personal folder that now sadly holds all of my C: drive documents and I've tried to move them out and back into just C: drive to no avail!</span></span></font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>The carnage is unbelievable and altho I'm a self-proclaimed Windows-IT-Microsoft-Wannabe, this has really got me feeling stupid. And now I realize I'm not even close to knowing what I need to
 know in fixing this blasted memory dump of a computer.&nbsp;</span></span></font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>BTW sorry for the names I called all you Microsoft Techs at 2:30 this morning when tears were squirting out my eyes and I was babbling uncontrollably at the long screen I found in Microsoft Support
 that was supposed to show me how to download my new updated driver and USB modem for my LG Ally 740 Cell phone to my desktop and extract the files there then point the wizard to them and viola! They are magically put in the correct file~! Noooowah! That didn't
 work either! But I wasn't a bit surprised. I just put on a bib to stop the drooling and opened Syst. Config and tried all the normal, Active directory repair, etc. boot methods. NOPE none of those either worked. Well then again, the poor wizard was probably
 confused since I’m sure the driver files are NOT where they are supposed to be! But I found driver files in my C: drive AND my D: recovery drive.
</span></span></font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>*Another bad situation is my DVD/CD drive is broken. The plastic CD holder is sticking out of the tower and I can't push it back in. So that nixes me from reinstalling windows.&nbsp;</span></span></font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font color="#000000"><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>So here I am still blabbing uncontrollably and writing to someone in your forums or a kind IT person I slandered horribly in the middle of the night that I'm sincerely again sorry for.

 great, I can now run some diagnostics to repair the discombobulation of all my files, after the Conduit/WiseConverter virus struck my system. Especially now that I have normal boot-up! You are AWESOME! Please don't go anywhere I know I'm gonna need your expert

<h2>            How to Reset a windows 8 without settings</h2>
                    Hi, I bought a Windows 8 asus computer with HDMI And Energy star, And I used it for a few month before it went downhill. I used it for education, But it soon became "Full" after downloading a few stuff. I soon started to delete stuff that came with the
 computer, Which I will never do again. Basically, I can't access any of my settings. I can access my PC Though with the files and stuff. Is there a way I can reset the computer without (Spending money) or spending too much money? (I dont care about losing
 the files on it) Thanks!

                    I have a Toshiba laptop satellite proL670&nbsp; I used to have a built in webcam.&nbsp; I haven't used this function for awhile and now I can't find&nbsp; it. I have gone to start all programmes and web cam, but nothing is there.....Is it because I am using Firefox as
 a browser instead of Explorer?

<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are facing the issue with the built in web cam is missing in the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have web camera software installed on the computer, you should be able to access the camera
 settings from that program.</span></p>
<p><span>Go to Start, All Programs and open the program related to webcam.</span></p>
<p><span>If the webcam software is not installed, then go to the manufacturer’s website and download the latest
 software for the webcam and install it on<br />
your computer.</span></p>

    <title>strange email icon in junk folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wondermuse  say:</h3>
<h2>            strange email icon in junk folder</h2>
                    <p>I have a strange email icon showing in my Junk folder for Windows Live Mail. This icon seemed to have appeared after what I thought I was doing was deleting about 15 or more junk emails. What I had done was selected the 15 or so emails by clicking on one,
 and then pressing the 'shift' key on the on-screen keyboard to select the rest. After that, I right clicked on the selected files, and clicked on the 'Delete' option in the menu. Well, I don't know if I clicked on something else besides the 'Delete' option
 or not, but as soon as the menu closed, all the files that had been selected had not only the strange icon beside them, but all of them had also acquired an 'attachment' (paperclip) symbol in the attachment column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a .png image of files and how they appear in the junk folder:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb83a92f-4227-441d-b0ae-22b57da16342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb83a92f-4227-441d-b0ae-22b57da16342" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The two emails at the bottom are normal, and this is how the other files appeared before I tried to delete them. This strange icon can be changed to the 'read' icon (open envelope) by right clicking on any of them and selecting 'mark as read'; but that is
 all I seem to be able to do with them. I cannot open them. I get a message box saying: "A problem occurred while trying to open the message." A problem has occurred. Please try again." When I try to delete any of them, I get a message saying: "An unknown error
 has occurred", or even if I try to move any of them to the 'Deleted items' folder or the 'inbox', I get the same message and then a follow-up message saying: "The selected message could not be moved. There was a problem. Please try again.".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't know what this symbol symbolizes, because I have never seen it before; but it seems to be some kind of 'seal' on the envelope, and it cannot be opened or moved or deleted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is any information on this type icon for Windows Live Mail, I would like to know what it is.</p>

            <p>This is a new type of spam. It purports to have been digitally signed, and the icon you see indicates that the message contains a digital signature. In fact, the alleged signature (just a bunch of code sent with the message) is garbage. It is also classed
 as an attachment, which is why you see the paperclip as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To delete this type of message, try selecting it in the message list and pressing
<em>Shift-Delete</em> on the keyboard. This bypasses the <em>Deleted items </em>folder, so you may be asked to confirm that you really want to delete the message permanently. If that works, try selecting a number of messages and shift-deleting them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted dozens of these yesterday and haven't seen any more since then, so perhaps the spam filter at the server (in my case Outlook.com) has been adjusted to trap them.</p>

            <p>Pressing the Shift-Delete worked, thank you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is though, these emails did not arrive this way. They were the usual junk emails till I tried to delete them. Unless you're saying this type of spam email does not show till it is interacted with?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually open every junk mail individually, and 'unsubscribe', and then 'Delete and Block' if available. But I have only been getting 10 or so everyday since I opened a Discover credit card account, about a month and a half ago. Since they do not seem to
 be deterring at all, I have decided to change my email address by creating a new alias and then making it my primary email address, just to get rid of the junk mail. I have done this before, but that time, I went through something like a small rolodex and
 changed all my online accounts that used the old email address to the new one. I don't think I want to do that this time. I'm going to change the most used like Amazon or Walmart, and leave the rest to whenever they are used next or something, I don't know.
 Is there any easy way around this? I have dozens of online accounts that use the current email address. How is anyone suppose to smoothly create a new email address? And all because of junk email, it just doesn't seem right.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Multiple Store Apps fail to update with Error 0x8007000A</h2>
                    <p>There are now nine apps in an ever-growing list that refuse to update on my personal account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have elevated my normal account to be able to run the Apps Troubleshooter (because it would run on the Administrator's account, which is fine), nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Store troubleshooter, nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling one the app with Remove-AppXPackage to re-install it through the store, it will not re-install, giving the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how to fix this?</p>

<p>What I actually did was reinstall Windows entirely, from DVD.&nbsp; It's not entirely linked to the problem I was having with the store, it's also that some of my hardware wasn't recognized, and other little things that were linked to the Creators' Update, and
 other things that appeared after installing cheap software, so I just decided to wipe it... with OneDrive, it's no big deal... almost all my stuff was on there, already, so...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a bit time-consuming to go through all the little nooks and crannies to set everything up again, but it's kinda fun... having something new is always fun.&nbsp; : D</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to the Creators' Update, though, the problem is that I had installed it myself, instead of letting Windows Update do it.&nbsp; I probably read in Windows Update that it was coming, read in an article that it was being rolled out, wanted it right away, and
 installed it myself, but what I didn't consider was that maybe it was still being worked on, as is now common for software to roll out "incomplete".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem was likely linked to&nbsp;forcing the Creators' Update onto my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying to help, though, and I'm glad you replied, because I didn't know how to reset the Store, or re-install it.&nbsp; I don't really hope the information becomes useful, but I'm glad I know how to fix problems with the store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So thanks!&nbsp; : )</p>

                    I WOULD REALLY LIKE SOME HELP PLEASE. I have been using windows movie maker for various video footage. A couple of days ago I edited and saved (perfectly fine) a video which was ten minutes long. Yesterday I tried to save a a new file to my computer which
 was 4 and a half minutes long everything is the same as the first video apart from its shorter in length. NOW I keep getting the same errors I HAVE TRIED EVERYTHING and I am becoming very frustrated with the matter. I keep getting "not enough memory" (I do
 have enough memory my laptop is all up to date and running perfectly fine with PLENTY OF SPACE) and then if its not that error I get another error saying corrupted files (when I go through the files on the movie maker none are corrupted and everything is perfectly
 fine when I play it all)&nbsp;I have been looking at all the answer (none work for me) so please can some one help me?

<h2>            Windows security alert when computer I start my computer</h2>
                    Whenever I start my PC a message displays to turn on windows firewall, to which I turn on the firewall. But next time when I start up, the same message displays and the window firewall automatically gets off. &nbsp;Also sometimes a message pops up saying that
 windows firewall has blocked some of the features of this program. Please help me out.

            Do you have any other internet security program installed (McAfee, Norton etc.)? These often include their own firewall and may block Windows firewall during boot.

<p>Contact your system manufacturer or refer to the manual provided with the system to know on how to boot in BIOS.</p>
<p>We have tried changing the Num Lock settings from our lab machine which is a DELL computer and I will put down the steps for the same. You can check for similar options in your computer and see if you can turn off the Num Lock from BIOS.</p>

            This is a "solution"? Or a "feature"? It's something that simple Control panel ought to do (and for what it's worth, I don't recall this problem with any previous Windows system going back to 95!). Users shouldn't be required, or even asked, to change
 the Registry. IMHO. - SP

            <p>It's set to 'on' as default in BIOS on my PC too. I have tried 3 different keyboards but it's the same on each. I also looked for the registry key to change it as advised.....but the recommended key is not there so I cannot change it's value.&nbsp;</p>

            This does not work. Why would Microsoft want people to enter PINs if they can't even get Num Lock to turn on automatically?
