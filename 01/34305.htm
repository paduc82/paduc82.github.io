<h2>            Error&#58; &#34;Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file&#34;. Why can&#39;t I access photos or calendar if I&#39;m the administrator&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Just got my Sony Vaio Duo 11 yesterday.&nbsp; Nothing installed except Office 2010/2013 &amp; Trend Micro Titanium Maximum Security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the Windows 8 "Start" menu (with all the tiles) I click on Calendar or Photos and they just immediately close and return me to the tiles.&nbsp; I tried a few times and it's always the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So then I figured "I just got this thing, there's no photos.&nbsp; Let me take some."</p>
<p>I tried the camera for the first time, took a couple pics.&nbsp; I double-click on them and I get this error message:</p>
<p>"Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file.&nbsp; You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess this is why the Photos and Calendar tiles don't work, but I have a question:&nbsp; If I'm the administrator, why the heck don't I have appropriate permissions??!?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I waited for a new computer to get rid of all the nonsense I dealt with on my old dying PC, so I'm really disappointed to see that I'm already having to fix problems on Day 2.&nbsp; Can anyone suggest a way to fix this?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I appreciate that someone tried to help.&nbsp; However, I figured it out myself.&nbsp; The problem was that I had two antiviruses running.&nbsp; I installed my own program without deleting the Kaspersky that came with the computer.&nbsp; I deleted the Kaspersky fully, rebooted
 the pc, and now it works fine.&nbsp; So far</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, you asked if I got any sort of error message.&nbsp; In my original post, I stated the message that I got.&nbsp; Also, I'm not sure exactly how the time/date would affect anything.</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I would not uninstall any .NET software. (Some will be security updates.)&nbsp; Some applications and games need this to function properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you sure it is memory that you are on about and not free disk space?&nbsp; If it is memory that you are low on then just
 removing software is not going to really help.&nbsp; Programs and the OS use the memory when needed and most release the memory when they are finished with it.&nbsp; If you only have this low amount with just windows running then the only permanent way to fix this is&nbsp;
 to purchase more memory.&nbsp; If it is disk space you are low on then you could do with looking at what temp files you have.&nbsp; Type in %temp% in the run box and delete all present files.&nbsp; Some might not delete due to being used, leave these.&nbsp; Also look at what
 size your swap file is.&nbsp;If this swap file is set to system managed then it will grow in size as windows needs&nbsp;it.&nbsp;You could set this to a fixed size e.g. 1.5 times the size of the amount of memory you have installed.&nbsp; Another place to look at is your temporary
 internet files folder size.&nbsp; This can be set to a value that is too high for ordinary surfing.&nbsp; Set it to 250MB (the recommended size as defined by windows).&nbsp; Burn any and all films/music/pictures to a CD/DVD then remove them from your system.&nbsp; A 1hr HD program
 can take up about 1-1.2GB of disk space.There are other areas that could be looked at but ultimately you really need to invest in a larger hard drive which are relatively inexpensive now a days.</p>

<p>I have tried everything recommended and nothing works. &nbsp;I created the USB but the machine informs me it can't upgrade or re-install from that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered someone else has the same problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"After update 1/9/2018, PC starts asking for keyboard layout, doesn't start, goes to Windows 10 Continue and Troubleshoot options. Continue option loops, Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options has no System Restore point nor

<p>
</p><p><span>Whatever I do it just loops back round to 'can't repair / can't restore / can't do anything - just because it downloaded an UPDATE? &nbsp; Isn't that supposed to improve things? &nbsp;There was nothing wrong with my desktop before,
 now it just won't work. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I have tried every possible option on the blue screens that come up (and of course I want to keep files) but it just goes round in circles.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only option that actually functions id the command prompt, but Microsoft can't (and shouldn't) expect their customers to have to program things themselves when their own update messes up! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have looked for assistance on youtube, where several people give guidance on what to type at the command prompt, (something about 'bootrec /fixboot' as I recall). But despite religiously and very carefully following these suggestions it does not work.
 After just one or two of these code inputs the computer responds with 'access denied'.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>The option 'repair' doesn't work</p>
<p>
</p><p>The' install' option 1 upgrade and keep files says I have to start windows normally first - if i could do that this effort would all be unnecessary!</p>

<p>Ok, so here is the thing.</p>
<p>I started playing when using a special email address which was *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>Now, after so many years, this address cant receive any emails and stopped working, but my GT is tied to the account.</p>
<p>I have added a Microsoft alias to this account which is *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and made it as a primary. I am waiting to delete the old @adanfime.co.cc alias.</p>
<p>Now, what happens if I delete that old @adanfime.co.cc and keep the @outlook one as a primary? Will everything still work?</p>

<p>it will work, though it may take a to update while if multiple Services are connected.</p>
<p>you said you already set your new Outlook.com as Primary so it should all be fine and done immediatly.</p>

<h2>            C&#58;&#47; Drive filling up randomly, possible fix..&#63;</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard" style="text-align: left"><span><span>Hi, this is a bit strange because, rather than asking about an issue to fix, like I usually do given the fact that I am 17, I have seemed to find a fix for an issue that had
 been popping up for me, my friends, and on forums that were left unanswered or still pending, some even after a year. I found that my C:/ drive was starting to fill up at a
<em>scary</em> fast rate, but I couldn't seem to find the issue. After hours of looking online, many seemed to ask about the solution but, like me, couldn't find any at all, or some fixes only worked shortly or not at all. After downloading a third-party application
 to view file sizes, I found that in the "Windows" folder, there were log files that took up a absurdly
<strong>monstrous</strong>&nbsp;amount&nbsp;of space. (Screen-shot taken here https://i.imgur.com/eA4Nox9.png). I wasn't allowed, however, to clean this before stopping Windows Modules Installer, and stopping Windows Updater in Services.MSC, only then was I allowed to
 remove this using "CC Cleaner" and the recycling bin. I am not sure if this would be of any use at all, and I most likely wasn't the first one to find this and I won't take any form or credit, but I hope this can help fix some people's issues, as well!&nbsp;</span></span></p>

                    When Windows 10 Night Light is enabled, the screen will increase in brightness when: 1) The mouse is hovering over text, OR 2) The mouse is on my secondary monitor. This issue is very annoying because it hurts my eyes when using my PC in the dark. This

<h2>            How do I navigate to &#39;Microsoft Online Assisted Support&#39; for Windows Update installation failures&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have tried and tried to navigate to a page that will allow me to detail my Microsoft / Windows Update (on XP Pro SP3)&nbsp;issues (several, many involving&nbsp;'Security Updates for Microsoft .NET Framework
 1.1 SP1 on Windows XP(, Windows Vista, and Windows Server 2008) x86' directly to Microsoft Support personnel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In so doing, I have followed all presented instructions to populate my IE8 Trusted Sites list (with
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com</a>, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://oas.support.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://oas.support.microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;&amp;
<a href="https://oas.support.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://oas.support.microsoft.com</a>), to no avail (don't even get me started on the clunky&nbsp;Security interface functionality of IE8, or the way IE makes you sort through every heirarchical level of&nbsp;a complex collection
 of&nbsp;Favorites to find the appropriate place to add&nbsp;a Favorite site / webpage).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think being led (dumped?)&nbsp;into this Microsoft Community (answers.microsoft.com)&nbsp;is what 'Microsoft Online Assisted Support' should entail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have a few gripes about the implementation of the Microsoft Update (update.microsoft.com) web GUI ... when I 'Review (my) update history',&nbsp;there is&nbsp;not&nbsp;an option to display more than 10 items to a page (obviously, the history
 can run to 10 or more pages, making repeated&nbsp;page transitions problematic when reviewing the entire history or even a major portion of it), nor&nbsp;is there an&nbsp;option to capture the displayed entries to a file (I have tried to 'Print All' to a file, however,&nbsp;that
 functionality&nbsp;seemingly <em>will not</em> populate&nbsp;a PRN file ...&nbsp;not that PRN files have ever proven that useful&nbsp;when simply wanting to view information).&nbsp; Who in their right mind would ever actually print all that info out on paper?&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I won't.&nbsp; Come
 on Microsoft, make this easier to work with would you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, in XP's Add or Remove Programs, I have yet to figure out a way to parse the plethora of updates presented&nbsp;to see which update failures listed in Microsoft Update's&nbsp;'Review your update history'&nbsp;have since been successfully
 resolved and therefore&nbsp;merit no further intervention.&nbsp; If someone can suggest a method by which this can be accomplished, please share.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There, now I feel better that I got that rant out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance to anyone who can assist me in furthering my goal of resolving my Microsoft / Windows Update issues by virtue of&nbsp;guiding me&nbsp;to direct contact with&nbsp;'Microsoft Online Assisted Support'.&nbsp; Or is this it?</p>

            <p>I bought a new Dell computer and I am trying&nbsp;to change my windows 8 to 8.1. I keep getting the message that&nbsp; only my administrator can ask for this change. This a PC desktop meaning "personal computer". This my personal computer. There is no other administrator.
 How can I get past this stupidity?</p>

<p>It isn't really workgroups that have been added but networks (with that workgroup name).&nbsp; To delete the "workgroup" you need to delete the network.</p>
<p>A computer that travels often is likely to accumulate settings for a large number of networks. Although these collected settings don’t have any significant impact on performance or disk space, you might fi nd it helpful to remove from the list entries that
 you don’t plan to use again, such as one for a network at a hotel you don’t expect to revisit. To remove a wireless network, in Network And Sharing Center, click Manage Wireless Networks. Select a network to delete and click Remove.</p>
<p>Windows Vista includes another tool that lets you delete wired networks as well as wireless networks. To use it, in Network And Sharing Center, click Customize. In the Set Network Location dialog box, click Merge Or Delete Network Locations. In the Merge
 Or Delete Network Locations dialog box, select the networks to remove and click Delete.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, d<span>o you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong><span>BEFORE</span></strong>
 the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

    <title>Winload.exe is corrupt - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> feral inferno  say:</h3>
<h2>            Winload.exe is corrupt</h2>
                    <p>I know what is wrong with my computer but don't know how to go about fixing it. Now, when I installed windows I had formatted the entire hard drive into a single partition and would like to avoid completely wiping the hard drive to reinstall windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had used Smart Defrag 3 to defrag my hard drive (obviously), and it tried to move a major windows startup file: winload.exe. That's when my computer crashed and wouldn't startup. When I tried to start my computer, after about 5-10 minutes, the Windows
 Boot Manager showed up saying that winload.exe is corrupt. I had the installation disk and ran a startup repair overnight, but when I woke up it was still attempting repairs. I thought of another easy fix: getting the winload.exe from another computer onto
 a flash drive and replacing the corrupt one. I thought that would work until I tried to delete the corrupt file with command prompt; it said the file was corrupt and unreadable, so I wasn't able to replace it. I'm reinstalling Windows onto the same partition
 right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my questions are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is there a way I can delete and replace the corrupt winload.exe file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Without wiping the hard drive and creating a seperate partition for windows files, is there a way to keep the c:\Windows\ files from being touched by a defragment program?</p>

<p>2, you are reinstalling.</p>

            <p>Hi Bobby,</p>
<p>Have you made any changes to your computer recently?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1: Perform a clean boot and check if it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: Make sure that you perform “step 7” in the above link to boot your computer normally after your troubleshoot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2: Run Search and Indexing troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Search-and-Indexing-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Open the Search and Indexing troubleshooter</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 3: Run System File Check (SFC) scans and checks if it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></p>
<p>Note: System File Checker gives an administrator the ability to scan all protected files to verify their versions. If System File Checker discovers that a protected file has been overwritten, it retrieves the correct version of the file from the cache folder
 (%Systemroot%\System32\Dllcache) or the Windows installation source files, and then replaces the incorrect file. System File Checker also checks and repopulates the cache folder. You must be logged on as an administrator or as a member of the Administrators
 group to run System File Checker. If the cache folder becomes damaged or unusable, you can use the
<b>sfc /scannow</b>, the <b>sfc /scanonce</b>, or the <b>sfc /scanboot</b> commands to repair its contents.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Hope this helps.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 does not depend on the length of the file or folder, it is always the same. Can I change something in the Registry Editor to do it as it was at 7?<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The interface of Windows 7 is totally different from Windows 10 which is by design and is not recommended to be changed through the registry to avoid any issues that can totally damage your computer. For suggestions, we would appreciate any feedback that
 you can send using the Feedback Hub that you can get for free through the Windows Store or by clicking on this

            thank you for your reply. but just the screenshot is from windows 7 and i wanted to show how was the selection line. actually windows 10 was like the screenshot too, but after the creators update it became like the second screenshot. i mentioned registry
 because i thought maybe its the easiest way. so is there any setting for this problem? because it is very hard to select a file with few characters.<br />
thank you<br />

    <title>Wrong channels being tuned, missing channels, etc. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anonim1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wrong channels being tuned, missing channels, etc.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm using the Hauppauge USB tuner with a Mohu Leaf 50 antenna. Plugging the antenna directly in to the TV, I can watch 70 DTV channels. Setting up the tuner and selecting the OTA lineup on the Xbox One works fine; however, it's all downhill from there.</p>
<p>There are a number of channels that don't show up in the OneGuide that are both part of my OTA lineup and that I can watch through the TV (including NBC). With a number of other channels that do show up, selecting them tunes to an incorrect channel. Examples:</p>
<p>2.1 (FOX) in OneGuide tunes DTV channel 4.2</p>
<p>5.1 (CBS) in OneGuide tunes DTV 36.1</p>
<p>Many other channels in OneGuide just say "Can't find signal. Check your aerial antenna" when the signal is clear as day when the antenna is plugged in to the TV directly.</p>
<p>Let me know if I can provide any more details.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; explorer.exe not working</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 this morning from windows 7 . </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having the following problems.</p>
<p>1) EDGE :</p>
<p>I opened Edge browsed a bit and then Edge shut down on it's own . After that whenever I click the icon I get a popup wth a message " Explorer.exe Element not found " . Edge does not open, I am able to open firefox or chrome.</p>
<p>2) App tiles:</p>
<p>None of the apps which are pinned to the start do not open when clicked. There are no error messages.</p>
<p>3) Some of lenovo utilities which came pre-installed on the laptop are not working.For example "powermanagement.exe has stopped working Windows is searching for a solution"</p>
<p>4) Dolby stopped working too</p>
<p>5) Volume is very very very low</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solutions please</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you playing on Xbox One or Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was this race one where you bet in game credits?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did the game freeze or lag before this happened?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend quitting the game and relaunching it completely&nbsp;to see if the credits are back in your in-game balance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Provide us some more information and we can help you figure this out.</p>

<p>Гонка была обычная (сезонная) играл с другом. Да игра зависла, но не обратил внимание на баланс. После чего нашел раритет, и только после этого увидел что за место 9.700.000 кредитов стало 1.800.00<br />
Перезапустил игру, потом консоль, не помогло.<br />

</span><strong><span>Yes, the game hung, but did not pay attention to the balance.</span></strong><span>
</span><strong><span>Then I found a rarity, and only after that I saw that for the place of 9.700.000 credits it became 1.800.00</span></strong><br />

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for the reply with the update. Based on the fact that the game froze, or hung up, I would recommend you try a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
soft factory reset of your Xbox One console</a>. Once you do so, it will eliminate any potentially damaging files from the OS that may be causing this issue. It would also remove any profiles from the console, but keep your games &amp; apps installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button <span>
</span>to open the guide.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>All Settings</strong>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>System</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>Console info </strong>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Reset console</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards, when you log your profile back onto the console, it should re-sync all your data (including game data) to the console so that you may check to see if there have been any changes regarding the amount of the credits. Should the issue persist after
 that, then you would need to reach out to the friendly folks over at <a href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/categories/360000558393-Forza-Horizon-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Forza Support for Forza Horizon 4</a>, the <a href="https://forums.forzamotorsport.net/turn10_forum.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Forza forums</a>, or at <a href="https://www.playground-games.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Playground Games</a> as the credits are in-game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give the troubleshooting a try and let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this information helps out a bit more.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Local Area Connection&#34; Doesn&#39;t have a valid IP configuration</h2>
                    <p>It seems after about every 20 minutes the internet shuts off and I have to reset the local area adapter to get it to come back up. I've tried numerous guides but the problem still occurs.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Have you tried disabling "Wake on Link Settings" and "Wake on Settings" on the network adapter?</p>
<p>

<p>

            Hi, Thanks for your quick reply, however I tried disabling any settings that may turn off the device with no avail. I also looked at power settings and disabled sleep mode but the problem still persists.

            <p>Hi Aaron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that the drivers for the network adapter is fine and assuming that it used to work, I'm guessing that it might be the Network Card itself.&nbsp; If you have one handy, try putting it in your PC and give it a go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In one of the forums mentioned that they had change the link speed to a lower speed.&nbsp; It's worth giving a go.</p>

            <p>I'm not sure if this has any relevance but whenever the internet drops, the time setting on the pc switches to some random date/time. I've checked the bios and looked at about every setting in time management but no success. It seems to be linked with this.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Aaronj1.With the time changing is never a good thing for a system that bases the scheduler to perform tasks.I never use the sync time server as I have had issues with it myself in the past.If you double click the clock/time and set the date and time.Turn
 off sync to any time server and see if it helps.This program is an uninstaller that will also show you what is starting every time you switch the machine on.You click tools and autorun manager you can shut off whatever you don't need at startup.Be sure to
 follow the directions very carefully if you uninstall a program.Make sure to read as you go.</p>

            I should've said this above, but I already tried all those methods, and the problem occurs for ALL adapters. Even the wireless. Thanks for the reply.
