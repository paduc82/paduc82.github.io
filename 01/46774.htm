 how to do this. If I could log in to my page I could do a system restore, but I can't get that far. I have recently (2 days ago) installed a canon all-in-one printer but I had no problems until today. I have disconnected the printer, just in case, but the

<p><span>Unfortunately, because of the condition of your system, there are very few things we can try (essentially only using a disk since you have no other means of
 access).&nbsp; We will do the CHKDSK option that was suggested but from the disk. Do you have a genuiune Vista Installation Disk or just a Recovery Disk from the manufacturer (or neither)?</span></p>
<p><span>Bluescrren errors typically mean hardware or driver issues (though it could also be software).&nbsp; Read the posts and follow the procedures set forth by Spirit
 MVP in the following thread regarding the Blue Screen of Death.&nbsp; They should help you resolve your problem.<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistarepair/thread/3deab2fa-4000-4136-8c78-a3d22b1db009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistarepair/thread/3deab2fa-4000-4136-8c78-a3d22b1db009</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A
 lot of that is duplicated below but it also offers some other oprtions and explanatons of bluescreen errors (though you will have the same problem there that you do here with the inability to access the system in any way other than the disk).&nbsp; What we really
 need now is the EXACT and ENTIRE text of the bluescreen message - just copy it down and post it in a reply.&nbsp; It might say IRQL-NOT-EQUAL-TO or something like that.&nbsp; It will also have a string of numbers like 0x800000f3 (0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000).&nbsp;
 It would help to know this information as it can sometimes help us pin down the source of the problem.&nbsp; I suggest you try the following, then go back to Spirit's post and see if it adds anything that might help that you can do and that you haven't already
 tried.</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a><span>.&nbsp; Be sure to check the
 box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use Windows Update for the
 updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should be able to restore
 with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery
 Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span><span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along with burning software like:</span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps with another computer if necessary).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.&nbsp; Try to post any corrupted files here so
 we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at
 least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></span></span></p>

<p>Hi Lorien,</p>
<p>Thanks for your help and advice, this is what I have done and I'm still having problems .....</p>
<p>At the start-up screen I pressed F8 and selected Repair Your Computer. &nbsp;This is what the blue screen said ...</p>
<p>A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.</p>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<p>Check for viruses</p>
<p>Remove newly installed hard drives or hard drive controllers</p>
<p>Check hard drive to make sure it is properly configured and terminated</p>
<p>Run&nbsp;chkdsk/f to check for hard drive corruption&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restart&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Information:</p>
<p>***STOP: 0X0000007B (0XFFFFF98000A069E0, 0XFFFFFFFFC0000034, 0X0000000000000000, 0X0000000000000000)</p>
<p>I have done the following steps with these results:</p>
<p>Check for viruses - (done and cleaned)</p>
<p>Remove newly installed hard drives or hard drive controllers - (not exactly sure about this one but removed the newlyinstalled printer and its software)</p>
<p>Check hard drive to make sure it is properly configured and terminated - (no idea how to do this step, so advice would bewelcome)</p>
<p>Run chkdsk/f to check for hard drive corruption - (done this and noticed that 'orphaned files' were being put back towherever&nbsp;they belonged?????)</p>
<p>Restart - (done and system started to work fine again ..... however, when trying to download the new Safari 5, QuickTime</p>
<p>and iTunes updates, computer won't download - error message appears (this bit not important yet, computer needs</p>
<p>fixing first!))</p>
<p>I don't have the Windows Vista Installation Disk and I'm working on making a Recovery Disk (as explained above) but I'm having a few difficulties there too.</p>
<p>I'm very grateful for any and all advice and thank everyone in advance.</p>

            I had a problem with windows vista booting up but it wouldn't allow me to click on my icon so that I could type in my password. Struggled for hours, restarting my pc each type with the hope it would eventually work. Starting in safe mode worked fine so
 remembered that AVG free antivirus was one of the last software that I installed. So uninstalled it, rebooted and it would log me in no problem. This must have happened when I upgraded my AVG 2012 to 2013. &nbsp;Bad idea. So now that I logged on successfully I
 have installed AVG 2011 just to be safe.&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with the System Maker's Support (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) as there may<br />
be a hardware issue.<br />
<br />
Another possibility is there is something loading&nbsp;at startup that is affecting the USB. Use the methods<br />
below and then if needed try those in the next message. And it very well may be hardware.<br />
<br />
==========<br />
<br />
If a PC and if needed the on-board USB can be disabled and an add-in USB card can be used which<br />
is not expensive. For a laptop the help of a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a Best Buy<br />
or other Big Box Stores) or the System maker's Support.

Then lets refresh the USB Stack</p>
<p>Control Panel&nbsp;- Device Manager - click anywhere in the blank/white area - then VIEW - Show<br />
Disabled Devices - look everywhere (except USB Controllers) for your&nbsp;device(s) (may have<br />
none or more than one) and Right Click on it - UNINSTALL.<br />
<br />
Control Panel&nbsp;- Device Manager - USB Serial Controllers -&nbsp;RIGHT CLICK on EVERYTHING and<br />
UNINSTALL all&nbsp;except the category itself - REBOOT - this refreshes the driver and the USB stack<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 CPU Requirements&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It says my CPU isn't supported.</p>
<p>The requirements say Processor: 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster processor or SoC</p>
<p>My processor is AMD C-50 Processor (2 CPUs), ~1.0 GHz</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that good enough? I've read that the app is being buggy and reporting false reports to some users. Thanks!</p>

            Hi BangkitMc,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />There are three actions which you can undertake. You can try them one by one and check after each.
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>
<br />For 1803 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />3. Perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

<h2>            Halo 5 Guardians impossible to play online on my Xbox one</h2>
                    
<p>I bought xbox one limited edition Halo 5 guardians with limited edition game. I activated the game with the code. My network is working well, but i can't play with the multiplayer. The loggon screen to play with the campains coop and multiplayer is impossible
 to join. With my account i can play online on a friend's xbox, but not on mine. I've tried to reinstall the game twice, it doesn't work. I ve tried to reset my xbox one like a new one, it doesn't work. A message appeared and say that there is an error of user
 authorization with halo 5 guardians services and i couldn't join online mods. I contact the xbox one support 4 times and they told me that there is no trouble with my console, and i must explain that here on the forum.</p>

<p>Thank you for help.</p>

            <p>Hey David, I think I see what your problem is.</p>
<p>You stated in your original post that you can play online on your friends console but not yours. &nbsp;This suggests that you do not currently have a Gold membership and were sharing their membership when you were playing.</p>
<p>If you want to play online multiplayer games you will need to purchase a Gold membership for your account. &nbsp;You can either do this on the console or website (credit card or paypal required) or by heading to your nearest gaming store and purchasing a membership code then entering it in on the console. &nbsp;Then you will have full access to all Live features.</p>

<h2>            cd&#47;dvd drive won&#39;t launch unless computer is restarted with disk in drive</h2>
                    I had to replace my cd/dvd drive as part of a system reinstall. The new cd/dvd drive (actually a used unit my IT dept at work gave me) works fine except for the following glitch. If I insert a cd or dvd disk in the drive with the computer on, the disk
 does not launch nor does the drive show up in the available drives in windows explorer. But, if insert the disk in the drive and then restart the computer, then the computer recognizes the drive and it shows up in available drives in windows explorer. I have
 run troubleshooting and fixit, and they indicate there is nothing wrong with the drive. At the Control Panel, the Device Manager recognizes my ATA driver and says it is working properly, and windows says my software is up to date Any ideas? Thanks.

            You have a faulty/dry connection, when the system is started normally the drive is not detected, when you put a cd in then reboot, the initial bios process then detects the drive, so it is available when win finally boots

<h2>            Windows Icon and search not working in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: How do I know if Windows 10 loaded properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having several issues. I did not want to mess with Cortana when I first loaded, so now I want to search, and it won't let me type anything in the Search the web and Windows bar that is on my taskbar. Also,&nbsp;the windows icon on the bottom left does absolutely
 nothing!</p>
<p>Now, when I try to attach files to email, all of the files do not show up to choose from.&nbsp; I put a few on my desktop to see if I could attach them that way, and it worked a few times, but now the Desktop (in the file choice area) shows it is empty! What?</p>
<p>My system also does not have the little square with all the tiles of what's on the computer.</p>
<p>HELP!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Susanna</p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Run the Search and Indexing Troubleshooter.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Run the DISM Tool.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I would have you run the DISM tool to check the system health and will try to restore the files.&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on '<strong>Start</strong>'.</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In the list of results, swipe down on or right-click Command Prompt, and then tap or click
<strong>'Run as administrator'</strong>.&nbsp; </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<h2>            Windows 8.1 - It keeps freezing up - Windows Media Player configuration</h2>
                    <p>Asus PC CM855 </p>
<p>Windows 8.1</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>I have done a disk clean, defrag, troubleshooting.. When i did the troubleshooting on the windows media player settings it did come back with a problem detected - configeration may be set incorrectly. &nbsp;Upon desperatly searching for a fix for my computer
 freezing up constantly, Microsoft is aware of issues with the dvd playback and the media center then they refered me to codecs...with warning on installing codecs on your own.. &nbsp;I just tried to open the windows media player and my computer frooze.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would microsoft make a media player that has issues? &nbsp;Why not just send out an update to fix this instead of causing issues with peoples computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to know how to fix this issue. &nbsp;I dont want to load the wrong codecs and have microsoft say..not my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you</p>

<h2>            Systems Settings Broker Runtime Error</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed an ASUS RT-AC3100 router which worked fine at first, but now when I try to connect my desktop to the 2.4GHz or 5GHz I am getting a Runtime Error for C:\Windows\System32\SystemSettingsBroker.exe. It says the application has requested
 the Runtime to terminate in an unusual way. It works with a Guest Network I set up with the same router no issues. I am running Windows 10 on my desktop.&nbsp; Any guidance would be appreciated!</p>

<p>Hello Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>SystemSettingsBroker.exe errors may be due to corrupt, outdated or missing files, virus or malware infection, file conflicts or overloaded hard drive or invalid registry entries associated with SystemSettingsBroker.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can follow these simple methods to resolved the issue:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Update your PC device drivers</strong></p>
<p>SystemSettingsBroker.exe errors can be caused by corrupt or outdated device drivers. If you're sure you have the latest driver updates and the issue is still present, proceed to
<strong>Method 2</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Run a Full Anti-virus/Malware Scan on your Computer</strong><br />
Viruses and Malwares can damage, corrupt or even delete Runtime Error-related files. Additionally, it is possible that the SystemSettingsBroker.exe error you are experiencing is related to a component of the malicious program itself. After running the scan,
 test if the issue is resolved. If not, proceed to <strong>Method 3</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3: Use Disk Cleanup tool to clean out junk files from your computer</strong><br />
You can follow these steps to run the <strong>Disk Cleanup tool</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Start</strong> button.</li><li>In the search box, type <strong>Disk Cleanup</strong> and select <strong>Disk Cleanup</strong> from the list.</li><li>The Disk Cleanup dialog box will appear with list of checkboxes you can select. Check the boxes of the categories you want to clean (<strong>temporary files</strong>).</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Once the tool has finished cleaning out the junk files, check if you're still receiving the same Runtime error. If you still have the same error, proceed to
<strong>Method 4</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4: Uninstall and reinstall the program/application associated with SystemSettingsBroker.exe error</strong></p>
<p>If your SystemSettingsBroker.exe error is related to a specific program or application, uninstall and reinstalling that program may resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need further assistance, let us know.</p>

    <title>Wireless printer won&#39;t connect to the network. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> srutht  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless printer won&#39;t connect to the network.</h2>
                    My HP photosmart wireless printer bn109n-z won't connect to the network.&nbsp; I have run the troubleshooterand tried things from help websites including updating drivers.&nbsp; I have put the installation cd in to get it to connect to my wireless network and get
 error messages that the UDP port 427 needs unblocking&nbsp;and TCP port 9220 needs unblocking from PC to printer. Also same for UDP port 161.&nbsp; I have tried following advice on adding a port in the firewall but can't work out how to do it because there is no add
 a port&nbsp; option to click on.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had&nbsp;been having problems with my old g router keep turning itself of and the printer just stopped&nbsp;working wirelessley with the old router. I bought a new one (belkin&nbsp; n600) and still can't get the printer to work on the network.
 I tried connecting the printer to the router but didn't work.&nbsp; I am on Windows 7. Any help would be appreciated, thanks.

            Wait.<br />
<br />
As a understood, you have wifi connection between Win7 PC and the wifi router, and a wifi connection between the router and the printer? Right?<br />
<br />
Can you ping the printer? Is your network in infrastructure or ad-hoc mode? (The ad-hoc mode doesn't need the router) Do you use DHCP on the router... Are all IPs in the same network segment?<br />
<br />
You have to share mode information with us if you want help.<br />

            <p>Hi, sorry I am not very technical which is probably why I am struggling to sort this out!
</p>
<p>My laptop is connected to the wifi.&nbsp; I don't think the printer has a wifi connection to the router because I printed out a wireless network test report&nbsp;from the printer and under network name (SSID) found it said fail and that the printer couldn't find my
 access point.&nbsp; it told me to check my printer network name matches my access point name exactly but not sure how to check this on the printer so searched in the HP solution centre.&nbsp;I clicked on network settings&nbsp;and it&nbsp;took me to a webpage that couldn't be
 found&nbsp;(of the IP address).&nbsp;I am assuming this is where I would change the printer network name to match the wireless network name? the report said wireless was on and working on the printer.</p>
<p>I pinged the IP address of the printer and it sent 4 packets, received 4, lost 0 - is this right?</p>
<p>I can't find where to check what mode the network is in - can you advise how to do this please?
</p>
<p>The router says DHCP is enabled under LAN settings.</p>
<p>The IP of the printer and the one under LAN settings on the router are the same except for the last digit. Is that correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>1. Which is the antivirus program installed in the computer? Is it comes with an inbuilt firewall?
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. What happens when you tried to add the port in firewall?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may also temporarily disable security software and check if you can access the printer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have finally had success at last!!!</p>
<p>I&nbsp;looked in&nbsp;windows firewall and under advanced settings, inbound rules there were several rules about file and printer sharing listed as domain that were not enabled so I enabled them.&nbsp; I also turned off firewall,&nbsp;ran the printer&nbsp;installation CD and reconfigured
 it and it worked.&nbsp; I turned firewall back on and it still works.</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice.</p>

<p>Hey MediaTenSteve,</p>
<p>Let us know the model number of the Lifecam.</p>
<p>You can give a try with Windows Live Messenger which would give you a full screen view of the video.</p>
<p>With Windows Live Messenger you can chat, swap photos, and see what’s new with the people you care about.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>Note: Along with the webcam there comes a software which you need to install in order to view full screen video.</p>

<h2>            How can I RE-install LOST Microsoft &#39;Sticky Notes&#39; on my computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I seem to have lost Microsoft Sticky Notes on my computer.&nbsp; I had a lot of trouble logging on recently (don't ask!) and ran a cleanup program that was recommended to me which sorted out all my problems.&nbsp; One thing I did, before that, in attempting to sort
 things out, was to create multiple users (again, don't ask!).&nbsp; I've transferred all my shortcuts, including TaskBar, successfully, but Sticky Notes has disappeared completely, esp. from Microsoft Accessories in Start.&nbsp; I've searched for both 'sticky' and 'stiky'
 exhaustively (hidden and OS files are set to visible).&nbsp; Same applies to all the previous Users I created and the Administrator (to all of which I have access).&nbsp; Notepad is 'clunky', to use a technical term.&nbsp; There are plenty of third party applications, but
 the MS version is quite adequate.&nbsp; Is there a method to re-install it?<br />

            You can conclude from that, that the SSD is OK.&nbsp; Now I would re-install Windows 7 on that SSD.

    <title>IPSEC&#47;L2TP VPN broken after November update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brethawkins  say:</h3>
<h2>            IPSEC&#47;L2TP VPN broken after November update</h2>
                    <p>I have a VPN connection that worked fine up until I received the big November update yesterday for Windows 10. &nbsp;It's an IPSEC/L2TP VPN, and it looks like it's going to connect fine, but then gives me "A connection to the remote computer could not be established.
 &nbsp;You might need to change the network settings for this connection."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I "break" my password, it detect it, so I'm obviously talking to the VPN server successfully. &nbsp;I've reinstalled network adaptors and L2TP miniports. &nbsp;It's a Dell XPS 8700 with a Dell 1703 wireless adaptor. &nbsp;I only mention that because I have a 2nd PC
 on which the VPN still works fine, and it also received the update. &nbsp;So it makes me think it's an issue with the drivers on this machine specifically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Bret</p>

<p><span>Hi diamante2018,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no language pack download available for English language on Windows XP.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you try the below step to change the language from Spanish to English and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To install another language and keyboard layout in Windows XP, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the Windows XP standard Start menu, click &nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>, and then click&nbsp;
<strong>Control Panel</strong>. <br />
<br />
In the Windows XP classic Start menu, click &nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>, click&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>, and then click&nbsp;
<strong>Control Panel</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Double-click&nbsp;<strong>Regional
 and Language Options</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 the&nbsp;<strong>Languages</strong> tab, and then click &nbsp;<strong>Details</strong> under "Text Services and Input Languages".</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 &nbsp;<strong>Add</strong> under "Installed Services", and then click the language you want to add and the keyboard layout you want to use for that language.</span></p>
