                    I am running Windows 7, 64 bit on my laptop. There are 14 separate installs of Visual C++ on my laptop. Approx. half are 2005 and the rest are dated 2008. I really don't know what Visual C++ is or does but Why do I need 14 of these taking up hard drive
 space. I want to free up space on my drive and was wondering if the older 2005 ones can be deleted if there are 2008 ones installed or is there a way to get 1 install that would allow me to uninstall the 14 I have.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

            <p>The entries in Programs and Features are more of a record of which updates have been applied than an indication that multiple versions are installed. Only the most recent version of 2005 and 2008 will be in the Program Files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Visual C++ Redistributables are required to run applications developed&nbsp;in Microsoft Visual C++. The application may not work properly unless the version of the Visual C++ Redistributable corresponding to the version of Visual Studio it was developed
 with is installed. Uninstalling the Redistributables will break programs running on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to tidy it up you can uninstall them from Control Panel&nbsp;and then install the latest versions of the Redistributables from the links here:</p>

<p>However, these files are tiny. Uninstalling them would not even make a difference to the decimal place in&nbsp;you free space. &nbsp;</p>

                    <span>
<p>Warning: long story ahead. One ordinary day, my computer crashed. I was expecting this. I was completely backed up, and all. Only one problem: Windows 7 had been corrupted. Still, nothing that I can't repair; I was going to do a clean install and restore
 all my data. Then it hit me: where was my Windows 7 CD from my manufacturer, HP? I looked and looked, but I couldn't find it. Oh, but wait! I found something: a Windows 7 Ultimate CD that hasn't been installed. But there was a problem with that: I had lost
 the key. So, because I need my computer to work now, I installed it without the key, because the key I had on the bottom of my laptop was a Windows 7 Home Premium key. Now that my trial period is running out, I want to know this: can I activate? I don't even
 need the Ultimate features. I just want a Home Premium installation that works! Please respond ASAP; I need my computer activated<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">soon</span>.</p>

<p>No, you cannot use a Windows 7 Home Premium product key to activate Windows 7 Ultimate, in fact, if you want to use Windows 7 Home Premium, you will have to do a clean install or purchase a product key for Windows 7 Ultimate.</p>
<p><br />
MS Store Prices for Windows 7:<br />
http://store.microsoft.com/microsoft/Windows-Windows-7/category/102</p>
<p>The other option is customize the Windows 7 Ultimate DVD and install Windows 7 Home Premium from it.</p>

    <title>USB Printing Support driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mnielsen  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Printing Support driver</h2>
                    
<p>As I was leaving work on Aug 3, I shut down my computer and a Windows update had been downloaded, so I "Shut down after installing updates."</p>
<p>The next day (yesterday) I booted up my computer and all of a sudden, I get an error saying that new hardware was recognized (USB Printing Support) and that I needed to find a driver for it.</p>
<p>I followed the prompts and completed the wizard for the driver install.</p>
<p>On the last screen of the wizard, I was informed that the driver was installed but not working properly.</p>
<p>So, I checked in Device Manager for any red x's or yellow !'s. Both instances of USB Printing Support have yellow !'s. Now my printer doesn't work.</p>
<p>After spending time on the phone with Canon (printer manufacturer) tech support, they say their software and drivers are installed and that something's wrong with plug 'n' play or usb hardware on the machine.</p>
<p>I'm ready to be done with this problem!!!</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated!</p>

<p>Go to Windows Update and click "Check your Update History."&nbsp; What was the update that was installed on August 3?&nbsp; Did it have anything to do with printing or USB support?&nbsp; You should not download drivers from Windows Update.</p>
Disconnect your printer from the computer.
<p>Go to the Canon website and download the driver for your printer.&nbsp; Save it where you'll find it again.</p>
<p>Open Device Manager and uninstall the two instances of USB Printing Support.</p>
<p>Go to Control Panel &gt; Add or Remove Programs and uninstall any software related to your printer.</p>
<p>Go to Printers &amp; Faxes.</p>
<p>Select the icon for your printer, right-click and delete it.</p>
<p>Still in Printers &amp; Faxes, click on File in the toolbar and select Server Properties.&nbsp; Look in the drivers tab. Delete any drivers that are related to your printer.</p>
<p>Reboot the computer.&nbsp; Do not connect the printer yet.</p>
<p>Run the exe file you downloaded from your printer mfr's website.&nbsp; Follow the directions.&nbsp; You should be prompted when to connect the printer.</p>

<p>Thank you for the quick reply, LemP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed your instructions exactly and everything worked perfectly until I plugged in the printer.</p>
<p>I took the extra precaution of rebooting after installing the drivers, etc for Canon.</p>
<p>Once that was done, I plugged in the printer and got the new hardware found notification.</p>
<p>An unsigned driver was trying to install, and I clicked Continue Anyway.</p>
<p>This began to look very familiar to me.</p>
<p>The process started again as before: Found new Hardware, Canon MF5770, Continue Anyway, Notice: installed, but not working properly, Finish.</p>
<p>The same process occurred with USB Printing Support.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>Sorry that didn't work for you.</p>
<p>Just to be certain that we're on the same page, you should have downloaded MF5770_MFDrivers_Win_x32_us_EN_7.exe</p>
<p>While you were there, you probably also should have downloaded one of the versions of the Canon Toolbox (if you followed my initial directions and uninstalled everything related to Canon).&nbsp; I'm not sure what the difference is between ToolBox_4911mf10_Win_EN.exe
 and <span>ToolBox_4911mf08_Win_EN_1.exe, but it looks as if the former works with Win 7 as well as earlier OSes.</span></p>
<p>Finally, in case you have misplaced the manuals that came with your printer, download<a href="http://gdlp01.c-wss.com/gds/3/0900006173/01/imageCLASS_MF5770_Set-Up_Instructions_NandP_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Canon's printing setup instructions</a> .</p>
<p>Try doing the cleanout procedure again, but this time follow the Canon setup instructions.&nbsp; You need to be logged on as a user with administrator privileges.&nbsp; Also note that one of the first things Canon says to do is to "quit" your antivirus application.&nbsp;
 Most a/v applications have a way to temporarily disable real-time scanning.&nbsp; Do this.&nbsp; It's possible that your a/v app interfered with the install of the Canon driver so that when you finally connected the USB cable, Windows attempted to install some sort
 of generic USB printer driver.</p>
<p>One last question: did the Found New Hardware Wizard also want to install USB Printing Support this time, or are you referring to your initial attempt to install the printer?</p>
<p>If you go through all of this and things still don't work, you might try doing the install in Safe Mode.</p>

    <title>Hinder windows from disconnecting wifi when LAN is enabled - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hinder windows from disconnecting wifi when LAN is enabled</h2>
                    <p>Dear sirs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have encountered that Windows 8 disconnects WLAN from&nbsp;the Access point &nbsp;when LAN is Connected, especially at reboot.</p>
<p>Is there anyway to prevent this? It is of tremendous annoyance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My LAN and WLAN are Connected to the same Network hostname. But ironicly LAN has restricted internet speed to 3mbps and 1gbs LAN-wise, while WLAN has 50mbps Internet Access, and 130mbps LAN-wise.
</p>
<p>That is why I require WLAN to always stay Connected at all times, in order to keep web speed at maximum.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everytime WLAN gets disconnected, all internet traffic gets routed through LAN because it is second in "Metric" that I have manually set in order to get WLAN prioritized for web traffic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thank you for taking Your time reading at least.</p>

            <p>Hi Tadasha</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-I encounter no issues reconnecting WLAN while LAN&nbsp;has been&nbsp;connected.</p>
<p>-Both WLAN and LAN may work at same time, if user reconnects WLAN after a reboot is done and/or after&nbsp;the LAN cable has been unplugged and then replugged.</p>
<p>-WLAN just gets disconnected automatically when LAN is operational.</p>
<p>-Are there no ways to disable this automatic WLAN&nbsp;disconnect?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other internet&nbsp;issue is that LAN is connected to all computers in the same room at full speed, but the ISP router is in a different floor without direct cabling. So a LAN over power current is utilized but due to the floors being on different electric
 circuits only a mere 3mbps of bandwith survive through the power currents, and if these 3 mbps are maxxed out, the&nbsp;ISP router gets such a packet loss that it strips all other internet users of the&nbsp;50mbps speed.&nbsp; So that is why I would like windows 7 passive
 setting back, where WLAN is not influenced by changes on other adapters.</p>

<p>Some HP laptops have a LAN_WLAN switching function that disables wireless when your plugged into an Ethernet network. Its configured in BIOS.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Of laptops I&nbsp;encounter this on&nbsp;both&nbsp;a ASUS K55VM&nbsp;and a CLEVO P150HM </p>
<p>When running Windows 7 on these there is no issue with disconnects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one else experiencing that WLAN disconnects when LAN gets connected? just to clearify it's just an annoyance it's not impossible to use both WLAN&amp;LAN at the same time, one just has to connect WLAN to SSID manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for input so far.</p>

                    <p>Xbox won't go home when told to via the Xbox button on a controller, nor by using Kinect voice commands. I get this error code:&nbsp;0x87b20c07 &nbsp;. &nbsp;Which I tried entering on the code error page, to no avail. My other console does this often as well; and there has never been a resolution. It simply recommends if it keeps happening to reset the console with the 10second power hold. This is very frustrating!!</p>

 the folder I'll start getting&nbsp;registry errors. I have Win 10 Home. During the install I got an error "Runtime Error (at 1:736): Out of Range." I already tried downloading the file and reinstalling the addon but it didn't help. Another thing the addon a AV-8B

<h2>            Lifecam HD-6000 autofocus issues</h2>
                    

<p>I was asked to post this question in this hardware forum, but you can read the full string on this topic which is still outstanding for many people in the following threads:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/a01ce6c0-f3a8-453b-b710-0040d5435ad9?prof=required&amp;ppud=4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/a01ce6c0-f3a8-453b-b710-0040d5435ad9?prof=required&amp;ppud=4</a></strong></p>
<p>and in</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/0c08e82f-85f4-478b-9583-6b057c8b6fe2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/0c08e82f-85f4-478b-9583-6b057c8b6fe2</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>To summarize:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Issue #1) There is no Product Identification Number on/in the Microsoft Lifecam HD-6000, which means no one can contact support (requires a Product ID number). &nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Issue #2)&nbsp;</span></strong><span>I just purchased a Microsoft LifeCam HD-6000. &nbsp;Sounds nice, looks nice, but the autofocus on it makes the product useless.</span></p>
The autofocus takes a crisp image, and for no apparent reason, sends the image to totally blurry and then refocuses (to crisp infocus) about every 20 seconds, and the process takes about 5 seconds to complete. &nbsp;This&nbsp;is very annoying and basically makes
 the unit non-functional - every 20 seconds I go totally out of focus and then come back in focus, then repeat 20 sec later.

<p>See other threads/links above on this topic. &nbsp;I am running XP SP3 with USB2, T2600 CPU @ 2.16GHz, 2 GB of RAM.</p>

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p><br />
This is a pretty old thread, but here&nbsp;is a&nbsp;work around:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open LifeCam software. </p>
<p>2. Choose the Settings tab on the right of the viewing pane&nbsp;(Gear wheel icon)</p>
<p>2. If the Settings&nbsp;tab area&nbsp;is not showing, tap/click the arrow on the right-hand&nbsp;border of the window viewing pane.</p>
<p>3. Turn off "True-color"</p>
<p>4. Choose "Properties, then the "Camera Control" tab.</p>
<p>5. Uncheck "Auto focus" next to the "Focus" slider.</p>
<p>6. Adjust focus to a value that works for you. And "Apply" then "OK".</p>
<p>7. OPTIONAL: Turn "True-color" back on (optional) (if you turn on "True-color", autofocus will reactivate, but you should be OK for that session (the focus will not go in and out). If you close and restart the program, you'll need to turn off auto focus
 again. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Can I remove the microphone icon from the taskbar search feature, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janeweber  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I remove the microphone icon from the taskbar search feature, while keeping the search bar itself&#63;</h2>
                    <p>To clarify my question completely; </p>
<ul>
<li>I do not want to remove the search bar;</li><li>I do not wish to disable Cortana completely;</li><li>I wish to continue using the search box, and;</li><li>I wish to remove the icon and nothing else.</li></ul>
<p>I want to keep exactly the search bar embedded in the task bar, without the microphone icon located to the right of the box. I never use it, but I love the search box, and so when I accidentally press the microphone icon it delays my search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hello Jane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Noting all the details that you have provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you want to disable Cortana's microphone icon on the search bar. By design, disabling Cortana's microphone icon in the taskbar is not an option. What we can do is to disable or hide Cortana search bar but not the Microphone icon.
</p>

    <title>Ghost e-mail account in Mail under Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donawinter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ghost e-mail account in Mail under Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have tried to use Mail application under Widows 10 and added my accounts for Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail.</p>
<p>I had problems with my Hotmail account so that I deleted and re-created it for several times.</p>
<p>The result now is that, when I click on Accounts in the right panel, in the list with all accounts I have two Hotmail items, a good one that works and a ghost one.</p>
<p>I would like if you could provide a solution on how to get rid of the ghost account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried this : removed all accounts and created them again (but the ghost account can't be removed), I uninstalled Mail application and reinstalled it, all this without any positive result.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
                </div>

I have this same "Ghost" problem, but with an iCloud account.&nbsp; I've done all of the things you tried, but with no joy.&nbsp; Also, I've tried them with both&nbsp;my Microsoft account and my local account.&nbsp;The only thing I can think of is to delete the entire Mail app

            I have to agree with your post on the other subject matter (Win Mail and iCloud) - i think it is a Mail Application for Windows 10 problem.

            I finally gave up the mail application and went back to Windows Live Mail which has a lot more features and does not create ghost accounts.

<h2>            Windows explorer keeps restarting</h2>
                    <p>i do not know exactly when it started happening, i want to say it started when i downloaded a update a few months ago because i know this did not happen when i first got this computer. im pretty sure it started after i downloaded an update. but my other
 computer is on the same version mine is and its doing fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so every 20-40 seconds, my deskktop and taskbar will go black and all my windows apps (file explorer, control panel) will close. and about a second or 2 later it will come back (not the apps though) this is annoying when i want to delete apps or do stuff
 with my files.</p>
<p>i also noticed that when im rearranging my desktop apps, after it goes black, my apps are back in thieir preivous spots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>note: when this happens windows explorer (explorer.exe) will dissapear and reapear from task manager like its being restarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>any one know how to fix this pls?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows thinks there is a second monitor - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows thinks there is a second monitor</h2>
                    Hello All,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been searching through the forums to see if someone has experienced this before, and it looks like people have but solved the issue with some simple steps. Which I have tried as well.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's the issue (running Windows 7 64-bit):</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Window "thinks" there is a second monitor attached to it off to the right.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I go into my Screen Resolution properties and it shows only one display.&nbsp;</div>
<div>However, I can move my mouse off to the right and see that it does keep going.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It's as if it thinks there is a second monitor attached.&nbsp;</div>
<div>This is causing problems with my colors and Aero.</div>
<div>Windows is stuck in 16 bit, even though all of my properties everywhere are set to "truecolor (32 bit)".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I ran the Troubleshoot problems with transparency and other Aero effects wizard and it came back with two issues:</div>
<div>1. Color depth is set too low (again I looked at all properties everywhere and they are set to 32)</div>
<div>2. Desktop Window Manager is disabled (looked in windows services and it is running/auto starts</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I booted into safe mode and re-installed my video card drivers (Intel HD3000)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be great as using the 16 bit icons in all of my applications is dreadful.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Update</b>, dug around the Aero Troubleshooting results and I see the following:</div>
<div>Color Setting Requirements:</div>
<div>Depth: 32 bits</div>
<div>Required: 32 bits</div>
<div>Depth: 8 bits</div>
<div>Required: 32 bits</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It looks like my "ghost" monitor is running at 8 bits, therefore preventing Aero from running.</div>
                </div>

Alright.. Figured it out.
<div>Start &gt; Device Manager &gt; Display Adapters<br />
I saw there were a few things under here, one being "Air Display Adapter".&nbsp;</div>
<div>Air Display is an application that lets you use your iPad as a second monitor.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I right-clicked it, hit "disable" and restarted. Everything is right in the world.</div>
<div>I believe the issue was the last round of Windows Updates updated my Video Card drivers and Air Display does not play nice with the updated drivers.</div>

    <title>Windows Hello Facial Recognition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sa80  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Hello Facial Recognition</h2>
                    <p>My elderly parents share a Microsoft account between them, and have done for many years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought them a Surface Pro, and would like them both to be able to logon with facial recognition, however, as far as I can tell, it is impossible to set up multiple face logons for one microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they have to set up a new, separate Microsoft account so they both can logon using facial recognition, this would mean one of them would not have access to their existing shared account (including their shared email) while logged onto the 'new' account,
 correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there no way around this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find it strange Microsoft doesn't allow mulitple faces to be assigned to accounts, I'm sure there are plenty of instances where this would be desirable, especially for teams, or simply, people who wear glasses and contact lenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like an oversight that could easily be resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I really have to set up a new account for one of my parents for multiple face recognition to work?</p>
<p />

<p>Hi William,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A Microsoft account or email address can only be used to a single or specific Xbox Live account. You can change the Microsoft account alias online and use your new email as the primary email. However, if you are going to access your Xbox Live account, you
 have to use the original email address attached to it before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information about changing your Microsoft account, you may visit <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/microsoft-account/change-email-sign-in-for-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>In changing your account information, there might be some verification process. If you will have an issue with verifying your account, you can contact Xbox Chat Support directly at this

Welcome to the Microsoft Community.</p>

<p>Let me gather some information on this issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
1) Which livebox are you using to connect to the network reader?<br />
2) To which device is the livebox connected to? </p>

Please reply with more information to help you better.</p>

            &nbsp; &nbsp;Before getting to the Livebox reader issue, I need to point out that when I clicked on "reply", I was asked to sign in with account name (with @) and password. Thereupon I was presented with "one more step" offering my private name and inviting me to
 change it. When I put "Donncadh", which was the username I chose yesterday, I was informed that it was already taken and I'd have to use a new one. I added three "x"s. But my original username is "Donncadh", and I asked the question. How can I persuade the
 Microsoft Community that I am not trying to pinch someone else's name? I tried getting there by opening my profile and question, then tried to answer. No luck, I was still refused access as Donncadh. Could this be cleared up, otherwise I need to choose a new
 username every time I try to ask a question or engage in a discussion? I am still the same person.
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; My Livebox is a (new) PRO V2 S &amp;. The Livebox is connected by cable to my desktop computer. The external hard disc is connected to the USB input on the Livebox. I checked the name of the disc to be sure I'd got it right. Still "no path" or "not recognised".</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 Boot Drive Changed - stuck in windows repair loop</h2>
                    <div>
<p>So i recently had a electricity outage at home and when i tried booting up my PC i came to the Scanning and Repair screen. As soon as it started i got a blue screen saying&nbsp;<em>BAD SYSTEM CONFIG INFO.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>So i tried once again but got blue screen again. Then again and the 4th time i got in Automatic Recovery, which hasn't worked as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then i opened up CMD in advanced diagnostics?(felsökning in swedish) And opened&nbsp;<em>Diskpart&nbsp;</em>and there i saw something was wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is how it used to look before the whole crash.&nbsp;<br />
<span>C:</span>(named Hitatchi) Was my main drive where windows and everything was installed. (950GB)</p>
<span>C:</span>(named Hitatchi) Was my main drive where windows and everything was installed. (950GB)</p>
<p><span>E:</span>&nbsp;(named Western Digital) Were and internal EXTRA drive that had some games on it but mostly adobe programs. (74gb)</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>THIS is how it looks now:</p>
<p><span>C:&nbsp;</span>(still named Hitatchi) Has the content and size of&nbsp;<span>E:</span>&nbsp;(75gb with games &amp; adobe) but still has the old label??</p>
<p><span>E:&nbsp;</span>(still named western digital) And has the content of&nbsp;<span>C:</span>&nbsp;(all my main files and&nbsp;<em>Windows Installation</em>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow the content switched/drive switched place but the pc cant notice it cause the label is still the same?</p>
<p>I've tried ONLY having the 950gb drive connected but still got blue screen, and also tried with the 74gb which of course didn't work because theres no windows installed on that drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how this happened and I'm desperate to fix it! I've got things worth 10 years of experience(I know bad to not back it up) on it :(&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(NOTE: Im currently running chkdsk E: /f /r (since old C: is now E:) and it says ETA: 3h so i'll se if this works, still appreciate help!)</p>

</p><blockquote>Hi. <br />
<br />
Try to enter Safe Mode with network network function to repair Windows.. <br />
Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC <br />
If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive
 times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />
Then you proceed to repair the computer: <br />
With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to
 default factory settings. <br />
Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again. <br />
Select Reset. <br />
If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />
After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen.
<br />
Click on Reset and the resetting should begin. <br />
<br />
Would you be so kind to say if this solved the problem? </blockquote>
<p>Well currently im waiting for the CHKDSK to finish and if it dosent work i'll try out your solutions. Tho i cant get into safe mode no matter how much i try. And also i already am i automatic repair mode, not sure if i was unclear or if you've misread. I
 don't what to reset, or at least i hope i dont have to. Windows is installed and everything seems intact. It just wont exit Automatic repair mode, also the disks' have changed changed Drive Letters so im guessing windows are confused and tries to boot of wrong
 disk? Anyhow something happened with the C drive so trying Disk Check and hoping it will solve it! I'll get back in E.T.A: 1h20min<br />
