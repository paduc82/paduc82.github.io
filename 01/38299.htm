            You need to purchase a genuine key. I don't think anyone in here would suggest otherwise (as far as activating a non-legit copy).

<h2>            Skype - new version</h2>
                    Every time I install the new version of Skype I cannot hear anything from the person I am calling. When I re-install the old version there is no problem. What do I do?

            Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Microphone 
<br />Toggle on Allow apps to access your Microphone
<br />
<br />Scroll down and make sure Skype is toggled on
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<h2>            Change lockscreen picture&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Screen pictures</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Is there any way of switching off&nbsp;the tiresome stream of different screen pictures that Microsoft keeps presenting&nbsp;us with, asking us whether we like them or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few months ago, when the first landscape picture appeared, I was given a choice of selecting "I want more" or "not a fan". Various other photos appeared, and I clicked the appropriate choice&nbsp;for those too. I assumed that eventually there would&nbsp;be some
 stability, and that photos for which I had selected "I want more" (the landscape ones) would recur, and that the ones for which I had selected "not a fan" would not. Instead, months later,&nbsp;there is a never-ending stream of random photos, with no evidence that
 the system is&nbsp;'learning' from selections that I have made. Obviously this isn't a problem as such; it's just a minor irritant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I just want Windows to supply basic functionality, not gimmicks, and I'm&nbsp;tired of returning to my computer and finding that for the 300th time I'm being presented with a random picture and being asked whether I like it or not, knowing that my answer
 will be ignored anyway.</p>

    <title>XBox 360 USB Major Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a darker prince  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBox 360 USB Major Issues</h2>
                    
<p>I have the XBox 360, and since I cannot afford a HDD, I use a USB Flash Drive. It works perfectly on both my Macbook and my Windows laptop. It even works on the XBox 360, allowing me to install Grand Theft Auto V on it. My problem
 is that the XBox sometimes doesn't want to read the USB correctly. Say I fully install GTA V, which takes roughly 45 minutes. First off, there's times when the installation will lock up, specifically at 2047/7876, causing a restart and a re-install. Then,
 when I actually finish installing and play the game for a while, I can't turn the XBox off. If I do, and I turn the game back on, it'll say that the installed data is nowhere to be found. I go to the storage section in the System settings, and while it'll
 say that the required 7.8 Gigabytes is taken up, it will show that nothing is on it. Nothing in the game folder, absolutely nothing. And this isn't just on GTA V - this also happens when I try to play Watch Dogs.</p>
<p>What is wrong with my XBox 360?</p>

<p>An over-current protection mechanism protects USB ports on the Xbox 360 to reduce the risk of damage. An over-current situation may occur if the USB device attached to the console tries to draw too much power from the USB port. In these situations, the USB
 port temporarily turns off to prevent damage. It then resets after the device is disconnected.</p>

<p>You can buy an external 1 TB HDD for 60 bucks. They're not incredibly expensive. USB Thumb drives fail very quickly. They're literally the cheapest (not in a good way) form of storage available.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t see All Users folder, can&#39;t browse there, Search - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frankymacky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t see All Users folder, can&#39;t browse there, Search won&#39;t find folder therein</h2>
                    <p>From an Windows Explorer window, I did a file search in C:/ for Spybot in order to find log files for Spybot Search and Destroy.&nbsp; Search was unable to find "c:/Users/All Users/Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy/Logs", even though I could browse to it using the text
 editor Gvim.&nbsp; So using Windows Explorer, I tried to browse to the folder "Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy", which resides within the All&nbsp; Users subfolder within the Users top-level folder.&nbsp; While I can browse to Users, I cannot see All Users.&nbsp; I set the folder option
 to show hidden files, but it has no effect.</p>
<p>Is there something I can do to make the All Users folder visible and searchable?&nbsp; What other switches can I throw to make the search more complete?&nbsp; I already clicked on the "Computer" Search icon at the bottom of the search results (the balloon says it
 searches for indexed, non-indexed, and system files).&nbsp; I don't think it's an indexing problem because I am warned that "Searches might be slow in non-indexed locations: C:\."</p>
<p>In this case, I know that Search was missing a file.&nbsp; But I'm really looking for occurances of which I do not know (and hence, for which I have to search).</p>
<p>On a slightly different vein, the search results only show the partial file path of some of the longer paths.&nbsp; The "old" XP Search facility seemed much better in this regard.&nbsp; Is there a way to get the File Search let the user determine how much of the path
 to show, as XP did?</p>
<p>&lt;...a bit later...&gt; The missed folder above seems to contain identical content as one of the found folders: "C:\ProgramData\Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy\Logs".&nbsp; There is probably some file linking happening here, which I've found to be very confusing in Windows
 7.&nbsp; If this is the only reason why the first folder was not found, then no big deal.&nbsp; How does one check if one if components of a path is actually a link?&nbsp; I mean, I can't even see "c:/Users/All Users", much less browse to "Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy" therein.&nbsp;
 In this case, I'm wondering if "c:/Users/All Users/Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy" links to "C:\ProgramData\Spybot - Search &amp; Destroy".</p>
<p>P.S. Saddened that I can't use this site with Firefox any&nbsp;longer.&nbsp; The sign-in process seems to stall.</p>

Sorry for unmarking the answer, but I think NazimRangwala has a point.&nbsp; The posting that was marked as the answer doesn't really answer the question, which is how the folder can be made visible.&nbsp; Would appreciate if anyone can chime in about that, or positively
 confirm that it is not possible.<br />

            <p>But it's probably not where you want to go.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In Windows 7, the directory corresponding to the Windows XP folder C:\Documents and Settings\All Users is C:\Users\Public<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>In Windows 7, there is no actual folder named C:\Users\All Users.&nbsp; </strong>
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you manually enter C:\Users\All Users in the Address Bar of Windows Explorer, you go to C:\ProgramData because when Windows 7 was installed, a "Symbolic Link" that causes that behavior was created for you.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To see what I'm talking about, open a Command Prompt (click the Start Orb, type "cmd.exe" (without quotes) in the Search box, and press Enter.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When you first open the Command Prompt window, the prompt normally is set to the User directory (folder) of the active user, like this:<br />

<p>You'll notice that there is one hidden "real" directory (Default).&nbsp; You can see this in Windows Explorer if you set the option to view hidden files and folders.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>"All Users" is a directory symbolic link and "Default User" is a junction.&nbsp; Both of these objects are created by Windows 7 for backwards compatibility with applications programmed for Windows XP that expect to find things in directories with those names.&nbsp;
 Essentially, both the "junction" and the "symbolic link" are pointers to another object on the hard drive, similar to the more familiar desktop shortcut.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A <em>junction</em> (also called a <em>soft link</em>) differs from a hard link [the file system representation of a file by which more than one path references a single file in the same volume] in that the storage objects it references are separate directories,
 and a junction can link directories located on different local volumes on the same computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A <em>symbolic link</em> is a file-system object that points to another file system object. The object being pointed to is called the target.</p>

    <title>bluetooth headsets poor quality when using build in microphone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rzyghul  say:</h3>
<h2>            bluetooth headsets poor quality when using build in microphone</h2>
                    there is an issue with stereo bluetooth headset with build-in microphone that is occurring only on windows. To make it short the drivers available for windows does not allow to use a builtin microphone with 2 channel sound quality. The only available drivers
 prepared by a broadcom company are prepared for hands-free telephony that is forcing 1 channel (mono) sound while using the microphone. I have tried to reach a broadcom with this question but so far did not receive any reply. So I'm asking here now. Is there
 any plan on updating drivers for stereophonic bluetooth headsets with built in microphone to work in 2 channel quality sound while using microphone? I'm asking this because on android, iOS and linux my current bluetooth headset is working without any issues
 in 2 channel sound quality with mic but under windows it is always forced to 1 channel sound quality option. It is not a big issue but because of it I have to use a seperate microphone when working on windows machine. Thanks

            The properties you're concerned about are controlled by the driver, and the driver is controlled by the hardware manufacturer, not Microsoft.

                    <p>I just bought an Acer Desktop with Intel i7 6700 with a NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX graphics card. I has windows 10. I noticed that the screen dims so I looked up how to stop it and I turned off the adaptive brightness. However, the screen still dims from time to
 time and I really dislike it. I looked at a lot of forums but I could not find a solution. Can someone please help me with this issue. Thanks</p>

<h2>            Intel management engine interface code 10 error &#40;STATUS_DEVICE_POWER_FAILURE&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp; &nbsp;I am running Windows 10 in my computer.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I tried to wake up my PC (by moving the mouse) from sleep mode,&nbsp; the PC shuts down and rebooted itself.&nbsp; &nbsp;In a normal circumstance,&nbsp; after I move the mouse,&nbsp; the PC prompted me the login screen almost
 immediately.&nbsp; &nbsp;However,&nbsp; with the issue I am facing,&nbsp; the PC rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read a number of threads about the same issue from others.&nbsp; They have tried many things and nothing seemed to resolve this issue for good.&nbsp; &nbsp;I tried one of the solution by removing the CMOS battery and reinstall.&nbsp; &nbsp;This solve the problem for me "for a
 short period of time".&nbsp; &nbsp;After a while,&nbsp; I went back to the same issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far,&nbsp; I was not able to find a permanent solution to fix this issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;At this point,&nbsp; I am not sure if this issue is related to Windows 10 update or the driver with Intel Management Engine Interface (version 11).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to Device Manager,&nbsp; I see a yellow exclamation mark besides "Intel Management Engine Interface".&nbsp; &nbsp;When I display the properties,&nbsp; It shows STATUS_DEVICE_POWER_FAILURE) code 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please shed some light on this issue ?</p>

</p><p><span>The issue could also be related to the

 but optional too. If any available try to install them and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First try to install all of the&nbsp;Windows updates available and if issue persists, try to update the Display drivers by following the steps provided in the article mentioned below.</span></p>

    <title>Powershell scripting to join computers to an Azure Domain - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powershell scripting to join computers to an Azure Domain</h2>
                    <p>Is this something that can be accomplished? I am looking for something like the local domain modules. I know that I can script to join computers to a local domain, however I have not found anything that would allow me to join a computer to Azure. We have
 computers out at sites that have recently done the upgrade that will need to be joined.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can push the script to sites via a remote monitoring software, I can just set a task for it to run, then I can fill in the required blanks and move on to the next. I figure it will reduce my clicks which kind of add up after a while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am open to any and all better solutions if anyone has better ideas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft won&#39;t let me pay for my suspended Xbox Live subscription.</h2>
                    <p>Can anybody help me out? I go to my subscription and services and it tells me that my Xbox Live subscription is suspended until I make a payment on it. It doesn't tell me that I have a balance that I owe, it just tells me that my subscription is suspended and that I need to make a payment before I can use my subscription any further. I've tried two different credit card options, both with an available balance and it tells me it'll start using the selected option to pay for my subscription but it never actually charges anything. I keep getting the same message that I need to pay for the subscription but it's like Microsoft isn't taking the payments or anything. Like I said both cards have available balances but nothing is being charged.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have three (actually 10, but I'm working with a subset of three) Toshiba Satellite S75s that won't see each other on my wifi network. The setting is a public library, and I need these to connect so we can host multiplayer Minecraft sessions here at the
 library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machines are set up with the latest Realtek wifi driver, no antivirus (uninstalled strictly for testing), Windows firewall turned off, on a private network profile with network discovery and file sharing turned on (although I get the same results with
 a public profile). They are currently on static IP addresses, but the results are the same if I use DHCP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They can see, via ping, the network gateway, the wifi access points, and three Dell laptops also on the network. They can connect to a Minecraft session hosted on one of the Dells (running Windows 10 Pro), and the Dell can connect to Minecraft on the Toshibas.
 The Toshibas cannot connect to Minecraft running on the Toshibas, nor do they respond to a ping (either host unreachable or it times out).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I start up a Wireshark capture while pinging one Toshiba from another, I see a flurry of ARP broadcasts from the host asking who owns the IP address of the computer being pinged, but I never see the ping itself (i.e., no ICMP traffic).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I set up a homegroup on one Toshiba, the others don't see it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Results are the same whether running from a basic Windows account or an administrator account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These Toshibas all worked fine with Windows 8.1. It was only with the upgrade to Windows 10 that they began to fail. Since the Dells all work fine, I'm assuming this is a problem with the Toshibas or Windows 10 Pro, but at this point I'm open to any suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Thank you for your suggestions, Jenith. I ran through the procedures you outlined yesterday, and two of the four computers I was working with started to communicate. But when I came back in this morning, they wouldn't, even after I ran through the procedures
 again. A ping just returns "Destination host unreachable."</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the NETSH INT IP RESET command, I got OKs for resetting Global, Interface, Unicast Address, Neighbor, and Path, and then there was an entry, "Resetting , failed. Access is denied.", although the final entry did say "Resetting , OK!" I don't know if that
 fail indicates anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got two different messages on separate computers from the network adapter troubleshooter: "DNS server is not responding" and "Broadband modem is experiencing connectivity issues." I don't have a broadband modem, per se, I have a Cisco ASA&nbsp;which acts as
 my firewall/Internet router and as the DHCP server for any device on the wireless segment, as these laptops are. I don't see any explicit rule on the ASA firewall blocking communications, but then I don't see one allowing them either. In any case, none of
 these computers has any problem with general Internet connectivity.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern and we will provide the assistance required to help you resolve the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>1. Are you facing any&nbsp;block drive issue due to the failed encryption?</p>
<p>2. As you have stated that you attempted Clean Install, can you explain how to got the attempting repair page?&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Were you facing any issue that lead&nbsp;you to perform Clean Install?</p>
<p>4. If yes, can you provide the information about the issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not receive any prompt or error related to&nbsp;your drive being blocked, I do not believe that the failed encryption caused the above issue.&nbsp;Also, if you faced any system issue prior to the Clean Install,
 I suspect that it might be the reason for the failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I would suggest that you try to perform the Clean Install&nbsp;through Windows&nbsp;Recovery Environment using Media Creation tool. To create the tool click on the link below</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install</span></span></a>

<h2>            Windows 10 WiFi connectivity problem_Needs restart everytime</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>I am facing a peculiar problem with my wifi connectivity in my Dell Inspiron 1520 laptop.</p>
<p>When I start my computer and connect it with my smartphone wifi, it didn’t get connect and will show “Cant connect to the network”. I have to restart my computer to connect with the same wifi. It will get connected very easily this time with the same wifi
 connection without ant hitch (This gives the impression that the laptop wifi adaptor is not having any issue).</p>
<p>This happens everytime when I start my laptop from shutdown mode. </p>
<p>Now with every laptop startup, I have to stop at login page, click the power button and make a system restart or the wifi connectivity to happen smoothly, everytime.</p>
<p>I have used the network trouble shooter and turned empty handed. </p>
<p>I have ran through the WLAN report and found the following result:</p>
