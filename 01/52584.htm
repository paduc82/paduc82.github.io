            Hi <span>KathyMo,<br />
<br />
The email you received is a phishing email. It attempts to collect information from you. This is not a legitimate Windows Live communicaton and the email should be discarded.
<br />
<br />
Windows Live does not initiate any form of communication asking for account or personal related information. Good move on being wary about this.
<br />
<br />
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just built a brand new PC. Every time I try to launch SteamVR with my HTC Vive, I receive the above error in the Event Viewer. I have tried two separate power supplies (450w; 550w) to the same effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. I am a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows Troubleshooting and hardware so we should be able to find a solution.
<br />
<br />Using too small a PSU can cause this issue. Check with the motherboard, video card, and game makers' supports for recommendations.
<br />
<br />Be sure to remove all power and reseat everything, cards, memory, and cables. Remove and replace - do not just snug.
<br />
<br />ID41 with no Bug_Check - The main cause of this issue as you have described is hardware related :                 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2028504/windows-kernel-event-id-41-error-the-system-has-rebooted-without-clean" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/202850...</a>  
<br />
<br />1. Over-Clocking -&gt; best to reset ALL to the defaults especially while troubleshooting
<br />
<br />2. Memory (check thoroughly as indicated below).
<br />
<br />3. Power Supply (see below to ensure you have enough power).
<br />
<br />4. Over-heating - even if the overall temps are with-in specs a single component can be too sensitive to even the normal levels of heat and fault at a lower temp. Try adding a fan blowing into the case to reduce the effects of heat even more than the cooler usually does. Of course ensure all built-in fans are running.
<br />
<br />====
<br />
<br />After checking determining the wattage of the power supply you will then need to check the requirements of the motherboard and devices. Usually, the video card is one of the major power users.
<br />
<br />How do I determine how big my power supply is?

<br />Other good sources of information are the device makers' sites and their forums.

<br />
<br />BCCode: 3b    0x0000003b
<br />
<br />3b is usually a graphic's driver (display adapter/video driver), other possibilities include but are not limited to antivirus/antispyware/security programs and even memory (mapping). 
<br />
<br />Try removing and reseating all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug (on a PC) and clean out the dust bunnies and vents. On a laptop about all that can be done is reseat the memory and clean the vents. (Of course  remove ALL power prior to opening the case.)
<br />
<br />====
<br />
<br />This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : 
<br />
<br />Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names (and update BIOS and chipset drivers).
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />  
<br /> or Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<br />====
<br />
<br />Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.
<br />
<br />To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.  &lt;-- best method

<br />For the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool.
<br />
<br />Type in Cortana's search box -&gt;  Windows Memory Diagnostics

            Troubleshooting a new home build can be very difficult because there are few known good parts to swap in and out. 
<br />
<br />This issue is almost always hardware.
<br />
<br />What do the makers' recommend? 330W is very small by today's standards.
<br />
<br />Did you read the ID 41 with no bug_check link at top of my first reply?
<br />
<br />Perform all the methods in those troubleshooters.
<br />.........
<br />
<br />Please double check your settings here :
<br />
<br />Start - type in --&gt; System                     find at top and click on it - on left side Advanced System Settings - Advanced tab -
<br />
<br />Startup and Recovery - Settings - System Failure - check the box to Write an Event to System Log
<br />
<br />uncheck Auto Restart 
<br />
<br />make sure the Write Debugging is set to small minidump 
<br />
<br />and the default folder should look like %SystemRoot%\Minidump.

            400 watts is the absolute minimum..... other components can raise that and especially if you over-clock anything.

<p>Hey Compact, According to the Tritton webpage for the AX 180 it is not. It lists Playstation 3 and 4 (in Europe) and the Xbox 360, no mention of the Xbox one is made.</p>

    <title>Splitting Xbox-Live from Microsoft-Account into new Microsoft-Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blacky_99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Splitting Xbox-Live from Microsoft-Account into new Microsoft-Account</h2>
                    <p>Dear community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a serious issue. A few years back i started using the Xbox-Live-Account from my best friend, because he couldn't play anymore for reasons. He still had like 6 months left of Xbox-Live-Gold, so he decided to share it with me so that Xbox-Live-Gold
 didn't expire senselessly. I played on his Xbox-Live-Account ever since. I started buying games, got gaming progress and gamepass and invested some money over the years.</p>
<p>I even put in my creditcard information to access games online and it never was a big deal. We are still close trusted friends and share a lot, this is not the problem. For example we already had to change password once, therefore i had access to his Microsoft-Account
 with all his emails and stuff, but i never abused it, or even had a glance into his private things.</p>
<p>Since it has been a long time, some things occured. For example he had to change the password because of security issues and I had to adapt this on my Xbox so that i can access the Xbox-Live-Account again. Simple things, but the question arose, if we couldnt
 skip the issue by seperating his Microsoft-Account and the Xbox-Live-Account, and add the Xbox-Live-Account to another Microsoft-Account without</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) not losing any progress or games on the Xbox-Live-Account,</p>
<p>2) not deleting the Xbox-Live-Account and</p>
<p>3) letting the Microsoft-Account, where the Xbox-Live-Account is attached, untouched. Not deleted or anything else, this is most important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be a horrible mischief if I lose all those games and progress and it would be even worse, if the Microsoft-Account got deleted. I do hope that you guys can give me a hint on what to do and even show me an appropriate solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
<p>blacky</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Hey there blacky_99, </p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case it is not possible to transfer all the data including account, games, game saves, etc. over to a new Microsoft account. Under both Xbox and Microsoft this is the same account, the only way to update the email to your personal email would be
 to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/microsoft-account/change-email-sign-in-for-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Update accounts Primary Alias</a>, However by doing this you will be deleting his old Microsoft account and all his data will be lost.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do not recommend sharing account information as this could post security risks or cause situations like this one. Unfortunately that content will remain under that account and you are unable to have it transferred to a new one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. </p>

<p>Hi Joe, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is possible that the display scale settings may have changed after the game crashed. Right click on your desktop. Choose<strong> Intel Graphics Settings</strong>. Click
<strong>Display</strong>. Make sure that you set the maximum resolution and choose
<strong>Scale Full Screen</strong>. Click <strong>Apply </strong>then <strong>Yes</strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work, force shutdown your device. </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.</li><li>
<p>
Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both.<br />
The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.</p>
</li><li>After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.</li><li>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.</li></ol>

            Hi Rachel.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) See fixes here for 100% disk usage:
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-100-disk-usage-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-100-disk-usag...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-100-percent-disk-usage-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-100-pe...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />4) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />
<br />Please do not mark "No" to the popup asking if this post helped you, as it may remove my ability to help you further.  Just ignore it until problem is solved and then please mark the post which helped most as Answer to help others..

<h3> davidrogers2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow running Acer Aspire laptop</h2>
                    <p>Why does my Acer laptop consistently run at 100% disk usage and more than 80% memory for ages after it's started up?
</p>
<p>I swapped to using the Google Chrome web-browser because I was advised that the Firefox I was using was causing the problem. However, now I have swapped it seems exactly the same with google?! Help please?</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, a 100 percent disk usage indicates that the computer is performing such task needed like scanning an antivirus. Can you give us a screenshot of your Task Manager?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, kindly follow these steps:</p>
<p>Method 1. Run Windows Defender. A virus or malware could be the main cause of the 100 percent disk usage.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Delete temporary files. You may refer to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026616/windows-disk-cleanup-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3: Reset Virtual Memory. <span>Virtual memory is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive. "When the RAM isn’t enough to perform a task, Windows will temporarily store files in virtual memory, then swap them back to RAM when required."
 To do this, </span><span>kindly follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1.<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>Press<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Windows key + Pause/ Break key</strong><span>
</span>and then select Advanced System Settings on the left panel.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.easeus.com%2fimages%2fen%2fscreenshot%2fpatition-manager%2freset-virtual-memory-1.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 2.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Go to the Advanced tab, then click Settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.easeus.com%2fimages%2fen%2fscreenshot%2fpatition-manager%2freset-virtual-memory-2.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 3.</strong><span> </span>Click the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Advanced tab<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>again, and then choose Change in the Virtual memory section.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.easeus.com%2fimages%2fen%2fscreenshot%2fpatition-manager%2freset-virtual-memory-3.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 4.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span> Ensure that the Automatically manage paging file size for all drives check box is NOT ticked.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.easeus.com%2fimages%2fen%2fscreenshot%2fpatition-manager%2freset-virtual-memory-4.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Step 5.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Select your windows drive (the hard drive or partition that has Windows installed on it – usually C:), and enter an Initial size and Maximum size for your virtual memory:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.easeus.com%2fimages%2fen%2fscreenshot%2fpatition-manager%2freset-virtual-memory-5.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial size:&nbsp;</strong>This value varies, depending on your computer. If you’re not sure what value to use, just enter whatever the number is in the Recommended category.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Maximum size:&nbsp;</strong>Don’t set this value too high. It should be about 1.5 times the size of your physical RAM. e.g. A PC with 4 GB (4096 MB) of RAM should have no more than about 6,144 MB virtual memory (4096 MB x 1.5).</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once you’ve entered your virtual memory values, click Set, then click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>OK</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to continue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of these work, we recommend that you backup your files and then perform a clean install. You may refer to this

<p>Yes I did that on the first day I owned this computer and Windows 10.&nbsp; It seemed the logical place but it's not there.&nbsp; Here is what I have showing in Outlook mail:</p>
<p>#1 is "Outbox" and it says, "We didn't find anything to show here"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also used the search above this option to try to find junk.&nbsp; "No results found"&nbsp;</p>
<p>#2 is "Inbox"</p>
<p>This is followed by all of the Folders and those are the ones I had on Windows 7 and nothing in them leads to a junk function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a sync function that's missing or something I haven't done, please advise. Thank you again.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7&#39;s Media Player won&#39;t let me save MP3 files on my computer</h2>
                    I am trying to download mp3 files onto my pc (Windows 7 ftw)&nbsp;from the internet, just sound effects for a Flash game<br />
<br />
When i attempt to download an mp3, Windows Media&nbsp;Player opens, the song loads, and plays<br />
<br />
I then try to save the mp3 onto my computer, this is where things start going bad, i added my sounds into a playlist but after about an hour i can not find a single way to save the songs in mp3 format anywhere on my computer so i can import them to flash<br />
<br />
I hope i do not need to uninstall Media&nbsp;Player but i will if i have to, anybody have a suggestion?<br />
<br />
Edit: I cant even play the sounds when im not online because they are saved on the internet, Windows 7 cant download music??? wtf Microsoft???

            Hi Project 154,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft Windows Forum.<br />
<br />
When you are trying to download songs from the Internet, try right clicking on the song to be downloaded instead of double clicking on it and select
<strong>"Save target as"</strong> and save it to the destination of your choice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<h2>            Clear Defrag History</h2>
                    
<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I recently built a new system with an SSD in it. I was in Disk Defragmenter and hit analyze on my SSD just to see what it would say. I did not defrag it and I understand you do not defrag SSD's. I was simply curious.</p>
<p>Now it shows as 7% fragmented. Is there a way to completely wipe the 'Last Run' history for&nbsp;Disk Defragmenter? I've cleared all event logs and it has not helped.</p>
<p>Where is this data stored?</p>

<p>It's stored in the Registry at this path:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SOFTWARE \ Microsoft \ Dfrg \ Statistics</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can delete the volume key (the folder) for the drive that you no longer wish to show statistics. &nbsp;As with any change involving the registry, you should make a backup first. &nbsp;I'd also recommend taking a few seconds to make a quick System Restore point,
 just in case, before making any change in the registry.</p>

    <title>USB Ports Not Working In Windows 7 Home Premium - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB Ports  Not  Working In Windows 7 Home Premium</h2>
                    Dear Microsoft Support&nbsp; Forum,&nbsp;
<p>One of my USB 2.0 flash drive, Geek Squad 8 GB, is not recognized by Windows 7 most of the time. You hear a little beep sound always when the usb device is inserted in a port. Sometimes the device shows up in 'computer' but most
 of the time it does not. This same flash drive seems to always work in a Compaq desktop with Windows 7, Compaq desktop with XP pro, and a Toshiba laptop with XP Home. Have deleted items and drivers under Universal Serial Bus Controller in Device Manager and
 rebooted computer to reinstall them per Acer instructions. This helped the issue for most of one day and&nbsp; then it returned. Then used Microsoft diagnostic tool for Windows 7. It detected a driver problem with USB devices and corrected the problem. The USB
 devices worked for a day or two and then quit working. Computer is an Acer Aspire Laptop 7740 , Intel i3 processor 330M, 4 GB ram, Intel Graphics Media Accelerator HD. Running Windows 7 Home Premium. Acer online technical support wants me to reinstall Windows
 7 from the recovery dics but I do not believe this is the answer. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you,</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Use the USB devices in a clean boot state and see if any third party applications are interfering with the normal performance of the computer.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply Scott,</p>
<p>The clean boot did not seem to change/show-up anything that is causing an issue. Following the procedure and eliminating half the programs to start did not show that any one item or group of items helped the flash drive show up.
 At the end of the testing when all programs where eliminated again just a for check still only one port most of the time recognized this one particular usb flash drive. The only program I was not able to stop was McAfee real time scanner. Several times I clicked
 to clear the check in the box next to the scanner but the check would reappear. Almost did an uninstall of McAfee, actually probably will do this soon anyway. One thing I have noticed is if this flash drive in a usb port when the computer boots up then the
 flash drive gets recognized. Also, while running through the test procedure if I plugged in a usb mouse then that changed which one port would recognize the flash drive. Probably not significant. If you have any further suggestions I would be grateful to hear
 them and will be glad to give any idea a try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

            This seems to be a compatibility problem between Win7 and the Geek Squad flash drives. The workaround is to plug in the drive, then go to Device Manager, under Universal Serial Bus controllers, there will be an entry called "USB Mass Storage Device" with
 a warning (!) on it. Right click this device and select "Disable", then right click and "Enable" it. The flash drive will now be recognized by windows until you remove and reinsert it.<br />

            <p>it's not just these drives!</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have a top of the line Acer Aspire 8943G with windows 7 home premium (what a joke!). &nbsp;Out of nowhere all my USB ports have decided not to work to all external drives. &nbsp;I have a brand new 2T Transcend portable drive and a Kingston Usb drive and flash voyager
 USB drive, all of which are plug &amp; play drives and work with every other machine in the world except this one. &nbsp;This machine even keeps failing to install all its own window updates and now with this USB problem it's become a very expensive piece of plastic
 that doesn't do anything useful except be used as an internet browser. I have never in my life had this many problems with a computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all kinds of of instructions for installing the drivers, something keeps blocking the updates. &nbsp;Short of uninstalling my norton internet security (the new version does not give you the option of temporarily switching it off) another anoyance!
 &nbsp;I don't know what to do. &nbsp;I may have to re-install the whole machine as the USB's use to work before. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is windows 7 so utterly NOT fit for purpose? &nbsp;it's a ridiculous piece of software.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Both my wife and I have Apple CinemaDisplays and they both have <em>recently </em>
begun to dim and brighten on their own. This doesn't occur until after logging into Windows 10. At some point—after logging in—the monitors begin to dim and brighten on their own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the physical brightness controls buttons (for the monitors) are used, there is something happening that fights the use of these buttons (i.e. as the brightness is increased, the levels keep going back down as the brightness is turned up. Eventually
 the monitor returns to it's darkest state on its own, then it will <em>sometimes
</em>begin to brighten again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue does not occur when hooked up to our Macs, or when we were on Win7. It began with a recent Win10 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to give the <em>Nvidia Control Panel </em>full control of the monitor, and though it can adjust the settings, it doesn't lock out whatever is causing this randomness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could have happened due to several reasons like an outdated driver to your Windows 10. We suggest that you
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/ad5a063e-5f57-c715-2566-b983195752c1/update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
update your drivers on your Windows 10</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the error still occurs, we suggest that you run the System File Checker tool and the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool to scan and correct any issues. System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in tool in the operating system. SFC checks for system
 file corruption. Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) is a command-line tool that can be used to service a Windows image or to prepare a Windows Preinstallation Environment image.<br />

<p>(I have no solution, but would love to have one)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This started happening after updating my intel driver (so it is the latest).&nbsp; So I'm starting to think whatever causes this gets reset whenever a driver is updated.&nbsp; This is an Intel NUC Skull Canyon with integrated intel video.&nbsp; This was not happening until
 yesterday when I updated my bios and a bunch of drivers.&nbsp; I had a windows 10 system at work last year that was constantly dimming the display, even though all dimming settings on the monitor and system were disabled.&nbsp; It dims while not using a bright program,
 as soon as I bring a bright program to the foreground (like this browser) the screen brightens.&nbsp; (I would think this would be the opposite of desired behavior, that is when a white window comes forward you suddenly get blinded by the increased brightness.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a setting about setting brightness adaptively based on background image; I think that fixed my work computer.... but I can't find that setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>went though each adaptive brightness power setting and set it to yes and then back to no, just in case it was like totally unset and confused... still have the problem.</p>

<p>Can you verify if your monitor has a light sensor? It's usually located at the bottom frame of the monitor. If you have it, please adjust the brightness accordingly as the light sensor automatically adjusts the brightness of the screen depending on the light
 level of the surroundings.</p>

<p><span>Apple QuickTime and Windows Media player both use this port for their services.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 freezes when accessing Internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jlwrexham  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 freezes when accessing Internet</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows 8.1 freezing</p>
<p>I hated Windows 8, the irritating Chalms&nbsp;etc&nbsp;so was delighted at the prospect of 8.1 addressing some issues. The problem now is that my computer keeps freezing when I am on the internet. My computer is noticeably slower since I installed&nbsp; 8.1.
<strong>Can I uninstall Windows 8.1 / roll the clock back to the awful Windows 8... which doesn't freeze?</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>JL</p>

            <p>Hi JL,<br />
</p>
<p>1. Are you using a wired or a wireless network?</p>
<p>2. What is the make and model of the PC?</p>
<p>3. Do you face this issue when accessing Internet via a specific web browser?</p>
<p><br />
Follow these methods and check if it helps.<br />
<strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong>Run System Maintenance troubleshooter.<br />
a. From Start screen, type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.<br />
b. Now, click on <strong>View all</strong>.<br />
c. Choose System Maintenance and follow the onscreen instruction.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Method 2: <br />

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2681286/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2681286/en-us</a><br />

<h2>            Vista upgrade from XP crashed, had to clean install, upgrade key not good for clean install.</h2>
                    I originally had had XP SP3. Because support will end soon, I purchased Vista Home Premium upgrade DVD with a product key. All was well until my system totally crashed. I had to clean install Vista, and upgrade key won't work for clean install product
 activation. I have 29 days left after clean install, and I need a new product key. What do I do?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Reinstall XP &gt; then do the Vista&nbsp;Upgrade.</p>
<p>You need XP to be reinstalled as the Vista Upgrade needs a&nbsp;legit OS to&nbsp;be recognized to Upgrade from.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            HP scan and capture</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have installed the HP scan and capture app but when I start it , it says no device selected . When I try to manually&nbsp;find the printer&nbsp;that is connected&nbsp;via USB&nbsp;, an HP Deskjet&nbsp;3050 j 610, it does not find it .</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However I know the Surface can see the printer because I can print from it, and even scan it from it using what seems to be a pre-installed 'scan' app. However that app only scans 1 page at a time so&nbsp; 10 page&nbsp;doc would have to be scanned into 10 separate
 docs. Also it does not offer a PDF output.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The original disc for the printer pre-dates Windows 8.... is this likely to be the problem for the scanning&nbsp;even tho it prints ok? Or is more fundamentally to&nbsp;do with finding the device.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have switched the printer off and on again whilst connected etc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
