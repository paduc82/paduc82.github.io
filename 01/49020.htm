<h2>            &#34;How to right click&#34; Windows tile to  select it when using a touch screen &#40;metro interface-win RT&#47;v8&#41;&#59; no mouse.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to perform a "right mouse click" equivalent function when using just your fingers on the metro touch screen interface?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details:</p>
<p>I have been trying to make the big tiles smaller (metro interface)&nbsp;using the touch screen on my tablet. I have an ASUS VivoTab windows&nbsp;RT/v8.&nbsp;&nbsp;With windows 8 and a mouse, one could right click the tile to select it.&nbsp; Then there was a pop-up at the bottom
 of the touch screen where you could make the tile smaller and do other things with the tile. (Another example is right clicking computer in file explorer, then select&nbsp;manage or properties-I just end up going to the desktop when using file explorer). I have
 found a way to perform many of the functions that I used to "right click" with a mouse, using just my fingers and the touch screen, with menus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above is a specific example where a "Right click" function on a touch screen would be beneficial. Can anyone let me know how to perform the "right click" function when using the windows /rt v8) metro touch screen interface, using only my fingers and
 the touch screen keyboard</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try single Tapping the tile or double tapping it, the application associated with the tile opens. I've tried every variation that I can think of i.e. tapping individual corners of the tile, individual corners of the touch screen; individual sides
 of the touch screen display&nbsp;etc.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using just&nbsp;my fingers or a stylus only, &nbsp;I have been able to group the tiles; move a tile to a new location; make all of the tiles on my display very small, but I can't make an individual large tile smaller without using a mouse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>regards,</p>
<p>steve</p>

            <p>Have you tried moving tiles around by pressing and holding down on them?&nbsp; If they do move, you could check to see if you can recalibrate the screen or see if there are sensitivity settings.&nbsp; I have my RT stowed at the moment and don't have it around to experiment
 with it to see if you can.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may have a problem with ASUS support and best to see if you can get it to work and contact them only as a last resort.&nbsp; I have had issues with them with laptops and others here on the forum got gaffed off by them.&nbsp; Good luck if you do contact them when
 needed.</p>

<h2>            Dell Colour Printer 725 will not work with Windows 7</h2>
                    I have the printer connected to my new laptop which has Windows 7. The appropriate driver is installed for the printer onto my laptop. It will not print however. It says there is a problem with the current printer set up. The printer works fine with my
 old laptop. There is nothing wrong with the printer. The printer driver is shared with the home group and is up to date. There is simply a problem with the printer and its configuration with the laptop which is not being picked up by troubleshoot.

The drivers are included in Windows 7 but have you followed the recommended procedure to install and troubleshoot&nbsp;the printer?

            how do you download the driver for a dell 725 colour printer? the dell website is as clear as mud.&nbsp;i understand from the recommended procedure that it has to be downloaded for windows vista even though its for windows 7 but i cant see from this page:
<a href="http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/driverslist.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;ServiceTag=71Q11K1&amp;SystemID=inspiron1545&amp;os=WLH&amp;osl=en&amp;catid=&amp;impid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            The page you quote is for your system which has nothing to do with any printer you may have.<br />
<br />
The 32-bit printer driver is included in 32-bit Windows 7 and does not need to be downloaded.<br />
<br />

            I tried installing the driver following the above instructions and got this window at the end of it:<br />
<br />
Windows Script Host<br />
Script: C:\Drivers\printer\725\dlcfEN.vbs<br />
Line: 7 <br />
Char: 2<br />
Error: Permission Denied<br />
Code: 800A0046<br />
Source: Microsoft VBScript runtime error<br />
<br />
Still no luck!<br />
<br />
I have previously installed the printer driver by connecting the printer USB cable and checking for windows 7 updates and installing the driver that way. The driver installs ok, the printer is set as the laptops&nbsp;default printer and everything seems to be fine
 but there is a error message when it comes to actually printing.

    <title>unauthorized access investigation taking way too long - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blacklabel3  say:</h3>
<h2>            unauthorized access investigation taking way too long</h2>
                    
<p>I'm over 50 days of my unauthorized access investigation. I originally submitted the issue to the support team and was told 25 days. It's well over that now. The account was fraudulently charged a couple times and migrated to Russia. I received one email
 with a 30 day gold code and a notice that the investigation was taking a little extra time. I'm pretty sure they've have enough time to sort this mess out by now. Every time I call they can't really tell me what's going on. They can't even tell me for certain
 if I'm going to get the account back. I just keep getting told a story that they're working it and it shouldn't be much longer, sorry for the delay, the the appropriate people have been made aware of the delay and all that mess. I'm starting to wonder how
 much longer I'm going to have to wait or if I'm even going to get the account back at all! I have pre-ordered Battlefield 3 and it's been out for a day, I'd like to play that. I've had Forza 4 since release and haven't played it yet. I don't want to start
 playing on a temporary account just to lose all my progress in a game when and if I get my main account back to start playing on it. Not to mention all of my DLC is on my main account that's locked up in the investigation. I don't want to have to split my
 saved games and download content between two separate accounts. It would be really nice to know what is actually going on with the account. I'm getting sick of waiting patiently. I'm pretty sure I've waited patiently long enough for this. I either want my
 account back now or I'm going to start demanding that I get credited for my all my lost DLC onto another account. This is getting stupid.</p>

<p>Something else. My bank refunded my money a long time ago. The issue is just about getting my account back to me. I actually have the account in my control and have since this happened. I reset the password before the people that got into the account had
 a chance to do it. I caught the situation as it was happening. I just can't play on xbox live with the account because the investigation team suspended the access to live the and my dashboard is impossible to navigate because it's covered with Russian.</p>

<p>Same problem here. It's been since September 4th. Hell the name on this account is still wrong. REALLY getting irritated. I didn't even have a credit card on the account, only live points. Every time I call up they say the same thing, and it shouldn't be
 taking this long especially since there was no credit card on the account. </p>

<p>I wish statistics on how many people this is happening to comes to light, I imagine its a ton. One article in June or July said 50,000+, now some articles about hacking for FIFA, and then the others like mine which are completely unrelated to anything. I
 had 4000+ points on the account, stopped playing in spring when the weather got nice, went to fire it up on a rainy day in September, and found it not working. &nbsp;If this was more public, &nbsp;maybe they would take more of an immediate response to fix it. This needs
 some serious press, like the PS3 incidents. </p>

<p>Well I was apparently wrong about my bank refunding my money. Just this evening they've taken the money refunded back from me. I guess because they haven't been able to get the case sorted out with the investigation team at xbox live that it was actually
 unauthorized and not me trying to scam them. So now I'm out of $130 some dollars and a xbox live account. I was annoyed before. Now I'm just kinda pissed off.</p>

<p>Hello SubejoPangestu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is possible that the system file got corrupted hence, we are having issues accessing the VPN settings in Windows 10. To assist you with your concern, I would suggest that we run the
<strong>Deployment&nbsp; Image Servicing and Management (DISM) </strong>and <strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong> to scan and fix corrupted system files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how to run the
<strong>DISM</strong> and the <strong>SFC</strong> scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the outcome.</p>
<p>

<h2>            SFB Conferencing Add-On</h2>
                    On the Microsoft website the price to add PTSN conferencing shows $4.00 per user per month, but the price list for MPSA Level D pricing lists the pricing higher. Are their additional minutes associated with the volume licensing option? What is the reason
 for the price difference?

    <title>Remove unnecessary language layout - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rosalie paul  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remove unnecessary language layout</h2>
                    Good day. In general I installed Windows 10 one more time and ran into the fact that I have two English languages, none of which I cannot remove.<br />
One of them is British English (apparently chosen by the default system), and the second is Irish, possibly because of my physical location.

            Hi Rosalie, if you are running version 1803, there is a known bug in the 1803 version of Windows 10. Microsoft are aware of this issue and hopefully are working on a patch . . . 
<br />
<br />For the moment, please try this workaround to set your preferred input language:
<br />
<br />Right click your Start Button, choose Powershell (admin) 
<br />
<br />Run this command to get a list of installed languages on your PC 
<br />
<br />Get-WinUserLanguageList 
<br />
<br />Note down the LanguageTag of your preferred language 
<br />
<br />If say, your preferred language is US English, run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />$1 = New-WinUserLanguageList en-US 
<br />
<br />Then run this command to set the order of installed input languages 
<br />
<br />Set-WinUserLanguageList $1 
<br />
<br />Close Powershell and restart your PC       
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            If you add a secondary language to Windows 10 version 1803 that shares the same base language as the Windows display language, neither language can be removed.
<br />
<br />For example: If English (United Kingdom) is the current Windows display language, and you then add English (India) to the Preferred languages list, afterwards neither English (United Kingdom) nor English (India) can be removed from the Preferred languages list.
<br />
<br />Note: The most notable effect of having multiple related languages in the Preferred languages list is additional entries in the text input selector. You can remove unwanted language list entries using these steps:
<br />
<br />1. From the Start menu, search for powershell.
<br />
<br />2. Right-click Windows Powershell in the search results and choose Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Type or copy/paste the following command at the command prompt, and then press Enter. 
<br />
<br />Get-WinUserLanguageList
<br />
<br />After typing this command, make note of the “LanguageTag” listed for the language you wish to remove, as you will need it in the next step.
<br />
<br />4.  Type or copy/paste each of the following commands at the command prompt, and then press Enter. In the following commands, instead of typing &lt;languagecode&gt;, replace it with the language tag you wish to remove, such as en-in for English (India).
<br />
<br />$LangList = Get-WinUserLanguageList
<br />$MarkedLang = $LangList | where LanguageTag -eq "&lt;languagecode&gt;"
<br />$LangList.Remove($MarkedLang)
<br />
<br />Set-WinUserLanguageList $LangList -Force

            Hi Rosalie, if you add an additional language for Windows 10 version 1803, which uses the same basic language as the display language of the Windows operating system, then no language can be removed.
<br />For example: if English (UK) is the current Windows display language, and then English (India) has been added to the list of preferred languages, then neither English (UK) nor English (India) can be removed from the list of preferred languages.
<br />
<br />Note: The most noticeable effect of having several similar languages ​​in the list of preferred languages ​​are additional languages ​​in the language tab on the taskbar. You can delete unnecessary entries in the list of languages ​​using the following steps:
<br />
<br />1. Using the search tool find Powershell
<br />2. Right-click on Windows Powershell, run the program as administrator.
<br />Enter the command Get-WinUserLanguageList + Enter:
<br />
<br />After entering this command, copy and write down the "icon" of the language you want to delete (for example, en-in for English (India)
<br />
<br />4. Then alternately enter the following commands + Enter, replacing the line &lt;languagecode&gt; with the "icon" of the language from item 3 (en-in in the example) below, the language code should be in quotes:
<br />
<br />$LangList = Get-WinUserLanguageList
<br />$MarkedLang = $LangList | where LanguageTag -eq "&lt;languagecode&gt;"
<br />$LangList.Remove($MarkedLang)
<br />Set-WinUserLanguageList $LangList -Force
<br />
<br />5. Check the result
<br />Example:
<br />
<br />$LangList = Get-WinUserLanguageList
<br />$MarkedLang = $LangList | where LanguageTag -eq "zh-Hans-CN"
<br />$LangList.Remove($MarkedLang)
<br />Set-WinUserLanguageList $LangList -Force

<h2>            When I call certain people the calls do not go through.</h2>
                    When I call certain people the calls do not go through. They can call me, but I can't call them.&nbsp; However, there are many other people that I can call.&nbsp; Any idea why this is happening?

<p><span>What’s the Skype version that you’re using? Is this a Skype-to-Skype calls or calls to mobiles/landlines?

<h2>            405 - HTTP verb used to access this page is not allowed</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since a few days I have problems with one of my most used websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible to log in to the site. Normally there is possibility to "personalize" the site.
</p>
<p>And that's where it goes wrong. The site is abandoned and a message appears: "405 - HTTP verb used to access this page is not allowed.<br />
The page you are looking for can not be displayed because an invalid method (HTTP verb) was used to attempt access. "</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went looking for solutions for the message "405 - HTTP ...." but what can be found is for earlier years: 2008, 2010, 2012.
</p>
<p>Nothing for the recent time and not for Windows 10. Unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help or advise me so I can again use the website in full?<br />
Thanks for it already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>El.</p>

    <title>Recovering 360 account on Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> license2chill93  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovering 360 account on Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>So I got my Xbox One in June of last year, and at the time was a bit confused as to how to link my 360 account to xbox one and use it so I just made a new account. I now want to gain access to my old 360 account on the One so I can download some games I bought on the 360 account to my Xbox one account, but I have no idea how to log into the account. I went to "sign in" and I only get options to make new accounts on the One, not sign into my old 360 account. I looked up the 360 account from the One and it's still active so it hasn't been deactivated. Can someone help me here? I don't remember any of the login info for the account&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 1: Disconnect all external devices except mouse and keyboard and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 2: Perform a Startup repair using Windows Installation disk and check if it helps.</span></p>

            checked , they're fine. a clean install is what i had in mind but it wont read the install disc. it wont read most anything. turns it some then looks away i guess. repeats the repair process with no option to recover. is there a boot virus ?&nbsp;

<h2>            Is there any way to check how many licenses my Windows 7 Product key has left on it&#63;</h2>
                    I bought a genuine copy of windows a month ago where the retailer claims it has three licenses for three PCs. It only came with a product key, install disk and a windows manual (No other packaging) so i cannot see anywhere where it says it might be a family
 edition.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It would be useful if there was any way I could find out online how many licenses my product key has left on it, it would save me buying another copy of windows!</div>

            sounds like your retailer gave you misinformation. The only 3 license of windows is the family pack upgrade. It is clearly stated on the package.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>does it look like this?</div>

<div><br />
<div>If that is not what you have it is only valid for one install.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sounds more like you purchased an OEM system builders license.</div>

            <p>You were probably sold a counterfeit.the only ever -PC license for Windows 7 was the Family Pack upgrade, which was discontinued some time ago -&nbsp; complete with two diisks and a fancy box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please post an MGADiag report of one of the systems it's installed on.</p>
<p>To properly analyse and solve problems with Activation and Validation, we need to see a full copy of the report produced by the MGADiag tool
<br />
(download and save to desktop - <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012</a> )<br />
&nbsp;Once saved, run the tool. <br />
Click on the Continue button, which will produce the report.<br />
&nbsp;To copy the report to your response, click on the Copy button in the tool (ignore any error messages at this point), and then paste (using either r-click/Paste, or Ctrl+V ) into your response.<br />
&nbsp; - **in your own thread**, please</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't have it installed yet - try telephoning the Activation Center, and asking them to tell you the following about the Key you have.</p>
<p>1) Has it been activated - ever?</p>
<p>2) Is it an Update or Full License?</p>
<p>3) is it an MSDN Key? (or TechNet or BizSpark type)</p>
<p>If the answer to </p>
<p>1 is yes - return it</p>
<p>2 is&nbsp;Full - return it - it's counterfeit</p>
<p>3 is Yes - return it - it's a Subscription Key which WILL be blocked sooner or later.</p>

            <p>You can't check the amount of licenses, but as noted, its possible you were sold a system builder license which is only allotted one install.
</p>
<p>If you need additional licenses, you will need to buy it:</p>

            I paid about 59.99 which i thought was cheap at the time but the seller had many many positive reviews and my product has activated&nbsp;successfully.&nbsp;
<div>I know that you can get OEM versions for a similar price but im sure its not that.</div>

<div>It came with a certificate of authentication on the side so im fairly sure its genuine.</div>

            It did come with two disks (But i know all non OEM versions come with two disks)
<div>Ive already activated the software. Its not that i have any issues with activation or validation because all that has been achieved succesfully! Im more just curious as to how many licenses it has. Its most likely that the seller was incorrect in telling
 me how many licenses the product has, (It only has one product key).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Ive tried running that tool but nothing happends, i get the usual "do you want to run" dialog box to which i select run but then i get nothing.</div>

<div>Im not really interested in calling the activation&nbsp;centre, i don't really want to have to pay to get this question answered i was just curious. Thankyou</div>

Most activation centers have a freefone number - so you don't even have to pay for the call.

It would be "sad to say," but you have most likely fallen prey and have received a counterfeit version. &nbsp;&nbsp; Any web site that have "sellers" with "reviews" can be suspect.&nbsp;

    <title>unable to boot into windows 8 after installing windows 10 in separate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisbaber  say:</h3>
<h2>            unable to boot into windows 8 after installing windows 10 in separate partition</h2>
                    <p>I tried to install Windows 10 onto a separate partition from my windows 8 install.&nbsp; It failed, telling me it could not be installed on a partition that was not GPT.&nbsp; After some research, I used Active Partition Manager to convert the drive from MBR to GPT,
 which caused the computer to reboot, but was not actually able to boot.&nbsp; I suspect it killed the MBR.&nbsp; I was able, however, to get into the BIOS and set the boot order to boot off the USB drive first, and with that was able to install Windows 10.&nbsp; This time
 it did not warn me about GPT, so the conversion must have gotten that part right/fixed/updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, now I've got Windows 10 installed in the other partition, but I still cannot boot into Windows 8.&nbsp; I have tried a tool (DualBootRepair)&nbsp;to repair the boot record, but it's not working either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect this is all because the Windows 8 MBR is now on a separate partition to the Windows 10 partition.&nbsp; I have 3 small partitions on this drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>One has a drive letter assigned and says </p>
<p>System Reserved (D:\)</p>
<p>100 MB NTFS</p>
<p>Healthy (Primary Partition)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next one says</p>
<p>450 MB</p>
<p>Healthy (Recovery Partition)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next one says</p>
<p>100 MB</p>
<p>Healthy (EFI System Partition)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect I can/should delete at least one of these, then use the tool again to rebuild the boot records onto just one of the partitions, so that I get the ability to dual boot back.&nbsp; But, it could obviously mess things up worse if I do it wrong, so I'm
 looking for help in how to proceed to get things consolidated and regain the ability to boot back into my Windows 8 install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any help in getting this fixed!</p>

            I ended up downloading and running EasyBCD 2.3 and even though it warned me that my system was running in EFI mode and it might not work, it did work to restore the bootloader for Windows 8.1, and now I'm once again able to dual boot into both versions.<br />

<h3> bora basaran  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing motherboard and CPU - Do I need to reinstall Win10 or can I just reactivate it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a prebuilt PC that came with an OEM licenced Win8.1. I've since used the upgrade to Win10. I've been gradually upgrading the hardware and it's time to change the CPU and the motherboard to Skylake and socket 1151. The only parts that have been there
 from the start will be the DVD drive and the HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand it, a motherboard change will invalidate my Windows license and I will need to buy a new copy. I'm fine with this. My question is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the HDD will not be replaced, it will still be containing all the files and settings from the old Win10. When I buy a new license, do I need to do a clean install, deleting all the data and settings, or can I just enter the new product key into a box
 and continue using the old install?</p>

            You probably won't be able to boot up (although it MAY work if the chipset is similar enough or you SYSPREP'd before changing motherboard and SHUT DOWN) - but if you can, changing the product key will LIKELY work.

            Hi Guy.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Install the full software package from the printer's Support Downloads web page.  
<br />
<br />Then open the Printer Settings, look for setting to print Greyscale or Black and White.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Greg, thank you very much fixed the issue. I also have a similar problem with a HP Envy 5530, but it won't print in colour. Would you recommend finding the relevant updates again?

            Reinstalled all updates, but no luck. In Advanced Document Setting Grayscale is set to Off, but still prints in Black &amp; White. Also when printing a Word document in the Document Properties section there is nowhere to change the colour setting

<h2>            stuck at windows splash AND windows repair disk won&#39;t proceed</h2>
                    Hi everyone,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's my problem. I am using dual boot, Win7 and Ubuntu at the moment. Both OS are working fine until last Sunday. When I boot into win 7, it got stuck at the splash screen. I've waited for hours but nothing happened. So I logged into the ubuntu to do
 some stuff I found in some troubleshooting win 7 threads. Then I booted to win7 again, this time, it managed to get past the splash and proceeded to check disk and no errors were found. It restarted but to my dismay, it got stuck again at splash. Next, I tried
 entering into safe mode, but I can't because it stops at aswrvrt.sys. No amount of waiting can make it continue. What happens when I choose "last known good config" is it goes to the win desktop screen (blue background?) and stops there. Again, no amount of
 waiting will make it proceed. This is the farthest point I can get.</div>
<div>&nbsp;I've resorted to using disc repair. I still have the "repair/installation CD" provided by the laptop company. I booted from cd/dvd. I chose english, clicked "repair blah". Waited for some time. then it prompted me to choose the partition to be repaired
 or to use the image I created previously. However, I could not press next because the window becomes busy so I could not click on anything. I used two DVD/CD drive to rule out the possible error coming from defective drive. I also burned the repair disc using
 "create repair disc" and a .iso repair from the internet. I used them and the farthest point I could get is the selection of language.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't know what kind of troubleshooting should be done anymore. I think I've read relevant threads to repair this but unfortunately these were either not effective in my case or inadequately answered. I thought the best tool to address this was the repair
 disc but, apparently, it failed. What is wrong with my laptop?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm using Win 7 Home Basic 64 Bit Samsung netbook. 4GB RAM, 1TB HD. Btw, I can (of course) access all my files in win using Ubuntu so I already copied important files. Please help.</div>

            Hi Geethu! Thank you for your answer. However, as I've mentioned, I could not get through step 5 when using repair disk. &nbsp;After selecting the language, it will proceed to the windows 7 desktop background until a window shows the partition desired to be
 repaired. My problem is that I could not click on the next button because the system is busy, indicated by the busy cursor. Even after waiting for &nbsp;hours, it stays like that. Therefore, I could not proceed to the command prompt.

Instead of using a possibly faulty repair CD on different machines, you should burn a new Repair CD on some other machine.

            <blockquote>That's actually what I did. I burned repair disks from two different computers.&nbsp;

Trouble-shooting is often a process of splitting the task into small steps until you know which one fails. In your case I would now do this:
<div>
<ol>
<li>Create a System Restore point on a healthy machine.</li><li>Boot this machine with your Windows Repair CD.</li><li>Select System Restore.</li><li>Check if you can see the restore point from Step 1.</li></ol>
<div>If this does not work then there is something wrong with your repair CD.</div>
<div>If it works then the repair CD is unable to cope with your problem PC. My next step would now be to replace its hard disk with a spare hard disk, then try to get into repair mode by booting the machine with the repair disk.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If this works then the repair disk is unable to cope with your problem disk.</div>
<div>If it does not work then the repair disk is unable to cope with the problem PC. In this case I would get the machine serviced.</div>

            <p>OK, let's get back to basics. I assume, at this point, that there's no real reason to keep the contents of the disk. Windows is messed up, and Ubuntu seems to also have problems. I would back up any critical data, boot up on something like Parted Magic or
 Acronis Disk Director, and strip the disk. Split the disk in half, and set up two equal partitions on the disk. When both are set up, delete the first, leaving the beginning of the disk unallocated. Install Windows in that first partition, set it up, and activate
 it (although that's not strictly necessary at this point). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Win 7 is set up and running,&nbsp;start the Ubuntu installation, use it to delete the second partition and install itself there, using it's defaults unless you are a heck of a lot smarter than I am. Ubuntu will set itself up, then install a GRUB boot loader
 which will take care of both OSs. That setup should run fine. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect, although you didn't say so, that you installed both systems&nbsp;in the same partition (which is allowed but not advisable)&nbsp;and they were conflicting. Windows, in it's typical arrogant manner, assumes it has total control of the disk partition it's
 installed in, and doesn't like intruders. The control file for Grub will be in the Linux partition.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might notice some minor hardware interference when going back to Windows from Linux. I've found occasionally that the system clock was messed up, or that the NIC ports were changed, but usually not much of a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm probably a mile off, but that sounds right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;It occurs to me that you can use the Windows installation to clear the drive and create the two partitions. When that's done, delete the first one and proceed as directed. Windows will make two partitions in that space, one for the System Reserved portion
 and one for Windows itself.</p>
