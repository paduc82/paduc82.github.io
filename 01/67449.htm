<h2>            Windows 10 can&#39;t connect to Microsoft family</h2>
                    <p>Hi, i was got this kind of problem where you can't connect Microsoft family. I like to make family to share apps &amp; games from Microsoft Store with my family but, i can't connect in Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was found some <span><span>solutions to the problem, example to "</span></span><span><span>Log in to a microsoft account instead of locally".
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However, the problem here is that, in the future, the computer will want to log on to the windows 10 system in Microsoft account even though I would like to log on to my system's local password.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I might use this feature, but I do not want to do it or use my computer for use with a microsoft account that requires a microsoft account login.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If I need to sign up for Microsoft Family with Microsoft accound, so I will still wan to log in to my system locally with my local IDs.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To do this, another question is to sign in to that microsoft account:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Can a user sign in with Microsoft IDs on own local pc a computer if the user is offline?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>So the question here is that, can I solve this problem in other ways to circumvent or solve it?</span></span></p>

</p><p>-<span><span>Hello</span><span>,</span> <span>I have looked at</span>
<span>some of</span> <span>these steps</span> <span>but</span><span>,</span> <span>
strange</span> <span>here</span> <span>is the fact</span> <span>that</span><span>,</span>
<span>making</span> <span>a change</span> <span>will also change</span> <span>the operating system</span>
<span>and</span> <span>user</span> <span>credentials</span> <span>even if only</span>
<span>I would do</span> <span>just</span> <span>this one thing</span><span>.</span>
<span>And what's going on with those instructions, they have the same problem as almost what I was asking.</span>
<span>They do not show or have information on how and where to find an app for which to block or share them.</span><br />
<br />
<span>I could log on to Microsoft family functions using Microsoft IDs but, I would not want to change anything esle but, this also does much more unwanted.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Therefore, I do not necessarily want to do this or can use this feature because it brings more new and other problems.</span></span></p>

            Hi Varaosa,<br />
<br />
<br />
For you to be able to use the Family features for your Windows 10 PC, you will need to log in to your Microsoft account since that account is the one added in the Family list and not a local account. Your other family members that you want to add to your family
 list also needs to have their own Microsoft account to be able to be added to the family.<br />
<br />
If you would need to have a local user account different from your Microsoft account, you may create a separate local user account.<br />
<br />
Once the accounts are added on the Family list in your Microsoft account, you may set up the restrictions online then make it still work while offline.<br />
<br />
You can only block specific websites but not specific apps. From the "<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12439/microsoft-account-set-child-limits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Set the right limits for your child</a></strong>" article,
 you may find the steps of restricting apps by selecting the age level that would only be appropriate for your child.<br />
<br />
Let us know if there are missed questions we haven't answered yet.

    <title>Having trouble with Photo Gallery... need permission to view my own - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ravenjravary  say:</h3>
<h2>            Having trouble with Photo Gallery... need permission to view my own pictures... help&#33;</h2>
                    Aloha!... I got a new HP Pavillion to replace the older Presario ( with XP), so I'm using Windows 7 now, and I had the local shop put my old hard drive with all my pictures on it into an external case. Then, I found that my new computer had none of the
 ease of use that my previous version had when it came to manipulating pictures. I like to sort through and get &nbsp;the sunsets together, and the beach in one folder, but the new one made it hard to do. So, I imported Photo Gallery. I'm still a bit disappointed
 overall in the step down in terms of user friendliness and options available...
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;But now, I have yet to find a way past the 'permission' wall to be able to see my old pictures again. I click on one and photo Gallery comes out to say I don't have the permission needed to access the location of the file. I've read the tutorials on
 permissions, tried everything I could, but what has taken hours for me takes moments for others... &nbsp;So I ask you, how do I get over this little hurdle? My one friend says it's all a part of the setup process where we normal people are confused into thinking
 we are, or need to be administrators... making a one computer home into an instant nightmare. What little secret do I need to know that will make this more expensive machine more easy to live with? Any help is deeply appreciated. Thanks Much, &nbsp;Raven on Maui</div>

    <title>How do I set up faxing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> church office  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I set up faxing</h2>
                    When I try to set up faxing in the 'Printers &amp; Faxes' folder I am instructed to insert the Service Pack 3 disk, which I don't have as my laptop was supplied with the software pre-installed (aren't they all these days?). How do I turn on this facility without
 the disk? I haven't bought the fax modem yet, which I don't really want to do unless I'm sure it will work, particularly as I will only need to send about two faxes a month. Any advice greatly appreciated.

<p>When a PC is supplied with preinstalled o/s and you dont get a recovery disk set, then there will be a hidden partition on the drive, which you access in order to make the recovery disk set. How you do this is down to the PC maker as its not an MS process.
 So if you havent done this you need to do it ASAP</p>
<p>Generally if you have a fax modem it will be supplied with its own fax software, so you dont have to use the win built in fax software. You will also need a std phone line.</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>Printed colors are rarely *exactly* what you see on your monitor.</p>
<p>Bad colors are probably not the fault of Internet Explorer or Windows 7.</p>
<p>HP has some very good troubleshooters on their website.<br />

    <title>Phantom alarm every night. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lets go pitt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Phantom alarm every night.</h2>
                    <p>There is an alam that goes off every night at 945pm. It says "it is 10:45 am" and then music plays for 1-2 minutes. I've tried the task manager to see what program is causing this alarm - with no success. How can I find out what program it is and how do
 I turn off the alarm?</p>

                    <p>Hello folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting occasional BSODs on my Dell Notebook. Looking at previous posts, I see that you can analyse the dump using windbg. I've tried this, but I get a 'Page 209448 not present in the dump file. Type ".hh dbgerr004" for details' message when analysing
 the file. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Could one of you kind people please check out my dmp file for me and see what you think the issue it...</p>

<p>After playing Gears of War 3, I wanted to go back and play Gears of War 2. &nbsp;But every time I put the disc in, nothing much happens and the dashboard just shows 'Open Tray'. &nbsp;I have tried the all of the Xbox support tasks (cleaning the disc, clearing the
 cache, etc), but none of them help. &nbsp;I saw a google post that mentioned a bunch of people were having this problem after some of the recent Xbox Live Console Updates (but the links to the articles are broken). &nbsp;The rest of my discs work fine and my GOW-2 disc
 is in mint condition (no scratches, no marks of any kind). &nbsp;I will try to see if another Xbox will play the disc, but am interested if anyone else is having this problem.</p>

<h2>            How to roll back to Windows 10 Home edition from Windows 10 pro &#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I purchased Windows 8.1 and upgrade to windows 10 using ISO link provided by Microsoft. I got activation of Windows 10 also and happily using for several months. Today morning I received a question from possible buyer (Amazon through which I purchased
 windows 8.1 retail copy) that whether It was Home or pro edition !&nbsp; I replied as Home but found the one seller mentioned it as Pro edition.&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that may be at time of download ISO file; I select Home version although I could download pro. I searched
 some sites and found the process of change windows 10 to Pro using default key and product key of OS&nbsp;. I followed steps and my OS upgraded to Windows 10 pro but&nbsp; later found that I am entitled for Windows 10 Home only which was activated .
</p>
<p>Now, my window is not activated and I could not see option to uninstall Windows 10 pro to back in Windows 10 home. Is there any workaround by which I can move back to Windows 10 Home without reinstalling it from media.&nbsp; I tried system restore also but that&nbsp;did
 not&nbsp;work. &nbsp;There was number of updates received after I upgraded to Windows 10 and I do not want to go through all steps again and installing all softwares again&nbsp;!</p>
<p>regards</p>
<p>Dev</p>

<h2>            V7 CS0300 Webcam isn&#39;t recognized by Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    The webcam is a USB plugin. I just got it in the mail today and I plugged it in to install. It says "This device isnt recognized etc" And it malfunctioned. It is listed as " /!\Unknown Device" under Device manager and Devices.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I really want to get this to work, I have the drivers, but it won't install because it says "Webcam not plugged in" or something like that (Since it doesn't recognize it...)&nbsp;</div>

            Does it have an install file? If so, unplug the webcam and run the setup and plug it in when asked. Some USB devices don't want you to plug it in until told.<br />

Hope this helps.<br />

            <span>Hi Nick,</span>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the exact/complete error message?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is the issue specific to the device?</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First check Webcam extension cable is connected properly or not! I will
</span><span>suggest, connect the webcam to a different computer with the extension cable and check.</span></p>
<p><span>If still issue remains same follow these methods:</span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Method 1:</span></u></b></p>
<p>
<b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Run the fixit available in the link below and check if that makes any difference</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Hardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows</span></b></p>

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/en-us</span></a></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b><u><span>Method 2:</span></u></b><u><span>
</span></u></p>
<p>
<span>Try to uninstall and reinstall the webcam software and check if it helps.<br />
Uninstall or change a program: <br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</span></a></p>
<p>
<span>Download and install the latest driver’s and\or software for your webcam from the computer or device manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p>
<span><a href="http://www.v7-world.com/downloads-q24279-c24276-g4559-p27285-V7_Vantage_Webcam_300.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.v7-world.com/downloads-q24279-c24276-g4559-p27285-V7_Vantage_Webcam_300.aspx</a></span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If the issue is specific to the device then contact the device manufacturer for assistance.</span></p>

<h2>            I have the error code 235 come up. I know I have internet access.</h2>
                    This happens when I try to sign my kids into MSN. It began after I upgraded Messenger and Family Safety was turned off by the process. When I tried to sign in again, I was told to add separate Windows accounts for my kids. Now they can't sign in because
 this code appears and I can't switch Family Safety users on my Windows account like we used to. How can I fix this?

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, we need to remove the 2 child accounts. Please try adding a new parent account, and then removing the&nbsp;child accounts from there.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the latest version now uses standard user accounts in Windows so adding Microsoft (Windows Live)accounts are impossible. For more information, please refer to this article:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still cannot delete the child accounts on the parent account, please&nbsp;<span>validate your ownership of this account. Please send a validation request here:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://account.live.com/acsr</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After validating your ownership of the account, please post&nbsp;the ticket number where you have passed the ownership validation criteria on the private message that I have
 sent to you. This should be included in the email you will receive from the validation team.</span></p>

<h2>            Disk cleanup don&#39;t cleans Windows Update Cleanup.</h2>
                    I have been running the disk cleanup for freeing up some space but there is a file named "Windows Update Cleanup" which won't clean up even if I have ticked it, When I press delete files it will not be deleted. It is consuming 1.7 GB of my hard disk space.

<p>Hi Himanshu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to verify, are you running the Disk Cleanup as administrator? Windows Update Cleanup will only run with administrator rights, so be sure to check on that if you haven't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>UPDATE: </p>
<p>
</p><p>We tried to simulate the issue that you are having and have figured out a way on how to manually clean it up. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>Services.msc</strong> on the <strong>Cortana</strong> search bar.<br />
</li><li>Scroll down to Windows Update, right click and select Stop.</li><li>Launch the File Explorer.</li><li>Go to <strong>This PC </strong>&gt; <strong>Local Disc (C:) </strong>&gt; <strong>Windows
</strong>&gt;<strong> SoftwareDistribution.</strong></li><li>Rename <strong>SoftwareDistribution</strong> folder to <strong>SoftwareDistribution_1</strong>.</li><li>Restart your PC.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once booted up, go back to the Windows folder. You will notice that there will be two Software Distribution folder. Delete the
<strong>SoftwareDistribution_1 </strong>folder. This will let you clear out the Update Folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Share screen in Skype for business is not available</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a particular issue that is happening to only one user in Skype for Business, he is having issue sharing his screen with some other people from Malaysia, the people from there have a Skype for Business account but not phone number, the person starting
 the meeting is based here at our office and he does has a phone number. He can speak to them, call them but whenever he is trying to share the screen the option is grayed out, inactive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate your help or at least an explanation for why is this happening,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nelu</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that your computer has another user account already created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>check the issue in safe mode.</strong></p>
<p>Refer this article:<br />

<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue does not persist in safe mode, then <strong>perform clean boot.</strong><br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows Photo Gallery Saying No Photos to Upload from Iphone 6</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have always uploaded my photos from my Iphone 6 to my Toshiba laptop using Windows Photo Gallery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Sunday, it is really playing up - at first, it was uploading some but not all the photos I had taken. I have just tried again with some new photos I have taken and it it saying '0 new photos and videos found'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's driving me mad - please help! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried through Itunes but there is no photo tab there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

            Is the passcode for the iPhone entered? 
<br />Have you trusted the computer from the iPhone?
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer on the Taskbar
<br />Click This PC
<br />
<br />Right click the iPhone, click Import pictures and videos. See if you are then able to import the pictures.

            Its possible the cable is damaged or frayed. Do you have a spare cable you could try?
<br />
<br />The the connection port on the iPhone might need to be cleaned out. Use a tooth pick and make any dirt build up is removed.

<br />Open the iPhone then browse it then manually copy over the Photos.

            I thought the issue you had with only 41 photos showing was through the Import pictures and videos wizard.
<br />
<br />Are you saying, when you open the iPhone in File Explorer, you are not seeing any of the photos you took since Sunday?
<br />
<br />It should be in a folder Internal Storage &gt; DCIM

            Strange, do you have access to another computer to see if they show up?
<br />
<br />They do show up on the Phone in Photos, right?
