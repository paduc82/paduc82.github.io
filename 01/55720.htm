<p>
</p><p>Mine does exactly the same thing. I can launch the File &amp; TV app, but cannot lauch the Groove app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I've gone to the store I get the same... it starts to download, stops and turns into a button saying "Update". Click it and nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed the method of uninstalling using PowerShell and then going to the Store to get it again, but nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I am at the point I will give up with this and use a third party player.&nbsp; I knew there was a reason I stuck with "xxxxxxx".</p>

            <p>Yeah, that's probably the best option. I spent more than 4 hors yesterday with MS tech support and one of them even took over my machine for an hour or so just to tell me that I have to refresh the installation and loose all the legacy applications that
 I've installed and configured over the last year. It's like going to the doctor with an itch on your toe and being told that you have to amputate your entire leg!!??
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And BTW, did I mention that I own a Surface Pro 3. So, an App made by MS doesn't work on machine that made by MS.....hmm.. why does it sound so familiar? Oh, yeah, that's the same story with every single Music Player App/Device that they've ever made, remember
 zune??</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just goes to say how incompetent the management on whatever team that's responsible for developing the app. Endless redesign and endless rebranding (hoping that people won't remember the catastrophic failures of the past)...Zune, Zune Player...Xbox Music...Music..and
 now Groove Music.&nbsp;&nbsp;Solution? Sack the team manager and put all the coeds his team developed in his termination package and while doing that take a picture and hang it on the wall of&nbsp;every&nbsp;room in their office.</p>

            <p>I also tried all "solutions" but non of them worked. Sfc reports no damage, other apps are working well. If i try open a music file it says something about catastrophic failure, which is a bit funny error. So I must install 3rd party app to be able to listen
 to my audio files (mostly mp3 or flac).&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Disk Space Getting filled up on OS Drive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disk Space Getting filled up on OS Drive</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
&nbsp; I bought a Dell Studio Laptop, with I got Windows Vista Home Premium Edition. My primary drive, on which Windows Vista is installed is of 25GB. But it has ran out of disk space only after installing and Vista and Applications came with it. When I tried to
 find which file\directory is eating up all the space, I came to know that Windows and Program files are just 14GB. But still it shows that only 2GB of space is free. And whenever I try to install something or burn a DVD the system cries with "Out of Space"
 error. I am not able to find any of the file which is huge in size, I don't store anything in OS Drive, Desktop or My Documents. Please advice.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Nayan

            Hi Nilank Nayan<br />
<br />
How many Restore Points do you have on the System?&nbsp; <br />
Is that a brand new Dell Laptop?&nbsp; I cannot believe it only has 25gb of total space.&nbsp; That doesn't sound right.&nbsp;
<br />
Do you have another Partition such as a Drive D with available space?<br />
<br />
<strong>Below is info on checking the System Restore storage space and how to change it:&nbsp; This information is provided as is.&nbsp; If you decide to make these changes, you make them at your own risk.&nbsp; Changing the storage space may delete some restore points.<br />
</strong><br />
<p>
<span>To see how much space system restore is actually taking up you need to use the
<strong><span>Volume Shadow Copy Service Administration Tool</span></strong> (<strong><span>vssadmin</span></strong>, for short), which runs from an elevated command prompt as follows:</span></p>
<p>
<span>1/ Click Start</span></p>
<p>
<span>2/ From the Start menu Click All programs followed by Accessories</span></p>
<p>
<span>3/ On the Accessories menu Right Click on the Command Prompt option</span></p>
<p>
<span>4/ From the drop Down menu that appears, click the Run as administrator option</span></p>
<p>
<span>5/ When the Command Prompt window opens type: vssadmin list shadowstorage and Press Enter</span></p>
<p>
<span>6/ The results should read something like this:</span></p>
<p>
<span>C:\Windows\system32&gt;vssadmin list shadowstorage</span></p>
<p>
<span>vssadmin 1.1 - Volume Shadow Copy Service administrative command-line tool</span></p>
<p>
<span>(C) Copyright 2001-2005 Microsoft Corp.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Shadow Copy Storage association</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For volume: (C:)\\?\Volume{db8e056a-6294-11db-9f9f-806e6f6e6963}\</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Shadow Copy Storage volume: (C:)\\?\Volume{db8e056a-6294-11db-9f9f-806e6f6e69</span></p>
<p>
<span>63}\</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Used Shadow Copy Storage space: 197.766 MB</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Allocated Shadow Copy Storage space: 400 MB</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Maximum Shadow Copy Storage space: 2.092 GB</span></p>
<p>
<span>7/ In this example the C: drive is 19.5GB in size. The currently used storage space is 197.766MB and the Maximum space allocated for System restore is 2.092GB.</span></p>
<p>
<span>8/ The current stored system restore points are 2. This can be found out by using the
</span><strong><span>vssadmin</span></strong><span> list shadows command.</span></p>
<p>
<span>9/ In
 be allocated for system restore points.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Reducing the Allocated Space</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>To reduce the allocated space we need to use the Resize option in the form of:</span></p>
<p>
<span>vssadmin resize shadowstorage /on=[here add the drive letter]: /For=[here add the drive letter]: /Maxsize=[here add the maximum size]</span></p>
<p>
<span>Let us assume that we wished to have a maximum size of 2GB from this particular partition/drive. The command line option would look something like this:</span></p>
<p>
<span>C:<span>\Windows\system32&gt;vs</span>sadmin resize shadowstorage /On=C: /For=C: /Maxsize=2GB</span></p>
<p>
<span>So to put this in to practice you proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p>
<span>1/ Click Start</span></p>
<p>
<span>2/ From the Start menu Click All programs followed by Accessories</span></p>
<p>
<span>3/ On the Accessories menu Right Click on the Command Prompt option</span></p>
<p>
<span>4/ From the drop Down menu that appears, click the Run as administrator option</span></p>
<p>
<span>5/ When the Command Prompt window opens type:
<br />
vssadmin resize shadowstorage /on=[here add the drive letter]: /For=[here add the drive letter]: /Maxsize=[here add the maximum size] and Press Enter</span></p>
<p>
<span>6/ if all goes well you should see a message saying 'Successfully resized the shadow copy storage association
</span></p>
<p>
<span>7/ Your System Restore shadow storage has now been resized</span></p>
If your hard drive is really only 25gb, I would suggest getting a bigger hard drive and using the Dell Recovery media, Installing Vista on the new hard drive:&nbsp; Backup your data from the old drive to an external hard drive or something so you can restore it
 later.<br />
<br />

            Hi Janet.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go into Mail Settings via the gear icon at bottom of inbox, then choose Manage Accounts, then the Gmail account.  It will show you what's needed, probably the routine need to refresh password.  
<br />
<br />If not delete the account, restart PC, then go back to add it back.  This solves most problems.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            I had this issue, only thing that worked for me was to check my settings and allow mail, calendar apps to access my location. I had previously turned this off (thinking, why do any apps need my location, I don't use maps), once I allowed them, mail worked
 fine again.

            Hey MadMax225985,
<br />
<br />Have you tried this?
<br />
<br />Hit Windows key + I, go into Privacy. On the left pane, click Microphone.
<br />
<br />Be sure that Allow apps to access your microphone is on, and the apps in the list under Choose which apps can access your microphone are checked on.
<br />
<br />Let me know.

            MadMax,
<br />
<br />There's some progress, at least. When you right-click the Speech Recognition bar, it's set to Sleep: Listen only to Start Listening, I hope? Just making sure.
<br />
<br />In the same context menu, you might want to go to Configuration &gt; Set up my microphone (again, if you must) or you can improve it by going into Configuration &gt; Improve voice recognition.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you've made any progress there, I again wish you luck on this.

<p>Both wired and wireless headset microphone work but apparently the issue is with the Speech module.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I indicated previously I can see microphone input on the speech bar but Speed module is not responding "Start listening". Made certain "Listen" was selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I worked through the improve speech module, often Speech would not respond to input, although&nbsp; Pause and Resume seemed to readily be recognized. Also sent speech results to MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doesn't appear the Speech is in my future.</p>

<p>I have a HP Envy i7 notebook &nbsp;Windows 8.1 x 64&nbsp;that runs flawless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This update fails and I followed the troubleshooting path and SFC /scannow passes but scanhealth shows the Windows store is repairable</p>
<p>but the repair fails during restore health. Says cannot find the "source file" and I do not know how to specify a location for it to go get it.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>No but I have&nbsp;the results saved to a&nbsp;DISM log, below. It is a cloned&nbsp;SSD with no recovery partition I don't believe. I am only using half of the SSD capacity for C drive.</p>
<p>Machine runs perfect and SFC passes.</p>
<p>Why can't restore health be configured to use windows update to get what it needs ?</p>
<p>Procmon sounds a little over my head at this time without someone&nbsp;babysitting me&nbsp;while I am using it.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>No but I have&nbsp;the results saved to a&nbsp;DISM log, below. It is a cloned&nbsp;SSD with no recovery partition I don't believe. I am only using half of the SSD capacity for C drive.</p>
<p>Machine runs perfect and SFC passes.</p>
<p>Why can't restore health be configured to use windows update to get what it needs ?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Steve that is the million dollar question. I have been researching this issue and am finding posts and discussions about this since at least 2013. I have yet to find an answer. Let me give you some more information. When I run sfc /scannow it appears everything
 is in order. When I use dism to checkhealth I am apprised there are problems which are repairable. When I run dism restorehealth I get an error message that the files cannot be found and it fails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reviewed my CBS.log and found a reference to some missing files and the particular update they came from which was reported by the log. &nbsp;I extracted those files from the download and managed to copy them to the appropriate amdx64 folder/file in C:\windows\winsxs.
 I ran dism restorehealth again and it gave me the same message that the files could not be accessed and thus it failed. I then checked the CBS.log which reported there were
<strong>NO corrupted or missing files</strong>, after I did the manual repair i.e., the problem was shown as corrected in the log file which previously showed there were three missing files (which I replaced manually), but dism is unable to access windows update
 which results in the error message. Bottom line, the missing files problem originally reported in the CBS log is fixed on my machine but because windows update fails when dism invokes it, dism reports there is still a problem when in reality, there isn't.
 I STILL can't find any reference as to what to do to cause dism to use windows update to search for the files. According to my dism log dism cannot find the image file on my machine which indicates it is looking somewhere on my machine rather than online as
 it is supposed to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, the update will still not install. My conclusion is that the dism restorehealth failure message is irrelevant to the update installation, which is what I have suspected all along. The dism problem remains a separate issue which
 also needs to be addressed but has been an issue for several years without a solution. Our only hope is for the grand old software company to figure out a way to solve this issue. Until then we are, well, you can fill in the blank with whatever you choose.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I think the same thing that the failed update may be a different issue than the restore health failure.</p>
<p>Some machines can install the update it appears. Different machines/configurations seem to be a problem for&nbsp;this update. There are a boat load of update failures I notice on win 8 forum.</p>
<p>I have confidence Microsoft&nbsp;come up with something fast because we will not be able to install any future updates soon !</p>

            I changed to a cloned SSD and got rid of the scan health issue and went to download the latest 10 updates and only 9 downloaded and installed. Scanhealth again showed OK. Re-booted a couple of times and there was one more update, our beloved 355 and that
 failed every time twice with a 8020056 error cannot retrieve data from the web or something like that so maybe Microsoft pulled the plug on it for a while, I don't know.

<p>You're missing a digit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Was it&nbsp; 0x80200056?&nbsp;&nbsp; That one seems to be associated with the same symptom with Store apps.&nbsp;&nbsp; The update troubleshooter seems oblivious of that code...</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>(via BING search for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x80200056 site:microsoft.com<br />
)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some were reporting that code in relation to resuming a suspended download.&nbsp; Could that be the case?&nbsp;&nbsp; You might get a clue from&nbsp; bitsadmin&nbsp; then (in an elevated cmd window):</p>
<p>
</p><p>bitsadmin&nbsp; /list&nbsp; /allusers&nbsp; /verbose</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try it without /verbose first in case there is only one&nbsp;"job" you want to list.&nbsp; Mine are all empty.&nbsp; I think if one was really suspended it would have to have a byte count.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then you could list just that job instead of all of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then there would be
 some correlating information in both WindowsUpdate.log&nbsp; and&nbsp; ReportingEvents.log&nbsp; (among others).&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW if there is no chance of a space problem on the drive what about virtual memory?&nbsp; E.g. if the implementation is to drag everything that is relevant into memory before trying to add to it that might account for why others have been reporting success by
 being so fastidious about (apparently) getting rid of&nbsp;previous traces of updates before starting this huge install?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>C.f.&nbsp; Marek Kusmierski's solution:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/8b6fbf3e-ccd1-4038-99eb-30563885ef10?threadId=c3071122-e903-4775-b659-e98784bc786c">http://answers.microsoft.com/message/8b6fbf3e-ccd1-4038-99eb-30563885ef10?threadId=c3071122-e903-4775-b659-e98784bc786c</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>also his amendment on the same page which some have said was necessary for them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that the effect of that would be to further remove the complete previous content of SoftwareDistribution from being read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Did you check your&nbsp; dism.log&nbsp; again&nbsp;to see if you were still getting those&nbsp; 0x80070070&nbsp; messages?&nbsp; Seems ironic that once you get into that state those messages will probably just make the implied condition worse (however it occurs.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it might be interesting to check your Virtual Memory state when the symptom happens.&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently mine says it is "automatically managed" but allocating only my RAM size.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I don't know if it grows efficiently when necessary or not.&nbsp;&nbsp; If not perhaps
 we would need to be specifying a Custom size to get this update done?</p>
<p>

<p>SFC passes and scanhealth passes.</p>
<p>I downloaded 9 updates up to 355 and checked scanhealth and SFC again and it is fine.</p>
<p>I tried the 355 update again and again it failed.</p>
<p>I am weary of this.</p>

<h3> petfab  say:</h3>
<h2>            Freeing disk space in WIndows RT 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I am using ASUS tablet with almost 30 GB SSD disk. It seems, that the OS and MS Office 2013 has "eaten" all the available free space on the disk, leaving 4,5 MB free...
</p>
<p>I cleaned the disk of almost all programs, data, put the&nbsp; One Drive files online-only, however Disk Cleanup is not helping me, offering few additional kilo- or megaBytes of free space after cleanup of any files, including the system files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The free space seems constantly shrinking , not leaving any space for Windows updates and files,</p>
<p>so I feel helpless.</p>
<p>What can I do to change it?</p>
<p>

            While you're waiting for someone knowledgeable about Windows RT 8.1 to come along (not me), download and run TreeSize Free to see what is taking up the space on your hard drive.&nbsp; That might give you an idea of what to do.&nbsp;

            BTW do not save to desktop, make a FOLDER off C:<br />
<br />
Like C:\Drivers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and save there<br />
<br />
Keep big files off the desktop<br />
<br />
Device Manager - Display Adapter - DELETE the device there - APPLY/OK&nbsp;- REBOOT<br />
<br />
If no joy :<br />
<br />
Try this - in Device Manager - Click on in the blank/white area <br />
<br />
At top then :<br />
<br />
View - Show Hidden Devices (just in case it got hidden)<br />
<br />
Action - Scan for Hardware Changes<br />

<h2>            Failed to Connect to a Windows Service</h2>
                    I have read the other posts on this community.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have attempted to follow the instructions and so far none of them has worked for me.&nbsp; One puzzling thing that seems different when I go into services all 4 choices about starting the service are grayed
 out.&nbsp; The status shows starting.&nbsp; So I cannot get it to be "started".

            <p>Yes, I guess that would be more than interesting.... probably crucial.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is the error message I get:</p>
<p>Failed to connect to a windows service</p>
<p>Windows could not connect to the System Event Notification Service service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is the one I have attempted to start.&nbsp; I have also reset the Winsock and performed a clean boot in regular mode and in safe mode.&nbsp; I have uninstalled all of my anti-virus programs.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, not being sure of myself, I have done these several times
 thinking I must have missed something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that helps.</p>

            Sounds reasonable. I would now try this:
<div>
<ol>
<li>Create a System Restore Point (just in case things go wrong)</li><li>Manually modify the following values to enable the service:<br />
ServiceSidType 1 (1)<br />
Start 2 (2)<br />
Type 20 (32)</li><li>Reboot the machine and check if the service now runs.</li></ol>
<div>The same data applies to the SensSvc service right underneath the SENS service.</div>

            <p>When i double clicked on each of the 6 icons&nbsp; (3 for each of the 2 categories) the values you suggested were already there with the exception of the SensSvc Start - it was a 3, so I changed it to a 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, one other thing I was not sure about is the value for Type was 20 in both SENS and SensSvc.&nbsp; Was I supposed to change it to 32?&nbsp;&nbsp; I left it at 20 for now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I restarted, the error still exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another note that may not really be helpful, when I first encountered this problem, it happed like this:&nbsp;&nbsp; i was installing some updates for windows.&nbsp; In the middle of the updating process my computer just shut off.&nbsp; No blue screen, no warning, no shutting
 down.&nbsp; It just shut off power.&nbsp; When I rebooted I attempted to continue the install.&nbsp; It shut off again.&nbsp; I rebooted again and got the error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help.&nbsp; I am a bit panicked.</p>

            Oh my goodness.&nbsp; Now I really messed up.&nbsp; I did the restore and it was working.&nbsp;&nbsp; I got a message that there were Windows updates.&nbsp; I thought it would be good to do the updates now.&nbsp; I should have asked.&nbsp; I let them install and then it wanted to restart.&nbsp;
 I clicked okay.&nbsp; Now I have a bigger problem.&nbsp; Instead of rebooting like normal I got a message that reads:&nbsp; Startup Repair Cannot Repair This Computer Automatically.&nbsp; It give me a choice to send the information abou the problem or not.&nbsp; No matter what choice
 I make it cycles back to this place.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sick.&nbsp; Any suggestions, now?

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I have a Toshiba Satellite L300 running on the windows vista operating system. Anyway about a week ago it crashed and it wouldn't turn back on, it recomended me to the repair center which after a few hours also crashed when a blue screen came up saying Fatal
 System Error c00021a. Now my laptop doesn't get far past the start up toshiba screen, it just goes blank and won't do anything, The recovery discs aren't loading and I'm not really sure what to do. I got it for Christmas in 2008 so it is almost 2 years old.</p>
<p>All answers are greatly appreciated I'm in desperate need of help. <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Thank you</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>STOP: 0xC000021A</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Can be a difficult problem to solve and you may indeed need technical help from a real computer shop<br />
(not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy or other BigBox stores) or the System maker's Support.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>This error occurs when a user-mode subsystem, such as WinLogon or the Client Server Run-Time Subsystem (CSRSS), has been fatally compromised and security can no longer be guaranteed. In response, the operating system switches to kernel mode. Microsoft Windows
 cannot run without WinLogon or CSRSS. Therefore, this is one of the few cases where the failure of a user-mode service can shut down the system.</p>
<p>Mismatched system files can also cause this error. This can occur if you have restored your hard disk from a backup. Some backup programs might skip restoring system files that they determine are in use.</p>
<p><strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p>Running the kernel debugger is not useful in this situation because the actual error occurred in a user-mode process.</p>
<p><em>Resolving an error in a user-mode device driver, system service, or third-party application:</em>Because bug check 0xC000021A occurs in a user-mode process, the most common culprits are third-party applications. If the error occurred after the
 installation of a new or updated device driver, system service, or third-party application, the new software should be removed or disabled. Contact the manufacturer of the software about a possible update.</p>
<p>If the error occurs during system startup, restart your computer, and press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices. At the resulting Windows<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu, choose the<strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong>
 option. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time. If this does not resolve the error, try manually removing the offending software. If the system partition is formatted with file allocation table (FAT), use an MS-DOS
 startup disk to gain access to the computer's hard disk. If the system partition is formatted with NTFS file system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty software. If the faulty software is used as part of the system startup process
 in Safe Mode, you need to start the computer using the Recovery Console in order to access the file. If a newly installed piece if hardware is suspected, remove it to see if this resolves the issue.</p>
<p>Try running the Emergency Recovery Disk (ERD) and allow the system to repair any errors that it detects.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a mismatched system file problem:</em> If you have recently restored your hard disk from a backup, check if there is an updated version of the Backup/Restore program available from the manufacturer. Make sure the latest Windows Service Pack
 is installed.</p>

This is my generic bluescreen troubleshooter - you can try Safe Mode as suggested in the article<br />
above - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot. Vista disks are probably needed - if you do not have to try repair you can borrow a friends as they are not copy protected. Also you can buy the physical disks<br />
from the system maker cheap as you already own Windows (you will need these to reinstall if&nbsp;<br />
required). You can also make repair disks on another computer.<br />
<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

The log might give you the answer if there was a corrupted driver. (Does not tell all the<br />
possible driver issues).<br />
<br />
Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party<br />
keyboard and mouse, as well as other major device drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<h2>            Stop&#58; c000002a Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I am currently trying to troubleshoot a&nbsp;client laptop that keeps freezing and displaying the BSOD "Stop:C000002A" message. The message is always displayed on the duplicated projector screen while the laptop screen is black. This is why the client didn't
 even realize she was getting an error at first and this crash does not create any dump files so I could not find anything to give me a lead.&nbsp; The unit is a Dell Latitude E5500 running Windows 7 64 bit. What I have tried so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Updated all drivers</p>
<p>*Applied all Windows Updates</p>
<p>*Added registry entry "ArpRetryCount" value 0&nbsp; (the unit was having issues with duplicate ip error message, connected through wireless DHCP)</p>
<p>*Replaced the entire laptop, no special software installed, no&nbsp;special registry entry, &nbsp;basic image used on 50 other deployed E5500s.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Short of replacing every USB device attached to it, I'm out of ideas. There are at least 4 other identical laptops in the same building running without errors. The client does not seem to be opening anything other than Word and Smart documents (classroom
 with smartboard) and I have virus scanned all of these documents. According to the client it seems to happen when they go on break or leave and come back. In response to that I changed the power settings to never sleep, turn off HDD, ect.&nbsp; This did not seem
 to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anymore ideas? Anything is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
