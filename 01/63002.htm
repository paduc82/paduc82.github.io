<h2>            Dual Boot Windows 10 &#47; Windows 7 - One Drive - Sysprep Image - Windows 7 will no longer boot&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am attempting to configure, then Sysprep Image a dual boot PC for a classroom environment where we will need access to Windows 7 as well as Windows 10 for upgrade training.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started by installing Windows 10 on an internal 320GB drive, then I "shrunk" the partition to around 150GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then installed Windows 7 on a new partition created in the unused 150GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to do all of my customization on both O/S partitions. The dual boot process worked exactly as expected.&nbsp; I set the default boot option to Windows 10 (so I did not accidentally launch the Windows 7 mini setup wizard before I was ready to do so).&nbsp;
 Once I was satisfied </p>
<p>I "sysprepped" the Windows 7 Partition, using the generalized OOB option and has sysprep "shutdown" on completion.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then booted into the Windows 10 O/S and sysprepped it in the same manner. I used Clonzilla Live to image the disk and after it was complete I started the Windows 10 O/S and ran the mini setup wizard and all went well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went on to do the mini setup wizard on the Win 7 O/S and I chose Windows 7 from the boot loaded selection screen but Windows 10 loads??? I tried changing the default O/S from the boot loaded to Windows 7 but get the same result Windows 10 is the only
 O/S which will boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked that AHCI is disabled in BIOS. Using Windows explorer, the Windows 7 file system seems to be in tact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas how I can make this work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Brian</p>

<h2>            Blue Screen BCCode c2</h2>
                    I have an HP laptop thats about one year old. This is it's second blue screen in several months. Honestly, didn't even pay much attention to the first, as it happened overnight, I believe and didn't seem to cause any problems that I've noticed.<br />
Here's the additional info from the error...<br />
<br />
&nbsp; BCCode:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c2<br />
&nbsp; BCP1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0000000000000007<br />

&nbsp; Service Pack:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1_0<br />

Mini dump file is linked. (Hope I did that right.) Any help would be appreciated! I wish I knew more about diagnosing blue screens :-(<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The attached DMP file is of the <b>BAD_POOL_CALLER (c2)</b> bugcheck.<br />
<br />
<p><i>The current thread is making a bad pool request.</i></p>
<br />
<p>An application or driver made a invalid memory request and likely has a bug.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>BugCheck C2, {7, 109b, 68, <u><b>fffff8a018317010</b></u>}<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If we run a !poolval on the address of the block of pool being deallocated (4th parameter):</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1: kd&gt; !poolval fffff8a018317010<br />
Pool page fffff8a018317010 region is Unknown<br />
<br />
Validating Pool headers for pool page: fffff8a018317010<br />
<br />
<i><b>Pool page [ fffff8a018317000 ] is __inVALID.</b></i><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As we can see, there is pool corruption within the non-paged pool, so we are possibly dealing with memory issues over device driver issues.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Before we make that call though, I see you have Norton installed. I recommend temporarily removing and replacing Norton with Microsoft Security Essentials for troubleshooting purposes:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Norton removal tool - <a href="https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/kb20080710133834EN_EndUserProfile_en_us;jsessionid=45C4AC0D9BB760C424090B42D016AEDD.4?pvid=f-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>MSE - <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><i><b>If the removal and replacement of Norton does not help, run a Memtest for no less than ~8 passes (several hours):</b></i></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Memtest86+:<br />
<br />
<b>Download Memtest86+ here:</b><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a><br />
<br />
<b>Which should I download?</b><br />
<br />
You can either download the pre-compiled ISO that you would burn to a CD and then boot from the CD, or you can download the auto-installer for the USB key. What this will do is format your USB drive, make it a bootable device, and then install the necessary
 files. Both do the same job, it's just up to you which you choose, or which you have available (whether it's CD or USB).<br />
<br />
<b>How Memtest works:</b><br />
<br />
Memtest86 writes a series of test patterns to most memory addresses, reads back the data written, and compares it for errors.<br />
<br />
The default pass does 9 different tests, varying in access patterns and test data. A tenth test, bit fade, is selectable from the menu. It writes all memory with zeroes, then sleeps for 90 minutes before checking to see if bits have changed (perhaps because
 of refresh problems). This is repeated with all ones for a total time of 3 hours per pass.<br />
<br />
Many chipsets can report RAM speeds and timings via SPD (Serial Presence Detect) or EPP (Enhanced Performance Profiles), and some even support changing the expected memory speed. If the expected memory speed is overclocked, Memtest86 can test that memory performance
 is error-free with these faster settings.<br />
<br />
Some hardware is able to report the "PAT status" (PAT: enabled or PAT: disabled). This is a reference to Intel Performance acceleration technology; there may be BIOS settings which affect this aspect of memory timing.<br />
<br />
This information, if available to the program, can be displayed via a menu option.<br />
<br />
Any other questions, they can most likely be answered by reading this great guide here:<br />

<p><br />
</p>
<p>If Memtest comes up clean, why is your system uptime so long?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>System Uptime: <i><b>5 days</b></i> 11:15:45.838</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Due to large system uptime, possible memory leaking. Don't leave the laptop on for so long.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p><br />

            Thanks so much for your help, Patrick! I have Microsoft Sec. Ess installed and don't use Norton, but haven't removed it yet. I will definitely do that!<br />
<br />
I also got into the very bad habit of not shutting down for days on end. I'll give your suggestions a try and run memtest if I still have issues. I may just run it later regardless.<br />
Thanks again for your help and I'll post if another BSOD shows up<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
My pleasure. If after removing Norton your issue is solved I recommend marking my post as an answer so this thread no longer shows up as requiring an answer.<br />

<h2>            computer not showing on network</h2>
                    Hello. Every since reinstalling Windows 7 32 bit&nbsp; on one of my computers and getting the Virgin Media router one of my computers does not show up in the homegroup. The computers name is HONDO and the following&nbsp; messages when trying to open the shared user
 folder in HONDO:- Windows cant access \\HONDO\Users<br />
Check the spelling of the name. Otherwise, there might be a problem with your network. Try to identify and resolve network problems, click Diagnose. The error code is : 0x80070035 The network path was not found.<br />
After runing the diagnostic tool I am told Troubleshooter couldn't identify the problem. I have had this problem for the last 5 months and tried uninstalling and reinstalling the network drivers. I have tried using "ipconfig" to renew the ip addresses of both
 computers with no change.<br />
However the contents of computer called ANIMATION can be seen and edited on HONDO.
<br />
The ANIMATION computer can't access the shared folder on HONDO and gets the following messages when I try to acces the HONDO network icon:- Windows cant access \\HONDO\Users<br />
When I hit the Diagnose button I get this message next, "MAke sure that the device or resource (HONDO) allows incoming connections for File and Printer sharing. After I click next I get the following message, "Troubleshooter has completed. Troubleshooter was
 unable to automatically fix all of the issues found. You can find more details below<br />
Problem found: Windows can't communicate with the device or&nbsp; resource (HONDO)<br />
Then when I click on, 'Vew detailed information I get pretty much the same information telling me Windows can't communicate with the device.<br />
I was advised to untick the Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)<br />
This worked for a short time but everything went back to usual after reboot<br />
<br />

            Any Disk warning is a major event,usually it means the HD is in need of replacement...To check,open cmd,type:&nbsp; CHKDSK C: /F&nbsp; agree to restart,type: EXIT&nbsp; restart pc.The HD check takes place on restart,look carefull at the data,at the last data page,look
 at Bad Sectors,it should show 0...If any show,then back up user data in windows,replace the drive...Microsoft Store &amp;/or cache have nothing to do with HD errors/warnings....

            Teddy, did you get your drive tested to see if it's failing, and do the Disk check to confirm it?  
<br />
<br />Let us know if there's anything else.  
<br />
<br />If not then you can mark the post which helped most as the Answer, to help others.

            <p>This started a few weeks ago. No changes were made, except all updates from microsoft.
</p>
<p>After typing cmd in Run box all that came up was a C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe black box. All the box had in it was copyright of my XP version and,</p>
<p>C:\Documents and settings\my name&gt;</p>
<p>...nothing to right click on, program list or run as administrator so,</p>
<p>I just typed in sfc/scannow after the "&gt;".</p>
<p>This did not help in restoring files to their original version. The description link above said it may require access to the Windows installation source files.</p>
<p>So, a window just kept popping up that said: "files to run must be copied to the DLL cache...insert Windows XP Professional CD2 now.</p>
<p>...I had to cancel because, that's the problem, no CD for operating system (pre installed) just CD of my Office product.</p>

<p><span>Please see the following article with some possible troubleshooting:</span></p>

<p><span>Also, if your system came pre-installed from the manufacturer, you should either have a recovery partition already on the system to make recovery media,
 or be able to contact them to get recovery media sent to you. Depending on the manufacturer, there may be a charge for the media to be sent.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!</span></p>

    <title>Probox &#47;Windows 7 Connection issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trumpy81  say:</h3>
<h2>            Probox &#47;Windows 7 Connection issue</h2>
                    
<p>GDay All,</p>
<p>I'm having some sort of issue with my Probox PBR-500 being able to connect and file share between my Windows 7 machines, but, only some of the time.</p>
<p>Obviously, my current network settings in Windows 7 allow successful file transfer and streaming to the Probox but for some unknown reason, the Probox loses the ability to logon to any of my Windows 7 machines.</p>
<p>The network is connected and I am able to ping the Probox from any Windows 7 machine with no apparent packet loss, yet the Probox refuses to connect to any of them, but only some of the time.</p>
<p>Even though I am unable to logon to a Windows 7 machine and browse my files, I am still able to FTP files to the Probox and access the HTTP server within the Probox.</p>
<p>My first thought was perhaps the network cards in the various Windows 7 machines were being turned off as part of a power savings scheme, so I went into Device Manager and Power Options, and set the Network cards to remain powered up. This didn't solve the
 problem.</p>
<p>I have tried completely powering down the Probox and then retrying to connect to a Windows 7 machine, with no success.</p>
<p>I have tried powering down my Belkin N1 Vision wireless router and then retrying to connect, with no success.</p>
<p>I'm at a total loss why this works sometimes and not others.</p>
<p>Can anyone help or suggest a method/s of troubleshooting this issue?</p>
<p>Hardware:<br />
Windows 7 Professional 64bit Desktop, 2 x Windows 7 Ultimate 32bit desktops, Windows 7 Ultimate 32bit Laptop, Belkin N1 Vision F5D8232-4, Probox PBR-500 with TP-Link TL-WN321G USB Wireless dongle and new power supply.<br />
(Old power supply developed a fault that would open my garage door randomly ... Totally bizarre!).</p>

<p>GDay ll,</p>
<p>Syed V, Thanks for your reply. I have managed to track down the problem. After opening gpedit.msc, I navigated to Windows Settings/Security Settings/Local Policies/Security Options and I enabled 'Microsoft network client: Send unencrypted password to third-party
 SMB servers'</p>
<p>Since doing that, a problem arose with my Belkin N1 Vision Wireless Router, which makes me wonder if the problem was really the router all along. I have since replaced the router and thus far, I have had no problems connecting.</p>

            The driver version 7.10.344.0 is the one offered for the keyboard on its own.<br />
<br />
For the desktop set the version offered is ITPx86_1033_7.00.260.0.exe.<br />
<br />
Do you have a short, clear line of sight between the dongle and the keyboard? The received signal may be weak or the dongle damaged on transfer to the new system.<br />

<p>It's amazing. And they avoided every issue people had at the press conference. The online issue. The used games, the power compared to PS3. They dodged all 3. And who is to say those 15 exclusives are not all XBLA and Kinect games?</p>

<p>Nothing new.&nbsp; Same thing happened with the xbox vs PS2,&nbsp; then PS3 vs 360, then........&nbsp; Its honestly nothing new.&nbsp; 360 is still outselling the PS3 by a small margin not that it matters at all.&nbsp; Just keep in mind that's without having a blu ray player and
 without having free online.&nbsp; You would think the free online service would be outselling the paid service.&nbsp; Despite what many think, the blu ray player is going to be a massive game changer for Microsoft.&nbsp; If the 360 would have had a blu ray player it would
 have dominated over the PS3 by a longshot. I have been saying forever the next xbox would for sure have a blu ray player.</p>

<p>Yeah, it's weird I have been seeing more and more fan boys recently of the PlayStation variety. My friends and I thought the Xbox looked awesome but they announced before their presentation e3 would be about games not their console presentation. &nbsp;However
 I do believe it's important they address some of the basic questions about function regarding their console.... they did not do this at their presentation</p>
<p>Can we turn the Mic off? </p>
<p>How will headsets work with the new gen consoles?</p>
<p>How can we "trade " games now?</p>
<p>What are we getting as xbox live customers that PS isin't?</p>
<p>What if we don't have cable can we still switch our channels through regular television?</p>
<p>Although I like the idea of chatting through my living room everybody else hearing about me "pwning noobs" could be better left to my headset for my ears alone..... For a presentation that was suppose to be about the console, I left knowing very little:(</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Refund Scam</h2>
                    Received numerous phone calls from the following phone number 1-844-386-8965 stating that because Microsoft was no longer going to provide technical support, that I was entitled to a refund.&nbsp; Today, I decided to call this pestering caller.&nbsp; When I asked
 how much the refund was, the gentlemen with an Indian accent said that the refund was $300.00.&nbsp; He request that I start my computer and that we could proceed with moving forward with getting the refund.&nbsp; He wanted to get access to my computer.&nbsp; He said it
 would take about 15 minutes to get this refund process done.&nbsp; I told him that I did not have time to stay on the computer for 15 minutes since I had an appointment.&nbsp; He said he would be glad to call me back at a time that I specified.&nbsp; I said good bye and
 have not returned their call.&nbsp; I caution anyone receiving this type of phone call that it is very likely a SCAM. &nbsp;

<p>It not a new thing; they have been doing it for many, many&nbsp;years in many forms.</p>

<p>My call was a recording&nbsp; - Patricia Pender she said to call a 1800 number that I have a refund coming to me</p>
<p>as the company has gone out of business. She has tried numerous times to get in touch with me. I have not made any purchases. My computer is a couple of years old. So I knew it was a scam! But they call me 3 to 4 times a day. I am afraid to call the number
 they gave me because than they will know they got to me. I do not want the calls to pick up in the amount of calls. I have blocked the numbers and another number pops up with the same message. I have reported it This is harassment and annoying! I would like
 to call that number with an Airhorn handy. -- The number they called me from was 866-260-0275. Do not bother answering&nbsp; if you get this number.</p>

<h2>            Movies bought in windows store.</h2>
                    My first buy in the windows store was a movie. Probably my last purchase, too. I assumed for my money I had purchased a movie just like from Walmart or wherever, just "digitally delivered". But when I tried to move it from my PC to a flash drive to put
 it on my laptop all I get is "target can't handle this type of file' or "file too large for device'. The movie is only 5 GB. I think I got nothing for my money, just a linkup to watch that movie, it was never even downloaded. I don't do internet on my laptop,
 only paying for that service for my PC. Have I been scammed by MSN? Or is there a way to make that movie file move?

<p>
</p><p>If it's FAT32, your maximum filesize is 4GB. You need to format it in exFAT or NTFS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could be wrong but these downloaded movies could have DRM so you need to authenticate&nbsp;your account to watch these movies.</p>

                    <p>Hello everyone. My name is Autumn and I am beginning my on line college course today. I am trying to open a pptm file that my instructor would like me to see, however I am unable to complete this task. I have Microsoft office 365, so I know that I have power
 point installed. When I click on the file to be opened it tells me that it is unable to do so. I have been to settings, I don't know how or if I should make power point a default setting. Can anyone help me?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

            Hi Autumn,
<br />
<br />If the file will not open by double clicking it:
<br />
<br />Open Powerpoint
<br />
<br />Then choose File - Open and navigate to that pptm file to open it from within Powerpoint

            Hi Autumn.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />To answer your question, yes you need to type Default into Start Search, open Default Apps, scroll down to Choose by File type, then to the .pp** files types to see that all of them (except html which is web based) are set to Powerpoint.  If not click on the app to change it.   
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Printer Queue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Printer Queue</h2>
                    
<p>Windows 7 Printer is Brother MFC-490CW.</p>
<p>Has been working fine since I got the computer (approximately 1 month ago) and downloaded the Win7 drivers from Brother. Several days ago it stopped printing. When I open the printer it shows many files waiting to be printed (None of which I initiated),
 sometimes upward of 2000 to 3000. The files are in pairs "shockwave flash object" (.SPL)&nbsp;and .SHD files (.SPL). File sizes are always the same 1kb and 3kb respectively)</p>
<p>I have uninstalled&nbsp;and reinstalled the printer software. I have stopped the printer spooler, deleted the files in windows/sys32/spool/printers and restarted the spooler. I have checked the printer subsystem (<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itprohardware/thread/ff17456a-3339-4dd8-a0b3-607d1a02ea8b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itprohardware/thread/ff17456a-3339-4dd8-a0b3-607d1a02ea8b</a>&nbsp;)
 and all appears well. But it still will not print and the aforementioned files start reappearing almost immediately and every few minutes it adds a few more. After 5-6 hours there are several thousand of them.</p>
<p>Any iseas?</p>

<p>spl files are the spool files , shd files are the scheduling files for the spl files.&nbsp; ShockWave uses the same file extension, if you uninstall ShockWave these will not longer be associated with the application.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp; sure there is a way to unassociate the
 file extension from the application as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the document name is Remote Downlevel document, check remote machines on your network for viruses.&nbsp; There was an old virus that would copy infected exe and com files to shares on a remote computer, this includes print shares.&nbsp; The exe files would print
 binary to the devices and waste paper which was an unintended consequence of the file copy operation.</p>

<h2>            0xc000000f  &#92;Windows&#92;system32&#92;ntkrnlpa.exe kernel is missing or corrupt - windows server 2008 r2</h2>
                    <p>After restoring Windows partition boot flag i got:</p>
<p>0xc000000f </p>
<p>\Windows\system32\ntkrnlpa.exe </p>
<p>kernel is missing or corrupt.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am using Windows Server 2008 R2 installed on 70GB primary &amp; active partition with proper MBR. &nbsp;It is not typical system - it is installed on notebook. &nbsp;After repairing broken BCD (from Windows 7 install DVD; server DVD doesn't have that tool :( ) that
 problem appeared. I know that this file (ntkrnlpa.exe) doesn't exist and it shouldn't. System couldn't boot any mode (even basic Safe Mode).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The disk may be the problem becouse PARAGON Hard Disk Manager 2011 has problems with mounting that partition but it browses it well (like other tools). Files looks good. Also CHKDSK didn't found any serious problems like bad sectors - it only fixed tiny
 problems.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What should I do?&nbsp;</p>

<h3>    say:</h3>
<h2>            Update to later version of Windows after system reinstall</h2>
                    <p>I don't know if it is associated with the 1803 update on May, but a couple of weeks ago,&nbsp; a problem with the recycle bin occured on my pc, and afterwards I was unable to boot in windows, urged to seek for a solution via my recovery disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, my concern is that I had to reinstall windows, and now I am back to ground zero (1507). I want to get back to windows 10 1709 or later. How am I able to achieve that without waiting for windows update to find the updates?</p>

<br />Please read the following: Fix Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from Defaulting to Home Instead of Pro
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:
<br />
<br />Once you have the Windows 10 Spring Creators Update ISO, you can double click it to mount it then start the upgrade.

If setup does not start automatically, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a system with limited space:

            Hi Δημήτριος, 
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<p>Just an FYI, although Sara is right if this doesn't help you need to ask there.</p>
<p>The points are only given if you renew your subscription by auto renewal, or use an xbox live card while you still have gold status. And you will receive the pending points when your last subscription ends.</p>

<pre><div><p /><p>I will be happy to assist you in resolving your issue with regard to being unable to open email messages in Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p><br />It is possible that Mail.MsMessageStore file was corrupted. Please follow the steps below on how to repair the file:<br /></p>
<p>1. Restart the computer (this is to ensure that Live Mail is fully shut down, and that none of it's components are in use when the computer starts)<br /></p>
<p>2. Click <strong>Start</strong>, type CMD but do not press enter<br /></p>
<p>3. You will see <strong>cmd.exe</strong> in the search results, right click on it and select
<strong>Run as Administrator</strong> - type your admin password if asked, and if UAC pops up asking permission, allow it<br /></p>
<p>4. You should now see the command prompt, with the following displayed:<br /></p>
<p>Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7600]</p>
<p>Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.<br /></p>
<p>C:\Windows\system32&gt; <br /></p>
<p>5. Copy the following (press Ctrl+C):<br /></p>
<p>esentutl.exe -d "%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Mail.MSMessageStore"<br /></p>
<p>Note: the "" are necessary<br /></p>
<p>6. Right click in the command prompt Window, and select <strong>Paste</strong>, so you now see the following:<br /></p>
<p>Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7600]</p>
<p>Copyright (c) 2009 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.<br /></p>
<p>C:\Windows\system32&gt;esentutl.exe -d "%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Mail.MSMessageStore"<br /></p>
<p>7. Press enter. esentutl will now defragment the Live Mail database file<br /></p>
<p>8. Once done, you can <strong>close</strong> the command prompt, and <strong>restart the PC again</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></pre>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem and after inserting&nbsp; the above command the Windows Live Mail doesnt want to open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you help?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

This happens to almost everyone who tries the defragmentation routine. The problem is this:

            Hi Trong.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.   
<br />
<br />Press "Windows" + "R" to open a "Run" box on the bottom of your screen.
<br />Step
<br />
<br />Type "Appwiz.cpl" in the "Run" box and click the "OK" button. This opens a new window on your screen.
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Click the "Turn Windows features on or off" link on the left pane. This opens the "Windows Features" dialog box.
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Remove the check mark next to "Tablet PC Components" and click the "OK" button. This displays a dialog box informing you that Windows is removing the feature. Click the "Restart Now" button to restart your computer.
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Press "Windows" + "R." Type "Appwiz.cpl" in the "Run" box and click "OK." Click the "Turn Windows features on or off" link on the left pane to go back to the "Windows Features" dialog box.
<br />
<br />Retart the PC and try opening the Snipping Tool again.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Trong, 
<br />
<br />This doesn’t speak exactly to your issue, but some of the fixes may actually kick the snipping tool in the butt so it works.

            This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.<br />You can try a couple things.<br /><br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.<br />Restart the computer.<br /><br />If that doesn't work then try this, <br /><br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.<br /><br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. <br />Press Enter key after each command:<br /><br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth<br /><br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth<br /><br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. <br />Restart your computer.

            Which Antivirus utility do you have installed?
<br />
<br />Try these first to see if they work:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system
<br />
<br />You can also try the following alternative option to Snipping Tool:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + Shift + S
<br />Make a selection
<br />
<br />Open Paint then paste your screenshot there.

            OK, let's try another approach.  Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

            Ok, we’re going to try a clean boot, then some scans that can fix corruptions within the OS. <br /><br />Perform a clean boot. <br /> Click Start and type: msconfig - Select System Configuration;<br /><br />Click Services on System Configuration - Click and select Hide all Microsoft services  - Click Disable all<br /><br />Click Startup on System Configuration - Click Open Task Manager<br /><br />Select each startup item on Startup and click Disable - Close Task Manager<br /><br />Click OK on Startup tab of System Configuration - Restart PC.<br /><br />If this fixes your issue, you can then enable the services one(or a couple) at time, reboot, and see who the offender is.<br /><br />If that doesn't solve the issue, we're going to run some scans to fix possible corruptions. <br /><br />- Click start, and type "cmd" - right click and run as admin<br />type: <br /><br />dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth <br /><br />and hit Enter<br />Wait for the process complete and type:<br /><br /> sfc

<h2>            Xbox one will not take commands from controller or kinect</h2>
                    After trying to update my avatar everything froze. I restarted the system and now I can't get it to do anything, it just sits there waiting for a command. When I put in a game it loads it up but then does nothing. The controller is connected and so is
 the kinect but niether does anything, it's like it's not receiving any of the data.

<p>When you have an issue it's always best to start your own thread.</p>
<p>Try hard resetting your Xbox One Curvy and see if that will fix your issue. </p>
