<h2>            &#34;Windows Setup is unable to locate a valid hard drive to store temporary installation files.&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>So, I purchased Windows 7 Premium through an online site that gives discounts to college students.</p>
<p>I got an .iso file, and when I run setup I first got the 0x80070005 error message, but I searched the forums, so I disabled my firewall, and it worked.</p>
<p>However, now when I try to install it, it says "Windows Setup is unable to locate a valid hard drive to store temporary installation files."</p>
<p>I have a 300 gig hard drive for my laptop, I backed up everything to a 1 terabyte external hard drive, and pretty much erased everything. I have 247 gigs avaliable, and it still will not install.</p>
<p>What do I do?!</p>
<p>*original title - Windows Vista Ultimate 64 bit to Windows 7 Premium 64 bit help! (Windows Setup is unable to locate a valid hard drive to store temporary installation files.)*</p>

<h2>            Will I lose my save games from deleting and then downloading my profile&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have this problem with Mass Effect 3 disc 2, now I read somewhere that a number of problems can be fixed by removing a profile from the console and dowloading it againg from server. I just want to make sure doing so will not delete my saved files and DLC
 etc. for other games that work just fine...</p>
<p>Thanks :-)</p>

<p>You don't have to, there is an option to keep save data. </p>
<p>However is there a reason why you need to delete your profile, if it is a problem with your profile often just redownloading the profile solves it, deleting the profile is a last resort</p>
If you do need to delete your profile, go through the stages carefully and don't click the option saying delete game saves

<p>Well, it was suggested that a few corrupted files in profiles would prevent from playing ME3 disc 2, these files are supposed to be connected to ME3 and will be 'rebuild' when starting the game up after restoring your profile</p>
<p>These new corrected files should solve my problems with this game (I hope...)</p>
<p>I'm not sure that redownloading my profile will have the same effect on those corrupted files..</p>

<h2>            BIOS update in computer with Windows 10 Pro Version 1709</h2>
                    <p>Hi... I'm Dave</p>
<p>My desktop computer has a Gigabyte Ultra Durable motherboard GA-990FXA-US3 (2012 vintage) and since a little while after I converted to Windows 10 Pro version 1709 from Windows 7 Pro operating system the computer would occasionally freeze.&nbsp;<span>The only
 way out is to unplug and start the computer again.&nbsp; </span>With update to OS 16299.64 the freezing has increased in occurrence.&nbsp; All other component drivers are recent except perhaps the BIOS. Is the BIOS the problem and how do I check it and update? Couldn't
 find any info on the computer about the Bios and I would prefer not to revert to a former state.</p>

<p>I did an Internet search and found this link to a BIOS update from 2015:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/GA-990FXA-UD3-rev-41#support-dl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/GA-990FXA-UD3-rev-41#support-dl</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are various revisions of that motherboard, but sometimes the BIOS will be the same. You can try to figure out which revision your motherboard is,
<del>but maybe the most recent BIOS is common to all of them</del>. (EDIT: I took a look at the oldest revision and it has a lot more BIOS options.) You can compare what is offered under each motherboard revision link at the top of that webpage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a good idea to update to the most recent BIOS.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Are you able to other .jpg pictures on your computer through Windows Photo viewer?</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> You may also perform a System File Checker (SFC) scan on your computer. SFC tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Refer the below article:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Check if you are able to view the same photo on another computer.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Step 3: </strong>You may also try viewing those photos through windows media player and paint applications.</p>
<p><br />
Here is how you do it:</p>
<p><br />
a.&nbsp;Right-click on one of the photo.<br />
b.&nbsp;Select <strong>Open with</strong> option.<br />
c.&nbsp;Now search for <strong>windows media player</strong> or <strong>Paint</strong>. If you don‚Äôt find those options then select<strong>Choose default program</strong> option. Now in the next window (Open with window) search for those programs&gt;select it&gt; click
 on<strong>OK</strong> button.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 activation within a VM on original hardware - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gilh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 activation within a VM on original hardware</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I hope you can advise. I've recently gained a new laptop from work that had new Windows 10 OS on it. I assume the Windows type was that of a digital licence as I successfully activated it using my Windows live.com account (and can't find any product
 number in the purchase paperwork). Then a Windows 10 boot iso was made using the Media Creator product. Since then the laptop has had a version of Linux installed on it and now I'm having to activate Windows 10 as a virtual machine running on top of the Linux
 system.</p>
<p>It would seem that the Windows VM can't see the actual motherboard as it is now failing to activate. I am again using my Windows live.com account to log into the Windows VM (successfully), which is why I assume the problem is with it not seeing the actual
 motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to activate Windows 10 in this situation? Many thanks for any advice.</p>

<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />You would need a way to extract the OEM BIOS key from within Linux in order to use it to reactivate Windows 10 in the VM.
<br />
<br />Here is an example how to get using the Terminal in Linux:

            <p>You should be able to recover your registry by performing a "System Restore".&nbsp; Unfortunately, you've posted in a Windows XP forum and I'm unsure how to do this in Windows Vista.&nbsp; Usually it's under:</p>
<p>&nbsp; Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Tools -&gt; System Restore.</p>
<p>Pick a restore date from before your blunder.</p>

            Hi CalCaliva
<br />
<br />Open a directory (folder ) in File Explorer
<br />
<br />In the address bar, type cmd and hit Enter
<br />
<br />That will open command prompt in that folder
<br />
<br />If you want to include all files, including sub-folders, paste this command into Command Prompt and hit Enter
<br />
<br />dir /a /s /b &gt; AAA.txt
<br />
<br />If you want to include all files, just from that folder, paste this command into Command Prompt and hit Enter
<br />
<br />dir /a /b &gt; AAA.txt
<br />
<br />Wait for the command to complete, then close Command Prompt
<br />
<br />You will then have a new Text file (AAA.txt) in that folder that will list the files, you can copy and paste that into Word, Excel . . . etc.

<div><span>Here are five ways:</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Select all the files, press and hold the shift key, then right-click and select Copy as path.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>This copies the list of file names to the clipboard.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>Paste the results into any document such as a txt or doc file &amp; print that.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Go to a command prompt and issue the command</span></div>
<div><span>dir [drive:folder] &gt; c:\tempfilename (you can use any name and put it in any folder you want)</span></div>
<div><span>Then open notepad, open tempfilename, and print it from there.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>3. Write (for example in Notepad) a 1-line text file:</span></div>
<div><span>DIR %1 /O &gt;LPT1:</span></div>
<div><span>Save it as "printdir.bat" in the "Send To" folder.</span></div>
<div><span>Then, to print list of files in any folder, right-click that folder and select Send to | printdir.bat</span></div>
<div><span>To include subfolders, change the command to DIR %1 /O/S &gt;LPT1:</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>4. Go to http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;Q321379 and follow the instructions there.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>5. Download and use any of the several freeware/shareware utilities that can do this, such as the popular

    <title>Windows 8.1 Pro watermark cannot remove - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Pro watermark cannot remove</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently tried the "sfc /scannow" command. It said it fixed corruptions and after a restart a "Windows 8.1 Pro" watermark showed. I tried to remove it using the&nbsp;My_WCP_Watermark_Editor.exe app. However, it gave me errors in various Modern Apps like the
 Windows Store app wherein it would crash whenever I type something in the search bar. I did the "sfc /scannow" command again and it fixed the Modern Apps errors but the watermark appeared again. Please help me remove this watermark it is very annoying. Please
 don't tell me to activate my Windows because it is already activated. I can use the Personalization settings in the start screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Btw this is what it looks like now because of the watermark editor app. It added the "Test Mode" and the "Build 9600"</p>

    <title>Like seriously how bad can windows 8 be&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Like seriously how bad can windows 8 be&#63;</h2>
                    I've upgraded to windows 8 from windows 7 and I am really frustrated. Such an unstable OS. It's not my problem the lack of start button, the stupid metro apps interface (that's only good for my mom and dad).&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-This OS is full of bugs... after 6 months of use I was forced to do a Refresh, that actually fixed my issues (missing text on some buttons of control panel) and windows installer corruption.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_update/kb2821895-windows-8-x64-update-06112013-problem/eed54c3d-37c2-4965-8974-3f323b4e8e24">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_update/kb2821895-windows-8-x64-update-06112013-problem/eed54c3d-37c2-4965-8974-3f323b4e8e24</a>&nbsp;
 -sfc /scannow buged after a windows update.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-Control panel takes a lot of time to view the category you select for unknown reason...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-Sometimes login to windows with a windows live account take like 1 min when usually taking 3sec.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-My mother's laptop came with windows 8. After some weeks of use suddenly metro apps stoped being able to update or download, stucking at pending. After 5 hours of google searching same issues I tried the refresh which thank god it worked.... But once
 again all installed programs gone.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Seriously!!! I spend more time on fixing and googling rather than actually enjoying windows... I do not have any viruses in my pc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I really don't understand why you released that OS, it's pretty clear that it is full of bugs. Do we have an ETA when there's a massive Bugs Fix? Service pack or smth? Will windows 8.1 fix stability issues?</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Windows 10 enters sleep mode even though settings shouldn&#39;t allow it.</h2>
                    I am so sick and tired of struggling with fixing the power options for my computer, it was shutting off after not touching my keyboard after like 3 minutes and I fixed it after struggling with it! And now it's doing it again and all the settings are still
 the same...I've changed nothing. I have all options to sleep NEVER and advanced power options have all been changed so I don't have to deal with a computer that goes to sleep all the damn time. Could someone PLEASE tell how to fix this terrible Windows 10
 garbage?

            Hi Sabrina
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Sometimes your computers firmware, which deals with things like power management, which is related to sleep needs to be updated. Remember, the issue you are experiencing here is outside of Windows, where its not resuming from sleep. Windows is in a saved state on the hard disk and can't manage the hardware resources, thats left up to Firmware (your BIOS) to handle. So, its obvious this more a hardware issue than software, but updated driver software can fix it. 
<br />Another possible issue is, you are using an "intelligent" power adaptor with a master socket in which the computer is plugged in triggering sleep. 
<br />
<br /> It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters.
<br />
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Here are some steps to update drivers.

<p>I recently had this issue and was able to resolve the problem by going into <strong>
Device Manager</strong> and expanding <strong>Monitors</strong>. After expanding <strong>
Monitors</strong>, go to the top of the <strong>Device Manager</strong> window and select
<strong>View</strong>, then click Show <strong>Hidden Devices</strong>. Afterward, go back to
<strong>Monitors&nbsp;</strong>and see if you have more than one driver listed for this category. Mine had 4 total drivers listed for my computer. Only one of them was not grayed out. I uninstalled the grayed out drivers and rebooted the PC. Problem was solved for
 me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So actions were:</p>
<p><strong>Device </strong><strong>Manager</strong>&gt;expand <strong>Monitors</strong>&gt;Click&nbsp;<strong>View</strong>&gt;select
<strong>Show Hidden Devices</strong>&gt;<strong>Uninstall </strong>any Grayed out devices shown under
<strong>Monitors</strong>&gt;<strong>Reboot</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterward, problem solved.</p>

<p>Thank you that did help.&nbsp; Once I had the clean boot, I just went ahead and installed everything I had back logged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only change to my computer was that this started after my "forced" changeover to Win 10.&nbsp; I was trying to keep Win 7 because it was compatible with US oil and gas royalty programs that I had to access.&nbsp; That was why I was trying to get a template to
 make a local machine Enterprise list so I can still access those sites without remembering to check Enterprise on the Tools every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had tried too many steps to list from many sites, that is why I didn't list them.&nbsp; The only ones I didn't try were the ones that wanted me to change the registry - figured I had enough problems without messing that up too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am assuming going forward that the only way to figure out which program is the problem is to just sit down and disable a group at a time and do the reboot, until I find a group that messes it up, then try one at a time in the group to find the specific
 one?&nbsp; Thank you for your assistance!</p>

            Hi Omkar, most likely this is caused by your Network card device driver, however, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

    <title>Lifecam HD-6000 autofocus issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> todd2371  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lifecam HD-6000 autofocus issues</h2>
                    I just purchased a Microsoft LifeCam HD-6000. &nbsp;Sounds nice, looks nice, but the autofocus on it makes the product useless.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The autofocus takes a crisp image, and for no apparent reason, sends the image to totally blurry and then refocuses (to crisp infocus) about every 20 seconds, and the process takes about 5 seconds to complete. &nbsp;This&nbsp;is very annoying and basically makes the
 unit non-functional - every 20 seconds I go totally out of focus and then come back in focus, then repeat 20 sec later.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found out how to turn off the 'Truecolor' image adjustments, which turns the autofocus off completely (but also turns off all the auto exposure control, etc as well, which is unfortunate). &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
How do I get the autofocus to not reset itself every few seconds but still retain the 'truecolor' automation for color, brightness, whitebalance, backlighting, exposure, etc.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Unfortunately, to contact microsoft support (link listed above), one must have a product identification number (<span>Example: 12345-xxx-7654321-98765). &nbsp;The Lifecam HD-6000 does not have one printed on the device, and the packaging
 only has a Serial number and a model number (neither of which work in the product ID tool). &nbsp;Therefore, no support. &nbsp;Where is the product identification number on a HD-6000?</span>

<p>Summary so far for anyone who reads this:</p>
<p>1) HD-6000 has autofocus issues that make it largely non-functional (as of 3.22 drivers). &nbsp;I've now found several other web articles that cite this, with no fix. &nbsp;Shame on me for not doing good research before purchasing.</p>
<p>2) Help from Microsoft is basically non-existent, see string of notes above. &nbsp;Still no contact with anyone who can provide meaningful assistance. &nbsp;Cannot gain access to hardware support team. &nbsp;Only option is to pay $35/hour to fix a brand new $50 device.</p>
<p>3) Next action: &nbsp;Return product, review badly online, buy Logitech. &nbsp;Spread the word.</p>

<p>Hi Todd,</p>
<p>This is the Windows Vista Hardware support forum. I will do what I can but your question belongs in the proper forum:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/xphardware/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/xphardware/threads</a></p>
<p>That may be why you are not getting the issue resolved.</p>
<p>Many of the answers you will receive in this forum are for Vista.</p>
<p>I see that the device requires a USB 2.0 port to operate correctly.</p>
<p>Does your computer have USB 2.0 ports?</p>
<p>Do you have SP2 installed on this XP computer?</p>
<p>What model/brand computer are you using?</p>
<p>I was researching your requests and I found this information:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fq82pka.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pE0vkcDVb25UIEhLZZbDDwEwUSp2wCjCxmWn1Lz6QdjxnYFpk_7RIPpbsLAj8fsuu_nf6X8PCu8O8CPJW1WS6cxSVdcVogdaG%2fPIN.PNG%3fpsid%3d1" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed the link provided on that page:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fq82pka.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pJMvUK3Zs9dmcCg0JIaZdYg_HMUYGHR-0CwF30WFHxF7CatHzD9oz-VF-a0qo6MDAHvcogp4-VKsOT4llfiCV9_daLrxNMMLv%2fPID_locate.PNG%3fpsid%3d1" /></p>
<p>It seems the PID should be located in the product software.</p>
<p>I suggest using the directions outlined in the screen shot to see if the PID is located there.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By the way, the LifeCam software does not have a Menu Bar where you can click 'Help" and "About Microsoft<em>product name</em>" so still no way to access support as there is no product identification number.</p>
<p>This is XP SP2 with USB2, running LifeCam ver 3.22.270.0</p>

<p>Hi Todd,</p>
<p>I see that the solution for that that issue was replacement hardware.</p>
<p>As this was new, I suggest returning the device if possible to get a replacement.</p>
<p>My&nbsp;apologies&nbsp;for the incorrect information concerning the PID.</p>
<p>This link may help:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/pidwin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/gp/pidwin</a></p>
<p>I see that the Windows PID is the same format the hardware support is asking for.</p>
<p>That was identified by Srinivas earlier in this thread:</p>
<p><span>"To contact the Microsoft Webcam support, you can try to type in the Windows 7 product key and try to contact the Webcam support team."</span></p>
<p><span><span>However I must have missed it. Vista should have the same format PID to enter for support.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.</span></span></p>

            Microsoft has many issues with software and hardware as well! While they do a huge amount of job, something can go wrong. It is normal.
<div>
<div><span><span>But
 the worst thing that I dislike in this business, and especially in Microsoft, that it does not wish to admit their failures, and continue selling bad products, and refuse any support at every opportunity. Function of auto-focus&nbsp; of camera simply pure aggravator!
 All we asking for, it is opportunity to disable auto-focus, which is not conserved after off, and start again with each new launch any program using the camera.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>Running
 Vista Biz. edition, but the same story on my Acer laptop and other tests of Win 7. I have to admit, that under Ubuntu, this issue remain, but has different behavior, while driver just installs in seconds automatically with no problems.</span></span></div>

                    <p>Every time I turn on my XP laptop that end of XP service popup turns on. I have no intention of upgrading my xp computer since the 2 programs I have on there crash on both win 7 and win 7 pro virtual xp. The popup is annoying&nbsp;and I can't seem to get it disabled.&nbsp;
 How can I do this?</p>

            <p>Well, my&nbsp;CrystalBall¬© is in the shop for polishing so who knew you were referring to Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE)?</p>

<p>
</p><p>...the only way to "turn it off" is to uninstall MSE. If you do so, you will NOT be able to install it again. See

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>The file extension .a00 is one component of a larger ARJ archive file (kind of like a .zip file but split into multiple pieces).&nbsp; A large file (such as a movie) will be split up into smaller files (makes it easier to download, especially
 when using usenet newsgroups). The archive will usually come in a series of file with extensions starting with .a00 and going on in sequence .a01, .a02, .ao3‚Ä¶and so on. &nbsp;This is not a Microsoft supported file format so a 3 party program will be
 needed to assemble all the pieces of the archive back together again.</p>
<p>You can find more information about this file format by searching the internet using the keywords ‚Äú.a00‚Äù and ‚ÄúFile Format‚Äù or can read more about this file format at
<a href="http://www.ehow.com/facts_6797458_file-extension-a00_.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/facts_6797458_file-extension-a00_.html</a>
