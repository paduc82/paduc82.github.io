<h2>            Windows 10 installation stuck at 74&#37;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I was trying to upgrade from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 via Media Creation Tool. Everything is OK, until the installation. It says my computer will be restarted several times and that it might take a while. Well it always get stuck at 74% and no matter how
 long I wait, it just won't move.</p>
<p>I'll be glad for every help.</p>

            So I've deleted everything from Windows/SoftwareDistribution/Downloads and tried it for the 4th time. And it worked! It didn't take longer than 20 minutes. So thanks everyone for the help.

            <p>I'm having this exact issue. The answer provided below points to a thread discussing finding a device and does not appear to be related to the actual problem. It seems based on the amount of people who have marked that they also had this question that there
 is something more going on here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see the hard drive activity light blink on occasion but have been stuck at 74% for about an hour now. This is not 74% progress while downloading or 74% progress of identifying devices, it's the initial "Installing Windows 10" screen with, as the OP said,
 the text that says "Your PC will restart several times. This might take a while."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that at the 74% mark the installation is doing something that legitimately takes this long? I really would prefer not to cancel and start over repeatedly (as the OP did to finally get it to work).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is supposed to be the "Wahoo" for Microsoft... the one that solves the issues so many of us experienced in moving to 8. Thus far, not a positive one.</p>

</p><p>The information which you have provided is not enough for us to determine the issue. Please provide us more information.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you upgrading Windows using Windows update or Media creation tool?</li></ol>
<p>Issues with installation are being resolved by <span>disabling/uninstalling the Antivirus software</span> and also by unplugging the e<span>xternal devices
</span>(including the Windows 10 USB install media as soon as the PC restarts for the first time during the upgrade).</p>
<p>

<p>My laptop came preinstalled win 10.</p>
<p>Its been updated many times but now during recent update &nbsp;it stuck at 74% .</p>
<p>Screen says -&gt; configuring update for win 10 , 74% complete , do not turn off your computer( blue background with ring animation working).</p>
<p>It is stuck at 74% for nearly 24 hours, and i dont want to take a risk of restart coz i don't have any recovery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes i really wonder why Microsoft's update system is worse in this whole &nbsp;world , even if they got one of the best os.</p>

            <p>Hello Tim,</p>
<p>The generic answer to your question is as many GB's as you can afford and that fit on your motherboard.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Specifically, your motherboard will drive what memory you get and how much memory you can fit on the board. For example on my system my motherboard will only accept 4 memory modules up to a maximum of&nbsp;16 GB. The MB manual further specifies the specific type
 (frequency etc.) of&nbsp;memory you can use. Mine can be single sided or double sided, DDR3 but not DDR2, 1800Mz etc. .</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you don't have the manual for your MB, go to the manufacturer's site and download it&nbsp;from there. It'll have the info you need. Take the info to a web retailer such as Newegg.com or TigerDirect.com and match it their offerings. The other approach is to
 go to a memory manufacturer's site and use their memory configurator (PNY and Crucial are two examples), which will select the correct type and amount of memory that&nbsp;will fit on your motherboard. You can then shop at a (web) retailer for the best deal.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope this helps; keep me posted.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

 with the 486 cpus&nbsp; so I know there is some things you need to know and under stand to make a good chose&nbsp; sorry if the spelling is not to good I do my best !

            Curious - You already have RAM on this motherboard and are upgrading the cpu and gpu, yes ?<br />
What RAM are you using now, and how much ?<br />
If you already have 8GB you don't really need more. No game uses close to 8GB <br />
(BF3, FC3 and&nbsp; Crysis 2 barely reach 4GB use, and that includes Win7 using about 1.35GB on my setup), and&nbsp; changing the cpu should not affect the RAM.
<br />
<br />
If you don't have 8GB already buy more of the same brand with the same timings and voltage<br />
&nbsp;(I prefer sticking with two sticks, personally). 8GB RAM can be had for between $70 / 90.<br />
If you are already using 1600MHz RAM there is no real need to go with faster RAM as you will
<br />
not see any real world performance gain in games.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if motherboard mfg's kept their 'qualified vendors' list up to date, but they don't<br />
and&nbsp; ASUS don't even your ASUS M5A99FX Pro R2.0 on their list (it may be on their site somewhere,<br />
but it didn't show on the main page for memory recomendations when running a search).
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/M5A99FX_PRO_R20/#specifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/M5A99FX_PRO_R20/#specifications</a><br />
<br />
Note the following from the specs above -<br />
<i>* Due to CPU spec., AMD 100 series CPUs support up to DDR3 1066MHz. With ASUS design, this motherboard can support up to DDR3 1333MHz.<br />
</i><br />
I've found that running 1600MHZ RAM on a motherboard that defaults to either of the above<br />
speeds results in lower latency, so there can be a <i>small</i> performance with gaming when running 1600MHz RAM at either 1066 or 1333MHz.<br />
However, if you intend over-clocking ( never found it necessary, but people like doing it) a faster<br />
RAM may be in order - 1866MHz may be a good idea. <br />
Having said that, from what you said, you don't seem to be knowledgeable enough at this point
<br />
to be over-clocking,&nbsp; so you may want to do more homework before exploring this or suffer
<br />
instability in your system and game play. You would also want an after-market cooler if OC'ing.<br />
<br />
Also - May I ask why you are buying 2 GTX560's (or are they being given to you ? ) instead of one
<br />
of the 700 or 600 series cards. Say a GTX770, GTX760, GTX660ti (depending on your budget).
<br />
While you seem to have already used SLI. SLI is fraught with issues. A lot of games don't support it properly and it is also known to increase the chance of 'stutter' in many games.
<br />
Another problem with SLI is it does not double up on the VRAM , so 2 GTX560,s still only make<br />
use of&nbsp; 1GB VRAM. <br />
More games are using over 1GB VRAM lately, and the newer 700 and 600 series series cards all
<br />
have 2GB VRAM.<br />
A single more powerful card is always less prone to issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

            I am runing 4GB XMS Memory kit for dual channel systems, 1333MHz, 9-9-9-24, 1.5V<br />
that is 2X 2GB a totle of 4<br />
and the info on the video has been heard will look in to then when I go to buy <br />
<br />
my windows ratint is&nbsp; :<br />

gameing graphics: &nbsp; &nbsp; 7.6<br />
Primary Hard Disk : &nbsp;&nbsp; 7.8 &nbsp;&nbsp; was at 7.9 but droped for some reason !<br />
<br />
So I need more memory&nbsp; I had&nbsp; 2 other moduals the rating was 7.5 but they went bad and started crashing my sys I remove then and it seams to stay runing with just 4Gb of ram but it did run smuther with the other memory in till it died!!<br />
<br />
all in all not to bad of a rating LOL. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

            <p>Hello Tim,</p>
<p>You have all the information you need to buy more memory. You take those specs to I'd suggest an online retailer (Newegg and TigerDirect are two excellent ones that I use) and match that to the memory they sell. Its really that simple.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>One caveat:&nbsp; check your manual one more time and see if it has "suggestions" about the type of memory that works best with the motherboard. For example, mine says if I'm only going to use 2 sticks, they're better placed in slots 1 and 3. Look too to see
 if the board "prefers" single sided or dual sided memory sticks (mine prefers double sided).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>One thing I don't see you mentioned, so I will. For anything over 3 GB of RAM you need to be running the 64 Bit version of Windows to take advantage of the memory - Windows run as a 32 Bit system can't use more than about 3.5 GB of RAM.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope this helps; keep me posted.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>
<p><br />

            <i>"Primary Hard Disk : &nbsp;&nbsp; 7.8 &nbsp;&nbsp; was at 7.9 but droped for some reason !"</i><br />
- Maybe you hadn't run Disk Cleanup or defraged the HDD around the time of the test ?<br />
<br />
Just a couple of examples of RAM to get you started (in addition to the Corsair XMS) -<br />
If you stay with 1333MHz -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820148653</a><br />
<br />
1600MHz -&nbsp; <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231416" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231416</a><br />
<br />
Notice that I'm steering you in the direction of low rise RAM. Those so called heatsinks with<br />
big teeth on them don't really do anything to help keep the RAM cool, and can get in the way
<br />
of after-market coolers should you decide to use one later.<br />
<br />
Allow me to drift well off topic -<br />
- Speaking of coolers - If your case does not have a large opening on the motherboard tray to<br />
give access to the cpu backing plate it could save you some trouble (depending on the cooler)<br />
if you&nbsp; install an after-market cooler now.<br />
I don't know how loud the stock coolers on the FX series are, but the fan on my Phenom II 965 was<br />
a howler. My Intel i5 3750 was pretty bad too, so I opted for after-market coolers and their quiet fans.<br />
<br />
You could put some of the $200- you were planning on spending on the RAM toward a cooler.<br />
Some examples below -<br />
- This cooler uses a relatively small fan - 92mm , and an easy mounting setup <br />
(except that apparently, it only mounts in one direction. Not so good unless your case has top exhaust fan)&nbsp; Not cheap,&nbsp; but very quiet.<br />
<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835186065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835186065</a><br />
<br />
- The Coolermaster Hyper 212 EVO is good value but a bit large (120mm fans) and you would need to verify your&nbsp; case is wide enough (using one with my Intel cpu).<br />
The mounting is also a bit tricky, and somewhat scary as it does not clamp as tight as most coolers,.<br />
so you have to be careful when first mounting not to twist it.<br />
<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835103099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835103099</a><br />
<br />
- Another good 92mm option, but you'd need to verify AM3+ compatibilty.<br />
<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835103064" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835103064</a><br />
<br />
- They have a special promo on Noctua coolers atm, but you would want to verify if the models that are compatible with AM3 socket cpu's&nbsp; are also compatible with AM3 + .
<br />
I've been using the<i> Noctua NH U9B</i> with my Phenom II 965 for about four years.<br />

</blockquote>
Ah! Right - Primary 'Hard Disk'&nbsp; I didn't look at your specs again, did I ?<br />
<br />
No you don't defrag an SSD, but should still run Disk Cleanup. <br />
Especially after doing Windows Updates. They have a recent update that helps keep the winsxs
<br />
folders size down via Disk Cleanup as well.<br />
A too full TEMP folder can slow performance too (probably not as much on an SSD as HDD though),
<br />
but combined, these may take a point of the score.<br />
<br />
Or maybe it is just a case of you have done a lot of this and that and your machine hadn't
<br />
been at idle long enough for 'Garbage Collection' when you did the new Windows test ?<i><br />
</i>( Just a couple of guesses, I pay no attention to the Windows rating - except now = 7.9 for Primary HD)<br />

<h2>            Sunset overdrive decided to delete itself after installing the midnight update &#40;digital&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I pre-downloaded sunset overdrive and it took 8-9 hours to download. This is fine since it was at a time when nobody else was playing it. The download of the game finished a few days ago and I was all set to play it at midnight. At about 00:05 I came onto
 my xbox and went into my games and apps to start playing the game. I select the game and it takes me to the store. (I think this bit is normal since destiny took me to the store come midnight for that) There was the option "install" I selected it hoping it
 would install the small update for sunset which would allow me to play it but It was updating very slowly. This is when I realized that my hard drive space went down in percentage and it was installing the whole game again.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons why I canceled my Sunset overdrive at GAME UK and went digital was because I could play the game at midnight. Now it seems I wont be able to play it for a number of hours and I will have to leave my Xbox fully on all night as there
 is an issue with the download percentage going back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This glitch isn't just effecting me, I saw a tweet on twitter about it and one of the replies I got on reddit was from someone with the same problem&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/2ku44b/uk_player_sunset_overdrive_has_been_stuck/cloqa87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/2ku44b/uk_player_sunset_overdrive_has_been_stuck/cloqa87</a></p>

<p>I am unsure if Xbox support are aware of this issue but it really does annoy people and should be fixed.</p>
<p>luckily the game size is around 20GB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nobody should experience this with games like Halo MCC and advanced warfare which are more than double in terms of size.</p>

<p>I have the exact same problem with Sunset. I pre-purchased and pre-loaded The Legend Of Korra, Fantasia, Shadow of Mordor and even the Evolve beta ahead of time. They all unlocked with no issue at 12:01am but not Sunset Overdrive. I checked this morning
 on "my games and apps" and "manage game" that everything was properly installed.</p>
<p>Sunset is my most anticipated game of the year and I was very much looking forward to play a bit of the game at midnight.</p>
<p>I tried to talk with support on the chat, just to know why it was happening and how to avoid seeing it happen again. Sadly the person I was chatting with didn't seem to understand what I was saying, I had to quit the chat because I was about to stop being
 polite.</p>
<p>I have Assassin Creed Unity, Halo MCC, Dragon Age 3 and Lego Batman 3 all pre-loaded on my console. I need to be sure those games will not be wiped and download again from % on launch day.</p>

<p>Hopefully this doesn't happen to me with the Master Chief Collection. It has a 45GB download as well as a 20GB patch. If it starts the entire download again at midnight on launch day, I'm going to be ***, as downloading ahead of time and playing at midnight
 was the sole reason I decided to go digital rather than get it on a disc.</p>

<p>I pre-ordered the digital edition SPECIFICALLY to avoid having to download/ install for hours on release. I spent more than the standard game's value on energy drinks, pizzas and supplies, I booked a week off of work, so that I can properly have a 24-hour
 run from the get-go, and actually utilise my double XP. Aaaand it's re-installing the whole game that I planned for days to avoid doing. There is no fix. This is a &nbsp;disaster of a release, and for the biggest release of the xbox one's history yet. A f**k-up
 of huge proportions, from lack of proper testing. I hope this completely blows up in gaming journalism/ media in order for MS to get their crap together. I didn't go through all of this for another 10+hour progress bar. I'm now cheated out of my day zero and
 2x XP because MS didn't bother to test their biggest release yet. Absolutely livid. Being cheated out of my bonuses I paid for through faulty service errors is unacceptable. I want compensation in some form.</p>

<p>Now that it's happening on a larger scale with COD AW, this is finally gonna be investigated. It happened to me with Forza Horizon 2. Because it was the first time I pre-ordered and pre-downloaded on the xbox one I thought I made a mistake during the unlock
 (even If Shadow of Mordor, unlocked perfectly at the same time). Since then I successfuly pre-purchased, pre-loaded and unlock Fantasia, Korra and even the Evolve Alpha. So when it happened again with Sunset Overdrive I knew something was up. I tried to chat
 with support about it, but the guy on the other end didn't understand what I was talking about. He kept saying that I needed to go through settings with him to increase my download speed, that it's not because of microsoft because they only put the games on
 when the publisher tells them to... He even refused to acknowledge that he didn't understand what was my problem. I really believed no one else was having this problem and Microsoft was not going to investigate it.</p>
<p>So yes, I'm sorry for you COD players but I'm kind of relieved to know that now Microsoft will look into it. And yes people who bought CODAW will probably get a compensation from microsoft while guys like me who had the same issue with Forza Horizon 2 or
 Sunset Overdrive will not get anything.</p>

<p>THis happened to me on SSOD too. &nbsp;My pre-load unlocked and then tried to download something even though it was at 100%. &nbsp;It never finished so I had to delete it and download again.</p>
<p>However, I had installed an external hard drive since I pre-loaded SSOD and asked the XBox to install everything to the external in future.</p>
<p>It may have been that I caused the issue with SSOD by confusing it with the external. &nbsp;I have MCC pre-loaded too so I have asked the X-Box to install everything on internal for now - don't want any problems with that beast!</p>

            Hi Brian
<br />
<br />Find that app either in the alphabetical list of installed apps on your Start Menu, right click that and choose 'Pin to Start'
<br />
<br />That's It!

            Click the start button and find the app you want to add.
<br />Then right click it and select pin to start.
<br />Once it is on the start menu you can drag it around or right click it and select Resize to make it smaller or bigger.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Built-in apps are pinned to Start Menu by default.
<br />
<br />If you install new apps, they should be automatically added to Start Menu &gt; All apps list. 
<br />
<br />From there, right click on apps and select Pin to Start.
<br />
<br />Regards.

            that is the problem, its not in the list of installed apps, if it was then I could use it to set my default programs. The one particular app is the Apache Open Office program.

            Hi Brian
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, then just type open office
<br />
<br />Does Open Office appear in the resulting list?
<br />
<br />If so, right click that and choose 'Pin to Start'

            I had problems with another WU install (can't recall the KB number) but was able to download and install it manually.&nbsp; One thing that might shed some light on this error is that I had to answer some prompts during manual installation - never asked during
 normal install during a WU install.

<p><strong><span>I just got my new computer and my TV (Insignia 22" LED) a few weeks earlier. I went to go hook it up with a VGA cord.
 It worked for a couple of days. Today, the screen appears to have wavy colors and I can't see a thing. So, I went to go on my other monitor it works fine. I know my new TV works fine, I mean I've tried other things on it. Is their a specific resolution it
 has to be on? I'm thinking maybe if its below recommended then its becoming distorted. I don't really know but I need help please!</span></strong></p>

<div>Hi Tyler Chester,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Do you remember any changes to your computer prior to the issue occurring?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In the meantime, you may follow these steps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1: Update display drivers.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>your graphic card might may need an updated driver to support Insignia 22" LED.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'd suggest you follow the steps given in the below article and check if it helps resolve the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Update drivers: recommended links<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2: Change display settings.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>To change the display settings, you may go through these steps.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Open the "display settings" in your computer(Click start, in the search box type "display") and activate Output to the TV screen. You can either mirror content of your computer on the TV or extend the display just like a dual monitor screen.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>b. Pick up your TV remote and switch to "External Inputs" from the menu. You will need to change the default "Video 1" to a different selection which may be "HDMI 1/VGA" or "Video 2" depending on how you have made the connection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Important: </strong>Make sure you connect the cable to the TV before turning on the computer as sometimes it may fail to recognize external display.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Connect television</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may also need to change the screen resolution of your TV using the Display settings in your Control Panel else the picture may appear distorted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi Azeez,</p>
<p>Yes, I did make one change when I was playing a game and I changed my resolution to 1024 by accident and now its stuck at 1024. When I went on a different monitor it won't let me change it, see it would stay at that monitors resolution. I could not go higher,
 so I'm not exactly sure what to do but I'm thinking if I get a graphics card this would probably fix it since I'd be running DVI instead of VGA. Not to mention I could run an update on the new graphics card so it would run with my Insignia 22". Keep in mind
 this is a desktop.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have anything else that would help me.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Tyler</p>

<p>Hi Tyler,</p>
<p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p>When you say that the resolution is stuck at 1024, do you mean that the resolution will not change from 1024 to another resolution or that it will not go higher than 1024?</p>
<p>On this page I noticed the resolution should be set at 1080 vertical resolution, as it appears to be 1024 vertical resolution at the moment.</p>

<p>You may need to lower the&nbsp;resolution&nbsp;to 1080 for it to function properly with the TV.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're sorry to hear this.&nbsp; May we know what steps have you tried doing so far which you mentioned you found over the internet? This issue maybe due to either a software or hardware issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try to do the following steps to see if this would wake up your device from sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. <span><span><span><span>Press Ctrl + Shift + Windows + B. - this should </span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span><span>reinitialize the display driver of your device.&nbsp; It is like jump starting a car.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>2. </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both.
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>The said step may boot up your device in the UEFI environment which is normal,
</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>and means that the Surface display is working. The device was in an off state.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>If the first two steps does not work, let's plug in your device power chord (PSU) and then take note / check if the adapter lits up.&nbsp; If it does, we would like you to take note of the color of the light.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>While the PSU is connected, try to power on the device and see if it turns on.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>Let's see if these initial steps would work and if they don't, please feel free to return to the thread and inform us.</span></span></span></span></p>

    <title>Deleted Paging File, low memory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keithh&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleted Paging File, low memory</h2>
                    <p>Hey all, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently deleted my paging file to boost computer performance. I have 4 gbs of ram and figured that would be sufficient in running my meager background apps. But now, whenever I open a web browser or do more than one thing on my computer, I am warned about
 low memory. <br />
<br />
What really bothers me right now is my overall computer speed has increased since I deleted my paging file, but I cannot multitask. Should my 4 gigs be sufficient? Or do I really need to re-add my paging file,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keith</p>

            <p>All of this depends and you have not given us enough information to really be of much use</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some apps require a page file.&nbsp; With no page file if you crash the logs cannot be saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting the page file will NEVER make it faster, it will only force more memory to be used and if you are running a lot of things you may not have enough to spare (as indicated by your low memory warning)</p>
<p>

            <p>So the main benefit I was hoping to glean from deleting my paging file was to, yes force, my computer to use more RAM and less virtual memory (being that RAM is faster than re purposed hard drive space).
</p>
<p>My experience in the past is that deleting a paging file when there is adequate RAM available will improve performance. I guess now my 4 GBs is insufficient? I guess I am a bit shocked as to what web browsers actually require in terms of resources. I am
 also a bit shocked that my system will idle while using nearly 2 gbs of ram. (ESET antivirus is installed)<br />
<br />
So the low memory warning comes because there might not be enough space to save a log in the event of a crash?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll include my dxdiag file. I'd really appreciate any advice in terms of improving performance.<br />
<br />
Thanks ZigZag<br />

    <title>Games wont load after updating AMD Radeon HD 7450 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rob_960  say:</h3>
<h2>            Games wont load after updating AMD Radeon HD 7450</h2>
                    After installing this update and restarting my computer I can not load any games. My desktop gadgets also stop working and will not come on. The only thing that works for me is to undo the install. I recently purchased Batman Arkham Knight on PC and have
 been unable to play the game due to lag even though my computer meets the requirements and I was thinking this update is what I need in order to play the game. Im running win 7 &nbsp;SP1 - 10 GB RAM - 1TB HD - &nbsp;AMD FX six core processor 64 bit - Direct X 11. Any
 advise would be greatly appreciated.

            <p>Bats Arkham Knight is so badly bugged that WB has recalled if from sale while they</p>
<p>set about fixing it's apparently copious number of problems - latest estimated fix date is Sept.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your other games are still running smoothly you may need to wait. </p>
<p>If other games are also having problems you may want to do a clean reinstall of the recent drivers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- "<em>undo the install</em>" - </p>
<p>If this means you 'rolled' the drivers back via Device Manager a clean reinstall may help.</p>
<p>Note that using Windows Updates or Device Manager is not recommended for graphics card drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However ...Unless running the game at a low resolution, your HD7450 will struggle with this game.<br />
</p>
<p>There do not seem to be any system spec sites which mention a AMD minimum graphics card, but</p>
<p>they do all list the Nvidia GTX660 as the minimum. The GTX 660 is equivalent to the AMD HD7850,
</p>
<p>which is far more powerful than the HD7450.</p>
<p>eg - Passmark scores -</p>
<p>HD7450 = 323</p>
<p>HD7850 = 3742 (GTX660 = 4116)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note that 10GB RAM is not an optimal configuration. If you have two sticks of 4GB you should be able to</p>
<p>just go with them.</p>
<p>There is no game that approaches 8GB (including Windows) of system RAM use, and the extra 2GB
</p>
<p>could result in lower performance than if using 2X4GB, even if the speed, timings and voltage are the same.</p>
<p>No RAM mfg will guarantee stability unless using factory matched RAM kits.</p>
<p>

            I used system restore to go back a few days before installing the update. As far as RAM, does it hurt to have extra? This is what the computer came with. I know I will either have to wait for the August update to play Batman or need a new graphics card.
 I'll wait and see. I just wanted to know why games will not load after the AMD update. As far as gadgets goes, I'm running win X now so no gadgets for me anymore.

            <p><em>"I'm running win X now "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Win10 may still have a few(dozens ?) wrinkles to sort out. The AMD (and Win 10 on this site) forums
</p>
<p>would be the place to find out what problems people are having with Win10 and AMD drivers, if any.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"...I just wanted to know why games will not load after the AMD update"</em>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a fair guess that, if problems started after updating the drivers, that the driver install&nbsp; was corrupt,
</p>
<p>so you should do a clean install of the drivers as a first step to eliminate the drivers as the source of
</p>
<p>the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"<em>I used system restore to go back a few days before installing the update..."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done this from time to time if there were serious issues, and it may be OK most of the time, but if there</p>
<p>is instability or poor performances a clean install needs to be tried. </p>
<p>- Clean installs aren't generally necessary, but when there are problems this is the best way to assure the
</p>
<p>driver install is not corrupt.</p>
<p>- I get a good result by first uninstalling the graphics driver, and any component parts that may not uninstall</p>
<p>with the main graphics driver (HD audio, etc) via Programs and Features, and after rebooting the machine,</p>
<p>run <em>Driver Fusion</em> or similar driver uninstall/cleaning software to 'clean' remaining files.</p>
<p>(I haven't used AMD for a couple of years, and the people over at AMD may have another driver tool,</p>
<p>or clean install suggestion).</p>
<p><a href="http://treexy.com/external?url=http://download.cnet.com/Driver-Fusion/3000-2086_4-75748005.html?part=dl-&amp;subj=dl&amp;tag=button&amp;dlm=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Treexy - Driver Fusion</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being careful to select only the AMD<em> graphics</em> components, run Driver Fusion and allow it to delete the files</p>
<p>it has located. </p>
<p>Reboot the machine again and install the drivers of choice. </p>
<p>- Note that the latest drivers are not always the best for your hardware. Use the driver that works best on your machine.</p>
<p>More so as a graphics card series ages. While newer drivers may have an optimisation for Bats it would be</p>
<p>more for special effects that your current gpu would not run effectively anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"does it hurt to have extra? This is what the computer came with."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thinking more of if you had added an extra 2GB. <br />
If the machine came with 10GB you at least know the RAM has properly matched specifications, but it's</p>
<p>largely a marketing exercise. You would have to be doing some serious multi-tasking to use over 8GB.</p>
<p>And if they have used only one 2GB stick for the extra 2GB RAM it would normally cause all of the&nbsp; RAM to function in Single Channel mode vs Dual Channel mode, which would result is a small performance decrease.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>OEM (DELL, HP, etc) PC's and laptops have been tending to use an extra 2GB (6GB is common in laptops) in the past few years, and while I've never verified why, I've assumed that if this extra system RAM is used as dedicated
</p>
<p>graphics RAM on machine that has some form of Integrated graphics.</p>

            <p>Hi see if you can get into Advanced Startup mode. Here's trick that should work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your PC isn’t loading Windows 10 and you don’t have the operating system installation files, you can use the following trick.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start your computer and follow the POST, when Windows should begin loading, press the power button to shutdown your computer.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Repeat the previous step twice, and in the third restart the operating system should enter into the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE), where a number of diagnostics will be performed to try fix any booting issues, but you will also get an option
 to access the Windows Startup Settings</p>
</li></ol>

<h2>            How to change the default font for displaying Devanagari&#47;Hindi on my system&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Using Windows 10 : 1809 build 17763.55.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nirmala UI is I guess the default font for display of hindi/devanagari text.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to change it to some other font example: Noto Sans Devanagari, which I downloaded from Google Fonts for free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this could be done using Registry Editor in windows, I tried changing it but ended up not displaying the font at all, as seen in the image attached.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me how to change the font for display of hindi/devanagari on my system. As the default font is not good at all and it needs to be changed to a better display of Devanagari-text with a new font say, NotoSansDevanagari.</p>

<p><span>Hi Amar,

<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>You may follow these steps to make the registry changes to check if that helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>Disclaimer: The registry is a database in Windows that contains important information about system hardware, installed programs and

<p>Hi Srimadhwa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for response. This does not solve my problem.</p>
<p>The method you suggest is already available on various sites such as :</p>
<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-default-system-font-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Windows Central: Change default font">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-default-system-font-windows-10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>this method changes the entire system font for display; But still does not change the Devanagari font for display, only English font display is changed. That is not wanted.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win10 uses a different font than Segoe UI to display Devanagari Text. </p>
<p>Text which has both English and Devanagari is displayed on windows as a mixture of text containing both Segoe UI for english and Nirmala UI for hindi/devanagari.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be a separate entry in Register Editor which tells the OS which font to use to display Devanagari Text on Windows 10. I'm interested to know about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default it is Nirmala UI, if we remove Nirmala UI from the system and install hindi language pack then this language pack brings a different devanagari font in our system named Mangal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>at many places where Nirmala UI was used to display Devanagari text earlier is then replaced with Mangal font. but that too does not happen every where example on a web page devanagari text will be rendered by Mangal font but not on the task bar. On the
 Task Bar still we could see square blocks appearing, coz the OS searches for Nirmala UI font to display text in Devanagari on the Task Bar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we re-install Nirmala UI back in our system then any text in Devanagari font on the task bar is displayed correctly but on web-pages devanagari text is still rendered in Mangal font.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm interested to know what are those registry keys which tells the operating system to use these fonts for the display of devanagari text, so that if I want to change any of Nirmala UI or Mangal font with any other font such as Noto Sans Devanagari I could
 then successfully do that.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Provide the following information:<br />
1. Are you referring to outlook webmail or outlook email client?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>I am refering to the default mail and calendar app for windows 10 (no outlook) i was just refering to the added accounts in the mail and calendar app they both share the same email adres (maybe that is the issue)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
2. Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
3. Do you receive any error message?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Yes... when the default mail and calendar app tries to sync with icloud i get the following error: system error unable to retrieve calendars</strong></span></p>

            I want to change the current hour setting in active hours from what I currently have my laptop set to and Windows 10 will not allow me to edit the hour settings. Instead it just goes back to the previous settings even after I click the save button<br />

            <p>Encountered the same thing and not sure what has fixed it. At the bottom of the rolling hour selection window, do you see a checkmark and an X. If so, click on the checkmark to make your selection stick before hitting the Save button. If your active time
 span exceeds 12 hours, you will get an error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't remember seeing the checkmark control before I started messing with the registry and I don't understand why it's there now after returning the registry key to what it was. Maybe I just did not notice it and I was skipping that step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I thought was missing from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UX\Settings was the value
</p>
<p><strong>IsActiveHoursEnabled</strong> DWORD</p>
<p>1 Enabled</p>
<p>0 Disabled</p>
<p>
</p><p>After having added it, I noticed the checkmark control but it is still there after having removed this value to 0 and still after removing theparameter so maybe it was there all along.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that help you?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Outdated drivers</strong> is one of the possible reasons <strong>why you cannot print documents</strong>. To better assist you, we need the answers to the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How is your printer connected to your computer, is it <strong>wired</strong> or
<strong>wireless</strong>?</li><li>Did you make changes on your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest <strong>performing the methods</strong> in this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027397/windows-fix-printer-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The printer is wired directly to the PC.</li><li>There were updates on the PC.</li><li>I've done the following steps:</li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>
<p>
Make sure that your printer is plugged into the power supply and turned on. Check the USB connection (for wired printers) or the wireless connection (for wireless printers).&nbsp;</p>
</span></li><li><span>
<p>
If none of the above steps work, download and run the <a href="http://aka.ms/diag_printer10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
printing troubleshooter</a>.&nbsp;</p>
</span></li><li><span>
<p>
If you’re still having problems, your printer may need a new driver. Right-click (or press and hold) the
<strong>Start</strong> &nbsp;button, and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>. Expand
<strong>Printers</strong>, find your printer in the list, right-click (or press and hold) it, then select
<strong>Update Driver</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
</span></li></ul>
<p>I have also re-booted the PC a few times then reconnected the USB cable from the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The errors I get...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The printer cannot communicate with the computer.</p>
<p>Try:</p>
<p>-Ensure the printer is powered on.</p>
<p>-Disconnect and reconnect the printer's power cable.</p>
<p>-Disconnect and reconnect USB cable.</p>
<p>-Check your firewall settings to ensure printer communication in not blocked.&nbsp; (not sure how to do this)</p>
<p>-Restart computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried everything except checking firewall setting. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>CANNOT upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miked639  say:</h3>
<h2>            CANNOT upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell desktop with nothing special going on in the hardware and software. All of the compatibility tests and initial scans have said all is OK. &nbsp;I have tried each approach (automatic, USB, ISO) multiple times having overcome various issues
 with drivers etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;I've followed virtually every suggestion on the web - driver updates, detached external devices like webcam and hard drive, uninstalled balky RW DVD, ran HD and memory checks, ran sfc, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am stuck on 0xC1900101-0x30018 failed FIRST-BOOT with SYSPREP. &nbsp;This seems like an odd place to get stuck given my understanding of SYSPREP from having created numerous images. So here it is the next to last day and I have no hope of doing an
 upgrade. &nbsp;I was at my forester's (I live rural) business office yesterday and they have a dumpy old desktop and said their upgrade ran fine the very first time by accident - you know how that goes. &nbsp;So I guess there are not a lot of folks in my position.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see no options. &nbsp;If I were to try loading on a fresh drive it wouldn't see Windows 7 so it wouldn't qualify for the free upgrade. &nbsp;Correct? &nbsp;Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Depends on the model of the Dell. You could try a clean hard drive and a clean install. Use the key on the label on the case of the Dell. Boot from your media and follow the instruction. If Dell do not support Windows 10 for your model it could be there
 is something in their hardware that makes the install fail.</p>

            <p>You can clean install by booting from the DVD. You will need your Windows 7 licence key. You also need to check you have version 1511 build 10586 DVD to be able to use your key during a clean install. (right click setup.exe and select properties, check the
 version info)</p>

<p>I wonder if your problem is that you upgraded to Windows 7 from Vista and there is some part of your operating system that looks like Vista to the Windows 10 DVD install process and that is why it fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you try a clean install then try a clean hard drive (just in case) I'm not 100% sure that a Windows 7 upgrade key is valid for the Windows 10 upgrade.</p>

            I didn't upgrade from Vista. &nbsp;I created a Windows 7 image and installed which totally wipes out all aspects of Vista. &nbsp;I will investigate the clean install route per you suggestions.

            I do have 10586. &nbsp;I checked the linked info and it didn't get me to the next step. &nbsp;I guess I should simply try. &nbsp;I do have all my license codes. &nbsp;I'll let you know.

            <p>This was on the link I gave:</p>
<div><span>During the free upgrade, you can use a valid Windows&nbsp;7, Windows 8, or Windows&nbsp;8.1 product key to activate Windows&nbsp;10 (Version 1511 or higher). The following types of product keys are supported:</span></div>
<ul>
<li><span>Product keys included in the packaging or the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) attached to your PC that came installed with Windows.
</span></li><li><span>Product keys included in the confirmation email you received after buying Windows from an online retailer.
</span></li><li><span>Product keys included in the box the Windows DVD came in. </span></li><li><span>Product keys you bought using Windows Anytime Upgrade or Get Genuine Windows.
</span></li><li><span>If you bought a Windows&nbsp;8.1 Pro Pack product key, you can use it to activate Windows&nbsp;10 Pro.
</span></li></ul>
<div>
<div>
<div>Note</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Some Windows&nbsp;7, Windows 8, and Windows&nbsp;8.1product keys can't be used to activate Windows&nbsp;10, such as product keys for volume licensing, including Generic Volume Licensing Keys (GVLK) and Multiple Activation Keys (MAK), and Windows&nbsp;7 Enterprise, Windows 8
 Enterprise, and Windows&nbsp;8.1 Enterprise.</p>
<div><span>To see if your device is running Windows&nbsp;10 Version 1511 or higher, select the Start&nbsp; button, then select
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>About</strong>, and make sure that
<strong>Version </strong>shows 1511 or higher.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>To use your Windows&nbsp;7, Windows 8, or Windows&nbsp;8.1 product key to activate Windows&nbsp;10:</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Select the Start&nbsp; button, then select <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>
Update &amp; security </strong>&gt; <strong>Activation</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Change product key</strong>, and then enter the 25-character product key.</span></li></ol>
<div><span>After Windows&nbsp;10 is activated, a digital entitlement will be given to your device based on the product key you entered. This means that you’ll no longer need to enter a product key to activate Windows&nbsp;10 on this device.
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>On some devices that came pre-installed with Windows 8 or Windows&nbsp;8.1, the product key is provisioned in the device firmware. On these devices the product key will be verified during setup, and then the appropriate edition of Windows&nbsp;10
 will be installed.<br />

            <p>Thanks. &nbsp;I had already tried the burned to ISO to DVD 2 days ago and have tried the upgrade that way twice with the same error message. &nbsp;I have done reboots in between which is my normal practice (and for which I get chided at work).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wow. &nbsp;I appreciate all the responsiveness from everyone in this user community. &nbsp;At this point I am pretty discouraged and feel I am stuck with Windows 7. &nbsp;But I haven't completely given up yet.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>What is the exact issue that you're facing in the Computer?</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When exactly do you get this error message?</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Are you trying to download and restore the Windows Live Messenger?</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Are you getting any error message?</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Wldlog.dll is part of Windows Live or Windows Live Messenger. So I would suggest you to reinstall that application.</span></p>
