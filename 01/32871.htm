    <title>access denied to share, yet another - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> njem  say:</h3>
<h2>            access denied to share, yet another</h2>
                    
<p>I see lots of this and have tried to read a lot of answers but don't find a solution. One computer can see the shared folder on another but is denied access to see into it, or if I map it I'm denied access to see inside the mapped drive. I have tried MANY
 things.</p>
<p>Setup,&nbsp;three Win7 home premium, when&nbsp;each connected to the network I told win it was a work connection, so I think "home group" stuff doesn't apply. Station 2 has its public documents shared. Station 3 can see it, map a drive and read/write. When mapping
 I used the logon and password of station 2 to gain access. Station 1 sees the share but if I click on it it says access denied. If I right click and map a drive it does that but then when I try to look in the drive it says access denied.</p>
<p>Settings I've tried in various combinations and other details:<br />
* All have win firewall off and no other firewall or security software</p>
<p>* Have tried having one or the other or both be admin accounts</p>
<p>* Have network discovery on, public file sharing on, file and printer sharing on, have tried password protected sharing on and off</p>
<p>* explicitly shared the folder (rather than just public file sharing on) and made sure "everyone" was in the permissions</p>
<p>* added matching users and passwords to both systems so they have matching user names so maybe it would recognize it.</p>
<p>* have tried mapping using system 1 logon name or system 2 logon name</p>
<p>* have used dos net use with various logon accounts</p>
<p>* System 1 can use a printer that system 2 shares</p>
<p>* System 2 can see files on a share on system 1</p>
<p>* Many restarts between setting changes</p>
<p>Hair getting thinner as I pull it. Suggestions welcome</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Everyone does Not mean Everyone that wants to logon.<br />
<br />
If accounts are set only for John, Jill, and Jack, using the Everyone setting in the Folder Permissions saves the effort of setting Permission separately for John, Jill, and Jack.<br />
<br />
Everyone else is Not in the Everyone group, only John, Jill, and Jack.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
What that means? It means that users have to be established on each computer network that participated in sharing.<br />
<br />
Then if you want to same permission to all of them, you do not have to enter them one by one use Everyone.</p>
<p>----------------------------</p>
<p><strong>If you have Permission and Security issues, check the <strong>following</strong> settings.</strong></p>
<p>Point to the a Folder that meant to&nbsp; to be share. Right click and choose properties.</p>
<p>In the properties</p>
<p>Click on the Security tab shown in the pic bellow to the right) and check that the users and their permission (shown in the pic bellow center and left) are correctly configured. Then do the same to the Permission tab.</p>
<p>This screen shot is from Win 7, Vista's menus are similar.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/Permission-Security.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/Permission-Security.jpg</a></p>
<p><strong>In both the Security panel, and the Permission panel you have to highlight each User/Group and examine that the Permission Controls are checked correctly.</strong></p>
<p>When everything is OK, Reboot the Network (Router, and computer).</p>
<p><strong>* Note</strong> . The Groups and Users shown in the screen-shoot are just an example. Your list will look the way your system is configured.</p>
<p><strong>**Note</strong> . You have to establish specific users. <strong>Everyone</strong> means all of the users that already have an account and been established as users. It does not mean<strong> Everyone</strong> that feel that they would like to login.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>As noted in the original post I have made matching logons in both systems so if the main logon in system 1 is "joe" with a password of "123" then on system 2 with the shared&nbsp;folder I also have a "joe" with password "123". The idea being that when I map a
 drive without using "use other credentials" it should be okay. I have also tried mapping the drive with "use other credentials" and used the logon name and password of the main user on system 2. Neither of these help.</p>
<p>I have "everyone" set in both folder security and share permissions.</p>
<p>As noted system 3 can log onto this share using the credentials of the main user on system 2, the one with the share.</p>
<p>Also, I don't know the detailed policies that go with Win7 public share but since I have sharing of public folders turned on shouldn't I be able to log onto that in any case? If not with the credentials of the user trying to log on then with the credentials
 of the main user of the system with the share?</p>

<p>Auf der Konsole solltest Du das Guthaben verwenden können. Auf der Website gibt es seit geraumer Zeit das Problem, dass Du mit Guthaben nicht zahlen kannst, solange keine gültige Zahlungsweise (z.B. Kreditkarte oder PayPal) bei Deinem Account hinterlegt
 sind. </p>
<p>Falls Du keine Kreditkarte hast, erstelle ein kostenloses PayPal Konto und hinterlege es als Zahlungsweise, und Du solltest dann Deine Xbox 360 Dinge wieder kaufen können.

    <title>Formatting a RAW USB Flash Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> letsup  say:</h3>
<h2>            Formatting a RAW USB Flash Drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi, i know this has been questioned a lot but none of those solutions were able to fix my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a TOSHIBA USB Flash Drive 16GB and recently it became unusable.</p>
<p>Everytime i plug it into my PC it says that i need to format the disk before it can be used, but when i did the formatting it shows that windows was unable to complete the format. (i assume it's because my disk is corrupted and became a RAW fs?)</p>
<p>So i did a lot of research and tried some softwares such as EaseUS Data Recovery and Partition Master, Mini Tool Partition, Hard Disk Low Level Format Tool, TestDisk, and even tried to format it with DISKPART on command prompt, but that doesn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way i run win7, and according to diskpart my USB flash drive has RAW file system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to recover some of the files into my PC with EaseUS, but my USB Flash Drive is still unusable.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>If a program written for an earlier version of Windows doesn't run correctly, you can try changing the compatibility
 settings for the program, either manually or by using the Program Compatibility troubleshooter.</span></p>

<p>Maybe you can try a Virtual Machine solution if Compatibility Modes fail.</p>

<p>Windows XP Mode (Windows 7 only, but not any of the Home versions)&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not eligible to download Windows XP Mode. You must have Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate to run Windows XP Mode".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have an old XP CD (or other older Windows
 CD)&nbsp; available you can just download the Virtual Machine and skip the XP Mode download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This covers the whole gambit of virtual machines in "Home" versions if you want to have a look at it.&nbsp; Of course you will need a licensed copy of XP to install and&nbsp; run in any of them (except XP Mode).</p>
<p>VirtualBox is an impressive VM contender<br />

<h2>            Realtek USB 2.0 Card Reader not working properly following Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 on 5 August 2015 and my Realtek card reader will now not read my MS Pro Duo cards even though it worked perfectly on 4 August 2015, ie prior to the upgrade.&nbsp; It will read SD cards and the Device Manager says it is
 working correctly, even though it obviously is not!&nbsp; I have tried to update the driver but apparently I have the latest driver installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced this please, and if so does anyone know how to fix?</p>

            <p>Hi Angbailey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear about the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might be caused due to compatibility issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would suggest you to install the drivers using compatibility and then check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To know more about installing program using compatibility, refer to the below link:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply and your suggestion to change the compatibility to Windows 8.&nbsp; I have now tried this, but I still cannot get the card reader to recognise MS Pro cards, it will only read SD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried different MS Pro Cards and different Memory Stick adapters just in case I had damaged one, but still not working :(</p>

            <p>Apparently Microsoft&nbsp;has quietly installed some Windows 10 upgrades to my Win-7 64-Bit Gateway desktop, because now my Realtek USB card reader is no longer working.&nbsp; And I just used it last week on copying some pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver checking says "up to date".&nbsp; So I decided to do a driver "roll-back", and viola!&nbsp; it immediately started working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            If you go to "Device Manager", then find the Realtek USB Card Reader and right-click on it's Properties.&nbsp; You should see an option to "rollback" the driver.

            I have tried to rollback the driver but that facility was not available - the wording was grey not black. &nbsp;I have updated the driver today but it still does not work even though the hardware status says it is working ok.

            <p>Mmmm, well, you might try "disabling" the reader, then "enabling" it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, uninstall the Reader then reboot the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A&nbsp;last suggestion would be try to locate an older version of the&nbsp;driver(s) for the&nbsp;Reader, either on back-up discs or even on the Web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before it just recently died, my Gateway desktop never did get the full Win-10 upgrade, and I suspect&nbsp;one of the reasons&nbsp;was probably because of the card reader issue.&nbsp; It was very annoying to have Microsoft do a partial install (behind the scenes) and cause
 this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, my Gateway system has been retired and I wish you luck on yours...</p>

<p>
</p><p>Well, the new version is really nice but I use it for work.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we send many links in a row so I get that much previews, that's useless to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the previews take too much room in the window.</p>
<p>That's why I need to remove them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you planning to reintroduce the option in a next release?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After following various KBs, I eventually followed this one.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2509997" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2509997</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had to get to Step 8 before Windows Update was able to check for updates successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Strangely I still some errors in the Windows Update.log but I guess those really are just warnings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Update is installing now, so I hope my PC is back to healthy.</p>

<h2>            What is required to improve my Primary Hard Disk rating on the WEI past 5.9&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to improve my WEI score for my hard disk, although I can not get past 5.9.&nbsp; Here are the options I have tried:<br />
<br />
(x1) Kingston 128GB MLC SSD - WEI rating 5.9<br />
<br />
(x2) Samsung 1TB 7200RPM 32MB SATAII RAID0 - WEI 5.9<br />
<br />
I would have thought either of these would have produced a higher rating.&nbsp; Please advise.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>To add a bit to the other good advice given in this thread :</p>
<p>If you need to compare disks use a BenchMark tool.<br />
<br />
PassMark - compare drives to their postings and&nbsp;benchmark tools<br />

<p>What OS are you running?&nbsp; Ratings on small 128GB memory and huge 1TB raid configured drives in line with 5.9 ratings.</p>
<p>Running Win 7 OS?&nbsp; Believe 5.9 WEI for Primary Hard Drive Transfer Rate is product of OS. &nbsp;&nbsp;Went from 7.9 with Vista HP OS on WD Raptor 300GB 10K RPM Sata2 drive with 3.0GB transfer rate to 5.9 using WD 600GB 10K RPM Sate3 drive with 6.0GB transfer rate
 using&nbsp;Sate3&nbsp;mobo,&nbsp;Sate3&nbsp;drivers, and Sate3&nbsp;cable after change to Win 7 OS.&nbsp; Forget the HD WEI; all other WEI ratings may be improved by upgrading your hardward.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
The Windows 7 WEI Scores are only operating system dependant because the WEI for windows 7 is only performed using windows 7.&nbsp; The results, however, are very real and system hardware and driver dependant.&nbsp; If you score a 5.9 on your HDD then you have a second
 generation rotating disk running at 7200 RPM and it is healthy.&nbsp; It is primarly determined installed hardware plus some basic read/write checks.&nbsp; The only configuration of HDD that I have seen beet the 5.9 is two WD VelociRaptors running the operating system
 in Raid 0.&nbsp; This only achieved a 6.1 rating.&nbsp; I achieve a 7.6 by running two Intel SSD's in Raid 0.&nbsp; Again this is limited from the 7.9 because they are running on SATA II channels which restrict the I/O of these heigh performing drives.&nbsp; I expect to achieve
 the 7.9 only when I upgrade to the Crucial SATA III 6 GB/s SSDs next week.&nbsp; These ratings in Windows 7 are really not as arbitrary as they are being made out to be.&nbsp; The fact is that these scores are only benchmarks and do not neccesarily affect your personal
 computing experience.</p>
<span>
<p>7.7 = I7 930 @ 4 GHz</p>
<p>7.8 = 6GB 3 channel 1600 DDR3</p>
<p>7.9 = GTX 470 with GTS 250 Physx</p>
<p>7.9 = ditto ussing HDMI monitor</p>
<p>7.6 = Intel 80 GB SSD x2 in Raid 0</p>

<h2>            DescriptionEvent ID&#58; 1016 DCOM errors and Blue Screen error</h2>
                    My Toshiba 64-bit Win7 laptop is getting these DCOM errors every hour or so, and frequently BSOD's. I just applied the suggested fix (to grant Launch and Activation permissions to Network Services in the Component Services tool). However, I'm concerned
 that I just opened the barn doors to potential dangers. Is this the best, safest fix (and does it really work)?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is a copy of one of the errors from my System Event Log:</div>

<div>The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Launch permission for the COM Server application with CLSID&nbsp;</div>

- touchpad<br />

- webcam<br />
- SD card reader <br />

Just replace all of them:<br />
- download a fresh copy<br />
- uninstall the current copy<br />
- install the freshly downloaded copy<br />

                    <p>Hello, i'm having problems trying to uninstall this game I currently have on my computer. I just upgraded to windows 10 about a hour ago, and i'm having a couple of problems. When I tried to play the game itself, I ran into an error that said&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>File system error (-1073741819). From there I attempted to uninstall the game itself, but I encountered the error that won't let me uninstall. Is there anything I can do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>While searching around, I saw a solution about using Regedit to fix the problem, but the thing is, I'm getting the same file system error when I try to run it.</p>

            Hi Yann 
<br />
<br />Have you gone to the support page for your PC, then form there download and install the Audio drivers they recommend, those may well be older than the current driver you are using, however it will be compatible with your system . . .
<br />
<br />If you have any trouble locating that support page, what is the Make and Exact Model No. of your PC - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing of your PC . . .

<p>I've split your posts off from the thread about USB installation stick since you clarified it never had anything to do with those, so I don't know why you posted it there in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also not sure why you wouldn't make clear to us in your first post exactly what kind of stick this is.&nbsp; So now please tell us the make and model of the device, what it does exactly (since you never bothered to mention that most basic information) and
 where you got it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;After doing that so that someone who is familiar with the device can help you, I would also locate the stick's packaging and paperwork or google this on the web so you can contact their tech support for the direct help.&nbsp; But do fill us in fully in case
 someone sees this now that I have filed and titled it as best I can for you and can narrow it down more when we hear the full story and details.&nbsp;

<p>Joysticks will not work with windows7 on ms flight simulator. I have a&nbsp;&nbsp;precision&nbsp;pro joystick but same problem with other joysticks also.<br />
&nbsp;Seems like a lot of other people have the same problem. Found no fix on the web. The calabration works with the joystick but it will not work in the flight sim game. A lot of others have the same problem on the web.<br />
MCFS1&amp;3 loads fine apart from you cant see the joy stick. When I recalibrate it (within MCFS3) it will come with a message saying that joystick %- has been replaced with joystick *] (or such like) and advises me that I should recalibrate! and tried recalibrating
 again, it still will not work.<br />

            Are you asking a question here?<br />
<br />
If you are wondering why your joysticks don't function, it is likely due to drivers.&nbsp; You may need new drivers for your flight stick for Windows 7 to use them properly.&nbsp; Check with the manufacturer of the stick to see if they have updated drivers for Windows
 7.<br />

            The Windows 7 driver for the Logitech Attack 3 joystick was loaded successfully and can be manged form the logitech driver crontoller.&nbsp; Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 both will see the driver, but will not allow it
 to function.<br />
<br />
I suspect a patch is needed for both applications but due to their ages, I suspect it will never be seen.<br />

Any one know of a work around?

Have same problem here with older Microsoft flight simulator games only. NOTE: FSX and FS2004 seem to work fine with my MS sidewinder joystick.<br />
Only info I was able to find is this old article but it doesn't seem to apply since I don't use onboard audio.<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Yes i'm in the same boat, just upgraded to Windows 7 64bit for my recording studio pc, i also use Microsoft Flight Sim Deluxe Edition, games works well. Plugged the Sidewinder Precision 2 in and W7 saw the joystick straight away, next time i used the FLX
 NO Joystick.</p>
<p>Again tried to find the driver online and support at Microsoft, found there is NO SUPPORT by Microsoft for this product any longer.</p>
<p>This Joystick is the best on the Market and so many people still use it.</p>
<p>My Question is - Why NO support or updated drivers? and why does W7 not see the Joystick the next time i used the game?</p>
<p>Please help Microsoft.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

            I have a Logitech Freedom 2.4 Cordless joystick.&nbsp; Both Cbt Flt Sim (Europe-98) and Cbt Flt Sim 2 (Pacific 2000) worked fine with this controller on my XP PC, as did Ubisoft Lock-On.&nbsp; Got a new Win 7/64 bit PC and this joystick would not work.&nbsp; Downloaded
 new software from Logitech- now works fine with CFS2 and Lock-On but does not recognize joystick with CFS (1?).&nbsp; Try to click "Settings" on home page of program and closes down program completely.&nbsp; There apparently is no updated download for CFS 1 from M/S.&nbsp;
 Spoke to Logitech- basically told that if this joystick works with these programs in W-7, you lucked out, otherwise "Sorry 'bout that".&nbsp;

<p>I too have this problem with CFS1. CFS2 and 3, plus Crimson Skies and more modern flight sims all work fine. An old game called Plane Crazy (Win 95/8) works fine but is missing some of the sound sections, although this does not stop the game running properly.</p>
<p>CFS1 works but only with the mouse, and that is no way to fly in combat!&nbsp;</p>
<p>In switching to Win 7 64 bit I had to contact Canon re my scanner which was fine with XP3. Their reply was dismissive and quite rude. I suspect the industry generally wants us to junk our old favourite software and hardware and buy all new. As I also have
 a laptop running XP3 I choose to use that for these applications.</p>
<p>There seem to be&nbsp;issues with Win 7 and XP3 over interworking as well, but I am not clever enough to sort it out!</p>
<p>Can't these people see that they are alienating their customers?</p>

<p>The first thing I did was check for new drivers with the manufacturer and there are none. I too am running Windows 7. I see it's a common problem with Windows 7 as an operating system. My FSX works great with keyboard and mouse, not so with joystick!</p>

            I have a "Sector" Rapid Fire Joystick. I made sure when I purchased it that it is Windows 7 compatible! I loaded the software into my hard drive, the joystick is calibrated correctly and shows it's Windows 7 compatible and when I use it to fly my FSX it
 works very poorly and I can't close FSX when I'm finished flying! I have to do a FORCE restart. FSX works excellent with keyboard and mouse. There aren't any upgrade drivers for this joystick! It's a real bummer to have to keep replacing hardware due to the
 fact Windows 7 isn't compatible with most software.

<p>i would suggest go to device manager and locate your "automatically installed" driver, uninstall it, unplug your gamepad, then restart.</p>
<p>after restarting insert the driver cd, and at some point during installation it should ask you to plug in your gamepad, and then there you go.</p>
<p>if it doesn't ask you to plug it in, then just plug it in after installation</p>
<p>if it doesn't ask you to plug it in, and it asks you to restart (which isn't likely, but anyways,) then just restart, make sure you are running your gamepad program, and then plug it in.</p>
<p>hope this helps!</p>

<p>Nein, hab ich nicht.</p>
<p>Dann dürfte man auch kein WhatsApp oder andere Programme installieren und nutzen.</p>
<p>Benutzt du Google? Kaufst du bei Amazon?&nbsp;Alles Datensammler und die profitieren mächtig davon und sind im heutigen Internet gar nicht mehr weg zu denken.</p>
<p>Bei Apps ist das ähnlich. Viele Apps verlangen Rechte, die man entweder hinnimmt oder nicht. Muss jeder für sich entscheiden.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bei meiner Xbox-App werden die Daten laut Beschreibung ausschließlich&nbsp;lokal verschlüsselt&nbsp;gesichert.</p>

            <p>Naja ... auch wenn die Daten lokal abgespeichert werden, irgendwann müssen sie zum LIVE Server geschickt werden und dazu müssen sie wieder entschlüsselt werden. Der Erschaffer der App hat daher (wenn er möchte) sehr wohl Zugriff auf deine Daten. Das hat nichts mit Amazon oder Google zu tun, denn hoffentlich hast du dort ein anderes Kennwort als hier. Ich kann von der Nutzung solcher Apps nur abraten, da der Entwickler (wenn er möchte) sehr wohl Zugriff auf die Daten hat. Auch wenn er schreibt, er macht nichts böses, die Daten hat er im Zweifelsfall.

<p>Sicherlich könnte der Entwickler auch das blaue vom Himmel lügen. Für mich klingt das in Ordnung. Seit 1 1/2 Jahren läuft die App ohne negative Zwischenfälle. Manchmal helfen einem auch Kommentare von anderen Nutzern.</p>
<p>So, und jetzt halte ich mich zu dem Thema geschlossen, sonst heißt es später noch ich verbreite Tipps zu böser Datenklau-Software.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 - DISM Errors - Unable to fix - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wendyberesford  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - DISM Errors - Unable to fix</h2>
                    <p>I have successfully upgraded my Lenovo X230i laptop to Windows 10 Professional from Windows 7 Professional. On running sfc /scannow from an elevated command prompt, the following message displayed:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I then proceeded to run: Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth. The following message displayed:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Error: 8x800f001f</strong><br />
<strong>The source files could not be found.</strong><br />
<strong>Use the source option to specifiy the location of the files that are required to restore the feature.</strong><br />
<strong>http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=243077</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I then ran:&nbsp;DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /source:WIM:C:\Sources\Install.wim:1 /LimitAccess. I ran this command after downloading and mounting the Windows 10 ISO. The following message displayed:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Error: 0x800f081f</strong><br />
<strong>The source files could not be found.</strong><br />
<strong>Use the source option to specifiy the location of the files that are required to restore the feature.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really stuck now and don't know what to do to repair my files. I am not that technical and would be grateful of some help to resolve my issue. Thank you.</p>

<p>Just reflecting on the DISM error, could this be because I selected the incorrect option when creating the ISO?<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>No no that is not the case.Corruption can have many causes.</p>
<p>You can select upgrade this PC now and use the ISO as well(if you installed windows 10 using the same ISO).</p>
<p>Upgrade this PC will download the ISO first according to your system, whereas if you have the ISO, just run the setup.exe from it.</p>
<p>hope that helps.</p>
