    <title>Inability to Connect to a Home PC Using Microsoft Remote Desktop App - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> id_viper_88_id  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inability to Connect to a Home PC Using Microsoft Remote Desktop App for iPhone</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have wanted to try out the Microsoft Remote Desktop App for iPhone to compare it to other such apps and see if it could be considered better, but I can‚Äôt even establish a connection to my home PC with it. Therefore, I have decided to write here about my issue
 with using Microsoft Remote Desktop App for iPhone hoping someone could help me out because despite precisely following the instructions on the matter found on the Internet and applying every solution I was able to find, I am unable to establish a connection
 to my PC from iPhone. The message I am returned by the Microsoft Remote Desktop App on the iPhone when trying to establish a connection to my PC reads: ‚ÄûUnable to connect to remote PC. Please verify demote desktop is enabled, the remote PC is turned on and
 available on the network, and then try again‚Äù (I can tell you straight away that both the PC and the iPhone are on the same LAN). First, I will give you the background specifications, so that you know what I am working on:<br />
<br />
Computer Type: PC<br />
Computer OS: Windows 10 Pro (all up-to-date, the latest April 2018 Update included)<br />
CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770K, 3.5GHz<br />
CPU Architecture: x64<br />
RAM: 32 GB<br />
Network: LAN<br />
Wireless Router: TP-Link Wireless Router, Standard N, 150mb/s, Model TL-WR740N/TL-WR740ND<br />
Computer Network Adapter: Intel(R) 82579V Gigabit Network Connection<br />
Active Computer Firewall: Kaspersky Total Security 18.0.0.405(f)<br />
Type of the Computer IP on the Network: Static IP Assigned<br />
Device I Am Trying to Connect from: iPhone 6S Plus running on iOS 11.3.0 (I do not want the iOS 11.3.1 just now yet, and I am quite sure that the minute changes found in the latest iOS version are irrelevant to the issue that I have) with a static IP assigned
 to it as well.<br />
<br />
Now, I will enumerate the sittings I have set up on the PC:<br />
<br />
I have checked Allow Remote Assistance connections on this computer under Allow Remote Access to This Computer dialog window, and as you can see in the screenshot, under the same dialog window I have also checked Allow remote connections to this computer (conversely,
 I have deliberately decided not to check Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication (recommended), as I want to be sure that if the iPhone app does not comply with the above-standard protective measures it
 can still be able to establish a connection with the PC).<br />
<br />
https://i.imgur.com/TnwGweq.jpg<br />
<br />
As far as the advanced settings for Allow Remote Assistance connections on this computer are concerned, on the screenshot below you can see that the checkbox Allow this computer to be controlled remotely is also checked.<br />
<br />
https://i.imgur.com/InkiFQF.jpg<br />
<br />
When it comes to the advanced settings concerning users allowed the remote access to the PC, I have added my user account which is the only user account on the PC and is granted the Administrator privileges because I have removed the Administrators and Remote
 Desktop Users Groups from the Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services Policy list for security purpose, leaving the privilege of such log on and remote control to my user account exclusively (the removal of those groups should not entail any negative
 consequences, since when trying to establish the connection back when both those groups were still on the list by default, I could not establish the connection either).<br />
<br />
https://i.imgur.com/DFUcQgI.jpg<br />
<br />
Also, my user account on the PC has a password set up, just as I have found out on the Internet that it has to have a password set up if you want to use the Microsoft Remote Desktop App for iPhone.<br />
Speaking of the firewall, the Kaspersky Total Security Firewall is in charge the settings of the Windows 10 built-in firewall, rendering that firewall itself turned off, and the Remote Desktop application under the Kaspersky Total Security Firewall is allowed
 on the standard 3389 TCP port. Moreover, I have set the Network protection component of Kaspersky Total Security not to monitor the traffic going through the 3389 TCP port, so that it does not interfere with it in any way. Assuming I could have either missed
 something or done something wrong (which I believe I have not), I have also wanted to use the PC Remote Desktop Setup Assistant Tool that I have found out about while trying to solve my issue and then downloaded from one of the Microsoft‚Äôs websites (I mean
 here the tool that all over the Internet is said to be available under the link https://aka.ms/rdsetup, which currently is not true, as that website in particular no longer exists). Nonetheless, when I want to run that tool that I have got from a different
 Microsoft‚Äôs website, a prompt windows pops up, saying: ‚ÄûCannot download the application. The application is missing required files. Contact application vendor for assistance‚Äù. The prompt window provides an option to view the details of what was and what couldn‚Äôt
 be done, and when I click it, a Notepad file with all that information opens. In that Notepad file there is a section of text which refers to the error occurred. The entirety of that section reads as follows:<br />
<br />
‚ÄûERROR SUMMARY<br />
Below is a summary of the errors, details of these errors are listed later in the log.<br />
* Activation of C:\Users\Hubert\Desktop\rdassistant.application resulted in exception. Following failure messages were detected:<br />
+ Downloading http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/2/1322897E-11C1-4E30-9EFC-70C1C2219048/rdassistant.exe.manifest did not succeed.<br />
+ The remote server returned an error: (404) Not Found.‚Äú.<br />
<br />
Obviously, that means that the repository webpage that the tool tried to connect to no longer exists. I tried to confirm that by trying to visit the webpage indicated manually, and when doing so in the Edge Browser, visiting either http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/2/1322897E-11C1-4E30-9EFC-70C1C2219048/rdassistant.exe.manifest
 or http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/2/1322897E-11C1-4E30-9EFC-70C1C2219048/, results in nothing, meaning that virtually nothing happens, except for the address bar going blank, as if no address were typed in. Trying to do the same in the Mozilla
 Firefox browser, I am returned the same error page for either of those two addresses, saying: ‚ÄûFile not found. Firefox can‚Äôt find the file at [the webpage address]‚Äù. Although it may be of lesser relevance as the repository webpage doesn‚Äôt work at all, the
 Notepad file also mentions more detailed error information regarding the error that I will mention here anyway:<br />

As far as the router is concerned, the version of its manufacturer‚Äôs firmware it is running on is 3.16.4 Build 130513 Rel.63875n, the router‚Äôs built-in firewall is entirely disabled, and although it may be unnecessary, I have also forwarded the 3389 TCP port
 on the router to the static IP of my PC which in the LAN network is 192.168.1.200.<br />
<br />
Having the settings set up on the PC and router covered, I will now pass on to the settings set up in the Microsoft Remote Desktop App installed on the iPhone:<br />
The first page with the settings looks as follows:<br />
<br />
https://i.imgur.com/ERD59KD.png<br />
<br />
The destination device set is its LAN IP address, which (as I had mentioned earlier) is 192.168.1.200. Regardless of whether I use the LAN IP address alone, append :3389 to the end of it, use the FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) of the PC alone or with the
 port number appended, and choose for the app to remember my user login credentials or to ask for them at each connection, none of this helps, as the Microsoft Remote Desktop is still unable to establish the connection to the PC. I assume that the Gateway that
 can be set up at the Additional Options page of the app is not necessary, but even if I set it up, as the gateway itself typing my router‚Äôs default homepage address and the username and password for logging onto the router as the username and password, it
 still does not help. When I do that, then the error message I am returned reads: ‚ÄûCan‚Äôt connect to the Remote Desktop Gateway. Contact your network administrator for assistance. (Error code: 0x03000008)‚Äù.<br />
<br />
https://i.imgur.com/rbnZn8J.png<br />
<br />
Besides trying to use the PC Remote Desktop Setup Assistant Tool mentioned earlier, I have even tried adding a registry key called Terminal Server Client under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft and a DWORD type value with a data setting ‚Äû1‚Äù under it using
 Regedit, as suggested by user Dzcharles (I do not know if Karel Dehertogh under his post marked as the answer is his name or not) at https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/c371fdb2-ad74-4fe5-9375-babd9dc2bf6a/remote-desktop-from-windows-10-client-to-remote-desktop-farm?forum=winserverTS
 (I know that forum topic refers to Windows Server, while I have Windows 10 Pro, but I gave it a shot anyway, trying out every solution I could find). As adding that key and its respective value did not help at all, I later removed both of them from the registry.<br />
<br />
It is annoying not to be able to get the Microsoft‚Äôs own application to connect, while applications such as Teamviewer and CrazyRemote, which both are for iPhones too, work for me like a charm.<br />
<br />
At this point I am completely puzzled, and do not know what else I could do to get this to work,<br />
<br />

<p>Port forwarding only matters if you are trying to connect from outside your network.&nbsp; If you're using the local LAN IP address, no port forwarding is needed nor do you need to specify a port when you connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are trying to connect when your iPhone (and you, I assume) are away from home, you need to use your WAN IP address instead, which is when the forwarding would apply.</p>

            Thank you for your reply/replies. Yes, I assumed that port forwarding could be a redundant step as I always connect to my PC when on the home LAN, but over time I have started to try out everything to somehow get this to work. Yes, I know Teamviewer is
 a really good application for the remote control purposes, but it also has its little downsides, and the one that pushed me to wanting to try out the Microsoft application was the fact that Teamviewer misses an option to not only press, but also press and
 hold the mouse wheel button. Of course, I do not know if it is possible to press the mouse wheel button in Microsoft Remote Desktop, but manuals and users‚Äô discussions concerning usage of things not always cover such details, and judging by what I have seen
 on the Internet, I guess I know what else Remote Desktop does for sure that Teamviewer doesn‚Äôt (at least for me), and that is adjusting the PC screen streamed to the iPhone in a way that it fits the iPhone screen from the physical top to

            <p><span>Hi Mikayil,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are facing the above issue using Mail app, it may be due to the following reasons:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Presence of missing or corrupted app/system files and folders.</span></li><li><span>Corrupted user profile.</span></li><li><span>Changes made to the app/system settings.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Since you haven't tried the following methods, check if performing either of the steps will help in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Running the troubleshooter will help in detecting and identifying the issue and in certain cases
 will fix the same to enhance the performance of the system. Run </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Windows apps troubleshooter</span></strong></a><span>&nbsp;to
 check if the any of the app files are missing or corrupted.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In many cases, the
<strong>Windows Store</strong> will automatically notify you if there‚Äôs a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, this tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> If the issue persists, create another administrator user account by referring to
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/getstarted-set-up-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Set up accounts</span></strong></a><span>&nbsp;on
 Windows 10 article and check if similar issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The corrupted user profile does not function normally such as not launching
<strong>Start menu</strong>, <strong>Cortana, Search bar, Store </strong>and other
<strong>Windows applications</strong>. In such cases creating a new profile and checking for the same will help in identifying if the is specific to corrupted user profile or the OS.</span></p>

    <title>cant play original xbox games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jws302  say:</h3>
<h2>            cant play original xbox games</h2>
                    
<p>in the spring of 2012 i was able to play all of my original xbox games on my xbox 360. later in the fall of 2012 i found that NONE of them will even begin to load.</p>
<p>ERROR: &nbsp; the game couldn't start. try downloading game again.</p>
<p>it will say that for downloaded or disc based games.</p>
<p>i play xbox live so i always have the current system update.</p>
<p>i'm not at all happy as i bought the xbox to play games!! not to internet or watch movies, game play should be first and other functions should be secondary.</p>
<p>you are delibretely phasing out the old to make way for the popular. options could be made available for those of us that want to play original xbox games</p>
<p>if your not going to support original xbox game play then quit selling downloads that wont load. that's stealing! take my money for something that doesnt work.</p>
<p>i have tried on my original white 360 console and a later black console but not a slim.</p>
<p>thank you</p>

<p>do you have an official microsoft xbox 360 hdd? as you need one in order to play xbox original games. It is also worth checking they are on the list of original xbox games that are able to be on the xbox 360.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure i'd had this issue before i swapped drives, but i'll check.</p>
<p>can i save my content to the cloud, then swap drives, and download some of the content to the smaller drive?</p>
<p>it's not a bad update download!</p>
<p>take "BLACK" for instance, i have the disc and paid $10 to download it from the marketplace and get the same message for both.</p>
<p>thanks for helping</p>

<p>Did you happen to buy this new hard drive from amazon or ebay? &nbsp;A lot of drives sold from these places tend to be fake hard drives and therefore lack the necessary emulation software needed for playing original xbox games. &nbsp;If you still have the 20Gb drive,
 can you hook that one back up and try your games? &nbsp;</p>

<p>ok, we need to settle a few things.</p>
<p>first - it is the hard drive, i put in the old 20Gb and bingo game loads</p>
<p>second it's not about fake drives, it's about erased files and partition. still working out the details on fixing it but it can be done, &nbsp;check out microsoft.com $systemupdate_12_2007.zip</p>

            When did this problem start and did it coincide with any change to the&nbsp;system such as installing new hardware or software?<br />
<br />
Did you recently install&nbsp;new video drivers?<br />
<br />
Can you check here:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Control&nbsp;Panel &gt; Hardware and Sound &gt; Device Manager (under Devices and Printers)&nbsp;&gt; expand&nbsp;"Display Adapters"<br />
<br />
What is listed under&nbsp;&nbsp;"Display Adapters"?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the video drivers?

<h2>            Black Bars in Game</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I upgrades to Windows 10 last July and this is when the issue began so basically, whenever I run a game (my native resolution is 1920x1080), I run it in a lower resolution for example 800x600 but then, I get black bars on the sides and the game is in
 a small square. I uninstalled the driver then installed the driver again (latest one) but still no results. It still has black bars.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem occurs on most of my games such as Call of Duty etc etc. But the game I'm trying to run is Spider-Man Web of Shadows. The resolution is set too 800x600 and the others don't seem to work so I'm stuck with that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the 4th Time I'll be asking but all other people couldn't help me :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried this:</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Freezes and hangs</h2>
                    <p>OT- Windows 10 only works for a few minutes</p>
<p>My windows 10 computer doesn't see much use, maybe a couple boots per month for school or paying the bills, it works find for a couple minutes right after I boot it (which can take an hour or more, longer before I can boot any programs from the desk top)
 and after I get my Firefox open and pay my bills it starts to chug, to the point I can't even close Firefox with out using the task manager. And it stays like this for hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on AMD phenom II black quad core, 4gig ram, 250 gig free space, evga gtx460.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like to get anything done I have to boot it and let it chug everyday! Nevermind getting it working so I can play games. I've taken to watching TV because I get so frustrated with it always doing so much "background" I never bother using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And after I know a major update comes out it's worse. Is there anyway to make it not such a pig to boot up everytime without unplugging the internet?</p>

<h2>            Why don&#39;t I see facebook icon to directly share my photos from the photos app&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, there is no facebook or people icon on the photos app to share my photos. On app's page it says I can share photos on facebook directly from the photos app. But no facebook icon appears when I click on share although my facebook account is already
 connected.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

I just checked it, and there is no problem with it. I can see my facebook photos in the app. The problem is that I can't share my photos on Facebook. There is no facebook icon showing up when I click on share.<br />

<h2>            My PC DESKTOP on windows 7 will not go to sleep when left idle.</h2>
                    Hello again guys, here is my problem, I had a new hardrive fitted to my Desktop,and now it will not enter sleep mode on its own when left idle,I have done the power settings and set the times for screen 5 minutes and computer 10 minutes, but it is not
 going to sleep.I have also unticked the modem box so that will not interfere,I can put the PC to sleep through the start sleep etc, but it is not going off automatically.<br />
This is important to me as I have unfortunately got a medical conition whereby I simply fall asleep at any juncture. I have tried all of the conventional and suggested things but still no luck, I have NOT gone into BIOS because I am not very Techy,and would
 not know what I was doing.I am relatively new to computing so any advice in simple terms would be greatly appreciated.<br />
The P.C. is an ASUS custom build( More memory and upgraded graphics) around one year old runnuing Windows7 home edition.<br />
Many thanks.<br />

            <p>Hi Svetolik,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of the Windows 10 family.</p>

<p>Sorry to know that you are facing issues with using Mustek 1200 CU Plus on Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Do not send Xbox to Microsoft for repairs  </h2>
                    <p>Microsoft and I have been back and fourth for the past couple weeks due to my Xbox not being sent. I sent my Xbox for repairs. (Paid the extra $10 for expedited shipping),&nbsp;no problem, the package gets there. Once it‚Äôs finished I get my tracking number for the Xbox to be sent back, but all the tracking information has to say is ‚Äòlabel created‚Äô which means the carrier has never received that package yet, or they would have scanned the package to their truck. So. I wait 3 days to give Microsoft a call about this, and after a pointless conversation with a representative. She transferred me to a supervisor that tells me it‚Äôs going to take upto a month to be delivered to me. Ridiculous. I‚Äôm personally&nbsp;never using Microsoft&nbsp;service again.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>When I try to stream a &#42;.wmv file from the web, windows vista - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> asa dematteo  say:</h3>
<h2>            When I try to stream a &#42;.wmv file from the web, windows vista media player only allows me to save the file, not open it and stream it.  This makes my media player minimally useful.  Can this be changed&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>In the program section, the MMS protocol has windows media player as the only program available.&nbsp; I have a real media player on my machine and a quicktime.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the Windows media player does not allow you to play the WMV files from the web would suggest that
 you install the codec package and check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer the below link and install the codec package.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A default program is the program that Windows uses when you open a particular type of file, such
 as a music file, an image, or a webpage. For example, if you have more than one web browser installed on your computer, you can choose one of them to be the default browser.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Open Default Programs by clicking the

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Click on<strong> Associate a file type or protocol with a program

    <title>Cannot connect to your DHCP Server - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot connect to your DHCP Server</h2>
                    
<p>I am having problems connecting my XBox One to my wifi. I have a BT HomeHub 2 with BT Infinity, and have had no issues since I bought the XBox at Christmas. However for the last couple of days XBox Live doesn't connect and when I test my connection it tells
 me "Cannot connect to your DCHP Server".</p>
<p>I have tried everything on the troubleshooter except plugging in Ethernet since the Xbox is quite far from the Hub and I don't have a long enough cable. I have tried switching everything off and on again and I have disconnected all other wireless devices
 in the house. All the other wireless devices (e.g. iPad) find the wifi with no problems.</p>
<p>I also find that if I set up my iPhone as a hub my Xbox will connect to that but this is obviously not a solution.</p>
<p>I am a bit stumped since nothing has changed since it was working. I have no idea what to do now. Should I be returning the Xbox? Any ideas?</p>

<p>Im having the same problem i recently had to do an update but it stopped working about half way through , I've followed all the support steps and it still hasn't worked, I've even gone to the extent to call them but even they don't know what to do, they
 suggested trying their offline system diagnostics tool (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/system/offline-system-update-diagnostic-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../offline-system-update-diagnostic-tool</a>) but that hasn't worked either.
 So I'm stuck for ideas.</p>
