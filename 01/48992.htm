    <title>HOW TO DELETE&#47;DISABLE &#34;ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES&#34; IN WINDOWS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twowolves80  say:</h3>
<h2>            HOW TO DELETE&#47;DISABLE &#34;ACCESSIBILITY FEATURES&#34; IN WINDOWS 10</h2>
                    <p>I am looking for a simple solution. I know it exists. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know the registry code for Accessibility features in windows 10 so I know where it is in the registry, and can disable it by changing the value of the setting.
<br />
<br />
I am sick&nbsp;<em>&lt;removed- <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/page/faq#faqCodeConduct2">
CoC</a> violation&gt;</em>&nbsp;of these stupid "features" MS packs in that ALWAYS seem to cause problems. I shouldn't have to worry about being in the middle of a boss fight while gaming, and accidentally pressing some key combo, and suddenly, my keyboard won't type
 and does strange things because I've somehow managed to turn on accessibility, forcing me to restart to get things back to normal. Unacceptable. I shouldn't have to know about certain key combos--that accessibility&nbsp;<em>&lt;removed&gt;</em> (and that's all it is
 to me)--shouldn't even be there in the first place. This isn't what I paid for from MS. I paid for an OS that would stay&nbsp;<em>&lt;removed&gt;</em> out of my way. I don't need Cortana, I don't need apps, I don't need an app store. I don't want accessibility features.
 That I have to use regedit to get rid of them, instead of being able to simply disable them upon install, says a lot about Microsoft
<em>&lt;non-relevant content removed&gt;</em><br />
<br />
I want that registry location and code. Even if you don't give me the value to assign to the setting, I'll figure it out on my own. Just give me the registry code and location.</p>

<p>No.<br />
<br />
I want the registry data. I'm more than willing to take my chances, thank you. Submitting issues using the Feedback Hub is a joke. Nice way to try to pass the buck. Not happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want the registry location, and the code. I'll figure out the values on my own if you won't give them to me. If I have to figure out the registry location and code on my own, I'm going to post the results here with EXPLICIT instructions on how EVERYONE
 can finally get rid of something that should have died in Windows 98.<br />
<br />
I built my own computer. I've modded games so heavily that they looked like a fricking photo. Editing the registry is NOTHING to me. I could do that in my sleep.
<br />
<br />
Give me the registry location and key to search for to disable it.</p>

<p>I doubt there's only one location/key to disable all of those features, Have you thought of going into
<strong>Ease of Access</strong> and turning <strong>off </strong>the features you don't want? It doesn't sound like you know it's possible. It's quite simple really. Or have you tried Binging/Googling what you want to do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should have died in 98? I'm sure you understand there are people who actually need some/all of those features.</p>

            I've already turned them off. Think it's off, right? Nope.<br />
<br />
Playing game.<br />
Boss fight.<br />
Button mashing.<br />
Suddenly, keyboard no longer functions properly.<br />
Now, Q acts like ALT+TAB.<br />
TAB acts like Windows key.<br />
****?<br />
Ease of Access.<br />
Everything is off. <br />
Why, keyboard?<br />
Restart computer.<br />
Keyboard back to normal.<br />
<br />
I want it erased. Gone. Finito. Kaput. If <em>you</em> want to keep it, fine. Good on you. I don't want it nor need it. And I'm pretty sure the control panel itself can be suppressed through regedit--I
<em>know</em> Cortana can be. <br />
<br />
I want keyboard macros, shortcuts, hotkeys, whatever is doing that, gone. I've had this happen before, and I know it's one thing only, but I can't remember what it is. Therefore, I posted here, seeking the proper registry key which I will then delete/disable.
 Problem solved.<br />
So, I'll thank you ahead of time for posting the proper registry key and value to be inserted.

<p>You know it's one thing only in Windows 10? In XP, it seems to be according to this pg. We're a long ways from XP, ya know. Things aint so simple anymore. Edit: Removed link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't KNOW the proper registry keyS. Have you tried searching for what you want to do? You didn't answer that.<strong>&nbsp;If&nbsp;</strong>there were/is an easy way, I'm sure you can find out yourself.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to understand, while some of us post registry tweaks/hacks once in awhile, this isn't just a simple&nbsp;<em>tweak</em>&nbsp;you want to do. Keep in mind, some things can't be posted on these forums either, for various reasons. This forum is for helping users

<p>That's a start...<br />
<br />
It's the sticky keys, I think. They weren't on, but the keyboard sure acted like they were. But since those are part of the Accessibility suite, they can go. I probably wouldn't delete the folder in case MS wants it to verify the legitimacy of the Windows copy,
 but keep it on the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I've tried searching. Google has turned to such a crappy search engine that I don't even bother using it anymore. Tried Bing (can you say, Irony?), still nothing...big surprise. Everything I was finding was way too old or had nothing to do with my search
 terms...finding the reg edit for something like a timer resolution tweak or forcing the cores to unpark? Pff. Easy to find. This? Not so much. I may just search for that registry key.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure there's not much dependent upon the Ease of Access whatever. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This <em>is</em> fixing Windows...by getting rid of something I will never use, never need, and don't want. I understand about not posting something security-related on here, but those sticky keys or whatever have to go. Tired of accidentally activating
 it.<br />

<p>No, i didnt search the registry because it is my experience that anything i touch i wreck. So i figured id put google to the test (it failed), and then Bing (it, too, failed), rather than putzing with the regedit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>if i hose the works then goodbye MS, hello Linux.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if thats the case, ill just start combing through the system files and when i find a folder that says Ease Of Access or something similar, ill just delete it. If it borks the OS then ill just do without MS and their top shelf bloatware.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Anyway, keep in mind Sticky Keys isn't the only sound. That sticky keys thing pops up, so it's a no-brainer to realize if it's sticky keys that's the problem. There's caps lock, numlock AND browsers have hot key shortcuts,

<p>Oh, believe you me, I know <em>all</em> about making a back up. *looks at the trail of digital wreckage left from modding Skyrim and Fallout 4*<br />
<br />
Sound? There's no issue with the sound. It's the keys. I use the WASD keys for gaming, along with a few nearby keys, Q, E, R, F, X, TAB, CTRL and SHIFT. I was playing Batman: Arkham Asylum. There is
<em>some</em> button mashing involved in the middle of a boss fight, and I'm not paying attention to the keys I'm pressing besides the WASD and spacebar and Q. It isn't CAPS LOCK. All that does is force a crouch to stay enabled.<br />
<br />
I remember something about...hitting SHIFT and ENTER...? That combo seems vaguely familiar for some reason. I dunno. Nothing pops up when the game is active because of the way the Steam overlay/UI works. It will remain the active window no matter what pops
 up. And when I shut it down (I didn't even have to ALT+TAB, just pressing Q and W, independent of each other, seem to have taken up the property of becoming ALT+TAB) there's no window waiting for Sticky Keys. Shortcut keys, maybe? I don't know. That's the
 problem. <br />
<br />
Yes, I realize the problem needs to be defined before you can fix it. Unlike modding Skyrim, this isn't a moving target. I'm positive it has something to do with Windows' Ease of Access/Shortcut Keys/Sticky Keys, because I had this problem before, and can't
 remember the solution (but it was just a temporary fix, i.e., turning it off, as opposed to disabling it, which is now what I want to do).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>lol Here's the thing about Linux. I know vaguely what a distro is, I know what Linux is, and beyond that, it's witchcraft. I've heard of Linux boxes, but I think Steam has issues running in Linux (I
<em>know</em> the script extender for Skyrim has problems running in Linux, unfortunately, and SKSE is the only way to get mods to load into the game, bypassing the Steam launcher, Skyrim.exe). I've run DOSBox before (for all that glorious 8-bit gaming--hello,
 Rex Nebular and the Cosmic Gender Bender!), and Regedit doesn't scare me (mostly because I'm already aware that it's a minefield).
<br />
<br />
Once I <em>do</em> find the solution, I will post it here in case other gamers have the same issue (and I can't imagine I'm the
<em>only</em> one). Steam gamers already expect Windows to play hell on the system, especially since updates can bork a 200+ mod game that took a week to set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you, though, no matter the results. Maybe MS will take a cue from the modding community and make Windows more like a FOMod installer where you can select the features that will be most useful, and not install the ones you have zero use for, not just
 the "personalization" it walks you through currently.</p>

<h2>            Problem with starting up computer and receiving error code OXC000021a</h2>
                    So halfway through a game of overwatch, my computer suddenly had an office update and the notification popped out on my screen. This caused me to tab out of overwatch and once i closed that notification my computer started to lag like crazy. I checked
 my task manager and it said my disk was 99% used. To fix this problem i closed all applications and restarted my pc. After restarting, my computer just kept going through the loop of saying attempted to fix computer failed and i couldnt fix the issue. Can
 anyone help me with this? (I run windows 10 by the way)

    <title>Vista mouse freeze during mobsync.exe &#40;Microsoft Sync Center&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ijaffray  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista mouse freeze during mobsync.exe &#40;Microsoft Sync Center&#41;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
My&nbsp;Vista&nbsp;system has had the mouse freezing for 10 or 15 seconds every few minutes for some time now, too long for me to simply start undoing restore points. I've read what's on the net regarding others who have had the same difficulty, and tried most of the
 fixes but with no success in getting rid of or even modifying the problem.<br />
<br />
I have a MS Optical Mouse Blue USB, running on&nbsp;an up-to-date Vista Ultimate install on a Dell workstation. The mouse freezing is&nbsp;often coincident with hard disk activity, so I tried turning off indexing service and anything else that would be intermittently
 running the hard disk in the background, but again with no effect on the problem.<br />
<br />
Recently, I brought up Task Manager and left it open. A couple of minutes later when the mouse freeze happened again, I saw "mobsynce.exe" appear in the Processes list, then disappear a few seconds after the mouse resurrected itself. This is what's happening
 every time the mouse freezes, at least on my system.<br />
<br />
I had never heard about the "Microsoft Sync Center," and reading about it on MS gave me not much more insight into why it's popping in and out like it is. I tried turning off all shared folders and drives,&nbsp;with no change in the frequency of the freezing.<br />
<br />
MS says Sync Center cannot be turned off or deinstalled. I don't have any mobile devices attached to my machines, that I know of. I am on a home intranet, and I have HP MediaSmart Server on that network, along with a couple of other machines.<br />
<br />
In the Sync Center, I saw nothing that could be stopped from being synced, no evidence of errors, etc. Its sole function, on my system, seems to be to freeze my mouse&nbsp;dozens of times each day. &lt;|:-)&gt;<br />
<br />
Would anyone know about this feature of Sync Center and how to make it behave and leave my mouse alone, or even what the heck Sync Center is supposed to be for? Could there be something to do with it being a USB mouse that makes Sync Center think it needs to
 check it for "synchronization"?<br />
<br />
As part of the "trying out everying everyone else has suggested on the net in regard to the Vista mouse freezing problem," I have installed/deinstalled mouse drivers for this mouse as well as using whatever&nbsp;generic Vista driver is there. No change to anything.
 I have not tried switching to the a PS2 port, but only because what I've read about says it makes no difference to the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help with this.<br />
<br />

            Yes could be some conflict in the USB stack.<br />
<br />
Here is how to refresh the USB just in case you ever need it.<br />
<br />
If a specific device(s) is in envolved do step 1. <br />
<br />
<br />
1. Control Panel - Device Manager - click anywhere in the blank/white area - VIEW - Show Hidden Devices<br />
<br />
Check ALL the Device Manager EXCEPT USB Controller for the device (there may be more than one or not so<br />
you have to look closely). For each instance of the problematic device RIGHT CLICK and UNINSTALL.<br />
<br />
2. Now go to USB Controllers there, RIGHT CLICK - UNINSTALL EVERYTHING in the Category except the<br />
Category itself. <br />
<br />
APPLY/OK <br />
<br />
Reboot - the USB stack will be rebuilt.<br />
<br />
This KB shows&nbsp;the XP how to and the Vista method is identical<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575</a><br />

Keep that info handy.<br />

            For anybody's information ...<br />
<br />
I rebuilt the USB stack and swtiched the mouse back to a USB mouse. I experienced the same freezing problem as before, seemingly quite a bit worse, which makes the mouse unusable. The only solution that has worked in my situation is plugging the USB mouse into
 a PS2 port adapter and using it that way. There are still occasional "pauses" but not freezes, and they may have other causes.<br />

            You need to know the router's factory-set user name and password.&nbsp; That information should be available in a setup guide that came with the router.&nbsp; What make and model is your router?

<h2>            Xbox one controller on PC &#40; configuration problems &#41; </h2>
                    
<p>Hey everyone,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;I've been trying to play games on my laptop with my xbox one controller, but when i go to configure it that buttons are numbered and not as they are on the controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A button reads as Button 1 for example. I can't for the life of me figure out the layout for it, I've tryed looking up a graph but i haven't been able to find one could someone help me out here?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Is this within a game? If so, this issue could be due to the specific game and whether they support the Xbox controllers.</p>
<p>If you try a game that states it supports the Xbox 360 controller, you should have better luck using the Xbox One controller and having an easier time configuring it.</p>
<p>If so, that makes it an issue with that particular game.</p>

<p>Like Maxen13, I would be interested to know what game/s you were having problems with using you Xbox One controller on your PC? &nbsp;</p>
<p>All the Xbox 360 controller compatible PC games should work fine with the One controller.</p>

                    <p>After upgrading from windows 8.1 pro to windows 10 pro all my files and settings were deleted. &nbsp;In fact, my whole hard drive has been wiped clean. &nbsp;I didn't have an option whether or not to save my files and now there is no operating system at all on my

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 is much appreciated.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In order to help you better, could you please confirm a couple of things:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">How did you upgraded from Windows 8.1 pro to Windows 10?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Did you receive any error message during upgrade?</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>If depends how have you upgraded to Windows 10, if you have performed clean install then the operating system will be wiped out.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So I suggest you to install the Windows 8.1 pro and activate it, then I suggest you to download and install the Windows 10 by using the ISO file from the below link and then check whether you see your file\data.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you download the ISO file from the below link and install the Windows 10 based on your 32 bit or 64 bit.</span></p>

            <p>I just clicked the button to upgrade to windows 10 in windows update. &nbsp;I did not do any clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only error received was after some time which was a blue screen of death telling me that my of needed to be repaired and it gave me the error code 0xc000000f.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I can install windows 8.1 pro is if I do a custom installation which cleans all files from hard drive so how is that going to get my files back? &nbsp;Furthermore, doesn't the ISO file for windows 10 that you provided require a product key to install?
 &nbsp;Why would I pay for it if it is free to upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What custom install do you recommend? &nbsp;Doesn't that wipe everything from the hard drive? &nbsp;Why would I perform a custom install?</p>

            Hey Jeff. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See here to control Defender notificaitons: 
<br /><a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/what-are-enhanced-notifications-windows-defender-how-turn-them-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/what-are-enhanc...</a>
<br />
<br />All other notifications are set in Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications.  You can also set Focus Assist there that restricts notifications during certain times or situations when you don't want to be bothered (like gaming).  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks. I was able to turn OFF the 'Get notifications from apps and other senders' but then below that, everything in the list is greyed out and can't be changed. Why would that be? I'm the only user so I'm the admin on this home computer.<br />
Could it have something to do with the fact that my Windows 10 phone also uses these same Settings somehow? If that's the case, how do I set both to OFF?<br />

<p>Here's another new type pop-up that I'd never seen before. They're coming after me. It's BAD!!<br />
This silly "Move notification to action center" isn't for me. I don't even know what an Action Center is or why we'd need one.<br />

<p>I just noticed that I had 2 Questions going on the same thing when I solved this on the other one and was looking at my Profile, the list of all my stuff.</p>
<p>So, this one is done too, I hope. I haven't waited yet to see if what I did but I'm feeling good that it will. :-)</p>
<p>I does still bother me as to why those were all greyed out and unchangeable. I'd asked Andre if he would know why and I haven't heard back.

            How are you connecting your computer to your printer?&nbsp; Ethernet?&nbsp; USB Port?<br />
<br />
One thing you can try is to go to the "Printer and Faxes" control panel,&nbsp; Right-click on your printer, select "Properties".&nbsp; When the properties window comes up, click on the "Advanced" tab.&nbsp; Try selecting the option "Print directly to the printer", Then OK
 your way out.<br />

    <title>Keyboard Intermittently Stops Responding When Using Skype or Playing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Keyboard Intermittently Stops Responding When Using Skype or Playing Video</h2>
                    Hello everyone,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a strange problem, which I originally thought was a problem with Skype, but I have recently started experiencing it in other programs, too.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem is this:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I am having a Skype video chat and using the keyboard to transmit written content at the same time, the keyboard suddenly stops responding and I have to use the mouse to bring focus back to the window into which I am typing the text.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been having this problem for quite some time, and it started when I was using Windows 7 x64. &nbsp;As I am now using Windows 8 x64, I don't think the problem is necessarily OS-related. &nbsp;I have not yet upgraded to Windows 8.1.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, I have now found that the same thing happens when I am playing a video file and simultaneously typing notes into a text editor (such as Notepad).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Furthermore, I am fairly sure that the problem is not to do with the display driver, because I have had the same problem with two different display adapters; neither is it to do with the keyboard driver, because I have used several different keyboards,
 some wired and some wireless, and the problem persists.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions?<br />
<br />
I have done a lot of searching, but all I can find are forum posts (both here and elsewhere on the web) which are anywhere between 2 and 8 years old.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Please Note:</b> &nbsp;I hope that I have posted this in the right place, as I couldn't decide what was the correct category to choose, so if an admin thinks that it might be better to move this to another forum, please feel free to do so, and please also
 accept my apologies for any inconvenience I may have caused. &nbsp;I would only ask that if an admin decides to move this topic, could I please be emailed about it, so that I'll know where to look for it next time?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance for any help!<br />
</div>

<h2>            Skype not working after migration to new Macbook Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the Mac Migration Assistant to migrate my old Mac Mini to a new Macbook Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now Skype won't work on the new laptop.&nbsp; I can't make or receive calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I click "Audio &amp; Video Preferences" Skype locks up and I have to force quit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've deleted it and reinstalled the latest version. Actually I've done that twice and the problems still persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

<br />
<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />Honestly, the Windows 10 mail app is a very simple tool and lacks some features. Unfortunately, this is one of them, you cannot do that at the moment, sorry.
<br />
<br />Regards.

<p><span>I would suggest you to install the latest Chipset driver and update BIOS driver form the manufacturer’s website and then check if this fixes the
 issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Important:
</span></b><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot

<h2>            &#34;Input Indicator&#34; keeps turning off</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep turning on my&nbsp;"Input Indicator", but it gets turned off when I restart. What is the reason and how to keep it turned on?</p>
<p>Here is the snapshot for the "Input Indicator" that is turned off.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d405a3c-8bd4-4253-881a-c2c64e73cc7d" /></p>

<p>Hi <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c61fc337-ec93-405a-8975-cf7331eb1e7d" title="jha.amit6666">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently faced the same issue. Its very annoying bug. On googling and playing with setting I found a workaround which is as explained:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all go to <strong>Control Panel&gt;&gt;Language&gt;&gt;Advanced Settings
</strong>as shown</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c0a7d1e-9122-44e3-8907-490606f897d2" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here make sure to uncheck <strong>'Use the desktop language bar when it's available'
</strong>checkbox and select the radio button <strong>'Don't use automatic learning and delete all previously collected data'
</strong>(actually its automatic learning that seems to be buggy!)</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fdcbc3c1-f037-48e4-b9c6-e02fdd58d7fc" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Save and close it. Now go to <strong>Start&gt;&gt;Settings&gt;&gt;System&gt;&gt;Notifications and Actions</strong> and select
<strong>'</strong><strong>Turn system icons on or off</strong>' as shown<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b3c937b-aa57-4cd1-83dd-ef66592ec66c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now turn the '<strong>Input Indicator</strong>' to <strong>On</strong> position and relax. Your setting should stay as selected after that and language input indicator shows itself automatically on every restart. Tell me if it works for you or
 not.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Please mark it Helpful if it works</em></strong></p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player cannot play DVD video. You might need to adjust your Windows display settings. Open display settings in Control Panel, and then try lowering your screen resolution and color quality settings.</h2>
                    I have recently encountered a problem viewing DVDs on my PC.&nbsp; The above is what it is saying and I have tried to change the settings of my screen resolution and it still won't play DVD's.&nbsp; Why all of the sudden am I having this problem?

<p><strong><span><span>Hi LoriMc,</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>1. Were you able to play the same DVD earlier?<br />
2. Does it happen with a particular DVD or all of them?<br />
3. Do you have third party DVD decoder software&nbsp;installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
Try running Windows Media Player DVD troubleshooter and check if it helps:<br />
a. Open the Windows Media Player DVD troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel.<br />
b. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Troubleshooting. Click View all, and then click Windows Media Player DVD:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-DVD-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-DVD-troubleshooter</span></a></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Play a CD or DVD in Windows Media Player:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Play-a-CD-or-DVD-in-Windows-Media-Player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Play-a-CD-or-DVD-in-Windows-Media-Player</span></a></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
Try updating the codecs to check if the issue persists. Also uninstall if you have any third party CD\DVD burning software installed.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Refer the below mentioned Windows help article.<br />
<strong>Codecs: frequently asked questions:</strong><br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Codecs-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Codecs-frequently-asked-questions</span></a></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 3:</strong><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to update the latest drivers for your display adapter from the manufacturer’s website and then check for the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Open Device Manager by clicking on Start, then type Device Manager.‌<br />
</span><span>b. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
</span><span>c. Look for the Display adapter drivers, right click on it and select ‘Update Driver’.<br />
</span><span>d. Once the drivers are installed, boot the computer and check for the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Update drivers: recommended links:</strong><br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Update-drivers-recommended-links</span></a><br />
<strong><br />
<span>Step 4:<br />
Try reducing the Hardware Acceleration.<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>a. Open Screen Resolution by clicking the<span>&nbsp;</span>Start button, clicking Control Panel, and then, under<span>&nbsp;
</span>Appearance and Personalization, clicking Adjust screen resolution.<br />
b. Click Advanced settings,Troubleshoot tab, and then click<span>&nbsp; </span>Change settings.<br />
c. Move the Hardware acceleration slider toward None to reduce or turn off video hardware acceleration.<br />
d. Click OK, and then click Restart Now</span></p>
