<h2>            Minecraft button problem</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought minecraft and when I play it some certain buttons to do actions will not work but my controller will be completely fine out of it. (Example)- Sprint button won't work when I play minecraft but when I use the button on Xbox menu it works
 completely fine. If someone knows the problem or has a solution I would gladly appreciate it!&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would recommend trying basic troubleshooting since I don't believe it to be a controller issue&nbsp;seeing it works fine when using it outside of Minecraft. If you already tried the power cycle mentioned above by Parity then you will need to try out a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button to open the guide.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>System &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Console info</strong>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Reset console</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>Make sure to select "Keep my games &amp; apps" and have your account login information plus your WIFI password ready if you connect wireless because&nbsp;you will need to re-add the account's that were on the Xbox&nbsp;and re-connect
 to your network during the reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help, then try re-installing the game.</p>

<p><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/customize-standard-controller-with-accessories-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Can you also check that your buttons are configured to the default in the Xbox Accessories app?</a>&nbsp; It lets
 you change the mapped buttons on the controller, and that might be causing the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What actions are you seeing when you press the button?&nbsp; Any action at all? Another thing to check might be that the game has to be launched from the profile you're signed in as and trying to play?&nbsp; If another profile launched the game, I know that causes
 some issues with controls and what happens on screen.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 NT Kernel &#38; system constantly writes to system disk</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: <span>NT kernel &amp; system process</span></p>
<p>I would like to know why the System (NT Kernel &amp; System) process is constantly writing to my hard drive? Also, is there anything I can do to stop or slow this down?</p>
<p>My HD LED is constantly blinking. It's been driving me batty for the month I've had this PC (LED's been blinking since I took it out of the box)&nbsp;and I started researching it with little results.&nbsp;Per Resource Monitor "System" and "svchost.exe" are the only
 things accessing my disk with "System" being almost constant. This worries me greatly as far as burning up my HD because of constant use.</p>

<br />
make a xperf trace [1]. This captures the IO activities, too. Please upload the etl file to your SkyDrive [2] and post a link here.<br />
<br />
I'll take a look at it, to see what is the cause.<br />

<p><span>Hi Helli N,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Along with what Andre has suggested, you can also try the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1: How to identify the services behind a Service Host (svchost.exe) process?</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on a blank space on Taskbar and click on Task Manager to open up the Task Manager.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Processes tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Show processes from all users button.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Continue button when prompted with User Account Control dialog.</span></p>
<p><span>There will be a long list of svchost.exe shown in elevated Task Manager.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Locate
 the svchost.exe that you want to find out what’s the services running behind it, such as those with high CPU usage or high memory usage, right click on it, and choose Go to Service(s).
</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>The
 focus tab will be switched and transferred over to the Services tab, with a few services been selected and highlighted. These are the services that are associated with the particular svchost.exe.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 identify the services that are possibly causing the svchost.exe to hogging system resources, carefully work out the services that you suspect may cause the issue. Once determined a suspected service, right click on it, and select Stop Service. Before you stopping
 any service, make sure that no other services rely on that particular services.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you find these steps too troublesome to locate associated services for svchost.exe, then download Process Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Download Process Explorer</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx</a></span></p>
<p><span>No installation required. Just unpack and run<strong>procexp.exe</strong> and then move and place mouse over on top of a svchost.exe process. A
 tooltip balloon message will pop up with information of all services running behind that svchost.exe.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2: Perform an online virus scan</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>Sometimes malware, spyware, adware, Trojan or viruses commonly hide behind the mask of svchost.exe consuming all the system resources. So, I would
 suggest you to perform a complete virus scan on your computer. Visit the link below for the same.</span></p>

            <p>I was recently seeing constant disk access for my Windows 7 Pro system, with about 3% CPU use by the System (PID 4). Although 3% should not slow the system down significantly,&nbsp;my PC was sluggish to start and run basic applications.&nbsp;The disk light was flashing
 constantly. The&nbsp;resource monitor (accessed from the Task Manager) showed dozens of disk accesses by this System process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Following several threads and suggestions, I gradually stopped several possible culprits. Although potentially helpful, I stopped the Windows Search (indexing) service. I also stopped the SuperFetch service. These seemed to make only minor gains. I then
 stopped the Media Player and Media Center Network sharing services. Upon rebooting, my system is renewed and fast. My CPU sits between 0-1%, the disk is quiet, and ideal disk I/Os are in the single digits and small. I have not gone about adding back in any
 of these services to see if and which ones might be tolerable, but for now I am a happy camper.</p>

    <title>When using Windows Explorer to view folders and files, image file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> izzlecrate  say:</h3>
<h2>            When using Windows Explorer to view folders and files, image file thumbnails display briefly then are replaced by the default image file icon.  I have tried answers given to similar problems but none worked.</h2>
                    I browse folders with image files but cannot see the thumbnail icons for any images correctly.&nbsp; I know it should be possible, but I cannot do it.<br />
<br />
When I first open a folder in Explorer, I see the correct images for a split second, then all the images are replaced by the image file thumbnail (it looks like part of a digital SLR).<br />
I have set the all the image folders display to show preview and filter, and the "always show icons never thumbnails" is not checked.&nbsp; The "display file icon on thumbnails" is not checked (I have tried it checked, also, with no change).&nbsp; I have also deleted
 the thumbnails by using Disk Cleanup as suggested on another question, but that did not enable them.<br />
The upshot is that, if I want to open an image for editing or download, I have to use a third party application (such as Pentax Photo Browser) to preview the images and then go back to explorer's window to select the correct file by its name.

Don't attempt to fix those things that are not broken.

You might want to try this and I just did this procedure myself a moment ago and surprising it worked!&nbsp; First I must tell you that I have Windows Vista but the information that I got it from was for Windows 7 and it worked.<br />
<br />
First: You must create a NEW FOLDER and put it on your desktop.<br />
Second: Move or copy the contents of the original folder to the NEW FOLDER on desktop. I copied the contents just in case something went wrong.<br />
Third: After that is completed and all of the contents are inside that you want. <br />
Fourth: On the desktop right click the folder and click on properties at the bottom of the box.<br />
Fifth:&nbsp; Click on customize tab at top then in the middle of the box click RESTORE DEFAULTS for the folder.&nbsp; Click on Apply than click OK and your done<br />
<br />
NOW! you can move the folder where ever you want to by dragging and dropping the folder and when that is done and this is the best part, you should see the thumbnails of the folder on the EDGE of the folder that you just created.&nbsp; This worked for me and I hope
 it works for you.<br />
I have 10 yrs. experience with my computer and have troubleshooted my friends computer for viruses and other problems successfully.&nbsp; I am Advanced computer user.<br />
<br />
What this does it restores the folder back to it's original settings.&nbsp; Good Luck! Rick<br />

            <p>Hi Nick, </p>
<p><br />
Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft Community Forums. <br />
</p>
<p>It is not possible to directly assign a control panel item as a shortcut to the taskbar. As a work around, you can create a shortcut and add the shortcut to the toolbar section in the taskbar as mentioned here.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. On the desktop, create a new folder. </p>
<p>b. Go to control panel and open <strong>'Small Icons' </strong>in the category list.
</p>
<p>c. Right click on <strong>'Sound' </strong>icon and select <strong>'Create a shortcut'</strong>.
</p>
<p>d. Now move the shortcut file from the desktop to the new folder that we have created.
</p>
<p>e. <strong>Right click </strong>the taskbar and select <strong>'Toolbars'</strong>.
</p>
<p>f. Click on <strong>New Toolbar </strong>and select the shortcut icon that we created.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Reply with the status so that we could help you further.

<h2>            Windows 10 Lock screen picture won&#39;t change.</h2>
                    I have tried the only ways that i know of to change the lock screen background (through the photos app and through the lock screen settings menu) and neither work. the menu gives me an infinite loading circle and the photo app says "make sure the file
 isn't damaged, then try again.") This is frustrating simply because the default piercing blue annoys me. any help is much appreciated.&nbsp;

<h3> nanush  say:</h3>
<h2>            Advent computer won&#39;t boot from CD recovery disk doesn&#39;t work either</h2>
                    We have an Advent 3119 computer. It will switch on, show Boot from CD, automatically go onto the screen where it &nbsp;asks how would we like to start the computer. We have tried&nbsp;safe mode, and the other alternatives and it always does the same. The windows
 xp screen comes on trying to load the programme, then it closes does and the TFT monitor screen says "no signal".
<br />

We have tried using the advent system recovery disk which tries to load, but always ends up by freezing and&nbsp;showing a blue screen that we can't get out of. The error message says a problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage.
 It says disable or uninstall any anti-virus or check hard drive with scan disk to check for corruption.&nbsp; Unfortunately we can't do any of this as the screen is locked, and won't allow us to type in any info, and we don't now how to get out of this sceen&nbsp;to&nbsp;ask
 it&nbsp;run CHKDSK/F like it asks us to do&nbsp;. <br />
<br />
The technical information says "STOP OX00000024 (OX001902F8, 0XF89B06FC,0XF89B03FC, 0XF81688E9)
<br />
ntfs.sys - Address F81688E9 base at F813000, Datestamp 3b5e36a9.<br />
<br />
If anyone out there is able to help or advise us if there is anything we can do to find out what the problem is it would be really great to&nbsp;get your advice.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I can't get past the first step....when I type in "Windows Live Mail" all I get is "Bing" with tons of sites to chose from, and I don't know which I should chose to even get to step 2.&nbsp; Can you give me an exact web address to type in so I can get to the
 right site to type in "Alt + F + O + M? Or maybe I'm typing it in wrong, but don't know where to type it! Please be VERY specific, thanks!</p>

<p>I'm looking for games under 400msp too. Yeah Bloody Good Time is pretty fun. Also try the trials for 3D Ultra Minigolf Adventures, Brain Challenge, and Chime. There are also some classic games that are 400msp: Wolfenstein 3D, Street Fighter II: Hyper fighting,
 and Worms . Not much to choose from, these are the ones I'm thinking about purchasing. Most decent Live Arcade games are 800msp and up. If I still can't decide, I might get some cheap Indie games or I might splurge and buy 800 more msp to get Comic Jumper
 which I really want.</p>

                    Dear all,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pasting the complete C# code in single string line&nbsp; as follows,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int _intUserID=0;string _strUserName=string.Empty;string _strEmployeeID=string.empty;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; in VS2005 C# .cs file the code has to paste as follows.<br />
<br />
int _intUserID=0;<br />
string _strUserName=string.Empty;<br />
string _strEmployeeID=string.Empty;<br />
<br />
<br />
So how to achieve this. by inserting the new line char in C#?<br />

<h2>            How do you uninstall programs stored under a different drive letter&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Dell D800 that I bought off of the school district. There are a whole bunch of programs on it that I want to uninstall, but whenever I use the control panel to do that, it says I have the invalid drive letter and won't work. What do I do?

            Many people would recommend that you do a complete reinstall on any second-hand computer.&nbsp; For Dell computers, see
<a href="http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/kcs/document?docid=52182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/kcs/document?docid=52182</a>&nbsp; (<span style="font-weight: bold">NOT</span> "Step 1: System Restore").&nbsp; Because your computer was originally deployed in a school, the "PC Restore" partition may have been
 deleted by the school's IT administrator.&nbsp; In this case, you may or may not be able to obtain re-installation media from Dell).<br />
<br />
If you do the "factory restore," you should follow the following advice from long-time MS MVP PA Bear:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<p>After the clean install, you will have the equivalent of a "new computer" so take care of
<b><i>everything</i></b> in the list below, <i><u>in order</u></i>, before otherwise connecting the machine to the internet
<b><i>or a local network</i></b> (i.e., other computers) <b><i>and before connecting a flash drive, SDCard, or any other external drive to the computer</i></b>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the Windows Firewall is enabled.</li><li>Uninstall any <i>now-invalid</i> Norton, McAfee, etc., free-trialware which was also reinstalled, run the appropriate removal tool (see below), then install an anti-virus application of your choice (e.g.,
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspxMicrosoft%20Security%20Essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspxMicrosoft Security Essentials</a>- free).</li><li>Check in at Windows Update &amp; get the computer fully-patched.</li><li>Install [an] anti-spyware application which includes realtime protection.</li></ol>
<p><br />
TIP: Use another, uninfected computer to download the installers for, e.g., SP2 and/or SP3, the installer for your new anti-virus application and either of the removal tools cited below. Transfer these files to CD or DVD (not a flash drive) then transfer the
 files from the CD or DVD to the desktop of the computer you're working on.<br />

</p>
<p><br />
TIP: After getting the computer fully-patched, download/install KB971029 manually before connecting
<i>any</i> external drive to the computer: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971029</a> [1]<br />
<br />
<b><span>VERY IMPORTANT!! =&gt;</span></b> Any Norton or McAfee free-trial that came preinstalled on the computer when you bought it
<i>will be reinstalled</i> (but invalid) when Windows is reinstalled. You <b>MUST</b> uninstall the free-trial
<b>AND</b> download/run the appropriate removal tool <b>BEFORE</b> installing any updates, Windows Service Packs or IE upgrades
<b>AND BEFORE</b> installing your new anti-virus application (e.g., <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Security Essentials</a> - free).</p>

If you nevertheless elect NOT to do a clean reinstall ...<br />
<br />
Please provide the complete error message without paraphrasing.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Also provide answers to the following:<br />
<br />
What version of Windows is installed, including service pack? Right-click on My Computer and select Properties for details.&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.askdavetaylor.com/4-blog-pics/windows-system-properties.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</a><br />
Open My Computer.&nbsp; What devices are listed?&nbsp; Please don't abbreviate; this shouldn't involve that much typing.<br />
<br />
What applications are you trying to uninstall?<br />
<br />
Without the answers to the above, my guess is that the installer/uninstaller file for these applications is located either on a CD (which you don't have) or on a network drive (which you also don't have).&nbsp; You probably can uninstall most applications with free
<a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Revo Uninstaller</a>, but to avoid confusion, please provide the requested information.<br />
<br />
<br />
Right-click My Computer and select Properties<br />
Click the "Computer Name" tab<br />
Does it show a "Full Computer Name" and a "Workgroup" like this --&gt; <a href="http://www.conniq.com/Windows-networking/images/computer-name-xp.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            If you saw the "Advanced Boot Menu" but didn't see an option to reinstall the factory image than either your Dell is older than 2009 and thus uses the PC Restore system (CTRL+F11) rather than Data Safe Local (F8) or the school removed the Dell restore
 mechanism.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I suggest that you see if PC Restore is available on your machine --&gt; <a href="http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/kcs/document?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;docid=DSN_181316&amp;isLegacy=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/kcs/document?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;docid=DSN_181316&amp;isLegacy=true</a>
<br />
<br />
Or <br />
<ul>
<li>Open Disk Management (Start &gt; Run &gt; diskmgmt.msc &gt; OK).</li><li>If the entire space for Disk (0) is filled with C: (as it is in this <a href="http://support.wdc.com/images/kb/diskmanagement_xp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
screenshot</a>), then you no longer have the Dell Restore image.</li><li>If there is a small unnamed section (usually at the left end) in addition to C:, then you probably do have a Restore image.</li></ul>
<br />
If you can't reinstall or decide not to, the error message does indicate that the application was installed from a network drive and that the installer is therefore not available on your computer.<br />
<br />
To remove Kaspersky, I suggest you use the Kaspersky removal tool: <a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/faq/?qid=208279463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>The only thing you can do is enter private chats via games for windows live. Party chats are limited to the console only. Tinker is a free game you can use that game to get into the ui for sending messages and entering private chats.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;so I’ve been having this error with minecraft where anytime a friend invites me to join their world, or I invite them, a text box comes up with “connection failed”. My wifi NAT is set to open, my privacy settings are totally fine, and anytime my friends
 invite me to play a different game, I’m able to join. It’s literally just minecraft that will not let me join or add others to a game. The servers are always invite friends on, I have them added as a friend, etc. Can someone please let me know what I’m doing
 wrong here? I’ve done tones of research and I cannot find out what is wrong.</p>

            there could be an issue with the version of the game... If you (or any of them) are Xbox insiders one of you may have the beta version exclusive only to the insiders, not to everyone else. check to see if they are insiders.&nbsp;

            <p>Hey</p>
<p>I found out that Zoom simply untill now has not made a</p>
<p>download version for win 8. </p>
<p>By the way - you can open Zoom Q3-files in win Movie maker, but mostly</p>
<p>the program close Down and shows error - don't know why.</p>
<p>We can only wait untill Zoom comes with an up to date download for win 8.</p>
<p>best regards.</p>

    <title>24 Months of Game Pass offered for free during console setup, errors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> x redacted x  say:</h3>
<h2>            24 Months of Game Pass offered for free during console setup, errors out</h2>
                    <p>Took advantage of a Gamestop promotion and traded in my Gears edition S console for a new Scorpio edition X. I went through the initial console update step, as well as the express setup via the Xbox mobile app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While proceeding through the setup wizard, I was prompted with a screen promoting Game Pass. There were three options (I took a photo with my phone so I can offer proof) listed as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>"Xbox Game Pass 14 Day Free Trial" for "$0.00"</li><li>"Xbox Game Pass 1 Month" for "<del>$9.99</del> $2.00"</li><li>"Xbox Game Pass 24 Month" for "<del>$240.00</del> $0.00"</li></ol>
<p>along with options to "Use a code" or skip using "No thanks".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to select the third option because hey, that looks like an amazing deal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The loading spinner came up for a second, then asked me to confirm my identity via access code which I did. Then the loader came back up for a few seconds, then the usual "Do you want to buy this" screen came up with options to get or go back. Unfortunately,
 this screen was basically a flash, as before any action could be taken for the prompt I was presented with the error code "frwSWMi2oU6q4nFI.3.11.1.3.2.1.11.9" along with a statement saying something was wrong on the other end. Accepting the error took me back
 to the Game Pass screen with the same exact options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to opt into the deal a few more times before becoming fed up with the process and decided to skip it, so that I could finish the setup. After that, setup went smooth and I was about to interact with the dashboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, this offer does not appear anywhere now. I then contacted customer service through Live Chat to see what was going on. It was determined that this offer was actually a bundle offer which required a code. After some back and forth, I was directed
 here to make a post. I have a reference number for this chat, if required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It makes no sense to me that this would be offered as an option like above, and ALSO require me to input a code, while mentioning the code or bundle requirement exactly zero times during the setup. It also seems opposite of the typical user interaction,
 as when offered like above it is what it is and there are no special requirements... but if there are, you don't see it until the code is input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were not eligible, I should not see the option and if I were, it should have worked without a code.&nbsp;I would appreciate it if someone could take a look at this, because as is right now this is pretty bad user experience and I could see some customers
 not taking this well at all.<br />

<h2>            Where to get updated driver for TV Home Media 3</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am watching TV on my Toshiba laptop with the use of external tuner and cable TV connection. I use Windows 7- 32 bit operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Tuner I use is Gadmei DSI TV stick UTV 383F the driver software that came with this TV stick is TV Home Media 3. &nbsp;I was able to watch tv before without any problems. But recently, I had to reinstall o/s for some other reason and since then I don't see
 any picture coming on TV screen . Before, o/s reinstallation, I &nbsp;was not able to see any tv videos, (photos), for last few days. I tried to troubleshoot it and it says that TV Home Media 3 is incompatible. I tried to look for updated driver for it but could
 not find anything on the internet and there is no site of manufacturer where I can look for updated version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can any one give me any suggestions in this situation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reply will be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

</p><p>Hello, Mr. Mayank Gupta10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your prompt reply, It is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Ran Hardware Device Troubleshooter. It said device may not have been detected but then next to it said, completed. It also said something like - you can go on doing what your were doing before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I will have to call TV service provider and see if they can get my TV working again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it works fine, otherwise, do you know where to get TV Home Media 3 updated driver? Because as I mentioned in my previous post that I was not able to find updated version for TV Home Media 3 driver on internet and manufacturer's website is not known.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I would like to know how to watch tv on Windows 7 Media Center? I tried to follow the instructions on Microsoft website but some of the things mentioned there are not found on my Windows Media Center so I could not complete the instructions given on
 Microsoft Windows website.</p>
<p>

<p>When installed, this rogue pretends to be an update for Windows installed via Automatic Updates. It will then install itself as a single executable called AV.exe that uses very aggressive techniques to make it so that you cannot remove it. First, it makes
 it so that if you launch any executable it instead launches XP Security Tol 2010, XP Defender Pro, or Vista Defender Pro. If the original program that you wanted to launch is deemed safe by the rogue, it will then launch it as well. This allows the rogue to
 determine what executables it wants to allow you to run in order to protect itself. It will also modify certain keys so that when you launch FireFox or

 a fake firewall warning. Last, but not least, when try to browse to a web site, it will hijack your browser and state that the site is a security risk and not allow you to visit it.</p>

    <title>Why does the mouse pointer size keep changing in Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ain786  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does the mouse pointer size keep changing in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My mouse pointer size keeps changing from SMALL to LARGE every time the screen locks.
</p>
<p>This means that I have to go to<em><strong>"Settings - Mouse - Pointer Size"</strong></em> and select the small pointer size,&nbsp;<strong> each time
</strong>I log in or unlock my screen. </p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            Hi AIN.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go to Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose the Mouse device, then on Driver tab choose Update Driver Automatically.  If no newer driver is found, right click the Device to Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps what I'd do at this point is wait a few days for Spring Creators Update to be released, install Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can monitor the Windows 10 Blog here to get notified of the exact date for release of Spring Creators Version 1803 which is soon:   <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thank-you for your reply.</p>
<p>I tried both options - but the problem persists.</p>
<p>Strangely enough the pointer now appears as a "square block" when I lock the screen and log in again!!</p>
