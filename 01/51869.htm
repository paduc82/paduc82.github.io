<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This pop-up message is a reminder that the catalyst must be updated as well since the system was updated. To get rid of the pop-up, you need to update the software package. If there is an option presented on the pop-up message on how to do it, you can click
 it, or you can visit the AMD Catalyst Software website to update the package.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 troubleshooting &#38; black screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 troubleshooting &#38; black screen</h2>
                    I've had a few problems since I uploaded windows 10 yesterday, including the removal of my autocad and adobe licenses, problems with receiving and storing emails/attachments and a black screen which only allows me to see my mouse. I've tried fixing the
 email problem by going on the store app however that isn't working and I can't find a troubleshooter which works. I tried the windows 10 app troubleshooter however it states that it won't work with this version of windows. Any advice regarding any of these
 problems?

            Im having a similar problem ever since i installed windows 10. Three scenarios all leading to unresponsive black screen with no mouse pointer, only responsive to power button. Left in idle, computer will go black screen unresponsive. If i close the lid(laptop)
 and open it up again computer will go unresponsive. Also, if i perform a regular shut down function computer will go black screen unresponsive. This is a major difficulty.. i have to keep using the power button to turn it off then back on every single time
 XD!!!! probably happened 6 times by now. since yesterday, what a pain. Thanks ^_-!

            <p>This happened to me too on two different laptops (hp and Acer). I just realised on my Acer that when I dimed the screen light it actually made the screen light up again... meaning.. the windows has inverted the screen light. If you had it on max brilliance
 try to reduce the light. it's working the other way around for some reason.. Hope they'll fix it soon.</p>

            Hi All, <br />
<br />
Thanks for posting. Per this you should contact Sony and request another disk if one was supplied with your computer. There is a chance that this disk is bad.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!

    <title>Skype Video Feed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike stephens &#40;mike&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Video Feed</h2>
                    <p>Hi there. I have an issue with Skype following the latest version update, which I installed last week. I am using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I start a call I can see the video feed of myself. When other people join they get a box on the screen but their video feed does not come through. If I tab into a different window then their video feed does show through in the thumbnail, but when I
 go back into Skype I just get their holding picture. I can't find anything in settings to change this. Can anyone help??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Here is a direct download to classic Skype. It should fix that problem for you, however Microsoft is going to shut classic Skype down Sep 1, 2018. Hopefully by then the New Skype will have the problems worked out.

            Hi  Mike, until Microsoft resolves the bugs and lack of functionality in the new Skype, it would be best to revert to the Classic Skype
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic, which most users prefer to the new app:

<h2>            Creative Sound Blaster Live&#33; 5.1 PCI SB0220 - Not Detected</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Creative Sound Blaster Live! 5.1 PCI Sound Card (Model&nbsp;SB0220) which always worked in Windows XP.&nbsp; I bought a new desktop with Windows 7 and when I installed this card Device Manager (under Other Devices)&nbsp;had yellow exclamation marks for Multimedia
 Audio Controller and PCI Input Device.&nbsp; When I&nbsp;tried to install the original software from CD my PC blue-screened on me despite choosing to run in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>After months of waiting the Compatibility Website now reports that the Creative SB0220 Sound Card is compatible with Windows 7 and directs you to the Creative website to download a file called SB24_PCDRV_LB_1_04_0090.EXE.&nbsp; When I run this file I get the
 following error message:</p>
<p>"Setup is unable to detect a supported product on your system.&nbsp; Please ensure that your product is properly installed before running this Setup program.&nbsp; Setup will exit"</p>
<p>When I took the sound card out and rebooted my PC nothing was detected in Device Manager.&nbsp; As soon as I reinstalled it, it showed up in Device Manager again so I know that it is detected.</p>
<p>Is it best to wait for Microsoft to create the correct drivers or do I buy another sound card?</p>

<p>Hey Lifeat50,</p>
<p>Thanks for your post.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;&nbsp;difference in&nbsp;sound quality seems&nbsp;perceptible&nbsp;to me, from 16bit to 24bit.</p>
<p>I'm a musician for 20-ish years, and I think it's a reasonable upgrade for your videos.</p>
<p>Here's a website that&nbsp;explains&nbsp;the difference (LOL, in&nbsp;excruciating&nbsp;detail):</p>

</p><p>Please answer this question to assist you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you able to boot to desktop?</p>

<p><span><span>Once your media is ready follow the steps.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

            What I said in my previous conversation that has been a while since I've been working on this thing and yes is still a blue screen is that recovery section I did buy an SSD and I ended up getting another bootable Windows 10 but again is still giving me
 problems is giving me an error code 0xc 0000098 file \Boot\BCD I went ahead and got SSD and I installed it in my computer that I have which is my extra one to pull the hard drive out of that one and I'm thinking about installing it into my other computer course
 the one with the blue screen not try just about everything I've read just about everything I can think of that software that that Microsoft and Windows has I went to their tech section and you have to understand that I'm just an old blue-collar 74-year-old
 man that used to be an automotive mechanic when I retired we were still having points and carburetors in our cars so as old as I am I been really trying real hard to understand computers and learning more than I think I can with a little

            <p>I believe the xcopy command is still included in Windows 10. You can use it with switches to duplicate a folder structure without copying the folders' contents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The /t switch copies the folder structure (only) from the source folder to the destination folder without copying the files, but it won't copy empty folders in the source folder. If the source folder includes empty folders you will need to add the /e switch
 as well. So the full syntax would be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>xcopy source target /t /e</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the School of Hard Knocks: Practice with a set of dummy folders first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just remember: You need to have adequate permissions in the source and destination folders.</p>

Things were going fine in "Upgrading Windows " screen. It was on 30%, Copying files was completed &amp; Next step was "Installing features &amp; Drivers". Its where my laptop restarted, screen flashed &amp; got the screen saying "Attempting to recover installation" &amp; then
 "Recovering your previous version of windows".<br />
<br />
After laptop restarted, got the error as mentioned.<br />

Any Idea how to get over this error?<br />

<p>Alternatively, you could connect to the IPv4 address of the AirPort by using "Configure Other..." from the File menu of the AirPort Utility.&nbsp; Thank you for pointing out the relation to IPv6.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As I understand you are facing issue with installing updates and keep getting the following error "Windows Update is
 currently installing other updates. Please try again in a few minutes" with error code: 80240016.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Let me know if I have misunderstood.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue occurs if a Windows Update client or a Microsoft Update client cannot access the user token.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refer the methods mentioned below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Run the update troubleshooter</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Restart the update service</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<b><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b><b><span>Hover</span></b><span> the mouse to the top right hand corner and click on search</span></p>

            I've had exactly the same problem trying to process Windows 8 updates.<br />
<br />
Tried method 1: resulted in an apparent program loop with the message 'Clearing BITS queue'. How long should this process run for? Over 20mins!<br />
<br />
Tried method 2: resulted in the message 'The service is not responding to the control function'. This occured on both
<b>Net stop wuauserv</b> and <b>Net start wuauserv</b> commands.<br />
<br />
I updated the operating system last week from Windows 7 and so far Windows 8 appears to be working OK.<br />
<br />
Any more ideas? <br />

<h3> cyndi simpson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Signing in to Skype</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype signs me in automatically at home. Today, I opened Skype at work, where I have used my account before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But today, it wanted me to sign in. I used what I thought was my Skype pw, but it did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then put in my Microsoft account name - a hotmail email address - and changed my pw.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went back to Skype to sign in and it did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did this repeatedly - and I was furious about having to change my MS account password. But I seem to get stuck in MS pw Hell several times a year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I would go back to sign in with the new pw, it insisted on showing me my Skype name - I could not put in my hotmail email address - that is, my MS account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that the reason MS insists on unifying my account across all MS products was so that **** like this wouldn't happen.<br />
<br />
Please help me out - I need to get in to Skype at work at some point - though I gave up for today and am using the phone.<br />
<br />

            I don't know why you changed your password.
<br />
<br />What you should have done was enter the email address and your Microsoft Account password. 
<br />
<br />I get this when I try to enter my Skype ID and Microsoft Account password when I setup Skype on a new computer. But all I do is click Back then sign with the email address and password.
<br />
<br />So, try using the original password. 
<br />
<br />As for the password reset you performed, give it 3 hours then try using the new password again - make sure the computer remains connected to the Internet. Sometimes it takes some time for the password reset to federate. If it doesn't work try using the old password.
<br />
<br />If none of the above work...
<br />
<br />I recommend you contact chat support and choose Technical problem so an agent can help diagnose whats the problem with your account:

<h2>            How to use the xbox 360 in China where the voltage is 220V&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I bought the xbox 360 in US, and the voltage for the console is 110V. How could I use the same console in China where the voltage is 220V? If I use a transformer, will it hurt the console? I heard that I could buy a 110-240V power supply, but I don't know
 where to buy it.</p>

<p>If the details on your current PSU say 110 - 220 and it has a tolerance of 50hz- 60hz, then you could use that.</p>
<p>US is 120v at 60Hz</p>
<p>Canada is 110v at 60Hz</p>
<p>China is 220v 50Hz.</p>
<p>But, if your PSU voltage rating is restricted to say 100v-127v. Then you will need to purchase the correct PSU for the country, in this case, China. Then you have the whole NTSC and PAL issues if not using HDMI.</p>
<p>To be honest, your best buying a new Xbox in China to save you all the hassle, and then you know your 100% correct/safe.</p>

<p>You are correct to a point. The UK PSUs are rated at:</p>
<p>200 - 240v 47Hz - 63Hz, which would of course work in China/Hong Kong.</p>
<p>As we already mentioned above, he is best buying one from China/Hong Kong, but I would advice to just get a whole new system and that way he has a 100% working Xbox. And most importantly, safe!</p>

<p>you could use a transformer but be aware of phase lag and spiking as transformers can distort the ac waveform to a different state that, when rectified by the psu can cause ripple and that is very bad. i would advise getting a universal power unit that can
 safely transfer 240 volts down 120 and wont cause waveform distortion &nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft's only official stance on 360 power supplies is buy one (from Microsoft) for the correct region and put nothing between the AC power cable and either the wall or the power supply input. For him to get out of this predicament, he needs to find someone

<p>Hi there, </p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>I have uninstalled and re installed iTunes, it opened started to download my podcasts etc then promptly froze as it had done every other time I have tried it.</p>
<p>I have the latest ITunes version and all my Microsoft updates are up to date so what is the problem?</p>
<p>I clicked on the link but I have no desire to go back to a previous version of windows, why should anyone do that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't get how two massive companies like Microsoft and apple cant figure out a fix for this, maybe they don't want to?&nbsp;</p>
<p>been on loads of forums and stuff and no one seems to have a solution, really frustrating it worked fine before windows 10, also how come some days it opens and some not?</p>

<h2>            I want to revert back to windows 8 from 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    I very recently had the store app recomend i upgrade to windows 8.1. From the second I had to re-apply all of my information i knew it was going to be dissappointing. My games are not running like they were, my screen has been downsized by 3 inches and
 i see no way of how to fix it. I want regular windows 8 back, from what i understood 8.1 was going to be an improvement. However, everything that could be wrong with this is wrong. I want my old windows back that worked properly and didnt give me a system
 32 error message after i sign in. I want my screen size back. I want my games to run at full pace again. I need help badly. Please?

            Hi Isaac,<br />
<br />
What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
<br />
If your computer came with <span><span>Windows&nbsp;8</span></span> you might be able to restore it back to
<span><span>Windows&nbsp;8</span></span> by refreshing your PC. Your personal files won't be affected, but apps that didn't come with the PC will need to be reinstalled. For more info, see
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to restore, refresh, or reset your PC</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Note: </b>When you perform refresh, you might lose all the apps that was installed on Windows 8.1 and You might be asked to insert discs or recovery media that came with your PC. Check the info that came with your PC to see if your PC manufacturer provided
 these discs or media. In some cases, you might have created them when you first set up your PC.<br />

 is nothing. I received the error message once and have not been able to start the computer since. I had installed Windows 10 approximately 2 weeks prior to this happening.</span></p>

 update because I don't have access to beta program, they also said that I can request an access here. So, can I access these forums for support?</p>
