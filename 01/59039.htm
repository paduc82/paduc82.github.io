            <p>Use Disk Clean Up.&nbsp; Right click your C:\ drive in the file explorer, then click on properties.&nbsp; Then click on Disk Clean Up,&nbsp; After Disk Clean Up opens click on Clean up System files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then review the list of options to clean up.&nbsp; You should see Windows Update Clean Up, Installation Backup files etc. The sizes will be listed also. Click the items you want removed and then click ok.

            <p>Thank you for responding, im just going to change up what i said.. I downloaded the Windows 10 tool and selected the option to use it on a USB and not ISO or installing from hard drive. I want to install Windows 10 on a different PC so I chose that. The
 problem I have is that after doing so, on the first PC which is still running windows 7 and I used to download Windows 10 has about 10gb less space than it did prior to doing the Win10 download. It leaves me with 14gb free instead of 24gb..I was wondering
 where the files are and how to get rid of those files. I have tried looking for them and I am not sure where they are, and I have done disc cleanup as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t boot &#34;Repairing disk errors this might take more than an hour to complete&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, last weekend I was going to use my computer when I realized that it was frozen so I pressed a the power button to shut it off. Then several minutes after I turned the computer on it still did not start up the windows logo was still there and
 the singing gears were still there, so I turned it off again (the same way as before). Then after about a couple of times of doing this it said "Preparing automatic repair" or something like that below the windows logo and spinning gear. Then it said "Scanning
 and repairing C: drive" and after that it said "Repairing disk errors. This might take more than an hour to complete." below the windows logo and spinning gear. I let it repair my c drive for about two hours and then I turned of my computer because I thought
 that something was wrong. &nbsp;Now when ever I try to startup my computer it says "Preparing automatic repair" or something like that after that it said "Diagnosing your PC" and then "Scanning and repairing C: drive" and then "Repairing disk errors. this might
 take more than an hour to complete." all &nbsp;below the windows logo and spinning gear. I then made a bootable windows 10 USB drive so I could access the recovery options because F8 was not working. After that was done making I booted from it and then from the
 command prompt in the advanced recovery options/ Windows Recovery Enviroment I ran Chkdsk and Sfc /scannow but both did not find any errors. I tried letting it repair disk errors for over an hour again. I also tried disabling and enabling secure boot. By the
 way the week before this happened my computer was running alright except it froze a couple of times and maybe even crashed once. I did not think anything of this because I though it was just a buggy driver or bad a windows update or a bad antivirus update
 and I did not have enough time to deal with it. I also got notifications that I needed to repair the errors on my hard drive. I did install software that I installed before on another computer and an earlier version of another piece of software that I had
 stored on on a USB flash drive so I recover some accidently deleted game saves. &nbsp;Is my hard drive failing?&nbsp;What should I do now? Should I try running system restore? What happened to all of my files? Should I go back to a previous build Was this caused by
 a virus or malware. Thank you guys I hope you can help me.</p>

I would try to boot off an external drive or move that WD Blue to another computer with another SATA and power cables and try accessing it as a secondary storage device in order to access your files and back up everything important so you are on the safe side
 even if the drive has issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
After that I would run WD Data Lifeguard Diagnostic and see if the WD Blue passes both the quick and the extended tests. Also, using another tool you can get the raw values of the S.M.A.R.T. status and see what they can tell you. If you are not sure how to
 read them feel free to post them here. All of this should tell you if the HDD is the cause of the situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I'd also try resetting the BIOS and possibly trying the drive on other ports with other cables on your own system and see if that changes anything. Bad cables or ports often cause issues that appear to be caused by the storage drive itself (bad connection,
 slow performance, crashes, etc.) especially if the drive holds your OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Running System Restore at this point doesn't make much sense as if the drive has physical issues you won't fix them and can further damage the drive itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
The files should still be on the drive. Connecting it as a secondary drive to another system should give you access to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Malware and viruses can be potentially involved here so scanning your system for them with good and reputable applications is a good thing.&nbsp;</p>

            I made an Ubuntu USB Flash drive and booted from that in the trial mode so I could try access my files. When I did this Ubuntu recognized my drive but for some reason I could not mount the drive because I got an error message saying that I needed to shut
 down Windows fully before I tried mounting the drive because of the hibernation file on my hard drive. I tried running a command from terminal to force it to mount but that that did not work. I did use the Disks program to check the status of the disk. I was
 able &nbsp;to see my hard Drive but it said was not mounted and it had 29 disk errors and that it was pre-fail. Then when I turned off my computer I tried again the next day I was able to mount the drive and view the file inside and every thing looked like is still
 there. When I sued the Disks program to check the status of the hard river and it still said it had 29 errors on it. The next thing that I was going to do was take a dying WD hard drive and install Windows 10 on that drive temporary and use it transfer files
 from &nbsp;my unbootable hard drive to my external hard drive. I will also install some hard drive monitoring software and
 &nbsp;I will also install some antivirus software so I can scan my computers hard drive for Viruses.&nbsp;</span>The reason why I am going to do is because I do not have a Sata to USB adapter or empty external Hard Drive enclosure to connect the unbootable Hard drive
 to my Laptop and I also do not have access to another computer. I will also use Clonezilla to clone my unbootable Hard Drive in case running Chkdsk will delete my files or corrupt them. Thank You for you help.

The initial plan sounds very good. Do try to get the raw values of the WD Blue's S.M.A.R.T. status and post them here so we can get a better understanding of the drive's condition.&nbsp;</p>

By saying "it does not work" do you mean that the WD DLG won't run at all or simply won't recognize the WD Blue drive.&nbsp;</p>

A note from me: cloning a failing drive is not a good idea as you may transfer some software errors caused by the damage on the old drive and thus corrupt the data on the new drive. My suggestions would be to simply copy/paste the data while it is available
 through the Ubuntu software and then perform al lthe troubleshooting steps that you are planning to do.&nbsp;</p>

 part of my computers motherboard DVD. Both of these programs are programs that &nbsp;I have used before. Both of these programs have the ability to see the SMART of all the drives on my computer(I will attach screenshots of their SMART). I was also wondering if
 there was a way to check if the folders that I copied and pasted into my new drive were exactly the same as the one on the old drive because when I right clicked the copied and pasted folder my external Hard Drive and the same folder on the unbootable Hard
 Drive the size and size on disk of the two folders was different but the amount of files and folders was the same. What does this mean? I was also wondering if there was a way to see where the corrupted files are or where the errors on the disk are.</span>

The difference might be caused by the different values of "File Size" versus "size on disk". "File Size" is the true file size where one byte of file is counted as exactly one byte. "Size on disk" tells you how much space on the drive was allocated to that
 file where a single byte file may take 512 bytes due to the Allocation Unit Size.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also I forgot to tell you that I when I was going to run CHKDSK disk in verification&nbsp;mode it said that it estimated that it would take 6-7 hours to . The reason why I want to clone my drive so that when I run CHKDSK again I can revert the drive to how it
 was before I ran CHKDSK in case I mess something up or it corrupts some files. When I was copying file I noticed that my external Hard Drive got knocked over or turned at an angle. It may have on and transferring&nbsp;files when it happened. Is the Drive OK? Do
 you think my files are OK? I also noticed more of a grinding/clicking sound. I cannot tell if it is coming from my external Hard Drive or one of My internal. What do you think?&nbsp;</p>

The drive appears to have some issues with 29 of its sectors and this is what the software is reporting. These are usually signs that the drive has started to have its health degrading and it's a good time to back your data up and replace the drive as more
 of these will eventually appear.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
CHKDSK /R does attempt to isolate those sectors and can prolong the lifespan of the drive but this should be taken as a temporary solution as more of these will appear, regardless of any actions taken as the read/write head flies over them anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
You can clearly see the difference between the values in "Size on Disk" and , as I mentioned in my previous comment, this is caused by the difference in the "Allocation Unit Size" of both drives. The Actual Size also seems to be different, though, and this
 may be cause by temporary files on your original storage place which cannot be moved over as they are active files used by applications and are only temporary. The difference appears to be around 9.75MB which can be a temp file or a group of similar files.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Check if everything you need can be opened and if it works properly. The amount of data moved is quite large (1000s of folders and 100s of 1000s of files).</p>

            Could I still clone my drive anyways? because I just to have my drive cloned in case chkdsk screws something up I can have an exact snap shot of drive that I can revert back to. Do you think that I could reapair all of the errors on my hard drive? Do you
 think they are physical errors that can be reapired or just soft, operating system errors that be repaired?

Cloning the drive may have the same effect on it as chkdsk /r in case you have a problematic sector that cannot be read at all. If you do clone this drive all the problematic sectors will be transferred to the new drive as errors and you will lose that data
 anyway. CHKDSK /R has a chance to reallocate data from such problematic sectors if the data from them can be read and isolate them. My recommendation would be to run chkdsk /r, run defragmentation and then clone your drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
If you have valuable data on the drive I'd suggest to manually copy it first before proceeding with anything.&nbsp;</p>

            If you purchase a 100 minute per month subscription for a year, you would have 100 minutes allocated to your account per month for a year. If you do not consume all 100 minutes in the month, you lose the remainder. If you consume all 100 minutes before
 the month is over, you balance will remain at 0 minutes until the monthly renewal refreshes your minutes.

<h2>            ebay.com - Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 32&#47;64 bit Retail Full Version - Question</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I browsed the community forums and came across a few threads where such questions have been asked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I came across the following link where an ebay seller is selling Windows 7 Pro Retail for around $190. Somehow from description, price and the photos, it seems legitimate to me. Also it has ebay money back guarantee. Since I am not able to find
 a retail copy at an affordable price anywhere, I am tempted to buy this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could anyone please guide me?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/291097311402?item=291097311402&amp;autorefresh=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 7 Professional Retail</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also contacted the seller to know from him if what he has written is legit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there still any chance of keys being MSDN or something if the product is retail/boxed and is never opened/unpacked?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>I honestly would not risk it, you just can't tell. For the honest peace of mind, buy it from a reputable source such as amazon.com/software. Ebay has just been too much of a bad bargain for software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks legit, but he could be using those images as a front and send you a pirated copy. In most cases, when it turns out its pirated, you either don't bother pursuing a refund or he locks up shop and starts or already in progress under a new alias.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still want to take the chance, its personally up to you. </p>

            Those are apps you should probably contact Samsung (likely the makers of whatever device it is installed for) to figure out what to do. &nbsp;They may have removal tools for them and/or they may tell you what specific registry entries and files to delete and/or
 they may tell you where to download and install the latest version(s) of said product(s) so you don't see the message.

Just to verify, how are you starting Windows 10? Are you using a Microsoft account or a local account? What changes have you done prior to getting this issue? What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?<br />

<p>I guess it's a local account. &nbsp;The system is in my home. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I was notified by Netgear that there was a firmware update for my Netgear router WNR2000, so I downloaded the update but could not get it to load. &nbsp;I called Netgear support and was connected to a technician who did NOT tell me that there was a charge for
 his service. &nbsp;After some diagnosis, for $199 he would install the firmware and remove a trojan horse that he claimed was in my system. &nbsp;I said I think it's a scam and hung up. &nbsp;Why would I spend money upgrading a four year old $40 router?</p>
<p>
</p><p>About two days later I needed a startup password to start my Windows 10 Pro system, which I never needed and didn't know one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gear Heads is the technical support company that I was directed to by Netgear.</p>

    <title>All my desktop icons keep moving off my screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryogherini  say:</h3>
<h2>            All my desktop icons keep moving off my screen</h2>
                    So I have just gotten an HP Pavilion desktop with WIndows 8 and am experiencing a problem. &nbsp;Sometimes, when my computer sleeps, all my icons disappear and the time, date, network connection and Norton symbol all do as well. &nbsp;Whenever I try to open a new
 window, it won't open. &nbsp;I have noticed that the problem is that they are all to the left of my actual screen, and it is some sort of glitch. &nbsp;Could someone give me info on how to fix this? &nbsp;Thanks!

            Same computer, same problem. Though it has only started since I isntalled an NVidia geforce 210 graphics card yesterday.
<div><br />
<div>It seems to be okay when I restart it, but it's almost like an incompatibility issue? I'm unsure. Any more help than this would be appreciated.</div>

            What the heck kind of answer is this to the problem? The proposed solution involves a great deal of programming and finding system files from other computers. We need a simple fix. My mail doesn't work and Microsoft should be able to provide a simple fix.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
<br />
About 5 years ago i made an Xbox live account, I did a stupid thing and put in "hotail.com" and not "hotmail.com" at the end of my email.</p>
<p>5 years later Xbox decides to put a security thing on my xbox where i need to put my email and password to log into live.....</p>

<p>No, i cant go into my account settings because you need xbox live for that</p>
<p>No, i cant change my password because the email does not exist</p>
<p>and no i cant do the survey thing with Xbox support because they always say i havnt given them enough infomation (even though i fill evreything out correctly..)</p>

<p>If anyone has the solution i flipping love you so much.</p>

            Hi I'm Peter an independent advisor, are you having problems with the onedrive client application? Are you using O365? Is the Internet working?<br /><br />If it's the client that's the problem you can still access onedrive in other ways...via the Microsoft website, onedrive app on mobile devices and office 2016 onwards allows you to sign in to your office account so when you go to File, open you'll see an option for OneDrive

    <title>ASUS laptop not charging - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jade west  say:</h3>
<h2>            ASUS laptop not charging</h2>
                    My ASUS X553M will not charge. I got it for Christmas in 2015 and it worked fine until a point last year where it wouldn’t charge. I thought it was the charger (which it was) and so I ordered a new charger last night and it came today. I then plugged it
 in but it didn’t work and I thought “I wonder why this isn’t working!” It charged intermittently but wouldn’t charge continuously. My mother’s boyfriend said that it was a fire hazard. I kept trying but it did nothing. I then tried the ASUS support live chat
 but whatever time it was it said that the live agent is unavailable as “out of service times”. Does anyone know how to fix it? Oh, one last note. The battery is dead so don’t tell me to do anything on the computer.

            Is the power supply a genuine Asus or a third party one?
<br />Some third party chargers aren’t the correct rating so will charge very slowly. If you purchased a genuine charger via Asus then you’ll have to contact them when they’re open or email them via their website.
<br />Choose your region: <a href="https://www.asus.com/entry.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.asus.com/entry.htm</a>

            It’s a third-party charger, the genuine Asus one broke on me. I did get it to work kind of today but it died and it just started doing the same thing. I’m starting to think that this is physical damage to the laptop and not the charger (that I bought third-party)
 because the laptop works when it wants to. I do need a new laptop since this one is kind of beat up and worn out, so I’m asking my parents to get me the HP Pavilion Notebook 14 inch or the Surface Go. I appreciate your time and effort spent on writing the
 reply, and it was very helpful to know that.

            I think it’s the power jack that needs replacing, but the laptop is almost destroyed anyway, all klutzes will know what I mean, and also it’s very slow and full of crap, so I need a new laptop anyway. I’m thinking about getting (well asking my parents
 to get me) the HP Pavilion Notebook 14 or the new Surface Go. If I (well my parents) had enough money I would’ve asked them to get me something like a HP Envy, but there is no money, time, resources, work or love for me for them to get it. I appreciate you
 helping in every way, shape or form, and that goes for everyone who helps me with this issue.

    <title>About the msconfig option - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            About the msconfig option</h2>
                    <pre><p><span>Good morning team<strong> Microsoft.</strong>

My question regarding msconfig is very interesting and I believe it is a useful information to add in the "boot" tab of the support on the site.

It is reported on the Internet (More in Brazil) that by leaving unchecked the option "number of processors" windows limits the use of processor cores to 1 core.

But from what I understand, when this option is disabled, Windows uses all the available cores.

This specific information is not on your support tab, it only mentions that it is unchecked from the factory (but not the reason).

Link: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/msconfig-the-system-configuration-tool/273dea8e-4cbe-47e9-8489-f400e879ce17

If what I am saying is what actually happens in Windows I would like a confirmation so I can also disclose to my friends and maybe even through a video on youtube that there is a misconception on the part of thousands of users who think windows Uses only 1 processor at startup when the option set above is unchecked.

Thank you for your attention and I await your return.</span></p><p /><p /><p><span><strong>Mário César</strong></span></p><pre><p><strong><span>Computer Engineer Student</span></strong></p><p /><p><span><strong>Country: Brazil, Pernambuco, Recife.</strong></span></p></pre><p /><p /><p class="contentStandard"><em>***Post moved by the moderator to the appropriate forum category.***</em></p></pre>

<p>This is definitaly a mis-perception!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows will use whatever processor power and all available cores it has access to when loading . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is plenty of advice on the web about setting maximum number of processors in msconfig and most is is bad/ill-advised information. There are numerous users on this forum that have bricked their systems by playing around with this setting</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most processors nowadays have multiple cores and are managed by software technologies like SpeedStep and TurboBoost, and it is best to leave well enough alone . . .<br />
