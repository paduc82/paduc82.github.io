<h2>            Sony Vaio did not come with recovery cd, and haven&#39;t been able to locate the set online</h2>
                    I have a Sony Vaio that's a few years old running with Windows XP Home Edition.&nbsp; When I first purchased the computer I wasn't very technilogically experienced that didn't think twice about the computer not coming with an Operating System cd.&nbsp; Anyway, now
 that the computer is a few years old I'm realizing the importance of having this cd as a backup if all else fails.&nbsp; My problem occurred when I went to the Sony website where a list of retailers were provided that might carry the recovery cds.&nbsp; After phone
 calls and emails I have yet to find one that still carries then&nbsp;Sony Vaio Recovery Set.&nbsp; I still have my genuine Windows Xp key, along with the receipt from the computer purchase.&nbsp; I'm no longer concerned with whether or not a new install has all the original
 programs that came with my computer ( ie. sony ).&nbsp; My concern is just to find an actual cd that I can use in the unfortunate event that I need to reinstall my operating system.&nbsp; Any hel

<p>Sony Vaio systems come with a recovery partition and software to generate ONE set of the recovery CD-Rs or DVD-Rs.&nbsp; Read the Vaio documentation that is installed with your system.&nbsp; It will explain exactly how to generate the recovery media.&nbsp; I've done it
 on a Sony Vaio laptop but can't remember the exact commands off the top of my head.&nbsp; I do recall that it was going to take twelve CD-Rs and I elected to generate two DVR-Rs instead.&nbsp; (It will NOT accept CD-RW or DVD-RW media.)&nbsp; The program that generates the
 media is in one the All Program menus somewhere.&nbsp; Nobody&nbsp;<em>sells</em> the recovery media, you have to make them yourself.</p>
<p>You do NOT generate the media by typing F10 at boot.&nbsp; That uses the the recovery partition to REINSTALL from scratch.&nbsp; (Bye, bye, files!)</p>

<p>My initial thoughts are that the comments are not entirely incorrect. There are a lot of players that only seem to play one game / genre,
</p>
<p>So the real question is - what is a hardcore gamer?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I mean, I play many different games / genre and all depends on what mood I am in although I always enjoy zombies (and prior to the last several months on Black Ops2 - MP)</p>
<p>But I may only play 2-3 hours 3-4 days a week.... so does that make me casual or hardcore??</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Interpretation is the key on his statements.... </p>

<p>What they said &nbsp;^</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Although I'll add they probably just ticked off a lot of people who consider themselves hardcore gamers .......... especially with adding "or even gamers".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I dont know about the term hardcore, but I've been playing video games for about 40 years now as my primary hobby. I'd say that at least classifies me as a gamer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;One question I have even more than "what classifies as a hardcore gamer?" &nbsp;is "what classifies as a really stupid comment from a game developer?" &nbsp; &nbsp; I know if I considered myself a hardcore gamer I'd probably pass on the next release ..... just because
 I suspect a hardcore gamer would be rather insulted by someone telling them they werent one. &nbsp;</p>

<p>TOG,&nbsp; I am not sure that it will matter what any developer says to a true gamer (whether hardcore or casual), as they buy the game to play because they like it. COD has been successful as it has the gameplay that attracts many different types of gamer.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I think that the majority of the gaming community will fall into the Casual Gamer category and COD is the perfect pick up and play game, whether it is for 1 match or a whole night long session. Sure there are other FPS'rs out there but none that offer the
 same formula that COD has.</p>
<p>To their credit IW nailed the formula 100% in my view and they have reaped the rewards sine 2006.... I suppose you could describe COD as an arcade shooter rather than a true SIM - and in that is its success.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Like you have been playing video games since they were invented back before consoles.... Asteroids anyone? - &nbsp;so the ill thought out comments of a self-important developer wouldn't prevent me buying the game.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I just hope for their case that the game lives up to the hype (dedi servers for instance and the communities expectation that it will solve the connection issues) - if it fails to live up to the simple expectations that the community has been complaining
 about for years, I think that many, me included will lose loyalty for the franchise.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The other factor of course, is what games a players friends are playing.... this has an influence for me on what games I buy for online gaming.</p>

<p>^^I agree, being a CoD player is way more hardcore than a hardcore FIFA guy (or any other genre probably besides WoW). Anyways, Asteroids was way advanced technology when I was gaming. I was doing some Pong and even PC games saved on cassette tape invented/programmed

<p>So the real question is - what is a hardcore gamer?</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>For me, it's a term<strong> I want to see gone.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is it with this obsession over labels and sub-labels within a label? Our entire history has been like that!&nbsp; Ever since gaming was a thing, we've always been looked down upon. We were called nerds, childs, and all sorts of epithets that would make one
 wonder if that person kissed his mother with that mouth. We found refuge in gaming. Now that people are interested in what we do, why do we shun them? Girls, boys, gays and lesbians, etc. Who are we trying to impress here?<strong> Is our self esteem that low
 that, because we got pushed, we need to push others for us to feel superior?!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seriously. If someone plays games, they're a gamer. Yes, even Facebook games. Let's stop pushing these people away. We all agree the PC master race is annoying but are we not becoming like these individuals by limiting others access to our hobby, making
 them feel unwelcomed? It's not kind and we're not in the best light - don't give people reasons to put the spotlight on us for the wrong reasons.</p>

<p>Uneasy, not sure if you had your tongue in cheek when you wrote this.... but I'll bite....why would a COD player be more hardcore than a FIFA player - I dont understand? Surely a gamer that plays regularly, no matter what game / genre it is a gamer.
</p>
<p>For instance, some years back, I used to play Tiger Woods Golf everyday, I played in online leagues and if I was up early enough I would have a round before work.</p>
<p>Other than the fact that might make me a bit sad, I would suggest that would make me a dedicated gamer - no less so than someone that plays COD (for discussions sake - pretend I dont play COD).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>[quote]Is our self esteem that low that, because we got pushed, we need to push others for us to feel superior?![/quote]</p>
<p>Kanaye, I dont agree with your suggestion that this is the way it is.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If a non gamer asks me what my hobby is, I describe myself as a gamer. if a gamer asks me what level of gamer I am, I would describe myself as dedicated to my hobby. I actually dont see the term as derogatory but when discussing with people that understand,
 describing myself as casual or hardcore is understood. If someone wishes to take that as derogatory description, thats on them, I dont mind what they think of me.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>To expand on your point - maybe we should not be called men or women - after all, why use labels separate gender? OK, maybe a bit extreme but I guess you see my point.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The problem is that those who claim to be hardcore gamers use the term casual gamer as derogatory. Thats really the only time I hear it used is, when that "hardcore" gamer thinks he is above others, or above a game. If he doesnt like something in the
 game, its because it was made for casual gamers. If someone disagrees, it because they are a casual gamer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I cant say that I've ever heard one gamer call another gamer a casual gamer in a friendly manner.</p>

    <title>Windows folder and user folder both eating disk space &#40;Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows folder and user folder both eating disk space &#40;Windows 10&#41; 65&#43;GB</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10, long-long time ago upgraded from a 7.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Case 1: Problem with "Windows" folder, used two methods in an attempt to locate where biggest files, usually I find a big folder and then google it to find a solution, but not this time.&nbsp;<br />
The difference is almost x3! 50 GB&nbsp;vs. 18 GB (see picture).&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c1e1f587-b6cc-42bd-91a3-6341d54c0e6b" /></p>
<p>Since I checked in a folder option 'show hidden' i guess that there is something super-hidden that causing that 30GB loss.<br />
<br />
Case 2 - %USER_name folder 14GB, some items like&nbsp;C:\Users\Name\AppData\Local\Google takes 1.9GB, and I'm not sure if I can delete there anything.&nbsp;<br />
About 4GB located on same folders but in Roaming.&nbsp;<br />
Plus, I find some folders from games I uninstalled long time ago, those two folders need some purge/wipe but without damaging actual stuff which I'm&nbsp;using right now. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please help me to free my C drive.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What I did with no result so far:<br />
1. Ran CCcleaner, Clean Master,&nbsp; built-in Disk Cleanup.<br />
2. Checked folders "Windows&nbsp;old," updates, temp</p>
<div>3. Tried to find a large folder, but as seen in the picture, I've missed about 30gb of some unseen files.</div>
<div>4. Checked system restore - 1.58gb size, acceptable. System protection is turn off with a 0 bytes limit set.&nbsp;</div>
<div>5. My RAM is 16gb, so I turned off all kind of virtual memory and/or caching on my drives.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />

Thanks a lot! A tool is awesome indeed! Ok, I found 6 points, which can yield good chunk of free gigabytes, can you please check and tell me which are safe to delete from a system?</p>

            <p>I would highly recommend not deleting any files from Windows\Installer manually. Use
<a href="http://www.homedev.com.au/free/patchcleaner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this utility</a> instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can clearly see in images 3 and 4, Nvidia's graphics driver installer/updater by default keeps saving older versions of the driver. At around 300-400MB each they sure add up in size quickly and are terrible especially for SSD owners. I suggest uninstalling
 the driver and ensuring all those nv* files and the Installer2 directory are gone. The official method is to perform a clean installation via the installer itself (see the checkbox below):</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>For best results I prefer running <a href="http://www.wagnardsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
DDU</a> from Safe Mode, then reinstalling just the components I really need from the latest version of the driver installer.</p>

            Hello Cedi64, welcome.<br />
<br />
Vista will keep creating restore points until the physical space they are stored in is filled.<br />
Vista will create restore points under some of the following conditions:<br />
<br />
1. A Windows update is installed<br />
2. A program is installed<br />
3. A driver is installed<br />
4. System checkpoint<br />
<br />
Vista is supposed to create what's called 'System Checkpoints' that are created after so many days go by. How days do the restore points go back or does it have just 1 restore point available?<br />
<br />
Thanks!

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I split anymore parts of my video&#63;</h2>
                    I'm not sure why, but for some reason, I can't split anymore parts of my video. I have a bunch of split parts of my video right now because there is a lot of editing that needs to be done. However, I tried to split a part of my video after all of the other
 splits, and I received an error message (yellow triangles with exclamation points in them on all of the thumbnails for my video frames). I don't know if this is because you can only split a video so many times or because my software doesn't work or what. But
 every time I try to split that part or any part after it, I see the error triangles. And once I undo the split the error goes away. Please help!

<h2>            Microsoft &#61; bad news for Skype</h2>
                    <p>Not really a question. Just a complaint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been a Skype user for 10 years plus, I cannot remember how far back it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back in the good old days, Skype was reliable, the interface was clear/intuitive to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then Msoft bought it. And wrecked it. And now it is another hacked Msoft mess. So just wanted to express my displesure. Not only is Windows a hack, with an interface design by a neon sign salesman, but its variety of system configuration screens makes
 it impossible to figure out where to change settings. Unless you type the exact proper phrase in Cortana.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely, Msoft is a miracle to have stayed in business this long but producing low grade, brittle, insecure, and non-fuctioning systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely, wasting my time typing this is only 10% of the time it took for me to try to login into Skype, so I do not invest the little time needed to vent.</p>

            I'm seriously considering ditching Windows altogether and buying a Mac computer. I am used to Apple's IOS now with an Iphone and IPad, and might just as well have the same here. Will miss my MS Word though, but maybe there's a Mac version as well.&nbsp;

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I ran sfc /scannow yesterday - OS XP SP3, CD XP SP3. It completed without giving me any notifications other than a number of:<br />

"Files that are required for Windows to run properly must be copied to the DLL cache."<br />
<br />
<span>I was prompted to click on 'retry'.<br />
<span>I was prompted to click on 'retry'.<br />
<br />
It lasted for around 40 minutes then closed.<br />
<br />
I thought all had gone well until I looked in Event Viewer today. There are approximately 90 Windows File Protection entries there mostly with the following information:<br />
<br />
The system file ........ could not be copied into the DLL cache. The specific error code is 0x800</span>b<span>0100 [No signature was present in the subject]. This file is necessary to maintain system stability.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span>I think the Help and Support Center that no longer functions properly was listed as being a bad file with a bad signature......and could not be restored to its original, valid version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At no point did sfc /scannow advise me that it had not successfully repaired files though, which is odd. Would it normally?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I restarted my computer directly afterwards, half way through booting a 'please wait' appeared - perhaps the dll cache was being updated then, I don't normally see that?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What do I need to do now please? Try again, try in Safe Mode or ?</span> Please note I normally summon a computer technician for complicated work / reinstallation of Windows and I'm not able to do that at present.

            <p>In Windows XP, running sfc /scannow does not do what many people who recommend its use seem to think it does.&nbsp; It does not repair or replace missing or corrupted system files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What it is supposed to do, however, <strong>is</strong> "update the dllcache."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is your XP sp3 CD actually an installation CD or is it merely the CD that is used to update an installation running sp1 or sp2 to sp3?&nbsp; What is written on the face of your CD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it like this (except saying "Includes Service Pack 3")</p>

            <p>Thank you for helping me. You may recall you previously assisted me here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-windows_install/xpsp3-installation-sfc-scannow-command-queries/2bbf9cad-2df0-4abf-9b89-6deabdf723aa</p>
<p>
</p><p>.......in fact I wasn't sure whether to open a new question or carry on there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I used for sfc /scannow (I bought another installation CD, in addition to the XP SP2 one I recently purchased):
</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Microsoft-Windows-XP-Home-Edition-SP3-OEM-License-Media-BRAND-NEW-/191194031869?pt=UK_Computing_Software_Software_SR&amp;hash=item2c840d66fd</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have carried out Microsoft's recommended checks to ascertain whether or not this is genuine, I feel certain it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I installed SP3 through Microsoft Updates there were some immediate problems - the Help and Support Center stopped functioning (nothing shows in the search results region) and I cannot run System Restore anymore, no matter what date I choose I get:
 Restoration incomplete. Your computer cannot be restored to......'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer had some BSOD's not so long ago with the error code:<span> 0xc000021a, although there hasn't been any for the last month or so.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>There has also been malware on it in the past, but this was successfully removed (I was told it was not serious). I wonder whether it modified a number of files though, it did knock out the Security Center and I was remotely assisted with that issue by Microsoft
 Support technicians.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I bought the installation CD because I previously didn't have one and I wanted to run sfc /scannow to improve my computer's health basically, to make sure all was well. You did tell me before that:
</span>"....using sfc /scannow will almost certainly <strong>NOT</strong> help you in any difficulty that you are likely to encounter.<span>"........but why does it appear that it hasn't successfully updated the dll cache?</span></p>

            <p>A few points:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't know what you mean by Microsoft's recommended checks to determine whether what you bought on eBay was genuine, but I certainly have seen assertions by people I consider reliable that counterfeit Windows CDs can be highly sophisticated and extremely
 difficult to detect (it's been so long that I don't remember, but I seem to recall that genuine XP came on a CD and that DVDs weren't necessary until Vista).<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I can't explain why you have the errors reported in Event Viewer and why the dllcache wasn't updated, other than perhaps you have Windows XP Media Center installed.&nbsp; See
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-system/files-that-are-required-for-windows-to-run/5d598cff-3122-4cc4-8f0e-d8a58072040d?msgId=c8cbbb94-167a-4579-89b0-7f092d0e7eb0">
THIS POST</a> (which lists a number of events similar to yours, with error code 0x800b0100) and the response that begins "Well you may have two problems").</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that rather than focusing on sfc /scannow, you post one or two new questions directed to your specific problems:&nbsp; Help and Support doesn't function and System Restore doesn't function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give as much detail about your system and the problem(s) as you can, including your version of Windows and service pack level, the name and version of your antivirus program, the names and versions of all other security software that you have installed,
 and whether or not you have run any registry cleaning programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get any error messages associated with either of these issues, be sure to include the complete text, without paraphrasing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can recall an event that preceded the problem starting, mention that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can tell you that security software, particularly some antivirus programs, are known to interfere with System Restore.&nbsp; Whether or not that is the cause of your specific problem remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Your help and advice is much appreciated.<br />
<br />
I wish I was knowledgeable / confident enough to wipe the disk clean and carry out a fresh installation, but I know I will get stuck particularly when it comes to drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have Windows XP Media Center installed as far as I am aware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"I can tell you that security software, particularly some antivirus programs, are known to interfere with System Restore." Yes, I have read that a particular antivirus I once had for a short time can interfere with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also read that other people have seen this long series of same error codes in Event Viewer too after carrying out the sfc /scannow command. I find it disappointing that a specific error code has been generated but I am not able to find out anywhere
 online / on the Microsoft site what causes it and how it can be resolved. <br />
<br />
I actually asked the seller about the term DVD before I bought it, he said it was an error - it is a CD.<br />
</p>
<div>
<div><br />
This is how I tried to determine if the CD was genuine or not (taken from the Microsoft site - all present), although I appreciate your comments with regards to this:<br />
<br />
Microsoft packaged software products such as Windows, Office, and Windows Server come on a holographic CD or DVD, which shows vibrant color and 3D effects as the disc is tilted. This hologram is embedded within the disc; it is

The COA is a sticker or a label that is attached to the retail packaging for products such as Windows, Office, or Windows Server. A COA should always accompany the product with which it is associated. COAs cannot be purchased separately. COA features the product
 name printed on the label and also contains anti-copy security features such as:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Interwoven security thread – is built into the paper and random paper fibers are visible when the thread appears at the surface</li><li>Color shifting ink edge - changes from green to magenta when viewed from different angles</li></ul>
</ul>
On the thin Inner Mirror Band (IMB) ring of mine, there is an area that shows “Microsoft” changing to the word “Genuine” as the disc is tilted from left to right.</div>

            <p>Ok......I bought that CD to carry out sfc /scannow though, so I would have peace of mind knowing the system was healthy (my main concern after the BSODs), so I am disappointed (although it will of course make reinstallation of Windows easier). Got a bee
 in my bonnet about it now. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find it odd that System File Checker didn't advise me it was unsuccessful and also that when I restarted the computer I received a 'please wait' notice half way through booting up, as if something was being done......the dll cache was being updated?<br />

</p><p>Hi!</p>
<p>I have upgraded my iball WQ149 from Windows 8.1 32 bit with Bing to Windows 10 using media creation tool (32 bit) available on Microsoft's website. The upgrade process completed smoothly and my 2in1 was upgraded to Windows 10 Home Single licence.</p>
<p>After one day of upgrade, my Realtek WiFi adapter (in-built) has started malfunctioning and it is giving error "the device failed to start. Code 10". I have got the tablet checked and on Windows 8.1, WiFi is working properly, but as soon as I am upgrading
 it back to Windows 10, it is not functioning.</p>
<p>If this is a driver issue, kindly provide upgraded drivers through Windows Update as Iball company is refusing to offer official drivers for Windows 10, even though this 2in1 was launched less than 1 year back.</p>

            <p>post upgrade to Windows i am having all kind of issues.</p>
<p>- Camera was not functional to start with, as no drivers are available from Iball so checked lenovo website for driver it worked.</p>
<p>- Audio was not working with in built speakers, again lenovo helped to provide reltek driver for this all seemed normal.</p>
<p>- the 3 day it started to get stuck/hung after every 10 min. Has to do a power down to get it back up.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Checked event viewer, it was flooded with different error, windows update service stopped to respond.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- 3G dongle (external) failed to respond.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- closed/disabled all of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>now i get 20 min instead of 10 min of before it gets hung.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i dont see any future of this device with windows 10. Tried reporting these eventviewer logs to microsoft no benefit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>even updated Windows 10 with latest update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suggestion no Windows 10 for Iball product till it comes&nbsp;</p>

<p>We don't support issues with password nor support password recovery.<br />

Have you&nbsp;used third party program to zip the file?</p>

<br />
1. I don't know what encryption was used. The disc had been sent to me with the note that it is a 256-bit encrypted and I have the password.<br />
<br />
2. In downloading Winzip, I get the "initializing" box whcih drags on for a while, then I get the error message that the "Connection failed".<br />
<br />
Guidance appreciated!<br />

            Thank you, once I went to charms and downloaded the "app" it worked perfectly! Going from XP to 8 requires this huge learning curve for me, I miss XP but now i know that I need to start on the search rather than a download through my browser!

<h2>            VPN Provider installed - now my internet connection times out</h2>
                    Hello
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I bought a new laptop 5 days ago with windows 8. I have since upgraded to 8.1 and everything worked fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I downloaded a VPN provider called tunnelbear. Since activating it, whenever I try to activate any website using chrome, Firefox or IE11 the connection times out.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have uninstalled tunnelbear but the issue remains.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am not the most laptop saavy and am also new to windows 8 so if anyone has a solution and guidance on how to do it, pls let me know as it is driving me insane not having the internet!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks a lot</div>
                </div>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System protection is enabled for my drive C, &amp; I have allowed it 11GB of space but no restore point is ever created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought system protection is supposed to automatically create restore points at certain times ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why doesn't it do this ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Thank you so for your posting in Microsoft community<br />

You did not dentine which os and version you are using<br />
<br />
The component which creates System Restore points on your computer is called System Protection. System Protection automatically creates Restore points before uninstalling, installing, restoring or updating things on to your computer. If you didn’t uninstall,
 install, restore or update anything on your computer, System Protection automatically makes a System Restore point every seven days if there were no other restore points that needed to be created<br />

            <p>I have a similar concern. I open System Restore and see a restore point from 5-4-2013, today is&nbsp; 5-7-2013. That is all fine, but why are there not more restore points to choose from? I see no box indicating click here to see more restore points, there is
 only ONE at any given time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not wish to manually create restore points, but I do wish to be able to go back a month or so if I choose to. Is there something wrong or is this by (poor) design?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running Windows 8 Pro. Thanks...</p>

<h3> burstingatom33  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I get DLCs with an Xbox Live ban&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So ages ago when i was about 8 i had an Xbox with Xbox live and one day my step dad walked into my room and swapped my Xbox with his which i found out had a lifetime xbox live ban... After years of boredom i got my favourite game tekken Tag 2 but my only problem was that the DLCs were free and one of my favourite characters were a DLC so i wanted to know if i can still get that DLC or not? Or if possible get unbanned or something... Cause i own a hard drive and dont know if i get a new xbox it will transfer that ban onto a new console or not...&nbsp;</p><p>(Please note in mind that im not an expert with consoles so i might have said or pointed something dumb out)</p>

    <title>MS Comfort Curve Keyboard 2000 all keys mapped incorrectly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MS Comfort Curve Keyboard 2000 all keys mapped incorrectly</h2>
                    I have a Comfort Curve Keyboard 2000 that I was using on my mac and all was well until one day all the keys were mapped incorrectly and I could no longer type anything. I tried rebooting to see if it was a minor issue but it remained. I have tried this
 keyboard on a machine running Windows 8 preview and a laptop and it continues so I assume something is faulty in the keyboard. It was only about 4 months old at the time but I don't have a receipt or the box.<br />
<br />
To clarify the issue itself, for example my "J" key produces an "L". Most of the keys don't produce anything at all. Many of the letter keys aren't mapped to other letter but to function keys (meaning some keys open new windows, one key is mapped to F7 apparently,
 etc, etc ,etc.)<br />
<br />
Is there a way to fix this?<br />

<p>Complete noob with .dmp files, however, had the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have NetLimiter (NL) installed, get rid of it, it was 'my' problem child, did all the other steps (8 different ones that I can remember) that you can find when doing a search, did all of those, nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Racked my brain about what I had changed and remembered that I had upgraded NL to 4 prior to this happening, upgrade worked fine, however, the WatchDog violation started next day on booting up system and following all the other suggestions did not enter
 my mind to disable/remove NL till day 2 of trying to solve this problem. &nbsp;Once I uninstalled NL and rebooted have not had a problem since. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence my deductive reasoning lays this WatchDog violation error at NL's feet. &nbsp;(you may have a different 'thing' creating your problem if you don't have NL installed)</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you have a USB drive hooked up and turned on, there will be a USB plug with a green checkmark ICON show on your taskbar by the clock and stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on it and select the device you want to eject.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a warning...Win 8 has something going on that I haven't been able to figure out yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of getting the usual "Safe To Remove Hardware" message, I have been getting "Unable To Disconnect-Device Is In Use" even though it's not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just been clicking OK basically, and then unplugging...I haven't lost any info yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may or may not have this problem, but I thought I should give a heads up.</p>

<h3> vendi1993  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I prevent the Xbox app from returning after sysprep&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I work as an IT technician for the county schools here and I'm trying to build a Windows 10 image to be deployed to machines in our County school system. Normally in the past this hasn't been an issue. But with Windows 10 version 1803 the xbox app will successfully
 remove itself when I run certain powershell commands, and then reappear after the machine sets back up after sysprep. We cannot have the xbox app available on our machines since students may abuse the app during school hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried multiple different solutions with no avail. The main powershell commands that I have used in the past are "Get-AppxPackage *xboxapp* | Remove-AppxPackage" and "Get-AppxPackage *xboxapp* | Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used that command with all the all the other xbox related packages that I could find as well. Nothing I try seems to stick after sysprep and it always reappears. Do I need to remove or disable the xbox app a different way? Group Policy? Any help on this
 would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>but the problem was that i dont have my product key of my orginal windows 8.1. so i searched for some keys on net and used that(i guess i pirated my windows) and on desktop it shows activate windows..<br />
<br />
soo i want my windows to activate. and idont know what to do.</p>
<p>help me here<br />
should i go back to windows8.1 and wait for the update to come from windows itself(as we can cancel this upgrade before 1 month is complete)</p>
<p>or should i get my original product key and use that instead(if so where can i get my product key</p>
<p>
</p><p>or is their any other solution for this?</p>

            You need to go back to W8, activate with your valid key, then upgrade (NOT clean install) to W10, without using any keys. If it asks for a key, press Skip.

    <title>Wallpaper Slideshow on Only One Monitor - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wallpaper Slideshow on Only One Monitor</h2>
                    Hello. As the title suggests, I want to have desktop wallpapers that are different on each monitor. More specifically, I want to have one single wallpaper for my main screen, but I want my secondary screen to cycle through a slideshow. Is there a way to
 set only one screen to have a slideshow?

            <p>I ended up using a program called rainmeter. Using that, I set a wallpaper on top of the normal one and left the slideshow running.</p>
<p>That way, it showed one side as a constant picture and the other shuffled.</p>
