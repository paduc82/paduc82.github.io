<h2>            XB One S - Error&#58; Video Could Not Be Decoded</h2>
                    
<p>I've been offline for a while now, and recently decided to get back into things, with the release of the XB One S. &nbsp;What CRAP! No Kinect connection? Wait for a XB Live Support person - "you are number 510". &nbsp;Games take FOREVER to reinstall - and what happened
 to the store?! I try to play a game, it tells me there's missing DLC, but there's no where for me to actually get the DLC, without exiting the game, going to the Game Hub, Going to the Store, then downloading the content?!</p>
<p>Worst of all, is the constant crashes and errors. &nbsp;The latest one forbids me from watching anything more than 5 seconds before stopping with the "Error: Video Could Not Be Decoded". &nbsp;I am permitted to watch one full length game trailer, but after that, I
 get the error. &nbsp;After attempting to watch 3 trailers, the Store crashes and reverts to the main screen. &nbsp;I guess it's what we've come to expect from MS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I gather the OP purchased a Slim then complains it hasn't got a Kinect port? If so then why do people buy blindly so to speak. Personally I research purchases, what it does/doesn't do before handing over my cash!</p>
<p>LastTimeLord</p>
<p>My suggestion, just have a little patience and phone Xbox Support again. It could be something quite easy to sort out and will save you a lot of headaches</p>
<p>Good luck </p>

<p>I am having same issues on mine Xbox one S 1 tb Madden 17 bundle. GameStop doesn't allow returns on game consoles, unable to watch game trailers and videos on the market store. Get decode error as well. Even did a restart and factory reset and still issues.
 Also I'll browse for games in the store then suddenly it kicks me to home screen. MS took my money and left me with a paperweight.</p>

<p>And just to moderate the detractors that want to chime in with irrelevant *** flaming...
</p>
<p>There was NO indication 2 months ago when I placed a pre-purchase that Kinect was going to require an adapter. But I don't care so much, since that wasn't the point of my post.</p>
<p>I don't want to return it, because it's 4k capable and there's not going to be another box from MS with 4k for the next 5 years. But again, not the point.</p>
<p>The point - is that this version of the console is based on a Windows 10 architecture, which appears to suffer the same issues and failures as it's desktop counterpart. &nbsp;And If MS cares to read our posts, since they won't answer support calls or online chats,
 then I'd rather spend 5 minutes trying to pack as many issues into a single post as I can rather than spamming the forums attempting to raise my post count.

<p>Every time I set up my hauppauge TV tuner it scans the channels then once I get to one guide it says TV tuner not found. &nbsp;Everything worked great untill yesterday. I bought a new TV tuner today and that didn't resolve the issue. I just bought a new xbox
 one and I continue to have the same problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My antenna works when plugged directly into my tv.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is anyone else having the same problem?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I upgraded my Windows 7 os to 8 last week and tonight I attempted to print a document to find that my printer&nbsp;wasn't&nbsp;listed in the print options. &nbsp;I removed the printer from the list of devices and then connected it back up. &nbsp;Windows 8 picked up the printer
 and went off looking for drivers. &nbsp;The printer installed but I still cant print! &nbsp;The printer shows up in the list of devices as 'An Inkjet Printer' in Win 7 it used to give the full name!?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I checked the Windows 8 site and it show up as this printer being&nbsp;compatible. &nbsp;Any assistance appreciated!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div>Will</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Will,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forum. From the description, I understand that the Canon printer is not working properly in Windows 8, please be assured that we will do our best to assist you with this issue.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b><span> Follow these steps to install the drivers in Compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Download the drivers for Windows 7 from the manufacturer‚Äôs website and save it on your local disk.</span></p>

<p><span>b. <b>Right click</b> on the setup file of and select ‚Äú<b>Properties</b>‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Select ‚Äú<b>Compatibility</b>‚Äù Tab.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Place a check mark next to ‚Äú<b>Run this program in Compatibility mode</b>‚Äù and select<b> Windows 7</b> from the drop down list.</span></p>

 know: if these are the same as the Windows 7 drivers or different; whether a working install requires use of compatibility or not.</p>

Hi Tom
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the reply. &nbsp;Actually they dont have the printer drivers listed there. &nbsp;They have a range of software:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li><span>Easy-PhotoPrint EX Ver. 4.1.0 (Windows 8/8 x64/7/7 x64/Vista/Vista64/XP)</span></li><li><span><span>My Printer Ver. 3.0.0 (Windows 8/8 x64/7/7 x64/Vista/Vista64/XP)</span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Windows Adobe RGB 1998 Installer Program</span></span></span></li></ol>
<div><span>But not the actual drivers for the ip3300. &nbsp;If you go to the page given above by Ravenath and select Windows 8 as the OS they say "</span><span>There is no driver
 for the OS Version you selected. The driver may be included in your OS or you may not need a driver.' :(</span></div>

            I had successfully installed the ip3300 immediately after upgrading to Windows 8 at the end of December. Today - mid January - it works only for one session.<br />
<br />
I install the ip3300 in compatibility mode for Windows 7, as I did before, and everything works. However, after rebooting, ALL printers are greyed out in Control Panel, Devices and Printers and if I try to print, Windows reports that I have no printers at all
 installed.<br />
<br />
Could a recent update to Windows 8 have caused this, or can you think of any other possible cause for the4 change in behaviour?<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 8 Pro 64 bit.<br />

            <span>Hi Liam Magee,<br />
<br />
1. Which operating system is installed on the computer?<br />
2. What is the exact error message that you get?<br />
3. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
4. Does the issue occur with any particular .wav file or all the .wav files?<br />
5. Do you have any third party codecs installed on the computer?<br />
6. What exactly do you mean when you say ‚Äù</span><span> I have tried to uninstall windows and reinstall media‚Äù?</span><span><br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the steps from the following links:<br />
<br />
</span><span>FIX: The encoder cannot use the Windows Media Audio 9 Voice codec after you install Windows Media Player 11 on a computer that uses Windows Media Encoder 9 Series<br />

<p>You will have to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro to get Bitlocker. &nbsp; I'm not sure how to upgrade without paying full price for Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I was able to get a free upgrade on one PC since I wanted to connect with my other Windows 10 Pro PC through my Homegroup.&nbsp; So if you have another Windows 10 Pro PC you can try connecting to it through the Homegroup.&nbsp; Then try using the Windows Remote
 Desktop connection app and you may get a notification that you can upgrade.&nbsp; But it may not work for you.</p>

            <p>It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time</p>

 to disabling &amp; replacing the culprit driver in Safe Mode. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you get sent into Safe Mode, this is how...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) R-Clk the START button, &amp; select Run.</p>
<p>(2) Type MSCONFIG, &amp; click OK.</p>
<p>(3) At the Boot tab, put a check in the Safe Mode box.</p>
<p>(4) Click OK, &amp; reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WARNING: When I did that on this Dell Inspiron 3542, I lost my Touchpad in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucky I had a USB mouse to plug in, &amp; it was instantly recognized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get out of Safe Mode, uncheck it in MSCONFIG.</p>
<p>(Good luck doing it w/o a Touchpad&nbsp;<em>or </em>a&nbsp;Mouse!)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Copy the minidump files to another location such as the Desktop and zip them from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, create a folder on the Desktop and call it <em>Minidumps</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then&nbsp;open the C:\Windows\Minidump folder&nbsp;and do the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Home &gt; Select all &gt; Home &gt;&nbsp;Copy to &gt; Choose location &gt; <em>Minidumps </em>&gt; Copy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then right-click the <em>Minidumps</em> folder &gt; Send to &gt; Compressed (zipped) folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then upload the newly created compressed (zipped) folder to&nbsp;a public folder on OneDrive&nbsp;or similar site and then provide a link.</p>

            Hi Margaret.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Exactly where are you seeing these characters because besides the System language that's installed, there are also Language choices in the MS Account online, in Web browsers and on some websites in their Settings?  
<br />
<br />Check the System Language is correct here:
<br /><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-properly-change-system-default-language-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-properly-cha...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/change-display-language-windows-10-english-another-language" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/change-display-...</a>
<br />
<br />For Edge see here:
<br /><a href="https://pchelp.ricmedia.com/change-browser-language-ms-edge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pchelp.ricmedia.com/change-browser-lang...</a>
<br />
<br />If you can narrow down where you're seeing the different language I can help you get to the settings controlling that feature, app, website, etc. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h3> pt andrew  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet connection issues</h2>
                    About a week ago&nbsp;windows stopped recognizing that my computer was connected to the internet through a Ethernet cable. I'm able to go to my normal websites through chrome without any issues. I'm able to load up steam and teamspeak and play and chat online
 without any hassle. It's when i try to use an app through windows or microsoft edge is when i run into problems. Every app and edge i am told that i'm not connected to the internet and the troubleshoots that I've tried have done nothing. My last update was
 on 12/16/2017 Windows 10 Version 1709 for 64-based Systems (KB4058043) and since windows doesn't think i'm connected to the internet i can't check for an updated. Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;

<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down
<br />Click Network adapters
<br />Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart to see if the problem is resolved.

<br />If not, press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network adapters
<br />
<br />Right click your adapter
<br />Click Uninstall
<br />
<br />Exit Device Manager, restart. Windows 10 should detect the network adapter then reinstall it. Check if you can connect and browse.

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and older hardware. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release significantly flawed. Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade loses functionality.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community forum.</p>

<h2>            You are connected to the Internet but can&#39;t contact XBOX LIVE&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Errors <br />
<br />
When I test my connection the XBOX goes through it's tests <br />
<br />
Network: Connected <br />
Internet: Connected <br />
LIVE: Testing... <br />
<br />
After a while the progress bar fill to about a third of the way, then I get a message telling me that a upgrade is available. If I select yes nothing happens the circle on screen just spins away with static Download progress bar after a while I get a error
 code saying that it's can't download update STATUS CODE: 3151-0000-0080-0300-8007-045D
<br />
<br />
If I select no and do not do the update it tells me that I am connected to the Internet but the XBOX cannot contact XBOX LIVE. I should reset the Modem and try again. This does not work. If I press the Y button I get the status perort below.
<br />
<br />
Status Report<br />
W: 0000 - 000B<br />
X: 0000 - F009<br />
Y: 20A8 - 4860<br />
Z: 8007 - 2746<br />
ID: 0006 - 0000<br />
<br />
I'm suspect that something is blocking the XBOX getting through to make a connection. I have tried port forwarding and all that but nothing works. My router Netgear DGN2200 sees the XBOX in UPnP on port 3074 why it is not connecting I don't know.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.<br />

<p>No offense and I appreciate the reply. But that has nothing to do with my problem at all. The error code you list must be some generic error the XBOX is throwing out for some reason if you compliy with the request to update. The XBOX does see the Hard Drive
 and can access it and all it's content.</p>
<p>The problem is the second part STATUS CODES listed. This error seems to be a trend if you look at the boards here something is going on and no one can seem to fix it very worrying.</p>
<p>I would like to renew my Gold Status I have MS points I would like to use. </p>

<p>Instead of downloading the update via live can you download the file and burn it to a CD/DVD or put it in a USB stick and do it that way?-

<p>Someone buy this man a beer!!!!!! Ok Shadow did the thumb drive update. And tested it. The XBOX went through the test and again the status bar progressed to about a 3rd of the way and I said to myself stuff it I give. As I looked up again it filled up a
 bit more and DISCO it looked like it connected. </p>
<p>Must have somthing to do with me not upgrading and the profile being deleted. I have NAT issue now but I'm sure I can sort that out on the router.</p>
<p>Thanks again appreciate it ;D</p>

<h2>            I have lost my internet Explorer icon on my desk top and program. How do I get it back.</h2>
                    &nbsp;It is not in my programs either.&nbsp; The only way I can get on the internet Is to click on a key i created on my keybord before I lost it.&nbsp; I even tried downloading Internet Explorer 8 hoping one would be put in my startup programs but NO. When I go to controle
 panel and right click and tell it to create shortcut, it does but the shortcut it gives me is to the properties. This happens to all of the places.&nbsp; I can get proberties and no where in properties is there a place to say create shortcut. The other way I get
 on the internet is to update my computer with microsoft. once I am on the internet I can go where I want.

            I had the same problem with receiving video calls on skype on my surface pro 4. I later realized, the "background app" was turned OFF. I had it OFF to preserve battery. I turned it ON for skype and I started receiving video call notifications.<br />
<br />
Try it out and see if it helps!

<h2>            USB 2 port not working in Windows 10 on Samsung Notebook</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a <a href="http://www.samsung.com/no/support/model/NP915S3G-K01SE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Samsung Notebook NP915S3G-K01SE</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer has 2 external usb ports. USB 3 on the left side, that is working fine. But the USB 2 port on the right side does not allow any devices to connect to it. I tested and noticed that the port is getting power (my phone can charge and lights are
 flashing on my usb stick when connected).</p>
<p>
</p><p>At some point when I was still running Windows 8.1 I got the message that the last device connected had malfunctioned. After that I can't connect anything to it. Now I have upgraded to Windows 10 and it is still not working. I tried reintalling windows and
 that did not work either. There are no drivers to be downloaded for usb on the samsung site either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have an idea what the problem might be and how to solve it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is a screenshot from Device Manager if you want to see what's there. I don't know what all these does tho. I know one of them is for the touch screen and one is for the card reader.</p>

            <p>Hi Tomale,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since all the USB ports are working and the problem is with the USB 3.0 port in the right side of the laptop, then this issue is with that particular port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can contact the manufacture of the laptop to get it done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, I suggest you to <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Run Hardware troubleshooter</span></span></strong><span>&nbsp;and check if it helps.</span></p>

Am downloading the trial as I type&nbsp; and am kinda hoping its pretty decent. However, no reviews up yet and the game description is vague to say the least.

<p>Anyone already got this? Any good?</p>

<p>I've been playing the Sega Rally games since the original arcade cabinet and loved the 2008 Sega Rally game. I was pretty excited when I saw the announcement for this Online Arcade edition but the fact that it's out already worries me. I haven't even read
 a single preview for it yet...</p>
<p>I'll be checking it out later tonight but I'm not expecting a lot.</p>

<p>I got it working by clicking on the Xbox icon in the microsoft solitaire collection app.&nbsp; Then after that launches a window I was able to go to its home screen and see my Microsoft Solitaire game information and there was a play button.&nbsp; When I clicked that
 it signed me in and let me play solitaire.</p>
<p>&nbsp; As a side note I was&nbsp; having the same issue logging into Microsoft Mahjong.&nbsp; I was able to log in and play that game as well using the same method as above.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 home freezing very often when i try to connect to wifi or installing or re installing wifi driver</h2>
                    <p>I have HP pavilion 15 p001tx, last year in the end of August I upgraded my windows 8.1 to windows 10. It was really great to use windows with all the outstanding features. But recently since a week my notebook is freezing very often. When it froze even Ctrl
 + Shift + Del doesn't work I has to long press the power button to force shut down. Believe me I used to long press the power button even 10 times a day.</p>
<p>The following steps are that I performed on my laptop</p>
<ol>
<li>I scanned whole my notebook from Command Prompt using <strong>sfc scannow &nbsp;</strong>which showed that there is nothing wrong.</li><li>I saw my disk running 100% most of the time so I followed one of the steps instructed in the community only which made by disk running go between 20%-60% mostly.</li><li>I updated all the drivers from HP website. I even use hp support assistant which notifys us about the new updates.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I observed that just before the freezing my wifi symbol goes away and shows device to be offed and when i try to on the wifi again if never gets on it automatically goes back to off. So I tried to disable and enable. When I try to enable it freezes again.
 I am really fed up with this. Please get me solution as fast as possible...</p>
<p>Thanks in anticipation...</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your response.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of uninstalling the HP services, I suggest you to update all the HP service (software‚Äôs) that you have disabled to higher version. Go to the manufacture website and check for latest software version, then update it and check whether the issue persist
 or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.</p>

    <title>How to install Windows 10 Home Single Language on a laptop that&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to install Windows 10 Home Single Language on a laptop that&#39;s running Windows 10 Home&#63;</h2>
                    I replaced my Dell laptop's HDD a few months back and I installed the recovery OS that Dell sent w/ the HDD. After booting into the desktop, a text saying that Windows isn't activated appeared. I ran the Windows activation troubleshooter and it says that
 it found a Windows 10 Home Single Language digital license for my laptop that is currently running Windows 10 Home, and that to activate using said license, I need to install Windows 10 Home Single Language. My question is, how does one exactly install Windows
 10 Home SL on a computer running regular Windows 10 Home? I'm aware of the Windows Media Creation tool, but I wanted to consult here first before doing anything that can affect my laptop. Thanks in advance.

            <p>Its not gonna show 'Single Language' on that portion of the screen, so everything should be ok.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download the Windows 10 Home Single Language ISO as an alternative, double click it to mount it then start setup.</p>
