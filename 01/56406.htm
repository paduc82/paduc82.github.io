<p>Sometimes it can be the xbox itself having a dvd tray failure. Try setting the xbox horizontal instead of vertical or vice versa.</p>

<p>I got this error today too. I pulled the disk out and saw several cracks in it and one that was just starting to spread into the data area which probably caused the error. I had the same problem with my MW2 disk but after over a year of use. It just seems
 too soon for a game I got two months ago and play for a few hours a week to break. The disks must be defective.

 how to clean it. must be a lot of people with this problem cause their are a ton of videos on how to remedy the problem.</p>

<h2>            SP4 touch disabled after closing cover</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My surface pro 4 touch screen stops working immediately after I close the type cover lid to put it to sleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have installed all the updates, disabled/enabled the relevant drivers and uninstalled/reinstalled the relevant drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still can't get it to work properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When this happens, the pen input is also disabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to be a problem with the cover as if I use the on-screen button or the power button to put it to sleep, touch returns after waking but not if the cover was closed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

<h3> abe_2000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t login in, windows is telling me that my password is wrong but it isn&#39;t&#33;</h2>
                    I'm trying to access my computer but the Windows is telling me each time that my password is wrong and I check it's working if I sing from the other places.<br />
I've tried to reset the password and again I can login to hotmail and other Microsoft services but can't access my desktop.
<br />
<br />
I tried to go to the recovery options where I need to supply my password and when I try with the old one it let me go to the next step, however I still can;t access my Windows.
<br />
<br />
That happened after the Windows update I did last time. (maybe it's coincidence but maybe it's related.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? <br />

            Thanks for the answer. <br />
<br />
No my Caps lock were not on, you can check the typed password when you click on the "eye" sign in the form box.
<br />
<br />
My system restore was not on (that that's what Windows is telling me) so it was not helpful although I've tried it before.
<br />
<br />
My remedy was to reinstall the Windows completely which I did and use&nbsp; local user account.
<br />
<br />
I simply don;t beleve anymore in linking my hotmail account to my machine to be used as a login.
<br />
<b><br />
I strongly advise all the others users, at least to <u>create one local account for backup</u> if the Microsoft account fails like it did in my case.</b><br />

<h2>            MTU Error</h2>
                    I got an Xbox 360 slim for xmas, and it has been working fine al this time. tonight I was playing online and it randomly kicked me off xbox live. I tried to reconnect and tested the connection and it said it was an MTU error. I followed what I had to do
 to fix the issue and it didn't work. checked my MTU settings and it was at the max it can be which was 1492. don't understand why I cant connect as my boyfriend has the old xbox 360 and he is able to connect to the internet just fine. I even tried to change
 internet cords to see if it was a cord issue, and it still said MTU Error. Please Help, this is driving me insane.

<p>I am currently having the same issue. If I do the "Test Xbox LIVE Connection" in Network settings, I get an "MTU Error". We have tried several network configurations but seeing the same results. We have wiresharked the xbox and saw the traffic. We noticed
 that it was making a DNS request to "xexds.part.xboxlive.com" which resolved to 131.107.228.132. We also tried this with a production xbox and it sent a request to "xexds.xboxlive.com" which resolved to 65.55.42.20. It then sends UDP packets to this IP address
 which are for the &nbsp;MS MTU Test that the xbox does. The first IP (131.107.228.132) doesn't have a reply and throws a MTU Error. The second IP ( 65.55.42.20 ) has a reply and seems to work properly, it connects to Xbox Live. I'm not sure why the development
 xbox is second UDP packets to a different address. Anyone here know how this could be fixed?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Start menu search function is slow when searching for files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emiliano carlevaro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Start menu search function is slow when searching for files</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I look up for a file using the Start Menu search function (I press WIN key and start typing a filename) it takes about 1-2 minutes until it founds the file. Also, I have to press [ENTER] in order to look for files, otherwise it only looks for apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless when I look up for the same file using the search box inside Windows Explorer (I open My documents folder and type a filename in the search box) it finds the file almost instantly. I have an SSD disk and the file is in the search index.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have this problem when I look for an app. </p>
<p>For instance, if I press WIN key and type "word", it instantly appears. But if I have a file named "word", I have to press [ENTER] and wait for abouts 1-2 minutes until it founds it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have rebuilt the search index twice without results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been suffering this problem since I updated to Windows 10 from Windows 7, about 2 months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that I want is to press WIN key, type a filename and that it appears and I can press [ENTER] to open that file. As it was working on Windows 7.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem arose after I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7. Since the first time I ran Win10 two months ago. I supposed it will have been fixed after some Windows updates but nothing have happened so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried upgraded some drivers (like video drivers) from Device Manager without results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the Search Troubleshooter without results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is quite strange for me that the Search function works perfectly inside Windows Explorer but the search function in the Start Menu does not work as it should (it takes too much time compared to the Windows Explorer search and does not show files results
 at first, I have to press enter to "Search my stuff" in order to find files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried with another user account (my current account is a Microsoft account).
</p>
<p>I tried with the local administrator account with exactly the same problem.</p>
<p>Then I have tried creating another user account (local admin account) without results. The same problem when I look for files inside Start Menu, and works perfectly when I look for the same file inside Windows Explorer. So, for me it doesn't seem to be a
 user account problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side note: I had Avast Antivirus in Win7 and it is not installed now after I upgraded to Win10, could be that be related to this problem?</p>

            <p>Hi Emiliano, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, do let us know what exactly is the file that you are trying to search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that the desktop search bar is used mainly to look for programs and apps and not files and documents/folders. This could be the reason why it is taking longer time to locate the file as &nbsp;Windows must inspect each file in the different
 folders in the file explorer during the search. . &nbsp;While searching for a file or folder, it is recommended to use the search box in file explorer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if the search bar is slow even while looking for programs or software, I would suggest you to try booting the computer in clean boot state and check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned
 below to perform a Clean Boot.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

 with the troubleshooting, perform the steps in "<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>" to reset computer as usual.</span><span><span>&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Emiliano,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We covered this topic recently on our blog since because we came across similar issues. If you add the Start Menu to your search index, then it should speed up search from the start menu too:<br />
<br />
Open the Control Panel &gt; Folder Options</p>
<p>Click the View tab at the top and then uncheck “Hide empty drives”.<br />
Click Apply</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to Control Panel &gt; Indexing Options</p>
<p>Under Included Locations, the Start Menu folder should now be on the list of indexed locations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps! You can find more detail here:&nbsp;<a href="https://lookeen.com/blog/what-to-do-when-windows-search-runs-too-slow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://lookeen.com/blog/what-to-do-when-windows-search-runs-too-slow</a></p>

<h2>            Help deleting Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to delete my Microsoft account (https://account.live.com/closeaccount.aspx), but when I'm getting ready to proceed, there is a big message at the top saying "Make sure *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is ready to close", and it has info on how to set up automatic
 replies, etc... &nbsp;The problem is... I do not want to remove my gmail account, I want to remove my Microsoft account. &nbsp;I only signed up to use syncing of OneNote, which I have since switched and I want to clean up after myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: If I proceed with deleting my Microsoft account, will I delete my actual gmail account or only an
<em>association</em> to the gmail account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realise this is really basic, but I was unable to string together a Google/Bing search phrase that lead me to an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance. &nbsp;:-)</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the reason of removing your Microsoft account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing or deleting a Microsoft account does not close the account associated with it. It only removes its association. So, your "Gmail" account will remain open.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you need the Weather app to work for you. The app may fail to work if there are issues with the app itself. It is best to uninstall the app then reinstall it to see if it resolves the issue by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In Cortana's search box, type <strong>PowerShell.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Windows PowerShell</strong><strong>.</strong></li><li>Enter the command <strong>Get-AppxPackage *bingweather* | Remove-AppxPackage</strong><strong>.</strong></li><li>Press <strong>Enter.</strong></li><li>Wait for the process to finish.</li><li>Once done, open the <strong>Windows Store </strong>App and download the <strong>
Weather </strong>app.</li></ol>
<p>Keep us updated with this concern and we'll be glad to assist you further.</p>

<h2>            Unable to log into Toshiba laptop, despite updating Microsoft password.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>i am trying to log in to our Toshiba laptop but have forgotten the password. When i select ‘I forgot my password’ it brings me to a Microsoft account log in. However, the email that is pre-entered is an obsolete email (no longer in use) from our old internet
 provider. When I enter our new email (a gmail account) it doesnt recognise this, as it’s not a Microsoft account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We even tried to utilise our daughter’s microsoft log in to reset the password, but this changes her log in, and doesnt carry through to the Toshiba account. I simply get an error message telling me to use the last password entered on the laptop (which i
 cant remember) or to go to account.live.com/password/reset, which also doesnt help (it’s the same issue with us not having a Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I resolve this issue?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>We can help you look into this. CMMR is a name or coding combination used by Microsoft to identify the processor installed on devices.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have further concerns.</p>

<p>That doesn't really answer anything. the question is "what does it MEAN", not what is it used for. your&nbsp;post doesn't answer the question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>additionally, you can find the same&nbsp;CMMR reference on many different surface tablets with different processor types, and even on surface tablet accessories, so your answer doesn't even make much sense.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There is no specific meaning for the <strong>CMMR</strong>. <strong>CMMR</strong> is a part number for processors that are distributed to different countries. It's not only
<strong>CMMR</strong> but the part number is actually <span><strong>Cmmr SC UK&amp;I Hdw</strong> which is for UK. Other examples are
<strong>Surface Pro 3 128GB CMMR SC EN/XD US Canada</strong> and <strong>Surface Pro 3 256GB CMMR SC Thai Thailand Hdwr</strong>. Hope this helps.</span></p>
<p>

<p>"a part number for processors" - no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>type covers also have that CMMR tag.</p>
<p>"Type Cover 3 Cmmr Demo SC English Hdwr Black "</p>
<p>
</p><p>docking stations do as well</p>
<p>"DckngStn-SrfPro3 CmmrDm a SC EN/XD/ES Hdwr"</p>
<p>
</p><p>the surface pen loop (a piece of fabric!)</p>
<p>"SRFC PEN LOOP CMMR A HDWR BRIGHT RED"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>the CMMR bit most likely stands for COMMERCIAL. </p>
<p>Why would they use a CMMR tag that means NOTHING? are you saying that they put meaningless tags onto product references just because it is fun? it has nothing to do with "processors". just admit you don't know what it is about.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 print blank pages, recurring problem on different computers with different printers.</h2>
                    <p>Would like to add first that if you PAY for Microsoft Word and install it in your computer the issue disappears, yes disappears.&nbsp;If you do not have Word then most if not all pages from notepads, email pages, websites with different browsers will only print
 blank pages. I am only able to print shipping labels and original PDF documents, if I create a PDF it will print blank pages, print to printer blank pages, print to PDF blank pages, trying to save the printing as a file results in blank pages when ordered
 to print. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This started as soon as my PCs got upgraded to Win10 with no solution in sight, looking for help online is useless as there are so many suggestions that looks to be an endless search for a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only way I can work around it and does not work all the time is opening Google Docs online and copy paste what I want there and print from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will not purchase Word ever again so if someone has a suggestion I would appreciate it.</p>

            If you want to run Windows XP, you might want to consider dual booting Windows 7 and Windows XP. You should first find out if your computer is compatible with Windows XP. A lot more modern computers are phasing out support for Windows XP. This option requires
 that you have your own Windows XP full version retail license. <br />
<br />
How to dual boot Windows 7 and Windows XP<br />
http://notebooks.com/2011/02/01/how-to-dual-boot-windows-7-and-windows-xp-part-1/<br />
<br />
Another option is to run your Windows XP license in a virtual machine on top of Windows 7. http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/virtualization/oraclevm/061976.html<br />
<br />
If you are running Windows 7 Home Premium, you can do an Anytime Upgrade to Windows 7 Professional, this will allow you download the free Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP Mode software which you can use to run older programs not compatible with Windows 7.
<br />
<br />
http://www.notebooks.com/2009/11/23/using-windows-virtual-pc-with-windows-xp-mode/<br />
<br />
Please note, the hardware assisted virtualization option is not required anymore, so you can run it without that feature being required.

    <title>Reimage Windows 7 to new SSD -- and restore Professional upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bob1170  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reimage Windows 7 to new SSD -- and restore Professional upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I want to move my Windows 7 64-bit from a 1 TB hard drive to a new 128 GB SSD. I would like to make a clean install to the SSD. I thought I could use backup, but apparently it wants to restore the entire drive, and there isn't enough room on the SSD. &nbsp;I
 have a set of recovery discs from HP, but here's the problem: a couple of years ago I upgraded the Home Premium to Professional. I did this online, and it worked fine, but for the life of me I can't find an email confirmation, or license key. Is there any
 way to generate a key from the existing installation, so I can upgrade the new image?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Computer Shuts Down immediately after turning it on&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a lot of trouble with my computer. I've got a lenovo thinkpad but I don't know the specs and whatnot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the trouble:</p>
<p>-would turn on but turn off again</p>
<p>-tries turning it on for a few times and it would still turn off</p>
<p>-I wait a few minutes before turning it back on</p>
<p>-same thing happens: it would turn off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-After attempting to turn it on after a few minutes, I decide to wait longer, about 40 minutes before trying again. I managed to log into my computer and use it for a few minutes before the screen fades again and the power goes off.</p>
<p>-I do not think this applies to overheating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-only once did windows tell me (after so many TRIES) that windows wouldn't load before turning off again</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My questions:</p>
<p>-Is it the motherboard or some hardware in serious trouble?</p>
<p>-Is it a virus?</p>
<p>-Should I simply get this checked at a local office depot or something?</p>
<p />

            <p><span><span>Hello,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To resolve this issue we need more information. Let us know the following:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>What is the previous windows version from which you upgraded to Windows 10?</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Are you able to boot to the desktop?</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To resolve the issue, let us try the following step:
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may create a bootable media using the Windows 10 ISO file and perform automatic repair via the bootable media.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Windows 10 ISO file completely from the following download link to your computer’s desktop:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once Windows 10 is downloaded you may refer to the following Microsoft Article which talks about creating bootable media like a DVD for installing/re-settings Windows 10. The following article shows how to download the tool which helps in creating
 the bootable media, and how to run the tool: </span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install</span></a></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You may now use the bootable media and perform an automatic repair follow the steps as detailed in the following Microsoft Answers thread:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-10-automatic-repair-on-loop/868d6b1c-ebf7-44d2-8c17-1886edaa6770"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-10-automatic-repair-on-loop/868d6b1c-ebf7-44d2-8c17-1886edaa6770</span></a></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 2: <br />
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Start Computer in Windows Safe Mode.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To restart your computer in Windows Safe Mode follow the steps from the following Microsoft Article:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01</span></a></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Check if the issue occurs in Safe Mode. If it does not occur in Safe Mode then restart the computer in Clean Boot mode and check.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>To restart in Clean Boot follow the steps as per the following Microsoft Article:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> The steps provided for Windows 8.1 in the above article applies for Windows 10 as well. After you have finished troubleshooting, follow steps under “</span><strong><span>How to reset the computer to start as

            Hi David, your Display Driver will need rolling back . . . Windows Update has lately been installing incorrect display drivers . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your graphics card, choose properties 
<br />On the Driver Tab, click 'Roll back Driver' 
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager and restart your system
<br />
<br />If the rollback option is greyed out:
<br />
<br />Right click on your display adapter, click 'Uninstall device' 
<br />Choose 'Delete the driver software for this device' then click 'Uninstall'
<br />Restart the computer (myst be a restart, not a shut down) 
<br />Windows will then download the correct driver       
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            From Microsoft:
<br />We are aware of a problem that resulted in an incorrect driver update for some AMD Radeon HD 2000, 3000, and 4000 series adapters. The driver update has been corrected. If you were impacted by the incorrect driver, follow these steps for all versions of Windows 10 to delete the 22.19.128.0 driver from the system and recover the recommended driver version (8.970.100.9001):
<br />Start Device Manager. To do this, press and hold (or right-click) the Start Menu icon, and then select Device Manager.
<br />Expand Display adapters, and right-click the adapter that has the problem driver installed, and then select Properties.
<br />Select the Driver tab and verify driver version is 22.19.128.0.
<br />Select Uninstall Device.
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” This step is important and will prevent the problematic driver from reinstalling in the future.
<br />The system may require a reboot at this point. Reboot if needed, then reopen Device Manager.
<br />Select any device, then click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />If the recommended driver (8.970.100.9001) is re-installed and this resolves your graphics problems, you can stop here. (Repeat steps 1-3 to verify that the correct driver version is installed). Otherwise follow the next step to check for the driver using Windows Update.
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />If the above do not work, try the solutions below:
<br />	Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />	Make sure recommended settings are selected for Scale and Layout and Screen resolution.
<br />
<br />
<br />Another thing you can try:
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try performing a system restore before this problem occurred. 
<br />
<br />I recommend you uninstall the KB4048955, KB4048954 (Windows 10 1703)
<br />
<br />Microsoft issued an update for several versions of WIndows 10: KB4048954, KB4048955 that has caused issues with display drivers. If you know the make and model of your computer, you can try manually reinstalling the driver from the manufacturers website for your video driver.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />(This is the update you want to uninstall KB4048955)
<br />KB4051963 and KB4055237.
<br />
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart then see if stability is restored. 
<br />
<br />The update might try to install again. So, try blocking it.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />If its the icons and toolbars, then Go back to Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />Click in the Scale and layout list box, try another scale such as 125 to see if that works or play around with custom scaling. 
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Perform a repair upgrade

<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.
<br />4. Download the legacy driver from here(You might have to do a bit of exercise to locate the driver:
<br /><a href="http://www.support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.
<br />Option 3: See if Windows itself has some history of the Older Driver:
<br />Solution by Ken-C here:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/windows-10-set-display-resolution-to-1920x1080/8ad4adc6-7cc1-494e-b296-e6c4dd8caefa?messageId=913d5c97-7dd7-4780-b735-1026da383882">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />Please note all the steps need temporarily disabling of Windows update or driver updates so that newer driver doesn't install automatically.

            Hello LCulp,<br />
<br />
Are you running the Microsoft Installer Cleanup Tool as an administrator?<br />
You may need to temporarily adjust your User Account Control settings to get it installed.<br />
<br />
<p><strong>Disable UAC on Windows Vista </strong></p>
<p>Open up Control Panel, and type in “UAC” into the search box. You’ll see a link for “Turn User Account Control (UAC) on or off”:<br />
On the next screen you should uncheck the box for “Use User Account Control (UAC)”, and then click on the OK button.<br />
You’ll need to reboot your computer before the changes take effect, but you should be all done with annoying prompts.<br />
<br />
See it that will help to get the Uninstaller cleanup utility installed and run.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</p>

    <title>Skins, and Customization of desktop icons Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skins, and Customization of desktop icons Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello Windows peers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have tried googling and binging, but I fall short. I hate the boring nature of the themes that I am offered. My computer needs to be like my phone. I was wondering where I can go to download skins and icons. I feel Microsoft doesn't give me enough
 options on customization and would really like to be able to have a program to change desktop icons and things of that nature. any assistance would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            Start Dock Desktop Object Suite has been probably the best third party skinning manager for years now. If you really want to change the way Windows 10 looks, this is probably the best place to start:
