<h2>            WINDOWS 10 MISSING DOES NOT SHOW ETHERNET CONNECTION</h2>
                    <p>I have an issue that I cannot resolve, after doing some searching, I found that my device manager does not any support driver for an Ethernet connection, I can connect via the wireless connection but the signal drops considerably.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I have tried looking at the legacy drivers and they do show three, but after installing each, I still can't get the PC to access the Internet via the Ethernet cable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have visited Broadcom, but they don;t make for me to figure out if I need their driver. which I suspect I do, but really am not sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a last resort, I tried to fix Windows 10 via settings, but that is asking me for a software that I do not have. Therefore, I cannot reset nor restore any previous software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>can anyone guide me or help me on this? Thanks.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand your concern, I would suggest you to plug in the Ethernet cable once again and also check by connecting it to the other device. Also go to the manufacturer website or with the help of
 ISP install the Ethernet driver.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helpful.</span></p>
<p><span>Regards. </span></p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply, it was one of the first thing I did. What I'm noting is that the Ethernet cable light in the rear of the PC is not flashing at all. It works find on my laptop. Moreover, I have done several Dell analysis check to see if it picks
 up any abnormalities, which it has but they were not related to the Internet in any way. I've since fixed them too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only difference I can physically see is that the Device Manager is showing a Broadcom Ethernet driver on my other laptop and PC that is not appearing on the machine. I tried downloading it from Broadcom but it tells me that specific driver is not available
 in the file.</p>

            <p>No, it hasn't worked. Went back to Dell, had it do its diagnostic, found nothing wrong the second time. I also downloaded Windows 10, and ran it keep my personal intact, (I don't want to waste time reinstalling other software, which I fell I shouldn't have
 to), that did not work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way for me to gain Internet access is via the Wireless card inside the PC. The Ethernet connector that's attached to the mother board did work at one time but became unstable after I added W10, and now it either not recognized and doesn't work at
 all.</p>

<h2>            Since the new Windows 10 update &#40;2016&#41;, my computer screen turns black after being idle</h2>
                    <p>Hi, So last night my computer updated the new Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems.&nbsp; It's working ok, but&nbsp;after my computer goes on a screen saver mode and I return to it, a black screen comes on with nothing except for the cursor.&nbsp; I can't do anything
 so I have to manually shut it down (today I've done this 3 times already).&nbsp; I'm frustrated and mad that this new update is affecting the performance in my computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Please help asap</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Marjorie</p>

            <p>That sounds like a display driver problem.&nbsp; That should certainly be the first thing you check before considering any other possibilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Device manager and rollback the driver.</p>
<p>right-click on the Start button,</p>
<p>select Control panel,</p>
<p>select View by - Small icons so you can see everything,</p>
<p>select Device manager</p>
<p>click on the &gt; next to&nbsp; Display adpaters</p>
<p>right-click on the entry for your display driver,</p>
<p>select Properties,</p>
<p>select the Driver tab,</p>
<p>I expect you will be able to click on the Roll back driver button because your problem sounds like the driver was updated as part of Windows update.&nbsp; If the Roll back driver button is greyed out it indicates that no driver update has taken place.</p>

            I just updated my Windows and the Desktop was black upon startup.. when I put an image as desktop background it stays for 5 sec and then fades to black again The fading looks as if it does it on purpose and not as an error.. Everything works but my desktop
 stays black..

            <p>Tryx3 -- BINGO!&nbsp; Great guess.&nbsp; In my case, it was 1607's incompatibility with my unique HP graphic driver.&nbsp; The Anniversary edition does not like HP Notebooks that have the dual Intel-AMD switchable graphics feature.&nbsp; There is NO cure for that issue...except
 to revert back to Build 1511.</p>

            <p>Carlos / Marjorie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still feel that, from your description, that this is a display driver problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the driver has no rollback then I suggest you reinstall the existing driver.&nbsp; Go to your computer maker's website and find the list of drivers for your model.&nbsp; Download and install the latest driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While you are there, have a look to see if the computer maker has a user forum.&nbsp; If so, have a search around there to see if anybody with your model, or a similar model, is reporting the same symptoms.</p>

<p><strong>First of all what was the program? Was it installed from the Store or from a CD/DVD? If you installed it from a CD/DVD there should be an Icon on you're desktop.</strong></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Most all of the "All Programs" folders you remember still exist in two locations...</p>
<p>You may need to "Show Hidden Files and Folders" to find them...</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>One for logged in User...</p>
<p>C:\Users\User Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Another for others...</p>
<p>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>The Win 7 type Start Menu sometimes combined files from both in it's All Programs list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here you can either make a shortcut, or possibly just copy and paste the ones in the folders to your Desktop...</p>

            Hi Duminda,
<div><br />
<div>Whilst looking at the Prolink website I found the drivers but, they do not support Windows 7.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can try installing the drivers from their website:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fida.com/download-dp.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.fida.com/download-dp.htm</a></div>

    <title>MBR SSD GPT&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daxon  say:</h3>
<h2>            MBR SSD GPT&#63;</h2>
                    I have installed Windows 7 on a 256gig SSD and plan on using a 2Tb hdd as a data disk.&nbsp; I have an UEFI mobo. When I installed it I didn't pay attention to the partition style, so it installed on my SSD with MBR partition. I would like to take advantage
 of full UEFI. My questions are: <br />
<br />
Is it worth it to reinstall Windows 7 with GPT now before I start filling my drives with data?<br />
Do I need to have GPT boot drive to take full advantage of UEFI?<br />
If my boot drive is MBR as it currently is, will I be able to make subsequent drives GPT?<br />
Will I be able to transfer my XP data to the new GPT drive?<br />
Does SSD work better with MBR?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance to anyone replying to any of these questions. <br />

            <p>Hello Daxon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installing to GPT disks requires EFI hardware. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
If your system support EFI firmware, Windows 7 will install and boot from an EFI disk.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There are not that many EFI systems available yet.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
On MBR hardware GPT disks can only be data disks. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to go through following Microsoft help articles.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 file explorer duplicates moved files but loses both copies - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 file explorer duplicates moved files but loses both copies on deleting the file from the source folder. Why would it do that&#63;</h2>
                    Hi - this is a show stopper of a bug in Windows 7 File Explorer - If you move files from one folder to another you end up with two copies - one in the source folder, one in the destination folder - OK so far? Fine, not what I expected for "moving" filesbut
 not a problem, or is it..... go to the source folder (remember you now appear to have two copies of the file) and delete the original copy, OK? Errr, not really - its been deleted from both the source and the destination folder....... Apart from providing
 a fix to this mind bogglingly system error, can any one explain how Microsoft could take a simple, elegant and functional file browser &nbsp;in Windows XP and make such an unmitigated hash of it in the 07 release?&nbsp;

            <p>Try to right click drag the files you want to move, it should ask if you want to copy or move, select the one you want to do.</p>
<p>Or state how you are attempting to move files because it sounds like your only coping from one location to another.</p>

            Thanks, really appreciate it &nbsp;- that appears to work - I was left-clicking &amp; dragging to move or copying &nbsp;then deleting duplicates - very relieved there is a simple answer. But I have to ask - what possible reason would there be to allow a means of creating
 duplicates that deletes everything when you delete the original version - surely that's asking for trouble???!!!

            <p>I'm not sure why it happens, but I've noticed that the only way to left click drag and not create copies is to drag the folder to your desktop then drag the files to the desktop folder,</p>
<p>Now in wlpg you can open a folder and left click drag files to different folder listing on the folders tree with it showing move to, not copy to as in windows explorer.</p>
<p>If you think about windows 7 library system it is nothing but shortcuts to one main file in your username location on the c-drive,</p>
<p>So dragging a shortcut to a different location causes this error, because you delete the shortcut you copied :)</p>
<p>If that makes any sense ?</p>
<p>But right click dragging prevents the additional shortcut production.</p>
<p>Also I only have pictures and my pictures listed on my folders tree, all others have been removed, so I only show located in one location and not three locations.</p>

<h2>            Destiny 2 Microsoft rewards offers</h2>
                    <p>When I was able to check my rewards&nbsp;points I saw a offer for destiny 2. Well I read the offer. &nbsp;It says if you buy destiny 2 and do 2 other things you get 6000 points. Not true, what it doesn't tell you(from the beginning)&nbsp;is you have to buy the launch addition which is total BS. Most people (like myself) preordered destiny 2 and it already on our account. </p><p>Either the offer needs to be&nbsp;removed or changed so people that have bought&nbsp;Destiny 2&nbsp;and complete all the other requirements should get the 6000 points.</p><p><br /></p><p>Oh the and the rewards site is messed up as well. I've tried several times to get to the site and either get HTTP 400 bad request error or page cannot be displayed. It doesn't matter which browser I use.</p><p><br /></p><p>MS you guys seriously need to fix you website. </p>

            let me know that these are Internet based Restriction or he restricted you PC by Group Policy?<br />
<br />
If these are internet based restriction then you can bypass it by using some third party software...<br />

            <p>The way that he does it is, when i'm conneted to the internet, he can see who's using it right. So then what he does is he looks at what mac adress is connected to it and he then goes to his internet provider (which it telus) and they have a internet restrictions
 and bans tab. He then simply types in my mac adress and then sets the times that i am allowed to have internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you also tell me what the 3rd party software would do?&nbsp;And would it work for my PS3?</p>

            Just download it and open it it will connect to the its own server and will create a VPN between your pc and its own server.<br />
It use just bypass local Proxies server.... or firewall ACL....<br />
<br />
Just try it and you will know how it is works........ <br />
<br />

    <title>Wrong sender name shown for incoming LinkedIn emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john artoux  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wrong sender name shown for incoming LinkedIn emails</h2>
                    <p>I use the Windows Mail application on my Windows 8.1 tablet. Around September give or take a month&nbsp;an annoyance started where all emails I receive from
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** became associated with the name of one of my contacts. Let's call him Jack Appleton. Everytime I get a LinkedIn email it says it is from "Jack Appleton via LinkedIn", no matter who really originated
 the email. I want to add that it did <strong>not </strong>work like this earlier in the year - emails from LinkedIn used to correctly show who really sent the message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use LinkedIn perhaps you have noticed that you also get emails from 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** . It's the generic email account they use for InMail and Network Invitations. I would like to know who really sent the message without reading the message or logging into LinkedIn.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started a new message and typed Jack's name into the&nbsp;To field and found two entries for "Jack Appleton via LinkedIn", one is "member" and the other is a long hexadecimal number that looks like a GUID - 9f3ff78dc-abcd-0123-...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at the People application and I confirmed I don't have "member" email address saved on anyone's contact info, let alone Jack's. I believe that rules out any contamination from my contacts list</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are:</p>
<p>How do I dissociate Jack's name with the email address in the Windows Mail application?
</p>
<p>Was there a software change, either in Windows Mail or LinkedIn, that triggered this issue?</p>
<p>Have you experienced this problem?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forum.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>As per the issue description, I understand that Windows mail app shows incorrect sender name for all the emails sent through linkedin. It shows the same sender name (One from your contacts) for all the emails received
 from linkedIn members.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Is this a Microsoft email account (live.com, hotmail.com, outlook.com, msn.com) or a local account (gmail.com, yahoo.com, Comcast.net) or a local account converted in to a Microsoft account?</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Have you checked accessing your emails on their webpage (for ex. Gmail.com)? Does that show correct sender names there?</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Has this issue started recently? Were there any significant software or hardware changes made to the computer just before this issue?</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>There can be a possibility of incorrect mail app settings causing mail app to download the emails from email client server but fails to display the sender name and hence pics up a random name from your contact to show
 as sender.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Let’s try these methods below and check if that helps.</span></span></p>

            <p>Thank you for the answer Mann.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answers to your questions.</p>
<p>1. I log into my device with a Microsoft account, and I have multiple email accounts configured in mail. I get my LinkedIn email at my Gmail account.</p>
<p>2. When I log into Gmail, the names are shown correctly for invitations from 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>3. The issue started in the second half of this year. Since there are updates each month, I am not sure which month it started. There have been no hardware or system software updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the App trouble shooter and it did not fix the issue. It did report trouble with the Store app and fixed those issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried removing the account and adding it back. But there was no improvement either.</p>

 all of my Windows tablets, and it started at some point in the second half of 2014.</p>

            A new problem has developed. One of the email accounts I had configured before deleting the application keeps disappearing from the accounts. I add the account back, but then within the hour the account just disappears without a warning.

</p><p>Did you run the App troubleshooter which I had asked you to run in my previous reply? If yes what was the result of that?</p>

            <p>Yes I have run the app troubleshooter and every time it complains the "the windows store caches and licenses may be corrupt." I fix the problem and then the Store app launches and that's it. I still have the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new problem is quite annoying. I basically cannot use that email address anymore.
</p>
<p>--&gt; What would make the Mail app automatically delete my email account?</p>

            <p>This remains a problem with the Windows Mail app. &nbsp;The app troubleshooter does nothing except tweak the windows store cache and licenses as JohnArtoux noted above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that if one replies to a message from a LinkedIn member whose return address is " member (at) linkedin.com " &nbsp;then the Mail app assigns that person's name to ALL of the messages with the same return address. &nbsp; &nbsp;Perhaps this was coded into the program
 as a convenience and in many cases would make sense. &nbsp;However, with the generic LinkedIn return address it becomes problematic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those individuals are not necessarily in contacts or the People app either; the issue is within Mail. &nbsp;It would be better if Mail kept the name as "Member" rather than applying an incorrect and unrelated name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>ALSO: &nbsp;This does NOT happen in Outlook.com (or gmail for that matter.) &nbsp;The LinkedIn emails retain the correct username. &nbsp;It is only a problem within the Windows Mail app.</p>

            V12 is a very stripped version of Skype earlier versions and offers very few customization options.
<br />
<br />Latest version is v8 which offers many more options. You should install this.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Good news is that Classic Skype is not going to be retired. Its last date in service was 1-Sep-18 and it has been decided not stop the services to Classic Skype for some more time. It would nag you for updating to latest version which is v8 which you can ignore.
<br />
<br />You can download Classic Skype and use that.

    <title>Wireless network driver randomly disappears and reappears - Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yorybab  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless network driver randomly disappears and reappears - Windows 10</h2>
                    I have an HP Envy 15 running Windows 10. Every once in awhile after waking my laptop from sleep mode my wireless driver disappears from the device manager. Despite restarting the laptop, running the troubleshooter, scanning for hardware changes, and making
 sure all drivers are up to date (which I have done when the driver appears in the device manager too), the driver does not reappear until some random time in the future. I seriously just wait a couple hours or a day and use my laptop with my Ethernet cable,
 and then all of a sudden the wireless driver reappears and works fine. Please help, this is getting very frustrating and inconvenient.

            The Network Adapter troubleshooter found no issues, so that did not solve the problem. I have tried this in the past and gotten the same result. The issue is not the WiFi router. I have had this problem across many many different WiFi networks.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>J' ai déjà acheté des contenus sur le marché et via les jeux eux même ( jeux xbla, objets d' avatars, DLC ) et je n' ai jamais eu de points stocké due à ces action !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello, normalement lors de ton premier achat tu aurais dû recevoir 100 points (compte gratuit et/ou gold) ensuite pour les actions courantes, les achats donne droits à un gain variable. Les enquêtes rapportent pour le mois de février 40 Pts. En ce qui concerne
 les 5% récupéré sur les achats pour le mois de février, je suis dans la même attente, mais soyons patient le mois de février commence tout juste...</p>
<p>Si jamais il te manque certain gains, je te conseil de créer un post en français ici, à condition qu'il soit orthographier correctement afin de faciliter la traduction.

<p>Bonjour Nico,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Au vu de la recrudescence des demandes et rapports concernant le programme de fidélité, il me semble judicieux qu'un bref rappel du fonctionnement soit inclus au sein même des forums Xbox.com, car malgré toute la bonne volonté des contributeurs des forums, bien peu d'utilisateurs font la démarche de consulter les informations sur la FAQ idoine du programme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A bientôt</p>

<p>Bonjour a tous,</p>
<p>Voila je reviens vers vous pour mon expérience personnelle vis a vis du programme de fidélité :</p>
<p>je suis plutot content qu'il y ai ce moyen de gagner des points gratuitement grace a ce programme j'ai pour l'instant eu droit a 1 mois gold offert et a 100 points offert grace au enquete !</p>
<p>C'est plutot cool jusqu'a maintenant il n'y avait rien ! merci Microsoft !</p>
<p>Le seul hic c'est qu'aucun de mes renouvellement gold ni aucun de mes achats sur le marché ne m'a rapporté quelquechose...</p>
<p>Je sais fort bien qu'il faut attendre jusqu'a 45 jours pour voir ses points mais pour un renouvellement gold de 3 mois et l'achat du DLC de BF3 a 1200 points vers le 17/12/2011 je pense que j'aurais du recevoir.</p>
<p>Pour ce qui est de mes achats et mes renouvellement gold 12 mois de janvier toujours rien non plus.</p>
<p>Je repasserais vous informé de la suite.</p>
<p>Bon jeux a tous a bientot</p>

    <title>Generic &#47; Test Only printer driver XP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikelaplace  say:</h3>
<h2>            Generic &#47; Test Only printer driver XP</h2>
                    <p>My system is XP SP3.</p>
<p>I have a proprietary&nbsp; application which prints data.</p>
<p>It formats the data based upon the settings of the printer.</p>
<p>It other words, if the printer is set for 80 columns the application word wraps at 80 columns.</p>
<p>This application can print up to 400 columns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wrote a different application which reads this data from a file.</p>
<p>This had been created by printing the data to a file.</p>
<br />
<p>Windows 98 allowed me to set up a generic printer which would print (to file) up to</p>
<p>5600 "units" wide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot find a way to get close to this with in XP.</p>
<p>I've tried tabloid, landscape, etc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've tried setting up custom sizes in the severer preferences but the generic printer setup</p>
<p>preferences won't allow me to select them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Larry</p>

            <p>This is an interesting problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>First, there is this KB article, that applies to NT 4.0 --&gt; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/184057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/184057</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I took a look at an old XP system, there were many forms listed in Server Properties that were not available in the settings for the Generic/Text Only printer driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a test, I created a new form in Server Properties and that new form <strong>
was</strong> listed in the Generic/Text Only printer driver.&nbsp; But even though my new form was supposedly 36 inches wide, the output file appeared to wrap at 80 columns.&nbsp; That's using Notepad, not your proprietary printing application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also see if editing one of the existing forms to make it wider gets you the result you need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work for you -- and I suspect that it won't -- try asking in the TechNet or MSDN forums, although because XP is so old, you might not find much relevant activity there anymore.&nbsp; I suggest using a more descriptive subject, such as "Can't Print
 Wide Forms in XP Generic/Text Only Printer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>TechNet has one forum for everything XP Pro sp3</p>
<p><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=itproxpsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=itproxpsp</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>MSDN is harder to figure out.&nbsp; You'll probably have to start in the "Where is the forum for ...?" forum --&gt;

<p>Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>I noticed that there is a maximum width, beyond which the new form will NOT appear in the preferences pull down. Mine was about 22in. Still not wide enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, some of the forms are not modifiable,</p>

                    my external HD doesn't want to be safely removed from&nbsp;computers! it only happened after i transferred some files into the external HD. when i remove all the files i still cannot safely remove it. however when i reformat it, it could safely remove, but
 when i added the files again it couldn't! again! it keeps saying "Windoes can't stop your 'Generic volume' device because a program is still using it. Close any programs or windows&nbsp;that might be using the device, and try again later". the thing is, NOTHING
 is running on it. even when i try to remove it IMMEDIATELY after i put it&nbsp;in my computer, it still won't eject!&nbsp;i scanned it with numerous scans (Malwarebytes [recommended by M.Murphy], eset online scanner, MRT&nbsp;and norton 360 [which came pre-installed on my
 computer, and my parents went to renew the subscription] and no&nbsp;viruses came out)&nbsp;and&nbsp;the symantec helper was dumbfounded, as (like i said) he couldn't find any virus or funny things.<br />
<br />
btw, other external HDs (containing different&nbsp;folders)&nbsp;can be safely removed from computers&nbsp;<br />
<br />
could there be something wrong with the files?<br />
a virus?<br />
what can it be?<br />
<br />
anyone out there that can help?

            1) no, i only have 1 external HD.<br />
<br />
2) when i put files into the external HD, but scans show that the files are clean. so i really don't know what's wrong<br />
<br />
it's not just my computer that it won't be safely removed from, it's all computers, so i'm not too sure that reinstalling the external HD on just one computer would help...

            try this:<br />
when you want to remove it, first make sure you have closed all programs then go to task manger by pressing ctrl+alt+del, in process tab, check that all programs you opened already closed if they are end process them specialy if there is windows media player
 prcessor in list, end process that one then try to remove it. (it definately works)

            1) the thing is, ALL programs are closed. like i said, "even when i try to remove it IMMEDIATELY after i put it&nbsp;in my computer, it still won't eject!"<br />
<br />
2)...i'm scared that i accidentally end the wrong processes. if i end the wrong process will it do damage to my computer? (it will, right D: )

            well , don't end process system processes and explorer and (csrss and dwm if you have). Try end process the ones in your username, if you could just say what you have there then i can tell you which one! normally when i get this problem i end process a
 program like windows media player through task manger and then i can remove safely. so try to recognise processes see which is a program that you have closed but still running!!!

            Another way: go to safe mode before u try again, connect you hard drive see if u can remove it there???? do some work for example copy some file into your hard drive then try to remove it! see if it works?<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
try preforming clean boot through msconfig (just type in search box in start menu press enter) then disable all startup items and none windows services then restart then try to connect ur hard drive try to remove it after doing some work.

            try scaning your computer using avast! and also for spyware! have you tried advanced system protector from systweak! or ad-aware from lavasoft.<br />
you can also use trend micro hijackthis for advanced malware removal!

<p>1) when i load my computer in safe mode, it takes a long time at the black loading screen (where it shows what stuff it's loading) cause it stops at one&nbsp;of the points (the thing that says crss, i think)..i don't know if i was just being impatient or what
 though...how long does it take to load in safe mode anyway??<br />
<br />
2) like i said, it's not just my computer it can't remove from D: it can't remove off my mum's computer too<br />
<br />
3) i can't use avast...i have a norton 360 on my computer and it might clash... (since they're both antiviruses)<br />
<br />
4) what's systweak? does it clash with anything?<br />
<br />
5) what's adaware? does it clash with anything?<br />
<br />
6) i've heard alot about hijackthis, but i still don't understand how it works...(wiki says that it doesn't remove or detect spyware, so what DOES it do??)</p>

            systweak is the company name for advanced system protector which is an antispyware program, it won't clash anything for me and i don't think will do! it just scans ur pc for spyware that is all it does and it removes them for u if u want to. there are
 also many other u can use like ad-aware from lavasoft and they won't clash anything, it might happen after cleaning but it is not because of these, it is because of spyware has damaged ur system.
<br />
<br />
Hijackthis is an advanced removal malware tool, it scans ur computer in depth for u so u can see what is running and what is happening is your pc. removing malware using this require research and you will need post your log files in some websites to analyse
 it for u like bleepingcomputers. Therefore if u don't know how to use, it won't matter, just stick to an antispyware program like i said above. they won't and I have not heard installing them will clash ur pc and it is necessary to have one because windows
 defender in windows does the same job but it won't detect most of them. I use personally Advanced suystem protector and i had no clashes.<br />
<br />
Try to scan ur harddrive&nbsp; and pc for spyware , malware and virus.<br />
<br />
http://www.systweak.com/AntiSpyware/download/<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
http://www.lavasoft.com/single/trialpay.php<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
http://www.malwarebytes.org/<br />
<br />
if u can not remove it from any computer is either spyware or malware is causing it or try updating ur harddrive driver software, go to their websites for updates and troubleshooting steps etc. there should be lots of help there too.<br />
