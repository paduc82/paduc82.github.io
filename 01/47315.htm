    <title>WiFi breaks after Windows 10 1809 update and SB2 firmware update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            WiFi breaks after Windows 10 1809 update and SB2 firmware update</h2>
                    <p>Yay, Microsoft managed to break something yet again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was running with zero issues related to WiFi prior (just a slew of other issues ha). Just installed 1809 and latest Surface Book 2 firmware updates/drivers. Noticed computer is lagging, primarily when browsing the internet. Ran a speed test. Turns out
 that I am getting a fraction of the speed I should be, standing right next to router. Running speed test on other devices shows full speeds. I am talking as low as 0.15 mbps with full signal. Switching to 5ghz I get 30mbps on a partial signal which is full
 speed of the connection at the location I am presently at. Switch back to 2.4ghz and I see slow speeds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting enough, and could have been coincidence, but when I opened task manager I saw delivery optimization was using a lot of bandwidth on the receive side. I am fully updated, have no updates pending, and have the Windows Update Delivery Optimization
 settings disabled so I do not know why Delivery Optimization is even running in the background?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any event, my SB2 is basically unusable for me because where I sit there is only 2.4ghz. The WiFi worked fine before these updates. I am also now getting a new BSOD. Thank you Microsoft for your excellent products!</p>

<p>
</p><p>What happens to the SB2 firmware update? My understanding is the package I loaded for build 17763 is not compatible with earlier builds and I am not sure that I can revert firmware?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I some how switch back to 1709 instead of 1803. 1709 was by far more stable. I never had a single BSOD. I got BSODs in 1803 and now 1809.</p>

</p><p>1703 and 1709 are available. Can I load a recovery image without losing data/settings/etc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still confused about what happens with the firmware as its updated to the 1809 build version. When I tried installing the 1809 firmware package on 1803, it refused to install because it said it was not compatible. To me that says I will probably have
 a whole host of new issues if my firmware are all on 1809 build level and I am running 1703, 1709, or 1803...?</p>

<p>I have been trying to figure this out all day...have run 100 speed tests...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting enough, when I turn bluetooth off, my speeds are fine 100% of the time. When I turn it back on, they slow, but some times they are just a tad below my top speed and some times very slow. Now of course that could be a complete coincidence. I had
 a hypothesis that when I moved my pen to the other room maybe it was trying to connect to it via bluetooth and due to the distance it was straining. That is the only other thing *I* changed other than updating to 1809 and the latest SB2 drivers (used to keep
 pen close/attached but moved it to a room down the hall the other day). I think its related to bluetooth/power management/interference but trying to narrow it down is proving difficult. Of course it might be external interference from a neighbor but very odd
 that when I turn bluetooth off, so far every time, I get top speeds...</p>

<p>The issue is no other devices running on 2.4 seem to have the issue. For example, when my SB2 2.4 wifi is lagging, my phone's 2.4 wifi right next to my SB2 is fine. That to me says its not a channel/general interference issue... timed with these issues starting
 immediately after I ran the 1809 and SB2 firmware updates makes things suspect. The only other change that I made was updating Symantec Endpoint Protection. I have had zero issues for months before with my SB2 wifi sitting in the same exact spot. I have Bluetooth
 disabled since last night and so far things seem to be fine but I do need ability to use Bluetooth...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some other settings I played with:</p>
<p>- WMM power setting on WiFi adapter</p>
<p>- RSC config/regedit (suggested from the other thread)</p>
<p>- ipv6 config/regedit (suggested from the other thread)</p>
<p>- Disabling ipv6</p>
<p>- Turning off Bluetooth Swift Pair</p>
<p>- Uninstalling and re-installing the WiFi adapter</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the above immediately solved the problem. So far only turning off Bluetooth seems to have but again that could be a coincidence.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would be happy to do some testing but generally Microsoft doesn't seem to take feedback, investigate, or fix things in a timely manner, so that is just a whole lot of time waste to end up in the same situation. Others have reported similar issues too so
 its not like I am alone. It is mind boggling how many bugs Microsoft introduces with each Windows build upgrade, windows update, and possibly even their device firmware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never said I was using Norton. I am using Symantec Endpoint Protection which is widely used and I've seen it work without issue in enterprises with 300,000+ endpoints. I highly doubt its SEP because I would expect there to be slow downs on ethernet or
 5ghz and network connectivity to be impacted in general. Its only limited to 2.4 wifi. And I don't think SEP has anything to do with bluetooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I question why Microsoft decided to use Marvell and not Intel hardware for the WiFi etc but I can't say its a hardware issue because like I said I have had no issues like this ever before on the same physical SB2.</p>

            <p>If the software refuses to uninstall, use Revouninstaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find Revo Uninstaller at <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.revouninstaller.com</a> &nbsp;(freeware). Here’s a quick look at how to use Revo uninstaller.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Launch Revo uninstaller after installing, select the program you want to uninstall or search for it using the built in search tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Click the Uninstall button on the toolbar</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will start the uninstallation wizard for the particular program you selected. Revo uninstaller will go through a series of steps which include creating a system restore point, creating a backup of your Windows registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then analyze the program and run its default uninstaller, click Yes when you see the above dialog. After the uninstall is completed, you have a choice of scanning modes to select from. What this will do is let you scan for any left over files, folders and
 registry items from that particular program. Safe looks in the usual places, moderate in more advanced locations while Advanced does a thorough search throughout the entire computer. After selecting your choice, (I went with Advanced), click Scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the scan is complete, you will see a list of registry entries left behind by the program, select them then click Finish to thoroughly remove the program from your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default uninstaller should work for most persons, but for those troublesome programs, the Force Uninstall feature and advanced scanning options will give you more control.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should also reset your web browser:</p>
<p>Press Windows key + S</p>
<p>Type: <strong>internet options</strong></p>
<p>Hit Enter</p>
<span>
<p>Select 'Advanced' tab</p>
<p>Under Reset Internet Explorer Settings, click 'Reset'</p>
<p>This should restore Internet Explorer to its default settings.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Professional Activation Key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davemillea  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Professional Activation Key</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate some help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an <strong>Acer Aspire V3 771</strong> laptop running <strong>x64</strong> which I bought installed with
<strong>Windows 8</strong> <strong>OEM</strong> about 2 years ago (now out of warranty).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had since upgraded to 8.1. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently had problems with the hard-drive and recovery partition so I downloaded
<strong>8.1 media installer ISO</strong>,&nbsp; and used <strong>Belerac Advisor</strong> to obtain my Windows key and from there I&nbsp;copied to DVD and did a reset install (maintaining all my existing&nbsp;documents).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some time ago I had been prompted to reserve an upgrade to windows 10 but had declined it because I wasn't yet sure about upgrading then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since tried to regain the windows 10 reserve upgrade option but with no success. So I was pleased to see on 29/07/2015 that I could&nbsp;&nbsp;download the
<strong>Windows 10 ISO</strong> from Microsoft's website which I did.&nbsp; I copied this ISO to DVD and did a complete reinstall. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is,&nbsp;now I have installed windows 10 Professional, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
it won't accept my windows activation key&nbsp;</span>- <strong>Error code: 0xC004C003.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this problem is because I couldn't get back the upgrade reservation option - which would have been fine with my existing product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help and advice greatly appreciated to get my OS activated. </p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

            Yes periwinkle_28. Thanks for your reply. As I stated however, I bought a genuine brand new Acer preinstalled with windows 8 OEM and&nbsp;should have a valid product key - In fact my product key was verified during a recent call to Microsoft. The&nbsp;operator said
 that she was unable to help me at the time because windows 10 was so new and&nbsp;so she&nbsp;advised me to just follow the posts regarding this error code issue.&nbsp;

            <p>I am having similar issues. I have a legitimate key for my refurbished HP desktop. The key worked fine</p>
<p>when I upgraded to Windows 10 initially. I decided to give the PC to my son so I did the reset, now it won't accept the original key it accepted before.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And NO, I will not buy a new product key. This is clearly a glitch in Microsoft's activation servers and I expect Microsoft to fix it.</p>

<h2>            How Do I Get Rid Of Pop Ups And Banner Ads</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just had a session with a Norton technician last night because of an error that my&nbsp;laptop tried to&nbsp;fix on it's own but couldn't.&nbsp;I gave him remote control of my machine after going in to safe mode to make an internet connection.&nbsp; He then&nbsp;cleaned up files&nbsp;that
 the free software on line&nbsp;for cleaning just did not get. He reinstalled Norton Internet Security Suite and all was well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I need to do now is reset my laptop to block banner ads and pop ups that Hosts doesn't get. Tell me how please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Anne Burns</p>

            <p>Hello Anne,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the trouble. Do you see the Pop ups and ads on all the browsers or is it specific to any browser? When you open your browser, do you see any new Toolbars added? You can also go to the Manage Add-Ons or Extensions window to see whether there are
 any new Toolbars added?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know the details so I can help you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Wireless laser 7000 keyboard buttons unresponsive and random errors.</h2>
                    I am having several problems with my microsoft laser keyboard 7000 I've tried installing and reinstalling the intellitype pro software several times but it just refuses to work, &nbsp;Firstly, when I first startup my computer it pops up saying that microsoft
 intellitype stopped working and it sits there for a few seconds and goes away, &nbsp;Secondly all the keys on the left, the Zoom Pictures and documents buttons, don't respond at all, all the upper keys work fine except the touch sensitive ones, they make the little
 sound as if it's working and all these features worked perfectly fine about before, there were no updates, or anything that I know of that would cause these issues, I've even attempted doing a system restore to a point where they all worked fine, and yet nothing
 has resolved this issue. I've even tried the Fixit software, incase this helps I'm running windows 7 ultimate, 64 bit, and have tried using both the 32 bit and 64 bit software, and neither solve this issue.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>also incase it's necessary I have 8GB of RAM and suffice to say I have plenty of computing power in my other hardware.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you for your time, even if this issue is unresolved I appreciate any help I can get.</div>

    <title>Old skype messages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zygisau  say:</h3>
<h2>            Old skype messages</h2>
                    Good day, few days ago me and my friends felt a little nostalgic about our old group and were really into looking to the very first group chat message (probably read or archive all of them). The problem was that the current version of Skype shows only
 latest messages and is not capable to go any further. Tried looking for different ways to get chat log file. Unfortunately, did not found anything that still supports new version (not denying the fact that I might missed it). The question is: Is there any
 way to look to very old messages? Is there still any possibility to get all group chat log? Thank you for your answer.

            Hi zygisau,
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing.
<br />
<br />Please try the following:-
<br />
<br />1. Win + R, then search for "%appdata%"
<br />2. If there is a folder with your Skype name, the information may be retrievable. Click this folder
<br />3. Click the file named "main.db"
<br />
<br />To open and read this file, you will need to use an SQLite browser:-

<br />
<br />If you however, cannot find a folder with your Skype name , it is likely that you have sinced uninstalled Skype or changed hard drives by some means since this conversation occured.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

<p>
</p><p>Once done, kindly follow the below steps:</p>
<p>1. Click the 3 dots.</p>
<p>2. Click Settings.</p>
<p>3. Click Chat</p>
<p>4. Then, click on Export chat history.</p>
<p>5. HTML file will be created where all of your old messages that is saved on your main.db from Skype 7x can be viewed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks and I look forward to your reply!</p>

<h3> jos&#233; oliver-didier  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Making your photos searchable...&#34; crashes Photo app&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have more than 200,000 photos on my Windows PC. The Photos App&nbsp;&nbsp;"Making your photos searchable..." feature seems to get stuck in processing all these photos. When I click the Search field, it seems to activate this feature. After about 5 minutes, the Photo
 app closes/terminates abruptly. No crash message is shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is there a way to disable the image recognition feature? To confirm if this is what is causing the crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Is there a way to allocate more resources (processing/memory) to the image recognition feature so that I can leave the machine running overnight so it can analyze/index my photo collection. I am curious to see how this feature works with my photo collection.</p>

<p>Hi José,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The image-sorting feature of the Photos app uses artificial intelligence to identify and catalog photos. It was made by design and currently, there's no available way to turn it off or disable it. However, we can try to resolve the crashing issue. First,
 let's try to run the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/69e76f90-d54c-44cf-9851-c2d1542790db/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows app troubleshooter</a> to scan your computer, identify the problems, and attempt to fix the issues automatically. The troubleshooter isn't designed to fix every problem but it is a useful tool to try first, as it can often save you time and effort.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out. </p>

<p>After a recent update was applied to the Windows Photo App, I noticed the it crashes less often. However, the "making collection searchable" process seems to get stuck after a while. Pausing it and Resuming it, sometimes works to make it "go" again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Months into using this app, it has yet to achieve analyzing more that 50% of the photos in my hard drive (about 108,000 remain). It would be nice to be able to allocate more processing power to the AI, so that If I leave my machine running, say at night,
 it can process these images faster.</p>

                    <p>Hello.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>The Xbox Store says Overwatch Game of the Year edition is €30 for Xbox live gold members (which I am), so I redeemed a €30 code so&nbsp;I could buy the game. However, when I tried to buy it, the store suddenly didn't recognize my gold subscription and nog charges me the full €60. The offer expires in about 1,5 hour and I don't want my €30 to be wasted.. I have been on customer support chat for over an hour but this 'Angelene M' fails to provide a solution, even lying to me saying that the only option is to buy the game using a credit card (this is untrue as a friend of mine literally used the same method as me, redeeming a €30 gift card). I feel like I'm really being screwed over here, because I already paid 30 euros and now I can't get the discounted game. What should I do?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skype transfer calls to phone line is not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>We are working on Skype as a US number with a telephone and we are located in CA. Before we could successfully transfer our Skype calls into our landline phone and we can pick up Skype calls from the phone. But now all the Skype calls are all been shown
 on Skype as 'Missing calls' and get hang up automatically. Is that anything wrong with our account? Or it is the landline company's problem? FYI we are using SHAW business line.</p>

<p>Hi, I don't think my account is blocked. My other MS apps work fine. It's just skype that has the issue. This is the screen I can't get past. I put the code in, select next and it just grays out for a second and sits there. No pop up warning either.&nbsp;</p>

            I understand. To solve this issue you will need to contact Skype support. I provided you the steps to contact them. I know your account isn't blocked that's why at the end of my first response I included this text "Not all choices lead to a chat session, but the choices above will, even if you don’t have a blocked account. "

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
They use 4 disks to install Windows?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Be sure to unplug all USB devices when installing Windows.<br />
<br />
The Hard Drive, controller (on the motherboard), or cable may have a problem and need to be<br />
replaced.<br />
<br />
See if these help - boot with a Windows disk (repair disk ok) and issue these from the Command<br />
Prompt and hit ENTER after each.<br />

<h2>            Windows DVD Player Problem</h2>
                    <p>Just installed Windows DVD PLayer today, 03-16-17. Will not play DVD. Paid 14.99 for the program. Very disappointed. Only thing it will do is come up, then goes right a way.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Richard, </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're having issues using the Windows DVD Player, can you tell us the error message if there's any? Have you also tried using the Windows app troubleshooter? If you haven't, you can check this

            <p>There is no error message.&nbsp; I tried the troubleshooter and it did not help.&nbsp; I purchased the dvd player on March 12, 2017 and it worked for a few days.&nbsp; On March 16, it stopped working and it just closes when I&nbsp; hit the play button.&nbsp; I also tried reinstalling
 it.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a Windows 10 upgrade to my machine on March 16 and then the dvd player no longer works.</p>
