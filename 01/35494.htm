<p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The issue could be due to some corruption in the programs or due to some third party software conflicting. This issue can also emerge due to infection on your system.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To help you suggest steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:
</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Were any significant changes made to the computer prior to this issue?
</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Are you facing issue with the webpages or with files and folders?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would suggest you to try following steps and check</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Method 1.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Step 1. Try to go into safe mode and check</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To go into safe mode refer the link given below
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</span></span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the problem does not exist in safe mode, try to perform a clean boot and check.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Step 2: Perform Clean Boot. </span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Refer: How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:<em> </em></span></strong><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting".</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If issue still persists try method 2</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2</span></span></strong><span><span>: <strong>Run Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
Run a full computer scan with the Microsoft Safety Scanner to make sure that the computer is virus free.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If issue still didn’t get resolved try method 3</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3: System File Checker. </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may run the system file checker tool and check if it helps. SFC scan will scan for the corrupted system files on the computer. You may refer to the following article in order to use System File Checker tool appropriately.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files.

    <title>Can&#39;t sync Outlook.com account in Mail app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aredhel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t sync Outlook.com account in Mail app</h2>
                    <p>To start with, I never had a problem with the original Mail app, it used to work flawlessly&nbsp;on both, my PC and my Surface RT.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Not any longer. I upgraded both to Windows 8.1/RT and now it won't sync my outlook account (my non-outlook.com accounts still work fine): &lt;name&gt;@outlook.com is not available. I removed the broken account and tried to re-add it, to no avail: You've already
 added this account (although it does no longer appear in the list in&nbsp;the lower left corner).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Next, I uninstalled the app and then re-added it from the store. No change. At all.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>That same outlook.com account works without problems in Outlook 2013 on both, the PC and the tablet. It's just Mail that's playing up.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm beginning to think that moving to outlook.com from GMail wasn't so clever a move after all. Granted, GMail no longer supports EAS, but at least I have access to my mail.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I ordered a Surface 2 a couple of days ago and fully expect Mail to be broken on that device as well, now that was a good investment.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>PS: People and Calendar app work without problems.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I found the solution to this problem. I have 3 different mail accounts, one of which is the Windows ID, but it's not Outlook.com account. In Windows 8 all 3 accounts worked fine, as I already stated above. When moving to Windows 8.1, these accounts are carried
 over. Same as when you reinstall the Mail app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that's not where it stops. In addition an account is created from your Windows ID and named after the server part from that e-mail. Say, your Windows ID is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, then Mail will create an account "Bar". If, at the same time, you have an actual
 "Bar" account then this automatically generated account will seem innocuous to you. Instead, you'll focus on the "Outlook" account which was carried over from Windows 8.0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After some tinkering you decide to remove it altogether and re-add it. You'll fail, because the account already exists - as "Bar", but you don't know that at that point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the fix is to look for an account with a name similar to your Windows ID, rename that to "Outlook" (or whatever you like), enable sync for e-mail and you're done.</p>

            <p><span>I have what may be a similar problem:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I created my Windows ID using an existing email address (not an outlook.com one). I then decided to use Outlook.com to aggregate emails from that service (because I've had to switch from POP
 to IMAP for the new&nbsp;Mail app, so emails are not deleted from the server, and that other service has a storage limit).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Next I deleted the 'old' account from Mail. When I want to add the 'new' account, which has the same email address that I use to log in, Mail says I've already added that account - but it
 doesn't collect email from it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, where do I search or the phantom account to get rid of? It isn't listed in the Windows 8.1 accounts, even if I switch to the 'old' Control Panel view.</span></p>

<p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>When I am day to day using the pc it is slower with pageloading slow/unresponsive &amp; pages needing reloading...when I am logging in it just me in as usual with no problems.</p>
<p>I do not believe it is specific to a particular application but all critical crashes have been when gaming.(Not forgetting above)</p>
<p>No error messages on screen just it hangs altho once it did say ...NVidia display driver stopped responding and has recovered.

            We do need the DMP file as it contains the only record of the sequence of events leading up to the crash, what drivers were loaded, and what was responsible.<br />
<br />
If you are overclocking STOP<br />
<br />
You may be able to get the DMP files without crashing by booting into safe mode (F8) with networking.<br />
<br />
Please follow these instructions to collect data from the crashes and upload them here, to your Skydrive or a file sharing service like Rapidshare.<br />

    <title>windows 10 update crashed my PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oldp  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 update crashed my PC</h2>
                    <p>My lap top was running windows 10 (OK-ish as I had a number of issues small and large which I solved eventually)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My copy was from the free upgrade from windows 7 as loaded by Microsoft over the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of days ago an error message popped up suggesting I restart the machine, which I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened next appeared to be a full installation of windows 10 (V 1511) taking over 1/2 hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This left me with the blue screen others have had above (NO I am not the only one)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent many unhappy hours trying all the options and trawling the internet for solutions (using my sturdy old XP machine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answers range from the trivial to the bizarre to the lunatic - in the final analysis none work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever I do, I cannot get past the Command entry screen. I do not have a windows 10 disk (as the upgrade was over the internet, like millions of other customers) and I didn't take a backup (like millions of other customers).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have managed to get back to the Safe Mode but that only leads me back to the command entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this was CLEARLY a microsoft induced problem (or there is mass hysteria going on over the internet with numerous similar complaints) PLEASE can you fix it. You created the problem simply enough, so please fix it simply enough. I'm quite happy that the
 fix cleans my machine as it is fully backed up. So, please, a simple way to clear my machine of whatever changes you have made and download a new version of windows 10, or 7, or whatever gets it to work.</p>

</p><p>Once you have the tool run it and make sure you select the correct version, Home/Pro, 32bit/64bit as this will affect activation should you decide to wipe your current system and clean install. Once you have created media you need to boot from it and see
 if you can use it to repair the install.</p>

            Running HP diagnostics did not help. I had to rebuild/reformat the computer, I did it from USB. Of course some of the very big files were not backed up and were lost consequently. Microsoft apparently pushed Cortana. I do not know what caused corruption
 of the bootloader. It is back now in the pristine state.

                    <p>I've spent the past two hours trying to set up my "wireless" Lexmark&nbsp;S605 so I can print from my Windows Vista 32 bit laptop. I've followed the directions in the setup process and&nbsp;used the installation cd, but was still unable to print from my laptop. I
 then downloaded the complete drivers and software (which was last updated Feb. 2013) from the manufacturer's website. The first error message I got was that one of the drivers could not be found/had failed to install. The second error message I received was:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Your operating system cannot support lexmark s600 series printer. Installation cannot continue."</p>

<h3> robdrapinski  say:</h3>
<h2>            can&#39;t save image as jpg, just png or bmp</h2>
                    <p>Before today, I used to be able to save images as jpg, png, or bmp.&nbsp; This was if I was using windows 10 browser, or windows 10 in private browser.&nbsp; Now, (just after a windows 10 update) I can only save as jpg if I use regular browser, and not in private
 browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cleared temp internet files/history.&nbsp; Restarted computer, and no change.&nbsp; I can only save an image as a jpg if I open and use a regular browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open and use the "in private" browser, and when I click "save image", it comes up showing as "untitled" , and my only save options are png or bmp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I change it back the way it was before today (11-17-17)?</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Changes after an update are one of the possible reasons why this issue is happening. The current changes are designed by default, reverting the changes will not guarantee that the jpeg option will return. We suggest either to use other browsers or send feedback
 to Microsoft regarding the issue. If you are using Microsoft Edge. follow the steps below to send a feedback.<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Edge</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>( . . . )</strong> on the upper-right side of the window.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Send feedback</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>Open Feedback Hub</strong>.<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>Let us know if you need anything else. We're here to help.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Try the following steps and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to check if your system specification meets the Windows 10 system specification.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Kindly refer to the following Microsoft article on
<strong>System Requirements</strong> and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to install the driver in compatibility mode and check if it helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.&nbsp;Right-click on the setup file of the driver and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;Select <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;Check <strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: Make sure that the Network adapter in Device Manager is updated.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists that check if that driver is compatible with your Windows. Refer to the following Microsoft Compatibility Center.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If you are facing the same issue then contact your manufacturer to install the latest drivers that supports Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Reference:</strong> Refer to the following Microsoft article on
<strong>Windows 10 help &amp; how-to</strong>.</span></span></p>

 issues with the drivers, can't be alone. The laptop is a loss, but I could and did replace the card and driver with a certified windows 10 driver. ??</p>

<h2>            Trying to install windows 10 Laptop from 2010, Samsung Q330</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I am trying to install windows 10 on my laptop from 2010, Samsung Q330. With windows 8.1</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I have tried everything i can think off really, USB boot, DVD, and windows update installation. The same thing happens every time.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Everything works fine until the computer restarts and the windows symbol is shown on the screen, and thats it. Nothing happens after that. It's like the computer goes to sleep but still not.&nbsp;<br />
The only thing i can think of is updating the bios but there is no bios update for this computer what so ever. I have also updated every driver that exist for this laptop i think.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
So yea.. either the computer is too old or i dont even know :(</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
So help is much appreciated</p>

 your advice doesn't help at all. System requirements are "passed", preview ISO as well, FAQ is a ****. I tried to update my Win7 Home Premium to Win10 Home with: USB, DVD and from HDD. Every time my laptop "freezes" with black screen and blue Window in the

            <p>I have similar issue with Samsung Q330. Three times I've tried Win10 and all goes swimmingly until system upgrades reboots, then it's a static screen displaying Win 10 moonlight logo. No mouse or buttons operational. Have left it overnight and only option
 is to force power off and reboot. It does so to Win7 with update error codes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ive read in forums that some have made a boot type change in the bios. That's a little beyond my comfort base. Hopefully Microsoft will fix this problem to enhance our windows upgrade experience.</p>

            Exactly the same problem here with Samsung Q330 - hangs on the Windows 10 logo screen (tried updating online and also using the ISO). I tried a BIOS update but that didn't help. I'm now unable to even boot back into Windows 7.

<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have just installed Max Payne 2 on my computor with Windows 7 and realised that it is one of my old games which isn't compatible with this operating system! &nbsp;I have surfed around, and it appears that there may be a solution to my challenge</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried changing the Compatible Mode to Wndows XP (Service Pack 2) with Administrator Rights, but the game will still not launch! &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone out there give me some advice, as Max Payne is awsome?</div>

            <p>Hi - It sounds like you are using the wrong technique... you draw/drag the arrow into position with the cursor - it doesn't 'paste' as such... then you can use the tool selections arrowed/circled to change colour-outline-fill etc... as shown below.- Ric.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the prompt detailed response. When I first noticed this issue, I thought I might be doing it wrong. I went on line and found a video detailing how to work with shapes. In the video he would select the shape and then put the cross hair pointer
 on the desired location and clicked his mouse to place it. I retried with no success. I tried dragging the arrow, also with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried rebooting with a clean start up and tried sfc, both with no success. I have not tried it in Safe Mode.</p>

            Thanks for updating&nbsp;- <strong>sfc</strong> would have been my next suggestion. Did you receive the 'no violations reported' result? If so it may be corruption in your user account - you can test this by opening a new user account from control panel (don't
 use the guest account) and testing if the 'Paint' program responds correctly there.

            When I ran sfc, it said something along the line "fixed some files but some couldn't be fixed". I checked the log but just gibberish to me. I tried a new account with no success. I tried my wife's lap top and it seams to work there.

            <p>In that case it is sometimes necessary to run sfc <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
several times</span> and also run the DISM health check as detailed <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">
HERE</a></p>
<p>Ultimately to fix this&nbsp;a clean install of Windows may be necessary - that would mean making sure all your personal files are safely copied elsewhere and then either reinstalling the factory settings (or using a system image disc if you have created one)...
 If most items you use regularly are working OK&nbsp; I'd avoid that on the sledgehammer/nut principal!</p>

            <p>Thanks for all your help. I'm an idiot. I don't work much with altering images much. I thought the arrow would be "pasted". Wrong. It has to be "dragged" to create the shape. Sorry I wasted your time. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Unable to install Windows 8.1 on UnBranded tablet, driver not available</h2>
                    <p>Original title : Need COMPLETE UnBranded UB-15MS10 Tablet drivers folder *READ PLS :)*</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello everyone! Long story short, I need the C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository&nbsp;</p>
<p>folder from an UnBranded UB15S10 Tablet. If anyone has one, please zip it and send it to me, thanks! The reason why is because I wanted to try 8.1 Pro on it but the install was kinda messy and none of screen drivers work right. In Device manager, I can point
 the missing drivers to this folder and hopefully they will install. DO NOT TELL ME TO GO TO THE UNBRANDED SUPPORT PAGE! All they do is say "go to GeekSquad" (As Best Buy owns both brands). Surprising they don't even have their own tablet, huh? Thanks!</p>

    <title>Windows Media Center freezes on Xbox 360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tweetanator  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Center freezes on Xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>Please help.</p>
<p>For a couple of days now, when I turn on WMC on my xbox 360, I go to recorded tv and when I try to select a show to wach, WMC freezes. I can not move. I can push the center button which will let me back out.</p>
<p>I log back in to WMC and I get the following error message: Connection Failure. The xbox 360 could not connect to the WMC PC. Turn your xbox 360 off then on again, then try to connect again. I do exactly that and WMC freezes again. I try to go to movies
 or another section of WMC. I can make a few moves, but it eventually freezes again.</p>
<p>On my pc in WMC, under extensions there is a image of my xbox 360, but there is a large yellow triangle with an exclamation point in the center. There is a message that says "Set up but not available"</p>
<p>WMC is working fine on the PC and I am able to watch my recorded shows, no problem.</p>
<p>I have not made any changes to my PC or my network. The pc is connected directly to my xbox, not through a router. I have tuned the network in the 360. All connections are working and fine.</p>
<p>I have removed and added the xbox 360 extender several times. I have reformatted the Xbox 360 hard drive. I am this close to reformatting my PC, but I would like to avoid that if I can.</p>
<p>Please help me to fix this problem and I will be eternally greatfull.</p>
<p>Thanks<br />
Tom in Vegas</p>

<p>I am trying to sort out my wife's Skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that she has 2 accounts (Work &amp; Personal) because we kept getting error messages when her original (Work) account got linked to a microsoft account, so then she set up a Skype account with a different (Personal) email address, but then we kept
 getting error messages with that as well. I suspect it is also linked to her microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We want to keep the original account as that has all her contact details; delete the new account and the MS account (she only uses Skype, nothing else), and THEN change the email associated with the old account to the new one (Move from Work to Personal).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried the diagnostics link above, it just took me to a password reset page, which I had already been to earlier.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for your suggestion but this is not helpful to me. I need to close an account that has been made with my information but I do not have the login credentials for it. Without having that information, it's basically impossible for me to follow these
 instructions. When I try and put in the Skype name for this fake account to close it, it says there is no microsoft account for that login. I really need this account gone as it is a fake and not mine even though it has my information.</p>

<p><span>Thank you for this information, Danielle.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Just to clarify, were you able to sign in to your real account or unable to sign in to both (real and fake account)?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Is your real account created using an email address or phone number? Do you still remember the password of your real account or just the username of your account?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please try again this account diagnostic tool:
<a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics</a> to identify the credentials of your fake account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Enter your email address or phone number and hit&nbsp;<strong><span>Continue</span></strong>. From there, you'll be able to see the Skype accounts related
 to the information you have provided.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>*For an account created using a phone number,&nbsp;type + country code plus 10 digit number.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Looking forward to your response.</span></p>
