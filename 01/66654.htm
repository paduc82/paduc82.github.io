<h2>            Microsoft Family issue with removing child</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have added my wife as child, and I'm not able to remove her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to remove a child I get the following message;</p>
<p>

You’ll need to remove consent first

</p><p>
Select <strong>Manage my child’s profile info</strong>, find your child, then select
<strong>Remove consent for this child’s account</strong>. Then, try removing this member again.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Your interface is really terrible, because I don't see&nbsp;<strong>Manage my child’s profile info&nbsp;</strong>anywhere.
</p>
<p>
Tell me where I can find this option and remove my wife from my family profile.</p>
<p />

<strong>Add a family member&nbsp;</strong>link.&nbsp; However, when I click on it, it takes me to a page that states "<span>This
 information is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later."&nbsp; It has been like this for several days.&nbsp; So now I too have a family member profile that was added by mistake as a child, but I can't remove it.</span>

            Having the same problems.... my profile has somehow been registerd in the US but my childrens accounts are in the UK. I can't remove consent as I get the same error as OP and I can't change my region manually to the UK because my kids accounts require
 consent!! Frustating as hell.

<p>I have the same problem. I realised my account was set up in error with a location of U.S. but my children's accounts are correctly set up as 'United Kingdom'. But when I try to change my location it says I must remove the consent for my children. In the
 help pages, it suggests you chose this option if you no longer want your children to have a Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to lose their active accounts. I just want to change my own location. Why is it so hard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke to someone at MS who said I should remove them from the family, change my location, then invite them back. But when I try to remove them, it tells me I must remove consent for them to have a Microsoft account, which I don't want to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone work out a method to sort this?</p>

<p>Same issue.&nbsp; For me, it presents a "Manage Permissions" page...which is obviously incorrect (a.k.a. incorrect URL).&nbsp; I have a child who aged beyond the point of needing consent, but the restrictions are still in play.&nbsp; I expected the MS&nbsp;system to be smart
 enough to know that consent was no longer required based on the DOB I provided when setting up the account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at the thread, this issue has been going on since at least April (4 months).&nbsp; From what I've been reading, the only resolution is to remove the account entirely, and start over.&nbsp; Which I am seriously thinking of doing...maybe gmail instead! Regardless,
 having an issue outstanding which affects the basic functionality of a feature (for &gt; 4 months) is an issue by itself.</p>
<p>Microsoft: please fix this so my 14 YO can start receiving email without restrictions!</p>

            I continue to have the problem whereby my child account doesn't appear on the "Manage Permissions" page.&nbsp; &nbsp; I think the URL is correct, but there is bug somewhere.&nbsp; &nbsp;I spent over an hour on the phone with Microsoft and they were unable to resolve the issue.&nbsp;
 &nbsp;They told me to raise a complaint on the tech support forum and continue to vote on it so it gets attention from one of their developers (crazy i know!).

            We face the same issue, you can't remove a child and when you finally go to the info screen it is blank.

            I'm also having this issue. Doesn't seem like Microsoft has any interest in fixing it, either. My daughter's laptop keeps telling her that I've blocked her from using Minecraft, even though I've turned literally all of the restrictions on her account off.
 I've found no way to fix it and Microsoft is of no help. This is why people hate you, Microsoft. It's obvious you just don't care.<br />

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will see from the thread I had the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To solve it, I had to have access to my boys account email address that was used when I first set them up. This is what I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reminder of my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Family set up:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Account 1: Me. Administrator and location set wrongly as U.S.</p>
<p>Account 2: My Wife. Adult Account set correctly as UK.</p>
<p>Account 3: First Son. Child Account set correctly as UK.</p>
<p>Account 4: Second Son. Child Account set correctly as UK.</p>
<p>Account 5: Generic account, used by all on some devices, correctly set as UK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: While logged in as account 1, follow the steps to remove access/permissions over family accounts for ALL linked accounts. It won't delete their accounts (it's badly worded). As long as you have the ability to sign in and access verification emails
 on each account, you be ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2: Log out, and log back in again. Check all permissions are now gone and the family group does not show (I had to do this twice before it showed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 3. Change the location of Account 1 to match the location of the other accounts. If it doesn't let you, it means all the permissions have not yet been removed. Go back over step 1 and 2. Update the profile and check Account 1 now shows as the desired
 home country.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 4: Re-invite the old members with the privileges / permissions you prefer. You will probably need to verify the invites individually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I did this, I'm back with family group and all the screen time, pay and permission services are all working correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that helps someone.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Reverting Back to Single Boot from Multi-boot</h2>
                    Currently I have <span style="font-weight: bold">Vista </span>and <span style="font-weight: bold">
Windows 7</span> installed on two separate hard drives.&nbsp; Vista was installed first on drive C:\ and Windows 7 was later automatically installed on drive F:\ in the dual boot mode.&nbsp; Eventually I would want to remove Vista and free up it's hard drive for other
 purposes.&nbsp; I believe the easiest way to do this is to reformat the hard drive with Vista on it, but I am concerned about what might happen if I do that.&nbsp; Will the master boot record (MBR) created with Vista be destroyed and render the system unbootable?&nbsp; And,
 without Vista, will Windows 7 then take on the drive designation of C:\, the former Vista drive?<br />

            <p>Its not the MBR thats the problem but the physical location of the BCD store (that hidden partition).&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the BCD store is located on the Vista drive, then when you disconnect the data cable from that drive (the Windows 7 drive should be the only drive connected) and then power up the computer, Windows 7 will fail to boot. However if by chance the BCD store
 is on the Windows 7 drive you should be able to boot to Windows.</p>
<p>If Vista was installed first and then you installed Windows 7 the BCD store is all but certain to be on the Vista drive and disconnecting that drive's data cable will result as previously mentiond, in Windows 7 failing to boot. This is when you should follow
 the "<strong>How to repair and reboot to Windows 7"</strong> instructions I posted. (With only the Windows 7 drive connected)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you are able to get Wndows 7 to boot the next thing you should do is disconnect the data cable from the Windows 7 drive and reconnect the cable to the Vista drive. Then use&nbsp;Partition Wizzard's "Bootable CD'&nbsp; (See the end of this post) to delete all
 the partitions on the Vista drive so the entire drive space is shown as "Unallocated".</p>
<p>Once you have removed the partition(s) you can safely connect the Windows 7 drive's data cable&nbsp;(both drives should now be connected).</p>
<p>After booting to Windows 7, open 'Disk Management' and partition / format what was the Vista drive.</p>

            <p>Hi Henoik, </p>
<p>
</p><div>Welcome to Microsoft Community and we are happy to help you on this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As per the query, you get an error message prompting “<strong>1607 unable to install Shield scripting runtime</strong>” when you try install a program on your computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This error message occurs due to the following reasons:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>•You run the Setup program from a virtual drive created through the subst command.<br />
•The driver IDriver.exe is not registered correctly.<br />
•The installer Msiexec.exe is not registered correctly.<br />
•The user account does not have permission to access the C:\Windows\Installer folder.
<br />
•An older version of the Windows Installer engine was installed from a network drive that is no longer available.<br />
•The user account does not have permission to install software on the computer.<br />
•Another instance of Msiexec.exe is running.<br />
•Another Windows Installer-based Setup program is running.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to rename the Install Script folder on the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can follow the methods accordingly:</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: Rename the InstallShield folder<br />
</strong></div>
<div>a) In File Explorer , open the following folder: </div>
<div><strong>DRIVE \Program Files\Common Files\<br />
</strong><br />
b) Right-click the Installshield folder, and then click Rename.<br />
c) Type InstallShield1, and then press ENTER.<br />
d) Try to install the game.<br />
<br />
If the problem continues to occur, go to Method 2.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: Locate and then close the files</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To resolve this problem, locate, and then close the Idriver.exe and Msiexec.exe files. To do this, follow these steps:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Open the Task Manager. Type task manager on the start screen and click on
<strong>Task Manager</strong>.</div>
<div><br />
b) On the<strong> Processes </strong>tab, locate <strong>idriver.exe </strong>and
<strong>msiexec.exe</strong>.<br />
<br />
c) Select each instance of both processes, and then click<strong> End Process</strong>.<br />
<br />
d) Click<strong> End Process </strong>on each Windows Task Manager window that opens.<br />
<br />
e) Close the Task Manager.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<div>I would suggest you to install the game in clean boot state and check if any other services or programs are leading to this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>same problem for me.</p>
<p>Game (Activision XMen 2) used to work perfectly on W8.1, but since switching to W10, it does not want to start anymore.</p>
<p>I tried to reinstall from the DVD, and I got Error 1607. And unfortunately, none of the above mentionned methods worked.</p>
<p>(for Method 2 : no idriver.exe nor msiexec.exe visible...).</p>
<p>For clarification, no "compatibility option" seems to work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have followed each of the above suggested solutions, but none of them have worked. I can no longer install apps since the upgrade to Windows 10. I never had the&nbsp;"1607:Unable to install InstallShield Scripting runtime" error when running Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please suggest further resolutions because as you can appreciate, it's very frustrating?</p>

            <p>I fixed this issue by deleting both of my Install Shield folders. &nbsp;Not too sure why it worked. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its a good work around, it also helped with my instal of Visual Studio 2015. &nbsp;It hung up during the installation and I had to hard restart, clear the folders again, and the instal completed normally the second time around. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that Windows 10 is not allowing you permission to write to these folders or write over files in said folders even with administrator permissions. &nbsp;You could aslomove the folder or rename it if you do not want to lose the instal shield information
 but there really is no reason to keep them. &nbsp;You can still uninstal and modify the installations without those files.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skype shows someone else&#39;s contacts and conversations</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just opened Skype for the first time in a while and all the contracts, my avatar, and conversations that appear are for some french person, who is not me. So as its is I have a slew of contact information for people I don't know and private conversations
 that weren't intended for me. None of my contacts or historic conversations are there. Its seems like my account UID and PWD signs into someone else's account. This appears to be a serious issue in terms of privacy and data integrity not to mention functionality.
 I need someone to contact me. I fear my contacts and information are being accessed by someone else as well. Also, I have no idea if Skype will work for me if someone attempts to contact me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft please respond to this!!</p>

            <p>My guess is you actually have the old launcher for minecraft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They updated it a while ago so it doesn't need java anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your computer, hit the windows key and the "R" key together, and it should pop up a message saying run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that, type "<strong>appwiz.cpl<em>"&nbsp;</em></strong>and hit
 enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scroll down the list of programs until you find Minecraft, and hit uninstall, then reinstall (instructions below)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is&nbsp;<strong>no</strong> minecraft on that list, then do these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On that minecraft icon on your desktop, right click it and hit "open file location", then delete the minecraft file that appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>TO REINSTALL </strong>Then click on this link</p>
<p>https://launcher.mojang.com/download/MinecraftInstaller.msi</p>
<p>and run it and install it.</p>
<p>

<p>and the build for minecraft is Minecraft: 1.8.8 with OptiFine_1.8.8_HD_U_F5 installed.</p>

</p><p>Now I don't know whether this is more Pro Tools related or windows... but anything Avid or PT related has been completely uninstalled or deleted off of my computer. Why does this keep happening still? It seems like at startup something is trying to find
 something in regards to Avid Client Cloud Services? All of that is deleted with the rest of Avid's crap. Any advice is really appreciated... this is pissing the sh*t out of me!</p>

<p>Hi OliverSounds,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had the same problem after uninstalling the AVID app manager and Protools.<br />
While investigating the problem, I have noticed that there is a file without a filedescriptor (like .txt) but named like my Windows log-on name in&nbsp;C:\Users. After deleting this file, the problem did not show up again.</p>
<p>Eventhough the file was containing AVID log messages, it could still be a Win10 mechanism, which tries to open such a&nbsp; file, because I have not found any AVID process running in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>(Edit: last paragraph deleted by myself, because it was pure guesswork and didn't help with the original problem)<br />
<br />
</em></p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Ronny</p>

            I had a REDIR file (whatever that is) in my users folder, it was called 'MY'. Deleted it, rebooted, works how it should now. Coincidentally, my spotify is automatically starting up now as well which it wasn't before because of this problem... idk how the
 hell it affected that. Thank you so much, this was annoying as hell!!

            <p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hi Master,<br />
<br />
1. What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
2. </span><span>Do you receive any error message or codes?<br />
3. Have you made any recent changes to the computer?<br />
</span><span>4. What is the make and model of the headset?<br />
</span><span><br />
Step 1: Ensure the headphone or microphone is fully and firmly inserted into the correct jack.<br />
Step 2: Plug in the headphone or microphone and see if the same shows up in Control Panel.<br />
Step 3: Check the volume property. Ensure that it’s not mute.<br />
Step 4: If possible, connect the headset to different computer and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: </strong>If the USB device is not getting detected in Windows 8, then I would suggest you to run the hardware troubleshooter to diagnose the exact issue.<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press “<strong>Windows + W key</strong>”.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type “<strong>Troubleshooter</strong>” in the Search box and hit <strong>
enter</strong>.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select “<strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>” from the Troubleshooter Window.<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select “<strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>” under Devices option.<br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the On Screen instructions.<br />
f. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restart the computer to take the changes effected. </span><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>I would suggest you to uninstall the USB controller from the device manager. Then download and install the latest “Chipset” driver from the manufacturer’s website and then check whether your
<span>&nbsp;</span>USB headset works.<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press “Windows key + W” from your keyboard.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then type “Device Manager” without quotes in the search box and hit enter.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand “Universal Serial Bus Controller”.<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on the each controller and select “Uninstall” option.<br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then restart the computer for changes to take effect.<br />
f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then download and install the latest driver from the “Motherboard” manufacturer’s website.</span><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<strong>Method 3: </strong>You can try setting the headphone as default and check if the issue persists.<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Right click</strong> on the <strong>volume icon</strong> in the system tray and then click "<strong>Recording devices</strong>".<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Right click</strong> on the blank space in the popped up window and then select "<strong>Show Disabled Devices</strong>" and "<strong>Show Disconnected Devices</strong>".<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on <strong>Headphone</strong> and then click "<strong>Enable</strong>".<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Highlight the microphone and then choose "<strong>Set as Default Device</strong>".<br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>Ok</strong>.</span><br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>This is what appears when my <strong>headset is turned off</strong>, but the <strong>
USB and Jack are plugged in</strong>. The only recent change I made was to update to windows 8.1 which I believe might be the problem. My headset is a
<strong>PDP Prismatic Wireless headset</strong>. When the headset is turned on however this is what appears.</p>

<p>The only thing I get when I try looking for a external mic is one isn't plugged in, but it is. No error messages I believe. As far as I know, PDP doesn't offer driver updates.</p>

            Hello SonVo,
<br />
<br />Yeah, that is strange. I would recommend that you report this to the Feedback Hub and see what kind of response you would get (Windows key + F).
<br />
<br />Until then, I recommend you gauge it bit-by-bit, meaning close applications like Chrome one at a time, then over to what you believe is a CPU intensive program.
<br />
<br />As an alternative, go into Resource Monitor (go to Start, search for "Resource Monitor", then click that).
<br />
<br />From there, let me know what kind of things appear. Hope this'll help you.

            Hi  SơnVõ 
<br />
<br />Those blank entries are showing the icon of svchost, but are not named as such, I think you might be infected with a crypto currency miner . . 
<br />
<br />You should run a scan with the free version of MalwareBytes to see if it can remove this infection, if that does exist . . . 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a> 
<br />
<br />After that scan completes, restart your PC you can then uninstall MalwareBytes
<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows 7 Twain_32.dll error in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angharadmcevoy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Twain_32.dll error in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I did put this one under "Windows 7 Pro Twain error" but no replies - so I am trying again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have&nbsp;this Twain_32.dll problem&nbsp;with an Epson network wireless scanner. With this scanner you apparently have no driver per se so&nbsp;you seem to be unable to&nbsp;delete the driver, you have&nbsp;to delete the program from the program list then re-load the scanner program
 from the supplier's disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everytime I do this and then try to scan I get "Twain_32.dll missing or corrupted".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The supplier insists it is a Windows problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per responses to&nbsp;other similar threads in this forum I renamed (rather than deleted) the Windows/Twain_32 folder and there was also a Windows/Twain_32.dll file&nbsp;&nbsp;which I also renamed.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Angharad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try the methods below and check. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Rebuilt the cache icon</p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp;In Windows Explorer, open the Windows folder.<br />
b. Delete all files beginning with "Twain" or "Twunk" (for example, Twain_32.dll).<br />
c. Delete all folders beginning with "Twain" (for example, Twain_32).</p>
<p>d. Restart Windows.</p>
<p>e. The icon cache has been rebuilt.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Try to run the installation in clean boot state&nbsp;and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

    <title>Reinstall Windows 10 to new hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jez0001  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstall Windows 10 to new hard drive</h2>
                    I recently bought a new hard drive because the previous one stopped working. I was able to backup all my files and create a system recovery usb before it went. I have now put in the new drive but have been unable to install Windows. There is no 'install'
 option, just reset, system restore etc. What do I need to do to get my laptop back up and running?&nbsp;

    <title>Why does windows media center open all my programs&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> norymarshall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does windows media center open all my programs&#63;</h2>
                    I was working on my computer when suddenly I was asked what I wanted to use to open a program. I selected "Windows Media Center" and suddenly most of my desktop icons changed to Media Center icons. Now, anytime I want to open up a program like a web browser
 or game, it redirects me to Windows Media Center. Is there any way to reset these programs so that this doesn't happen? I'm not very good with computers, so a dumbed-down method would really be useful.

<h2>            For Those Getting Watch Dogs</h2>
                    
<p>Anyone getting Watch Dogs I have a few questions for you. <br />
<br />
1. Are you going to be doing the missions right of the bat or will you do some free roaming first?<br />
<br />
2. Will you do single player first or jump right into MP (*This questions could be related to question one)<br />
<br />
3. Will you be using your powers for good or bad? <br />
<br />
<br />
My answers:<br />
<br />
1. I have a feeling like in most open-world games (EX: GTA) the first or first few missions will be required to start the game. After the "forced" missions, I'll be doing a bit of free roam, but of course I will complete the game.
<br />
<br />
2. I'll be doing single player first, but if anyone wants me to jump online with them, a simple message will do just fine and I will either complete or just stop any mission I am on.<br />
<br />
3. Let's say a little of both. I for sure want to do some personal information hacking, as well as stand of the street corner and make the traffic lights go all green or red. But I will be helping some people too.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">*Note: When it comes to MP I will not be one of those people that just go online to be a [bleep]. You know those players like in GTA that use glitches to hide inside buildings and kill people, or whatnot. I will not hack you just
 to hack you. We all know there will be those types of players.</span></p>

<p>In every game I play, I explore thoroughly and do every available side mission before even thinking about main missions</p>
<p>The single player campaign is always the priority. I might check out the MP if my friends are gearing up to play. But once we're done, back to the campaign it is.</p>
<p>I always try to make the decisions in games that I would in real life. Since I'm actually a pretty nice guy, I make good decisions whenever possible.</p>

<p>1. Single player and free form I've passed the blackout at the stadium seen his hide out and now doing some free form.
</p>
<p>2. I might try MP during the weekend.</p>
<p>3. BOTH. </p>
<p>I hardly play GTA V on 360 but compared to that game, I like this game more better graphics especially when it's raining at night. Will take some days getting use to everything. Current time 27 May 4:20 pm for me.

<p>Brought the ANZ edition of Watch Dogs (Australian and NZ special edition) of this game today from JB Hi Fi for only NZ$94 the game normally retails in my country for NZ$118 so good buy they were doing a sale of it on it's launch ^^.

<p>1. A little bit of everything. I'll start out doing missions and will do side missions when I come across them. Do a bit of free roaming. I just do it all. Whatever I feel like doing at the time, I don't really make myself do anything specific.</p>
<p>2. I'll start out on single player, but I will definitely be doing some infiltrating missions on occasion. They are a blast to do. It's so satisfying to pick out who is hacking you in the crowd.</p>
<p>3. I'm always a good guy, but I didn't think there was any sort of karma system in the game? Then again I have avoiding the single player.</p>

<p>I've finished the first act of the story but I've mainly been exploring, side missions/quests.</p>
<p>Single Player so far for me, I've been playing in "offline mode" from the start and it will stay that way until I've at least completed the main story.</p>
<p>Mainly good so far but the power of the dark side is quite strong with this one :)</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should assist you in removing it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The <strong>SweetPacks Toolbar</strong> and <strong>SweetIM Toolbar</strong> are adware programs that are commonly bundled with and installed by other free programs that you find on the Internet. Once installed, SweetPacks will install the SweetPacks or
 SweetIM Toolbar in your browser and change your home page and search defaults to use sweetim.com. Though SweetPacks is not a computer infection, a common complaint is that it is difficult to remove SweetPacks from your computer. Using this guide you will be
 able to easily and quickly remove all traces of the SweetPacks and SweetIM Toolbar from your computer and browser"</p>

<h2>            Start Menu and many taskbar icons not working after update last night 1 Aug</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 on 30 Jul and it was working fine until this morning where the start button and many of the taskbar icons are not working. There seemed to be a critical update last night as shown from my system Recovery. The problem did not directly
 happened after the update, only after my PC was rebooted that the buttons stopped working. Really frustrating and a few methods of recovering the start button shown online did not solve the problem.&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.windowscentral.com/windows-10-technical-preview/337063-windows-10-start-menu-broken-build-9926-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.windowscentral.com/windows-10-technical-preview/337063-windows-10-start-menu-broken-build-9926-a.html</a></p>

 also have done this upgrade - I haven't had the problem yet, but I found HP helpdesk very helpful.</p>

<h2>            Why would Microsoft download&#47;install over 20,000 updates at once&#63;</h2>
                    <p>There is at least one other post that indicates our mega download has happened to others, but I have my own questions to ask.</p>
<p>9-11-14 - Started my pc in morning and read on screen that "_ _ _ of <strong>21652 updates"</strong> were being installed. The "updating" process only took about 3-4 minutes. I noticed no problems during the following hours. Shut down after 6 hours and left
 off for a few hours. Booted up in evening. Web things seemed slow running, even going from one Opera browser tab to another slowed significantly.<br />
<br />
Ran AVG virus scan which found and removed "Downloader Generic," "a malicious application that allows hackers to remotely access you computer system letting them modify files, steal personal information and install more unwanted software."<br />
<br />
I seem to remember experiencing thousands of "updates" upon booting at least once before. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
My wife's computer (in the next room, on our local network) had the same (or similar) thousands of downloads when she booted up this morning. Subsequently, she has done two AVG scans - no threats found.<br />
<br />
Things appear normal today. My download/install record shows 11 on 9-11-14. See below.<br />
<br />
<strong>Questions</strong>:<br />
Is Microsoft really downloading more than 20,000 updates at one time?<br />
<br />
If Microsoft is doing this to me and my wife, I assume it isn't uncommon. But if this is true, why isn't there an uproar on the web?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it likely that the&nbsp;Download Generic trojan horse was part of the mega download?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Finally!!! Someone else this has actually&nbsp;happened to.&nbsp; Last October 2014&nbsp;I had the same event happen however I think my updates were more like&nbsp;24,156.&nbsp; Also Window 7.&nbsp; Windows gave no indication that updates were being&nbsp;downloaded or installed that day when
 I shut down.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;On the next boot, it opened with a stretched-out XP-looking background that said "Please wait while windows installs 24,156 updates"&nbsp;and instead of saying underneath "Configuring 1 of 24,156, 2 of 24,156" and so on, it was showing actual registry keys and
 files as they were being installed or changed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after ,we began&nbsp;experiencing&nbsp;remote connections and proxy servers and our router was engaged in activity even when the machines were&nbsp;powered off.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reformatted all machines and replaced the router&nbsp;and
 within a week, it happened all over again with the 24,156 updates along with someone connected remotely by a proxy server.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even resorted to <strong>replacing my hdd</strong>, and it happened again (March 2015).&nbsp; We ended up sending our machines to a local shop and he saw "no evidence of active virus" but&nbsp;reformatted and reinstalled windows. As soon as we brought them home
 and connected to the internet, you guessed it..... 24,156 updates!!!&nbsp; MSE, malwarebytes, rouge killer, FRST and avast have found no threats.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem came just&nbsp;after a neighbor was attempting to hack my Wi-Fi signal, and said as much.&nbsp; We have since disabled our Wi-Fi and connect with Ethernet.&nbsp; Happened again&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am almost&nbsp;convinced that some Wi-Fi&nbsp;signal hack&nbsp;program or app is being privately&nbsp;passed around that writes in the bios or boot sector/hardware partition that survives hdd replacement.&nbsp; Maybe that's why AV programs cant find it yet.&nbsp; It's&nbsp;already survived
 2 reformats and a new HDD - and if it's a virus...&nbsp;I still have it!&nbsp; </p>

            I also experienced more than 20,000 automatic updates for Windows 7 Friday night. A Norton scan&nbsp;showed no problems and a Windows Defender scan said Definition updates were found on the Microsoft Security Portal and then,&nbsp;No unwanted or harmful software
 detected. I posted a question for the community in the early hours of Saturday morning, but have had no responses. Just wondering&nbsp;if any of you learned more about the issue.

            I had this happen again recently. Unfortunately, I can't remember the details, but either at boot up or shut down I was instructed to wait until thousands of updates (think it was 14,000+) were initiated or verified or something. We recently experienced
 a similar action on another computer here (and maybe on our third machine). It is hard to keep track because we have become somewhat desensitized by the re-occurrences and the fact that on this forum smarter people than me seem to have no way to get to the
 bottom of this or know what preventative action might be taken.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And, as I continue to be amazed that more people aren't kvetching about these mega downloads, an alternative thought has filled an uncharted niche inside my skull... the possibility that we may be part of some exclusive group that (as in the movie Contact)
 have been chosen to receive a vast amount of data... downloaded to our computers, from somewhere in the Ardorfian Sector or beyond, that will enable us to build a huge wheel-like device to initiate a super-beneficial paradigm shift here on earth... **if**
 we can find a Beneficent Billionaire who will finance the project. Holey Moley! Second amazing thought: Could this be Donald Trump's hidden plan?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have heard that angels walk among us in the most unlikely disguises - this to test our mettle - but der Donald?!? Who woulda thought...

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The download speed is going to be based on the connection.&nbsp; If dial-up, it will take longer than dsl.&nbsp; You can wait or try downloading the .iso file and install it from media.</p>

            I have a decent speed internet ADSL2+ and its taking ages to download Windows10. At download speeds of 4mbps and after 4 hours it has only downloaded 30% of Windows 10 onto my flash drive. My PC is pretty powerful as well and nothing else was running at
 the time. Are these guys at Microsoft serious?!!! &nbsp;To create a WindowsImageBackup also took 11 hours. As if we have nothing else to do then muck around with our PCs.

<p>Hi Shivang,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several possible reasons as to why you can't connect to Xbox Live on your computer. Regarding your concern, can you tell us if you're getting&nbsp;the said error message when launching an Xbox game? If so, does it show in all Xbox games on your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also use your Xbox app to check if you're connected to Xbox Live. To do that, kindly sign in to your Xbox app, and then select the gear icon to access
<strong>Settings</strong> page. From there, go to the <strong>Network</strong> tab and wait for it to check your connection status. We would appreciate if you could provide us a screenshot showing your Network status result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your update.</p>
        </p>
