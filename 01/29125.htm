<h2>            locked out of my computer</h2>
                    I have just purchased a surface pro 2017 (version 5).&nbsp; I set up face recognition, which stopped working a day ago. &nbsp; instead it has a note: &nbsp; Your pin is required to sign in. &nbsp; when I swipe the page, it then says: &nbsp; Your pin is no longer available due
 to change to the security settings on&nbsp; this device.&nbsp; you can set up your pin again b y going to settings, etc.&nbsp; When I go to other options it refuses to accept my Microsoft password.&nbsp; I don't think that I can change pin without access to the computer which
 of course is now locked. &nbsp; I have changed my ms password on my wife's computer, but my computer does not accept it.&nbsp; what do I do?

<p>While I hate recommending a wipe and reimage, since this is a brand new Surface Pro 2017 (there is no Surface Pro "5"), you might want to start fresh:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</span>(with a different Windows computer if yours is not working properly)<span>&nbsp;
</span>and download a recovery image for your Surface. You will need a 16GB USB stick formatted FAT32. Unzip/extract the recovery zip to the formatted USB stick and then-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:</p>
<p>Step 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in (hold down the power button for 30 seconds).</p>
<p>Step 2: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.</p>
<p>Step 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the power button on your Surface.</p>
<p>Step 4: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.</p>
<p>Step 5:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.</p>
<p>Step 6: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.375in">
If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Step 7: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.</p>
<p>Step 8:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.</p>
<p>Step 9: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose Just remove my files.</p>
<p>Step 10:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select Reset.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.375in">
Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process continues (this can take a while).</p>

                    Why is Windows using stealth tactics and installing updates without permission or even notification?<br />
This is becoming a regular occurrence, it also seems to restart in the middle of the night to configure these updates. I'm not sure what the intent is but<br />
&nbsp;[Vista 32bit] I resent this intrusion into my PC's files and i will forever despise microsoft for deciding to act like a hacker.&nbsp; I will give microsoft some time to respond to this, but i fully expect them to be as horrible as they usually are with customer
 service. &nbsp; So in a few weeks, I will begin to smear microsoft's name as much as possible and sway anyone i possible can to buy non-microsoft products.

    <title>Windows 8 file History Not Backing up all files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> malcolm bott  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 file History Not Backing up all files</h2>
                    <p>I activated File History on a new W8 machine (Dell) about 3 weeks ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time,&nbsp; a fairly complete backup of my data files was completed, followed by a similar complete backup about 2 days later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However since that time, although File History says it has been updating successfully up to 2-3 times per day, VERY FEW backups have been made of files which have been amended regularly over the period, and several files created&nbsp; a week ago have still not
 yet been backed up. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems completely random what files get backed up and what do not, e.g.&nbsp; a number of files within the 'My Documents' folder are persistently missed, while some (but not all) files within sub-folders of that folder have been picked up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can confirm that all the folders concerned are within the default Libraries and so far as I know no changes have been made to any of the default MS 'sharing' or other file security settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trawling through this and other forums this&nbsp;problem seems to have been raised by others before, without adequate apparent &nbsp;response other than pointing to the various 'stock' MS articles about using File History (which I HAVE already read).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there possibly&nbsp;issues where there are large amounts of data with File History timing out in some way before completing a scan?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As thing are, this feature is unusable unless one can have confidence that everything is indeed being backed up.</p>

            <div>Thanks.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have only become aware in past few days that numbers of frequently updated files are not being backed up, so cannot recall or associate any particular event or system change that might have triggered this.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have run the ‘scannow’ utility as requested, which produced a rather large log file suggesting that some files could not be repaired; I have no way of knowing the significance or relevance of these to the issue in hand. Is there anything particularly
 I should look out for?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have since rebooted to apply any other corrections from 'scannow'. However there seems little change in what is or is not being selected for backup by File History.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As a 'last chance' for File History, I have now deleted all the backup files from the target network drive together with the configuration files on my PC, and re-targeted File History to create a backup from new. This is still running after some 10 hours,
 which I suppose is promising.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Needless to say I will also be using a proprietary backup utility to make real, reliable system image backups for the foreseeable future!</div>

            <p>An update on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The initial backup of all files completed apparently successfully, taking some 17 hours. Interestingly, it seemed to do this from the bottom up, i.e. in reverse of the natural sort order, starting with files at the bottom of the 'Videos' library and doing
 'Documents' towards the end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After some&nbsp;2-3 days of operation, the following has become apparent:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Files in the 'Videos' library/folders have all been backed up at least once, those at the bottom of the hierarchy tree twice, since the initial backup. NONE of these files have been amended in any way by me, all these backed up versions show&nbsp;identical
 'modified' dates to the originals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Some (but not all) files in the 'Pictures' library have been backed up once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. No files in the 'Music' or 'Documents' libraries have been backed up at all since the initial backup, including several where there have been modifications or new files created over the three days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be honest, I don't really buy the file corruption/virus suggestion, as I think this would become apparent in other ways.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There seems to something fundamentally awry in the way File History selects files for backup. Possibly there is some sort of time or capacity constraint, so it just doesn't get around to sampling more than the&nbsp;the first X files for changes? And why the duplications?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will probably allow this to run on for a few more days. To be honest I don't have the time (or the patience) further to pursue fixing a relatively peripheral feature of Windows 8, when there are other more&nbsp;reliable solutions available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However it is most concerning to think there are probably quite a few users out there who think they have a complete up to date backup of all their files, when in reality they&nbsp;may not.</p>

            <p>Another update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some files in the 'Videos' library (at the bottom of the hierarchy tree) have now been backed up 4 times since the initial backup. None of these have been accessed or amended in any way. These are quite large files, which in time will fill the target backup
 drive unnecessarily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No files in the 'Documents' library have so far been backed up at all, since the initial backup of all files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does ANYBODY have any idea what is going on here? Resounding silence from MS Support?!</p>

<p>There seems to be a somewhat&nbsp;long and (as yet)&nbsp;unresolved thread about&nbsp;a possibly related File History issue of excessive backups:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/14cedd95-b3b0-4830-be00-da793dda9e27/windows-8-file-history-excessive-backup-excessively-saving-copies-of-files-photos-videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/14cedd95-b3b0-4830-be00-da793dda9e27/windows-8-file-history-excessive-backup-excessively-saving-copies-of-files-photos-videos</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anecdotally, it seems that disabling Homegroups 'solved' that particular problem for some users, no explanation 'how' or 'why'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accordingly, I have disabled Homegroup (and indeed, all other) sharing for the 4&nbsp;user libraries; for good measure I also increased the maximum offline cache size to 20%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a reboot, File History performed another marathon 17 hour backup of everything; however since then (touch wood) File History now seems to be behaving as it says on the box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While File History is (for the moment) working for me, I do not consider the question properly resolved and closed, until there is a proper explanation of why these problems arise in the first place, what advice/guidance is being offered by MS to non-tech,
 confused users (like me), and whether or not this is being addressed in Windows 8.1.</p>

Thanks. </p>

<p>To be honest I don't think I'll bother. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On that forum is the very long (and so far unresolved) thread I referred to before. No real explanations or answers there, although I did pick up the hint about disabling Homegroup file sharing which seems (for the moment) to have resolved the problem for
 me.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Since it happens when playing games them major suspects are the video card and video drivers, the<br />
memory, and of course the games themselves. Be sure to check with the game's developers and<br />
their forums for known issues. And do the same with the System Maker's Support (Motherboard Maker<br />
for custom systems), the video card/device maker, and their forums.<br />
<br />

<p>Drivers could be at fault however disk issues or antivirus/antispyware/security products are<br />
just as likely to be the root cause as they can force a driver to corrupt or go out of bounds.<br />
The video driver or something affecting it would be very suspect.<br />
<br />
Be sure the drivers, BIOS, and low level chipset driver are all updated by manually checking<br />
at the System maker and device makers's sites. <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 0A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000000A</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>This bug check is issued if paged memory (or invalid memory) is accessed when the IRQL is too high.</p>
<p>The error that generates this bug check usually occurs after the installation of a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS.</p>
<p>If you encounter bug check 0xA while upgrading to a later version of Windows, this error might be caused by a device driver, a system service, a virus scanner, or a backup tool that is incompatible with the new version.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p>If a kernel debugger is available, obtain a stack trace.</p>
<p><strong>To resolve an error caused by a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Restart your computer. </li><li>Press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices.
</li><li>Select the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option from the Windows<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</li></ol>
<p><strong>To resolve an error caused by an incompatible device driver, system service, virus scanner, or backup tool</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for error messages that might identify the device or driver that caused the error.
</li><li>Try disabling memory caching of the BIOS. </li><li>Run the hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer, especially the memory scanner. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.
</li><li>Make sure the latest Service Pack is installed. </li><li>If your system has small computer system interface (SCSI) adapters, contact the adapter manufacturer to obtain updated Windows drivers. Try disabling sync negotiation in the SCSI BIOS, checking the cabling and the SCSI IDs of each device, and confirming
 proper termination. </li><li>For integrated device electronics (IDE) devices, define the onboard IDE port as Primary only. Also, check each IDE device for the proper master/subordinate/stand-alone setting. Try removing all IDE devices except for hard disks.</li></ol>
<p>If the message appears during an installation of Windows, make sure that the computer and all installed peripherals are listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.<br />
<br />
<strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>Before upgrading to a new version of Windows, remove all third-party device drivers and system services, and disable any virus scanners. Contact the software manufacturers to obtain updates of these third-party tools.<br />

<p>If there are&nbsp;RAID drivers they are very suspect&nbsp;and/or driver problems are very real prospects.&nbsp;<br />
Other major possibilities are Video and other drivers. See the driver section in my generic<br />
bluescreen troubleshooting methods below. BIOS, low level chipset drivers, memory and<br />
antivirus/antispyway/security programs can also cause this. Check the troubleshooter and when<br />
you get to the driver section refer to the generic methods in next message and then return to<br />
the troubleshooter&nbsp;if needed.<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: D1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000D1</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high.</p>
<p>This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.</p>
<p>If the first parameter has the same value as the fourth parameter, and the third parameter indicates an execute operation, this bug check was likely caused by a driver that was trying to execute code when the code itself was paged out. Possible causes for
 the page fault include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The function was marked as pageable and was running at an elevated IRQL (which includes obtaining a lock).
</li><li>The function call was made to a function in another driver, and that driver was unloaded.
</li><li>The function was called by using a function pointer that was an invalid pointer.</li></ul>

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />

BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />

    <title>At each boot windows 7 wants to &#40;re-&#41;check my disk &#58;-&#40; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mmo17  say:</h3>
<h2>            At each boot windows 7 wants to &#40;re-&#41;check my disk &#58;-&#40;</h2>
                    
<p>Since about a week I have the most annoying effect, that each time I boot Windows declares that it needs to check my disk for consistency. And if I don't react in time to cancel the check it goes off and runs chkdsk.&nbsp;A few times I let the scan run (which
 takes about an hour :-( ) and never were there any problems detected. But at next boot I invariably get that msg.<strong>again</strong>!</p>
<p>I usually boot my&nbsp;laptop twice per day (in the morning in the office and in the evening at home) and I also always shut it down properly. There never was any crash or message during shut down. So why does Windows then always conclude that it needs to (re-)check
 the disk?</p>
<p>Is there a way to find out, why this happens? Or what program or driver might cause that problem?</p>

<p>How do&nbsp;you fix it <br />
<br />
Well, that's easy. First click Start&gt; Search Box&gt; bring up a command prompt by typing in "CMD" and type " fsutil dirty query d: ". This queries the drive, and more than likely it will tell you that it is dirty. Next, type "CHKNTFS /X D:". The X tells Windows
 to NOT check that particular drive on the next reboot. At this time, manually reboot your computer, it should not do a Chkdsk and take you directly to Windows.<br />
<br />
Once Windows has fully loaded, bring up another CMD prompt and type and now you want to do a Chkdsk manually by typing "Chkdsk /f /r d:". This should take you through 5 stages of the scan and will unset that dirty bit. Finally, type "fsutil dirty query d:"
 and Windows will confirm that the dirty bit is not set on that drive. Good luck!</p>

                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I recently installed Windows 10 on my new intel m-2 ssd and I've noticed that my disk usage at task manager is almost always at 100% even when I'm not doing anything. On Resource monitor it says that
 its caused by C:\Windows\Temp\WPR_initiated_DiagTrackAotLogger_WPR System Collector.etl. I haven't even downloaded the Windows Performance Recorder and somehow It's still recording for me. I cannot even stop the recording in command line cause it says that:</span>

 remove the etl file from the folder but it just moves itself to $Recycle.Bin which from&nbsp;I cannot delete it (it says acces denied even if&nbsp;I try to delete it via cmd...)</p>

            I had the same issue, could fix it by running wpr -cancel in cmd as administrator, I think this has something to do with the latest windows update, never had this issue before.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I had the same Problem until 5 min. ago. Just solved it by applying the above advice. Disk utilisation went down from 100% to 0% within&nbsp;2 minutes after the change. However, I changed it back to its&nbsp;previous value just to doublecheck&nbsp;and left it for 10 min.&nbsp;No
 change! Disk Usage remained at 0%. - OK, don't know what's happening here, I changed&nbsp;the Setting to
<strong>Basic </strong>again, and it will leave it there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

                    Don't ask me why, but I have been a dyslexic mouse operator for many years.&nbsp; I was able to change the direction of my mouse on the Control Panel years ago, but now there's is no option to do so.&nbsp; I need the mouse to move upside down, in reverse.&nbsp; How do
 I personalize my mouse setting?&nbsp; Many thanks to any genius!<br />

    <title>Computer Becomes Unresponsive After Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markoce  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer Becomes Unresponsive After Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My computer is 2 years old. It met all the requirements for the Windows 10 update. After updating though, my computer starting running very slow. I tried running antivirus and anti spyware programs to no avail. I also deleted many apps that came with Windows
 10. I did the most updates I can, but it freezes sometimes. This freezing consists of me in any application, pausing to think about something, and no keys or touch pad work anymore. The fan speed of my computer drops to zero, and the hard drive light ceases
 to flicker like it usually does. This is odd because the screen still works. Luckily the power button still works. This happens about every hour of use now. Is this a hardware or a software issue? Does it have to do with a driver? Please help, Thanks</p>
<p>I upgraded to 10 three weeks ago.</p>

</p><p>The error code indicates that there is a missing or corrupted drive necessary for the installation of Creators Update. How are you attempting to download the update on your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's important that you ensure there are no errors regarding the Windows Update components for the update to push through. Here's a series of troubleshooting that should help correct this problem:</p>

            Hi Tom.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Where are these folders and file you lost from?  Are they in your User folders at C:\Users\Your User Name, or were they queued in Office apps that lost their link to them when they were repaired or reinstalled?   Check your User folders now  where these files reside - they never reside only in the Office apps, those are just links to them in their User folder like Documents. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            WD external drive letter change</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Change Drive Leteers</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently added a WD external drive and it has automatically taken the letter G which was already another external drive.</p>
<p>The original drive G became (G:)(H:)</p>
<p>I have tried to change the new drive to P and my original drive G to G.</p>
<p>I now have Drive (P:)(P:) and the original G Drive is (G:)(G:)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I simply make them Drives (P:) and (G:)?</p>

            Hi @WilliamSlessor!<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to hear about the confusion with the external drive. What I would suggest is to go in Disk Management and try to reassign the letters on both drives with a third one, and then go back to the original letters. For instance - change the G:G: drive to
 M:, and then reassign it as G: again.<br />
<br />
You can follow the steps described in this KB article:<br />
<br />

<br />
Hope this helps and let us know how it went.

    <title>Windows Live Mail Send Encrypted Email I get an Error&#58; Missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryan-r  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live Mail Send Encrypted Email I get an Error&#58; Missing Digital ids</h2>
                    I'm trying to send encrypted emails to a contact of mine. They have sent me a signed email with their cert. It's a self-signed cert. I've trusted it. I can see the cert listed under ID's when I look at the contacts edit screen in Windows Live Mail. However,
 when I try to send an encrypted email to that contact I get an error message:<br />
<br />
Windows was unable to locate the digital IDs of the following recipients: [contact email] digital ID is missing<br />
<br />
What am I missing?<br />
<br />
Thanks.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting back. I understand that you are having issues with the digital ID of your contact in Mail. To further isolate the issue, I would like to ask for the screenshot of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact details showing the Digital ID</li><li>Error message you are experiencing</li></ul>
<p>You can get the screenshot by following the steps provided <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Use-Snipping-Tool-to-capture-screen-shots" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, try to repair Mail to isolate if the issue was caused by corrupted Mail related files. Here's how:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Press <font><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows</span> +
<p>2. Select <font>
<p>3. Click <span style="font-weight: bold">
<font>Repair all Windows Essentials Programs</font></span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll wait for your response.</p>
<p><br />

<h2>            Skype for Business Voicemail</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently use Skype for business in a customer service team environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to set up a voicemail style greetings for when we're unable to answer a call due to high call volumes and another message for out of hours advising people of our opening hours, we need to switch off the ability to leave a voicemail message as the
 mail is stored in a cloud based server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or advice on how or if this can be set up would be greatly received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <span>Hi KayleighB65,<br />
<br />
According to your description, I understand that you want to set up voicemail greetings for some specific hours. You can refer to the article below to change the greetings and set up rules to determine what would happen when a caller reaches your voicemail
 in OWA (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>).<br />

<h2>            How to use Bitlocker to encrypt &#40;and automatically decrypt&#41; a single but partitioned hard-drive &#40;C and D partitions&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a 2010 Fujutsu Lifebook T900 that originally came with a single unpartitoned 500GB hard-drive (labelled C) and Windows 7 Pro.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shortly after purchase, using Windows 7 disk management, I partitoned the hard-drive into two equal partitions, C and D.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Only a few days ago, I upgraded to Windows 10 so I could encrypt the whole hard-drive (including its two partitions) using Bitlocker (Windows 7 Pro doesn't have Bitlocker).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like a similar result to how Bitlocker works on my Microsoft Surface Book - ie, automatic Bitlocker decryption with a password at Windows login.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Is that possible with a partitioned hard-drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on online tutorials I reviewed, it seems only 1 partition could be encrypted at 1 time, and the Bitlocker password for decryption is separate from the Windows login password? Is that correct?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In other words, would I have to enter a separate password everytime I want to access my C drive, and the same for my D drive if I also encrypt that one with Bitlocker.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>SO SUMMARY QUESTION:<br />
Is it possible with Windows 10 to use Bitlocker on both the C and D partitions, and have them both unencrypt automatically, upon windows sign-in?</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
<p />

<p>You encrypt the C: drive.</p>
<p>Then when you encrypt the D: drive you select the option that it is "auto-unlocked" at boot.</p>
<p>That way when you boot up, you will get an initial prompt for the BitLocker password and then you'll get your Windows logon.</p>
<p>The only way you'll accomplish getting it to unlock at Windows logon is if your system has a TPM chip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my system I don't have a TPM so I have to enter my BitLocker password and then my Windows password at boot.</p>

<h2>            Windows Defender and defragmentation stops working correctly on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Old title: Defender</p>
<p>Having problems when Defender scans computer. Used to scan around 877,000 files on Full scans. When set to run a Full scan now, it gets stuck in the 220,000's until it shuts the laptop down anywhere between 15 minutes to 2 hours after being stuck. The actual
 scan also takes longer then it used to. It can only complete a Quick scan now and for less files then before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also having trouble with a drive or partition called System Reserve. When the De-fragmenter is ran, System Reserved shows 100% fragmented and nothing I've tried seems to clean up or repair this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both problems began approximately at the same time. Tried running System Restore and Recovery multiple times but haven't had any luck. Anyone else have any of these problems or have any suggestions that will fix these areas? Any help would be appreciated!</p>

            <p>Hello Johnny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you make any changes to your computer? Like installing Windows Update or Software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess there might be some problem with the System files or User Profile causing this behavior. These steps will repair any missing or corrupted system files,, if they causing any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Use System File Checker to repair damaged Windows files</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the System File Checker tool to repair damaged Windows files. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows logo key + X</strong>, select <strong>Command Prompt(Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Run the "<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>" command by copy/pasting it into the Command prompt(Admin) and hit
<strong>Enter </strong>key.</li><li>Once it complete, try to check if the problem still persist.</li></ol>
<p>For more information about the System File Checker tool, see <strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</span></a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: Run the DISM tool</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem continues, use the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool to fix corrupted system&nbsp; files. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows logo key + X</strong>, select <strong>Command Prompt(Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Run the "DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth" command by copy/pasting it into the Command prompt(Admin) and hit
<strong>Enter </strong>key</li><li>Once it complete, try to check if the problem still persist.</li></ol>
<p><span><strong>Important:</strong> </span>When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions. However, if your Windows Update client is already broken, use a running Windows installation as the repair
 source, or use a Windows side-by-side folder from a network share or from a removable media, such as the Windows DVD, as the source of the files. To do this, run the following command instead:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:C:\RepairSource\Windows /LimitAccess</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note: </strong></span>Replace the C:\RepairSource\Windows placeholder with the location of your repair source. For more information about using the DISM tool to repair Windows, reference
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh824869.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Koen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10, your device is always kept up to date with the latest features and fixes. Windows Updates are installed automatically, with no need to select which updates are needed or not needed. In rare cases, a specific update might temporarily cause
 issues with your device. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To temporarily prevent the update from being reinstalled, a troubleshooter is available that provides a user interface for hiding and showing Windows Updates and drivers for Windows 10. You can download the "Show or hide updates" troubleshooter via this
<em><strong><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Download the">link</a></strong></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have any other questions.</p>
