<p>I lost my original Windows Xp cd. Where can I get a new or replaced cd from. I have a feeling it's time to format the hard drive and re-install. I've looked on the microsoft site and cannot find that you can buy it. Thank's to anyone for an answer!</p>

<p>Microsoft has stoped the sale of Windows XP both by Manufactures and the OEM versions found on most Internet sites. You might want to try Amazon and sites like it, but I warn you the cost has skyrocketed in the past two weeks.</p>

<h2>            Mouse needs to be replugged after sleep</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I used to run Windows 7 on this computer, but have Windows 8 installed now. The mouse that worked with Win 7 becomes unresponsive when the computer wakes from sleep. As a workaround, we unplug it from USB, and replug it in, each time we wake the computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried updating the mouse software, but it says the driver is up to date. What can I do?</div>
                </div>

<h2>            I have a bitlocker recovery key problem</h2>
                    <p>Dear Support team,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having a bitlocker problem as follows:</p>
<p>- I used bitlocker before to encrypt for my Windows 7, but after having a window problem I updated to window 10 and forgot to store the recovery key, I have lost the bitlocker recovery key and cannot re-open the drive. Is there any way
 to help me retrieve the data on the drive? It is very important to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can only remember each access password but now my drive is stuck with the recovery key that needs it to recover the drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much and wish you a good day</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>With best regards,<br />
Kenvin Hoang</span><br />

            I've never used BitLocker personally but have read on these forums that the key is sometimes stored on OneDrive. Other than that I can't help I'm afraid but if you don't have the key then the data is lost.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />As you've recovery password, and if you encrypted OS drive, you can use password to unlock the drive. Then you can turn off BitLocker for OS drive from Control Panel.
<br />
<br />Regards.

<p>Dear Kapil arya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for answering me, but I cannot use the password to access it because it is required to enter a 48-digit key, there is no other option I can use.<br />
</p>
<p>I brought it to a window 7 machine, I received a message "Error recovering disk ....: A key recovery was not found on this drive. The drive could not be unlocked".</p>
<p>I don't know how it really is, these data are quite important to me and I don't want to lose it.</p>

<p>If you don't have the key, the drive and data is NOT lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a similar problem as I had Bitlocker enabled and had the 48 keys in a usb drive but was lost when my car got stolen. A friend of mine referred me to this tech guy that has a website called cybernista.com so I got in touch with him. He wanted me to
 mailed him the hard drive since he's in another state and I had reservations about it because I had very valuable data, but my friend told me I would be mailing it to the tech's house.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mailed him my hard drive and within a few days he got in touch with me and had the discovery keys. He also send me pictures of the data from my hard drive. I send him his fee and he send me back the drive with the discovery keys. I asked him how he did
 it since bitlocker is hard to get into, he responded by saying, it was easy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you value your data and don't mind sending him your drive by mailed and paying a $250 fee, then it's worth it. It was for me.</p>

</p><p><span>When you&nbsp;</span>add an account<span>&nbsp;on your PC in Windows, it will be a standard user account by default. As an initial troubleshooting step, we need to make sure if the changes you made is applied. Here's how to

<p>
</p><p>Note: <span>You must be signed in as an<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>administrator</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>to be able do this option. You can use the same account you use to changed the account type of the other user account.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open the&nbsp;</span>Control Panel (icons view)<span>, and click/tap on the&nbsp;</span>User Accounts<span>&nbsp;icon.</span></li><li><span>Click/tap on the&nbsp;</span>Manage another account<span>&nbsp;link.</span></li><li><span>Look under the user name in each box with the user's<span>&nbsp;</span></span>account picture<span>.
</span><br />
</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>If you see<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Administrator</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>under the user name, then the account is an administrator.</li><li>If you don't see<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Administrator</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>under the user name, then the account is a standard user.</li></ul>

<p>Try going to account.live.com It should show your WLID at the top and have the option to change it right next to it. However, I'm not entirely sure it will automatically update on your phone as well. You may have to contact support for the Windows Phones
 to be sure.</p>

                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just about 15 minutes ago, I was watching a YouTube video and then all of a sudden my PC rebooted. I took a look in Event Viewer to see if I could find anything. I don't know if this is related to the reboot, but I figured I'd share it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found these error messages under Applications:</p>

The following information was included with the event: <br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information that you've provided, the sudden boot error that you experienced can be due to corrupted or missing system files. As an initial step to fix the affected file, we suggested that you run the
<em><strong>SFC </strong></em>command. This will perform a full scan on your device and will try to fix any corrupted files. To do this, follow the steps provided on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the event that the issue persists, our next option is to perform a repair upgrade. This process will re-install
<em><strong>Windows 10 </strong></em>over the existing installation of <em><strong>Windows 10</strong></em> on your device. By performing the repair, this can replace/repair any corrupted system files without losing any of your personal file and settings. To
 do this, you can follow the steps created by community MVP<strong> Andre Da Costa</strong> found on this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085?auth=1">Forum Article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll appreciate if you can send us an update.</p>

            Hi Jaxie.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What type of Recovery are you trying to do?  A Reset, Factory Recovery, Fresh Start or Clean Install using booted media you created?  
<br />
<br />The error can mean that the Boot configuration data is incorrect.  Is this the actual error text you're getting?  
<br />
<br />What I'd do is follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br /> .
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue your files using this method:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi  woodyodin
<br />
<br />Those are Windows Spotlight images, and yes they are beautiful
<br />
<br />A quick way to find the geographic location of one of those images is to take a quick pic of the image, then go to <a href="https://images.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://images.google.com/</a> and drop that image in the search box . . .
<br />
<br />A good source for those images, which is updates daily is this website:

<p>Hi Arthur,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the details that you have provided, we highly suggest that you get in touch with your graphics card manufacturer for better assistance. It seems that the freezing issue is due to its compatibility with the latest update that you have installed.
 It would be best that you reach out to them for clarification and availability of the compatible driver.</p>
<p>

    <title>Make 2nd internal drive the primary storage location - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sb510  say:</h3>
<h2>            Make 2nd internal drive the primary storage location</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I plan on using a PC for recording music only.</p>
<p>I have the OS on a small 250gb SSD. </p>
<p>I have a 2nd larger 1TB internal HDD that is more suitable for storage. </p>
<p>I want to put the music software on the SSD only,&nbsp;and use the bigger 2nd drive for storing files and stuff.</p>
<p>How can I make Windows choose the 2nd HD as a default storage location, instead of the main system drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure many do this all the time, but in my last install,&nbsp;all the default Windows locations: Music, Pictures, Document, Downloads etc, all ended up on the&nbsp;main system&nbsp;drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>
<p>Shawna</p>

<p>
</p><p>On the right side you can change the default storage location drive to the alternative drive for the main Libraries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to be more precise about exactly which directory structure to use then you need more than just change the drive letter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows key + R to open the Run box</p>
<p>
</p><p>enter %userprofile% and OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This opens a new Explorer Window with all the User Profile folders listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click each one and select Properties, if it has a Location Tab then it can be moved easily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Location Tab is the current path. Edit that path to set the new directory and select Move. The path must include the actual directory itself as the dialogue appears to move the named folder but it does not, instead it moves the CONTENTS of the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The %userprofile% view will show all folders that makes up the Users folder set irrespective of where they are on the disks in one single view. Using it after the move may show two folders of the same name, one in the old location and one in the new, the
 latter will have the Location tab in its properties.</p>

<h2>            Xbox one signing out automatically, cannot find network</h2>
                    My Xbox one has been down for two days. As soon as I turn it on, it automatically logs me out. When I attempt to sign back in, it logs me out again immediately. It also cannot find my wireless network. It isn't the router cuz every other device is connected.
 I've tried hard resetting the Xbox but the problem persists.

            Well the first step of that guide is to run a speed test which I can't do cuz the Xbox also can't find my wireless network. I've tried restarting the router as well to no avail. I don't think it's the&nbsp; network because the other console in the house gets
 online just fine and the smartphones connect without a hitch. I don't what happened, it was ok two days ago and now it can't find the network and signs me out randomly.

<p>You don't. The router is where the info is stored, it has to give the xbox permission and verify the key or passphrase. Without that info you'll not be able to connect.</p>

<h2>            Way to reset BIOS in Windows&#63; &#40;cant boot into bios&#41;</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I have a Toshiba tecra R940 laptop and I got it refurbished and I got it for a decent price tag but the only problem was is that the keyboard on the laptop didn't work. But that wasn't a problem for
 me, as I picked up a usb external keyboard and it worked fine. But after using the laptop for a while I came quick to notice that the bios wasn't working with my external usb keyboard. I could not even use the bios at all! But I noticed that the bios wasn't
 working because the dumb person I bought it from disabled external keyboard use in the bios which is outrageous!! I can't do a lot of things without the bios working!! Is there anyway that I can reset the bios to it's default settings without booting into
 the bios? Like a win32 app? can help solve this issue? Thanks!</span><br />

<p>While I appreciate the same day response the link you provided left me with 2 options:</p>
<ol>
<li>To check for updates which I did and was notified that my keyboard drivers were already up to date.</li><li>Remove the hardware... Which wont work as I need my keyboard.</li></ol>
<p>I attempted to roll back my keyboard driver and still have the same problems.</p>
<p>I've been using my old keyboard in my attempts to make changes to the drivers but as soon as I swap the USB dongle to the new keyboard it crashes on the first few keystrokes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned in the original post, I uploaded the dmp files and MSINFO to the dropbox for reference.</p>
<p>Could you or someone reference them to identify my issue?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't believe the issue is with the keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dump files you provided reference the WirelessKeyboardFilter.sys :</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>BugCheck D1, {0, 2, 1, fffff801f0122eeb}</em></p>
<p><em>*** WARNING: Unable to verify timestamp for <strong>WirelessKeyboardFilter.sys</strong></em><br />
<em>*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for <strong>
WirelessKeyboardFilter.sys</strong></em><br />
<em>Probably caused by : kbdclass.sys ( kbdclass!memcpy+2b )</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The WirelessKeyboardFilter.sys is from Microsoft and may have been recently updated as per the following article:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3152550" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3152550</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However another user has reported the same error in <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/driverirqlnotlessorequal-kbdclasssys-windows-10/87bf63dc-61c3-40f2-98f0-5072bef4455d">
this topic </a>and according to the dump files you both have the &nbsp;WRkrn.sys (dated July 22, 2015)&nbsp;as a loaded driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;WRkrn.sys appears to be a component of Webroot SecureAnywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of this similarity I might suggest to uninstall&nbsp;Webroot SecureAnywhere and see if the error resolves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards you could reinstall Webroot SecureAnywhere using the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For security software consider using Windows built-in antivirus (Windows Defender) and firewall.</p>

            Has any body been able to prove that it is Webroot? Or has it occurring without Webroot? I have Webroot installed and can't remove b/c of IT :( But it could be a red herring too about driver load order and the issue could still be in kbdclass.sys. Certainly
 the crash occurs always while typing. Of course wrkrn.sys could have written over memory in kbdclass.sys.

</p><p>The issue could be a Microsoft driver but if that was the case I would suspect more users would be reporting the same error rather than a limited number of users.</p>

            <p>I have just experienced this same issue, but with the microsoft keyboard and mouse combo 5050. &nbsp; I couldn't even get into the computer to removed webroot. &nbsp;I had to removed the mouse/keyboard, then use my on screen keyboard to remove webroot. &nbsp;Rebooted and
 now I can use the mouse and keyboard. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Exact same problem began affecting my Windows 10 Enterprise desktop system after installing the same Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard with wireless (USB) connection as reported in the original post on this topic. &nbsp;System works fine with USB antenna device
 unplugged and a wired keyboard and mouse plugged in. &nbsp;</p>

            Uninstalling webroot fixed mine but as soon as I reinstalled webroot the problem came right back. I have Geek squad support try a few things like update my bios but nothing. They did find that my motherboard battery was dead which he said can cause wired
 issues. I'm working on getting that done and will update from there.&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks everybody for the information. Removing webroot on my machine did work as well (no longer experiencing crashes). IT is going to re-enable webroot today to debug and we are going to see if there are any file locking issues with webroot (although I
 think the driver sys files should be system and signed properly so they shouldn't be an issue).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to set an app to use Default Communication Device instead of Default Playback device</h2>
                    In my Windows 10 system, I have multiple audio devices. Ex: TV as HDMI monitor, USB Speakers, Headset connected to the front panel Headphone/Mic ports.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35230b56-1d42-4d21-b4a9-202ef987da26?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35230b56-1d42-4d21-b4a9-202ef987da26?upload=true" /></a><br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4c473c7a-21f8-43e9-a760-0df5a87a5239?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4c473c7a-21f8-43e9-a760-0df5a87a5239?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
<br />
Most applications use the Default Playback device (currently set to USB Speakers as indicated by the Green Check), some direct their output to the TV via the HDMI port. I have an application that I use for VOIP communications. I have set my&nbsp;Default Communications&nbsp;Device
 as the front panel headset ports (as indicated by the Green Phone handset). When using the VOIP application the output audio goes to the Default Playback Device instead of the Default Communications Device.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there a way to designate the VOIP application as a Communications Applications so that it will use the Default Communications Device instead of the Default Playback Device?<br />
<br />
Yes, I know that this question has been asked before but the answers do not address assigning the application as a Communications Application so that it will use the Default Communications Device.

            As I tried to explain, I am not looking for a way to select what device is the Default Communications Device. In the initial two images, the Playback Default Communications Device and the Recording Default Communications Device are as I want them. The
 Default (all other sounds) Device is set to the device I want them.<br />
<br />
What I am looking to do is tell an application to use the Default Communication Device instead of the Default Device.

            Can anyone point me to where this question was asked previously?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
More details. I am a Ham Radio Operator. I use a program called EchoLink. I want EchoLink to use the Front Panel Connections (Mic and Headphones) as indicated by the Default Communications Device in the pictures above with the icon of a phone handset. Meanwhile,
 I want system sounds and various other audio applications to use the "Insignia" speakers as indicated by the Checkmark in the image above.<br />
<br />
Listed in the playback devices is one titled "SignaLink". It is also in the Recording devices but just outside of the image. This is used for one and only one application and thus I do not want to designate it&nbsp;as either Default or communications device.<br />
<br />
Is there anyone that can assist with this issue?

&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm a student. I have an dreamspark account made by university administrations. I'm trying to download windows 10 education version in my windows 8.&nbsp; In dreamspark it shows that the .iso file is 3.9 GB. I started download first time and it stop at 1.7 GB
 and there was no option of resume download( I used chrome) means the download completed. I tried to burn the file in usb drive using 'rufus-2.15p.exe' &nbsp;but failed saying corrupted file may be due to incomplete download. I started download second time and it
 stopped at 1.6.. GB and again file was corrupted. My wifi speed is 120 kb/s and it is fine.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
&nbsp; Please help</div>

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I downloaded the microsoft download manager but after I found that the download link is not able to copied (actually there was a button 'Download'). I tried several times but was not able to copied and paste.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now I disabled windows defender, firewall and cleared browser history. But again stopped at 1.5 GB this time. This was third time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to ask that is there any difference in the &nbsp;features of the windows if downloaded from dream spark or from link you provided here &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

            I used chrome. &nbsp; &nbsp; After your suggestion I went to the link you provided but &nbsp;it shows that my 'product key is invalid or not supported by this site'. &nbsp;But I entered the key correctly. So again I stuck in this problem. It happend when I scroll down the
 page of download academic softwares and tried to varify the key.

            Thanks to all for their replies. I successfully downloaded and installed windows 10 education version. &nbsp; Actually I noticed that if download takes too long it automatically gets stop. I used high speed net and download completed in short time without interruption.
 I suggest all others who facing this problem and have very low download speed that start your download at night near 2'o clock. At that time load on servers is very low so you will get very high speed. &nbsp;
