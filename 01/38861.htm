<h2>            After Windows updates&#39; installation&#58; the blue screen error and Windows does not start up anymore</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a really weird problem: after a regular installation of Windows 7 updates, Windows cannot start up anymore. There is a Blue Screen error each time a PC reboots. The OS is booting up and everything goes fine and I can see my mouse pointer, and when
 the welcome screen is about to show up&nbsp; - OS crashes with a blue screen error. No new HW or SW was installed within that period. I reinstalled the OS and the only piece of SW I installed right after - Microsoft Office Plus 2013 Professional package. Again,
 installation of Windows updates and the same blue screen error.</p>
<p>I can boot only into Safe Mode and Safe Mode with cmd prompt. Safe Mode with Networking does not work - leads to the same blue screen. While in Safe Mode, I tried to use available Windows recovery tools - doesn't help, since Windows cannot detect any problems
 :D PC: Asus X50VL series laptop (all available vendor-specific driver updates were already there, nothing more to update).</p>
<p>I would be very grateful if anyone could share any ideas or similar experiences, since I have no idea what could be the problem. I checked the provided error codes, but they are of "general type" and that doesn't help much to narrow the problem down. I also
 tried to rollback/restore the installed updates in Safe Mode - this does not work - I get an error and the installed updates cannot be removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Kira</p>

    <title>touchpad not working after windows 10 anniversary upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            touchpad not working after windows 10 anniversary upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, I have an Acer Aspire v11 Touch. This morning my laptop told me it'd had an upgrade, the anniversary upgrade. My touchpad isn't working. It has disappeared as a device. My laptop tells me I have the correct drivers for it but I can't uninstall
 it and reinstall it because it isn't there. Not sure how to install from scratch anyway, not a teccie. And I've also used Fn F7 just to check that all I need to do is turn it on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help please?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to download the latest touchpad drivers from the Acer's website and install them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try installing it in compatible mode and check if the issue can ne fixed.</p>

</p><p><span>1. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on ‚Äò<strong>properties</strong>‚Äô.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click on the ‚Äò<strong>compatibility</strong>‚Äô tab and check the box ‚Äò<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>‚Äô and select
 Windows 7/8 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks Joy, one of the many things I've already tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've taken my laptop to a local tech support and rolled back to the previous version of Windows 10 and permanently disabled updates. To have your laptop updated without any warning or permission is unacceptable! And for it then to not register the touchpad
 as a piece of hardware, hopeless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'll never upgrade from the existing build on a PC again. Waste of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But thanks anyway :)</p>

    <title>Icons Lock on the Desktop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Icons Lock on the Desktop</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 that I just upgraded from windows 7. After the upgrade I found that I am unable to move the icons on the desktop. I have toggled the auto arrange option on and off with no success. I can select/delete/cut/paste without any issue, but not
 am unable to move the actual icons. Any help would be grateful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Side note, I am also running fences without any problem. I can move them around with no issues. The only way to put icons into the fence at the moment is to cut and paste&nbsp;the icon into to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
The issue could be you might have enabled auto arrange icons. I would suggest you to try the following steps.<br />
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Right-click desktop, click View, and uncheck Auto arrange icons.<br />

</span><span>Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span>

            <p><span>Hi Vijay,</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for replying. As I mentioned in my post, I had tried the auto arrange option (on/off) multiple times, restarted the computer multiple times, to see if I could get the icons to work properly.
 I had no luck. I‚Äôll be honest I got tired of fighting it, then my start menu quit working, then the computer crashed. I went back to windows 7 and everything is working again. I will probably try windows 10 after the first service pack comes out as there seems
 to be bugs in the software.</span></p>
<p><span>Kind Regards</span></p>

    <title>Skype has started resending old text messages to my contacts - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype has started resending old text messages to my contacts</h2>
                    <p>This morning, two of my coworkers called me to ask about text messages from me that appeared in their Skype text window with time and date stamps from this morning.
<strong>I had not texted either of them.</strong> After they read the texts to me, it became clear from the content&nbsp;that Skype had randomly resent them several of my messages from many weeks ago. These texts did not appear in my own text window today, and so
 it was baffling when they started asking me "What's this about?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody else having this experience? Microsoft, are you reading this? Do you have an explanation for this glitch?</p>

<p>Thanks for you reply. Here's the info you requested:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My OS: Windows 10</p>
<p>Skype version: 7.40.0.104</p>
<p>My co-workers both use Mac version of Skype</p>
<p>Uninstall/reinstall Skype: Not recently</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are probably going to tell me to install the latest version of Skype. I did that when the new version of Skype for Windows 10 came out. My experience after a few weeks of using it was so disastrous that I uninstalled it and reinstalled the version that
 I had been using, i.e. the version that I have now, listed above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype for Windows 10 was buggy and inconvenient to use. Things like incoming calls not ringing, texts not being transmitted promptly, and being unable to hear the other party on a call. In addition, formerly simple tasks, like adding people to a group call,
 became cumbersome. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Every single one of my coworkers using Skype has complained about similar problems after updating to the latest version. Some of them are living with it, others like me have restored an older version. I have never before had complaints about the Skype interface
 in the many years I have used it, until Skype Win 10 was released. It is the worst Skype version ever.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You were probably referring to the Skype App for Windows 10 as the updated version which is a different interface.</p>
<p>We have recently released an updated version of the classic Skype which is version 7.41</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download it directly from this link: <strong><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Get Classic Skype</a></strong></p>

            <p>I just used that download page and that is where I got the error after downloading. Is creating an install DVD going to make a difference in the install compared to the upgrade after download? I was told the reason for this error is that, for me with a reserved
 version, that I must wait for my invite/installation notice, not to use the download page, at least on initial install. Waiting for my notification in any case but would be good to have some acknowledgement this is indeed correct

            Reinstalling Windows 7 is not a possible solution to many of us. &nbsp;I've been searching for this issue for several days. &nbsp;Microsoft... Nothing you have points to "Error details: Code 80240020" &nbsp;If this is a problem with root installations stemming from HP's
 Windows 7, updated to Microsoft's Windows 8 Pro, updated to Microsoft's Windows 8.1 Pro, I'm sure that I am not one of few that have hit this snag... &nbsp;Now I'll go try the partition magic solution. &nbsp;Boring&nbsp;

<h2>            Metro apps crash on launch in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I've been using Windows 8.1 since it came out. For last 4 days I'm having problem launching metro apps. As soon as I launch any app, it crashes to start screen, even the metro&nbsp;settings app. I have tried the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tried <strong>sfc /scannow</strong>. It says "<em><strong>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them</strong></em>".</li><li>Tried the <strong>Windows Store Apps troubleshooter tool</strong>. It says "<em><strong>Some security settings are missing or have been changed. Some apps might not have access to required resources</strong>.</em>"</li></ol>
<p>How can I get the metro apps running again? I'd prefer not doing a refresh or reset.</p>

<p>Whenever I launch a metro app, it brings the splash screen and immediately shows the start screen. I do not get any error message. &nbsp;When I access the program manager from left of the screen, I can see the app there. Selecting the app from there shows the
 same result.</p>
<p>I have tried sfc /scannow and store app troubleshooter, as mentioned above. I have UAC enabled and Windows is up-to-date.</p>
<p>I did a clean boot, and the issue still persists.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I tried this link <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/notime/archive/2013/10/18/fix-store-app-in-windows-8-1.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi Abhishek,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your update on the issue and I apologize for the late reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, 0x80070002 error states that the user does not have administrative privileges to access a particular program or app. So, make sure you login as an administrator and try to run the apps in administrator mode (Right click &gt;
<strong>Run as administrator </strong>on the menu below).</p>
<p>Apart from that I would, suggest you to try the suggestions provided in the step 2 of my previous post. This link is different from the Apps troubleshooter. So, try the steps provided and keep us updated with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be glad to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

<h2>            Sound Randomly Stops Working on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am having a problem with my Windows 10 PC. Randomly, the sound stops working, even if it has been working fine for 3 days straight. One thing that has fixed it before was doing a Windows update, but there are not any available right now. Another
 thing that's worked is completely resetting the computer, but this is very hit or miss in regards to fixing the issue, so I'd rather not do it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also already tried updating and reinstalling my audio drivers, but this still doesn't fix the problem. Is there anyhting else I could try?</p>

Yes, I've already the manufacturer's site and deleted the driver, but I always ensure it gets reinstalled.

<em><strong>IDT High Definition Audio CODEC.</strong></em></p>
<p>3. Go to <em><strong>Driver </strong></em>tab, click on <strong><em>Update Driver.</em></strong></p>
<p>4. Select <em><strong>Browse my computer for driver software</strong></em> and choose<em><strong>Let me pickup a list of device drivers on my computer.</strong></em></p>
<p>5. Select <em><strong>High Definition Audio Device</strong></em> and click on <em>
<strong>Next</strong></em>.</p>
<p>6. A warning message will appear, select <em><strong>Yes</strong></em>. You should receive an alert that
<em><strong>Windows has successfully update your driver software.</strong></em></p>

            Hi Fahim
<br />
<br />When you re-install Windows 10 it should activate automatically once the PC is put on the Internet
<br />
<br />Activation problems after clean installing Windows 10 are generally caused by installing an Edition (Home, Pro . . .etc.) that does not match the previously installed Edition that was on the PC
<br />
<br />Open Settings - System - About
<br />
<br />Does the Edition listed there match the previously installed Edition?
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Is this the method you used to re-install Windows 10?
<br />
<br />You should just clean install Windows 10 rather than upgrading from Windows 8.1. This will have 2 benefits, if you have to reset again, it will reset to Windows 10, not 8.1 and your system will be more responsive and reliable . . . 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>I realize this was posted a while ago, but since there's still no solution suggested, and I encountered it today myself, I'll share the way I fixed it:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Control Panel &gt; Region&nbsp;</li><li>Change the format from "Match Windows display language" to the one matching your systems language. (For example, I too am from Israel, so I selected the Hebrew(Israel) option, but any other language written from right to left would've probably worked the
 same.)</li></ul>

<h2>            External Speakers Not Working in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to Windows 10 on my NEO Elan laptop and while there is sound from the laptop's on board speakers, these do not play when I plug in a jack for external speakers. &nbsp;The jack and external speakers are ignored and the sound continues to play through
 the laptop's on board speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My VIA HD audio driver is updated to latest Windows 10 version. &nbsp;When I try the sound troubleshooter, I see the "no jack information" message available but when the troubleshooter completes, it tells me that it has found no solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get sound through to my Bluetooth headset so it's really just the external speakers that do not work. &nbsp;Would appreciate any help. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Mail app cannot see attachments</h2>
                    In the latest version of the Mail app in Windows 8.1, attachments aren't showing on some old mails. I have a number of mails with attached PDF docs, and when I view one there's nowhere to click to download the attachment.

I got a colleague to email me a word doc just now, and it showed up initally. Then the mail app crashed. When it reopened, I can no longer see the attachment. In the message LIST, there's an icon indicating that the mail has an attachment, but the mail itself
 has none.&nbsp;</font></p>

I've had this happen with word docs and images, so its not limited to PDF

<div>Also I can confirm in my case the attachment is not included if I forward the mail.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Thanks for reporting this issue.&nbsp; We are aware of the issue and are considering a fix in a future update to prevent this issue from occurring.&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem can occur when you choose "Search in all folders" and the mail that is returned should have an&nbsp;attachment.&nbsp;
 Once you are in this state, the only way to download the attachment is to download the mail again.&nbsp; To download an individual mail again, the easiest way to do this is to move the mail to a different folder.&nbsp; If you have many mails to download again, the easiest
 thing may be to remove and add back your account again.&nbsp; Thanks for your patience as we work to address the issue.</p>

            It's a bit ridiculous alright. This makes the mail app essentially useless for any emails that have attachments.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've now switched to Thunderbird which has no problem with attachments. This won't be a solution for anyone on an ARM device of course. MetroMail might be worth looking into

            Same problem, &nbsp; can see email fine on my old desktop with Windows 7, &nbsp;but this cursed Windows 8.1 will not allow me to see old attachments, &nbsp;will not allow me to see new attachments, &nbsp;and will not even allow me to send attachments. &nbsp; There is a box that
 says there is an attachment &nbsp;but nothing is in the box. &nbsp; Windows 8 is pathetic when it comes to mail, and this so called support is worse than pathetic. &nbsp;Of course no one will reply here, but feels better to know it is not just my computer.

<p><span>Many PC games let you play with an Xbox Wireless Controller instead of a keyboard or mouse. You can connect your controller to a Windows PC by using a USB cable, the Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows, or over Bluetooth. Some PCs also come
 with Xbox Wireless built in, so you can connect a controller directly without an adapter.
<span>The Xbox 360 Controller for Windows can be easily installed on any PC that has an available USB port and is running Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, or Windows 7.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Reset dei crediti e grado su Halo Reach&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Ciao A tutti, sono un fedele appassionato di Halo dal 2002...volevo chiedervi se sull'ultimo capitolo:Reach,&nbsp; vi √® capitato di essere bannati e/o resettati di crediti e grado per nessun motivo evidente, senza cheat ovviamente; oppure solo perch√® non avete
 terminato, giocando, alcune partite?? Grazie&nbsp; e Ciao</p>

<p>mai successo niente del genere, mi ricordo per√≤ che gi√† su halo 3 se uscivi prima dalle partite online perdevi dei punti esperienza, ma niente ban o reset totale di grado.</p>

<p>Dubito fortemente che la Bungie resetti il grado "senza nessun motivo evidente".</p>
<p>Se lasci le partite ti viene bloccato il matchmaking per un tot di tempo, generalmente 30 minuti.</p>
<p>Se fai il furbo facendo delle stanze con tutti amici, a volte anche solo per fare gli obiettivi, ti bloccano l'ottenimento dei crediti per qualche giorno (quindi matchmaking disponibile ma senza guadagno di crediti a fine partita).</p>
<p>Se perseveri in queste cose o fai il furbo in maniera ancora pi√π grave (per es. stanze apposite tra amici per incrementare gli encomi) allora ti resettano il grado e non ti fanno prendere crediti per un bel po'. Stesso discorso per chi modda il proprio profilo
 per arrivare al grado di erede con zero partite giocate :)</p>

<p>Per "non giocando" intendevo stare fermi, ma non per tutta la partita, alcuni minuti causa telefonate o ecc. In inglese lo chiamano afking, ma pensavo che non bannassero, come in halo3.</p>

<p>Piano piano, non vieni bannato per un afk (away from keyboard).</p>
<p>Vieni bannato se lo fai con l'intento di non giocare e raccattare punti: insomma, fare afking in maniera sistematica.</p>
<p>Nessuno ti banna se una partita stai fermo perch√® il gatto √® finito nella pentola a pressione e devi salvarlo o se ti si son scaricate le batterie del pad e stai cambiandole.</p>

<p>Comunque mi pare che si stia scatenando il panico dei bannaggi: siate seri, giocate per divertirvi e nessuno vi banner√† mai.</p>
<p>Nemmeno se di tanto in tanto fate qualche porcata (tipo uccidere i compagni di squadra per puro sollazzo).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Chi viene bannato, se non ci sono errori, ha fatto cose che SAPEVA essere scorrette ed illegali.</p>
<p>Poi fa finta di niente, ma questo √® un altro discorso.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you so much for getting back to us with the updates on this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You are absolutely correct. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If one of the speakers is working properly and if the other is not, then this does not seem to be a driver issue. However, let us try uninstalling and reinstalling the latest available drivers from the Acer website and check if that resolves
 the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, even after reinstalling the latest drivers, then the issue could be with the hardware components of the left speaker. In that case, I would suggest you to get in touch with a hardware technician and check if the
 left speaker is faulty.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To uninstall and reinstall the audio drivers on the computer, please follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Step 1: Uninstall the Audio Drivers</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>a) Press ‚Äú<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>‚Äù + ‚Äú<strong><em>X</em></strong>‚Äù keys on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click on ‚Äú<strong><em>Device Manager</em></strong>‚Äù from that list.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Search for the Sound Card device from the device list, right click on it and then select ‚Äú<strong><em>Uninstall</em></strong>‚Äù. On the un-installation window, if you have an option: ‚Äú<strong><em>Delete the driver software for this device</em></strong>‚Äù
 you may select that and then remove the corrupted drivers from the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Follow the on-screen instructions to complete it and the restart the computer if prompted.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After the restart, please open the <strong><em>Device Manager</em></strong> again and then click on the ‚Äú<strong><em>Scan for hardware changes</em></strong>‚Äù button. Check if Windows 8.1 detects the Sound Card device and installs an appropriate
 driver automatically. If the issue still persists, then try the next step. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Step 2: Check Windows Updates for the latest drivers.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check in Windows updates if any driver updates are available. If so, install the same and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press ‚Äú<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>‚Äù + ‚Äú<strong><em>W</em></strong>‚Äù keys from the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type ‚Äú<strong><em>Updates</em></strong>‚Äù in the search bar and click on the icon ‚Äú<strong><em>Windows Update</em></strong>‚Äù from the search result.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the ‚Äú<strong><em>Windows Update</em></strong>‚Äù window, click on the link: ‚Äú<strong><em>Check for updates</em></strong>‚Äù from the left hand side of the window to receive a fresh list of updates.</span></p>
<p><span>d) If the updates are available, then install all the updates listed there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If Windows Update does not offer the latest Windows 8.1 driver, then try the next step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Step 3: Update Driver Software from the Acer website:</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download and install the latest available Windows 8.1 compatible sound card drivers from the link given below and check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span><a href="http://global-download.acer.com/GDFiles/Driver/Audio/Audio_Realtek_6.0.1.7027_W81x64_A.zip?acerid=635168946390582093&amp;Step1=NOTEBOOK&amp;Step2=ASPIRE&amp;Step3=ASPIRE%20V3-731&amp;OS=81P1&amp;LC=en&amp;BC=ACER&amp;SC=PA_6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Realtek Audio Drivers

<h2>            I can&#39;t uninstall programs or make changes to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to uninstall programs on Windows 10 Home on a local user account. I used to be able to, plus make other changes, before the latest updates. Now the Yes button is missing from the User Accounts Control box when I'm asked if I
 will allow that app to make changes to my device. I never used to have to enter a user name and password to continue, I only had to click Yes. There is nowhere to type them anyway. The user name has always been the default admin and without a password. I setup
 a password but can't change the name of the account as there isn't a Yes button. I now can't make any changes to anything.</p>
<p>I'm running Windows 10 Home version 1703 64 bit. There are only 3 updates: KB4048954, KB4049011 and KB4022405.</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>

<p>Thank you for the update. If your Windows 10 installation is demonstrating unusual behavior, usually, the last resort would be performing a clean install. However, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily have to be that way. Instead, you can perform a repair upgrade.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A repair upgrade is the process of installing Windows 10 over the existing installation of Windows 10 on your hard disk. Performing this will repair broken operating system files while preserving your apps, files, and settings.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Digital licence and BSOD&#39;s</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
I had done my Windows 7 Professional to Windows 10 Professional free upgrade a couple of years back when Windows 10 was launched.&nbsp; I have been using Windows 10 Professional all along without any issues.&nbsp; I have also been frequently doing the Windows Update
 at regular intervals.&nbsp; I am currently having Windows 10 Pro version 1809 OS build 17763.55.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of a sudden, yesterday I have started getting a notification asking to Activate Windows.&nbsp; When I checked, it says I am running Windows 10 Pro whilst I am having a Windows 10 Home digital licence, which I not able to understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my laptop started suddenly crashing with BSOD and restarting showing different types of Stop code errors (SYSTEM SERVICE EXCEPTION, KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED etc.).&nbsp; It says some hardware has been changed, whereas, all hardware or external devices
 connected are the same since I had been using with my Windows 7 Pro and also since I had started using Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could be the issue for the above.&nbsp; Your help in regard would be appreciated.</p>

            For the activation message there‚Äôs currently a problem with the activation servers of which Microsoft are aware, it is stating that Windows isn‚Äôt activated.
<br />Some users have reported the problem is fixed after running the activation troubleshooter.

<br />If the BSoD appeared at the same time as the activation message then they may be connected.

<p>Hi, thank you very much for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The activation message was being received since yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BSoD's were coming since Monday with the different types of <span>
Stop code errors (SYSTEM SERVICE EXCEPTION, KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED etc.).</span></p>

            Run the troubleshooter to get Windows activated.
<br />If the BSoD is still happening here‚Äôs some suggestions for a fix:
<br />Start your Computer in Safe Mode
<br />Open Command prompt with administrative privilege
<br />Enter this ‚Äòsfc/scannow‚Äò command there
<br />Wait for the scan to complete
<br />Find the Corrupt file
<br />Find a new copy
<br />Install the new copy
<br />
<br />Go to the start menu
<br />Click or go to the Command Prompt
<br />Open it
<br />Type this following command there
<br />chkdsk /F /R
<br />Now, Press Enter there
<br />Now, press Y button there to reboot
<br />This make take some time depending on the size of the hard drive
<br />After completing, close the tab
<br />Restart your PC again
<br />
<br />Check that all drivers are upto date.
<br />
<br />Disconnect all external devices &amp; see if the BSoD returns, if it doesn‚Äôt plug them in one by one until the problem begins again then you‚Äôll know which device may be causing it.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 Professional Digital licence activation issue got sorted by itself on Friday after the Microsoft activation servers issue is sorted out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the commands "sfc /scannow", "chkdsk /f /r" successfully without any errors pointed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also run the "SeaTools" from Seagate and the "Data LifeGuard Diagnostics" from Western Digital on my hard disk.&nbsp; I ran all the tests in these tools and all the tests had a PASS result without any error message shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, my system is still occasionally restarting by itself with the BSoD&nbsp;<span>KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED error message.</span></p>
<p><span>What could be the issue for the same.</span></p>
<p>
