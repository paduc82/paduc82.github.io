<h2>            Red Dot On Power Supply Brick</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Microsoft :)</p>

<p>really confussed about my situation as ive never had an issue with my console or anything i use on my console till about 2 weeks ago maybe less i normally play daily and i hadnt being on it for a couple of days and my console just wouldnt turn on so i checked
 all cords still nothing then i looked at my power supply to find the light on it was RED... thought hmmm strange&nbsp; i come on xbox.com to see the trouble shooting steps and tryed all but still nothing so i rang microsoft up and explaned my situation and wasnt
 really asked anything and the person said its my power supply im covered under warrenty that i just need to send it to them along with the case number and ill get a brand new one sent out as from that day i havnt being able to get into town i just gave up
 bothering to see if it would fix itselfs until last night i plugged it in and what do you know it turned on and i was playing without an issue i decided to goto bed and when i woke up in the morning the light on the power supply brick was red again i thought
 geez ... so i unplugged it and plugged it back in and it worked again i was playing for hours without an issue i only went off as i didnt wanna play anymore ive searched xbox.com and google to see if ppl have ever had whats happening to me to anyone else with
 no real luck that its just over heating which i dont belive mine is i saw a post that someone was told the red light can appear on the power supply brick to indicate afew reasons like consoles dead,power supplys dead or its picking up a fault like maybe one
 or more of the USB PORTS ..&nbsp; before i bother sending it back is there anyway its a usb port if so if i coud possably figure which one can i just use the others without an issue ? i use 1.port for my astro headset 2. for my controller charger and one at the
 front for an external HDD i watch stuff off&nbsp; TIA</p>

<p>Hi Cr4yon, </p>
<p>I have read your post and see that you are having some troubles with your power supply for you Xbox and that you have phoned in an talked to Xbox Support. Unfortunately as they stated it appears that the power supply will need to be replaced as indicated
 in the attached link. </p>

<p>thanks for the reply iraydawg &nbsp;if i have to send it away i will i just thought as the person i spoke to didnt really ask much when i spoke on the phone that maybe its not needed as the power pack is still working and thought maybe one of you or another xbox
 live ambassador could clarify if it might just be a usb issue which is the cause ? .. im thinking before i send it back and get a new one back that im going to test out my usb ports like today ive had nothing plugged into any of the usbs at the back and if
 i wake up tomorrow and the light on the power brick isnt red then ill plug of on the things i normally have in the back each day seeing if that causes it to go red but if ur pretty sure this isnt the case then i may aswell just send it back on wednesday

<p>Hey there CR34MY CR4Y0N, it seems that you have a problem with your power brick. You did right by calling xbox customer support, they will replace the power brick as soon as you send them the problematic one. Since the power brick overheats i recommend that
 you do not use it to power your xbox console as it could lead to a short-circuit. Better wait until customer service replaces your current power brick for a new one :)</p>

<p>do you have this problem if nothing is plugged into USB ports,if you do,its def the power brick,sounds like an intermittent fault,which would require a new power brick,also make sure you don't leave it plugged in if your not using your Xbox</p>

<p>I have Windows Live Mail (&amp; Essentials) installed on my laptop and desktop for work.&nbsp; I have
<em><strong>one</strong></em> email account.&nbsp; I have set up the one (&amp; same) email account on
<strong><em>both</em></strong> computers, and always log into my Microsoft account&nbsp;on both computers.&nbsp; However, the 'Folders' I my Live Mail&nbsp;are<strong><em> not</em></strong> syncing.&nbsp; For instance, if I send an email from my laptop, and then later&nbsp;go on the
 desktop &amp; look&nbsp;under the&nbsp;'Sent' folder, the email I sent from my laptop does not appear in the 'Sent' folder on my desktop.&nbsp; If I delete emails on either computer, I have to do it on both.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essentially, I am looking to log into my email, and have a mirrored image/storage/account on both computers.&nbsp; How do I do this??!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Note:&nbsp; I have already uninstalled and reinstalled both Essentials and Windows Live Mail on both computers, and deleted and readded my email account on both computers...)</p>

    <title>Homegroup Advantages&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> athena..  say:</h3>
<h2>            Homegroup Advantages&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm in the process of upgrading my machines to Windows 7 and I'm getting messages about a homegroup being available but I'm not clear what advantages it would offer over what I have now.<br />
<br />
All of my machines are linked to a WHS that has a lot of shared folders for different types of content.&nbsp; The only shares on the individual machines are in the default public tree and not used very often.&nbsp; As I'm upgrading each client, the server shares are
 being included in Windows 7 libraries so no one has to keep track of what is on the local machine and what is on the server.&nbsp; The printers are either standalone netword devices or attached to the server.<br />
<br />
Would we gain anythinig by setting up a homegroup too?&nbsp; The only advantage I can see would be that I wouldn't have to maintain&nbsp;IDs for everyone in the network&nbsp;on all the different machines:&nbsp; they could get to the others' public folders with just the homegroup
 password and those folders could be included in the libraries too.&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually, that might be reason enough to try it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there any other advantage to using a homegroup?&nbsp;&nbsp;I assume that it wouldn't interfere with&nbsp;WHS in any way.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you.</p>

            <span>Hey Athena,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Here are some advantages of HomeGroup:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</span><span>1. Easily share the photos, music, and files on each of the PCs running Windows 7 on your home network. It's especially handy when you want to share a printer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. HomeGroup takes the headache out of sharing files and printers on a home network. Connect two or more PCs running Windows 7, and HomeGroup makes it easy to automatically start sharing your music, picture, video, and document
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/libraries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>libraries</span></span></span></span></a><span>
 with other people in your home. </span><br />
<span>&nbsp;<br />
3. HomeGroup is password-protected and puts you in total control. You decide what gets shared—and what stays private. You can also make your files "read only," so other people can look at—but not touch—your stuff.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4. Easier to just put the file on a USB drive and take it to the PC with the printer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5. Print a file at home when you aren’t connected to a printer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
6. Homegroup makes workgroups easier. If you have 10 PC's in a workgroup with a password shares, you need to create user accounts on all the PC's. With homegroup you can just create 1 password for shares, no accounts needed.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<p>ok, vamos lá.</p>
<p>1) não vai 24 horas, demora cerca de 5 à 7 dias... (na verdade devia ser 24 horas, mas sabe como as coisas funcionam no Brasil, quando precisei da assistência a telefonista me informou sobre isso, sobre esse detalhe no e-mail não ser "verdade")</p>
<p>2) de uma olhada na caixa de spam ou lixo eletrônico, as vezes este e-mail pode parar lá (foi o q aconteceu comigo)</p>
<p>3) antes de fazer a coleta eles vão ligar pra vc, caso vc não tenha recebido o e-mail ainda, basta avisar na ligação que a transportadora tem os seus dados, então eles mesmo imprimem e levam pra você</p>
<p>quando me ligaram, eu não tinha olhado na caixa de spam, então disse q não tinha recebido o e-mail e o cara q venho buscar trouxe junto a etiqueta.</p>

<p>Saudações, faz uns 5 dias que eu acionei a assistência por telefone e eles disseram que meu xbox one seria trocado, então veio um email dizendo que chegaria um outro email com a etiqueta de remessa até 24h, porem esse Email até agora não chegou, desejo saber
 como receber ou recuperar a etiqueta, pois a qualquer momento a transportadora vai vir buscar meu console pra poder enviar um novo.</p>

<p>Caso naoo tenha visto. ) não vai 24 horas, demora cerca de 5 à 7 dias... (na verdade devia ser 24 horas, mas sabe como as coisas funcionam no Brasil, quando precisei da assistência a telefonista me informou sobre isso, sobre esse detalhe no e-mail não ser
 "verdade")</p>
<p>2) de uma olhada na caixa de spam ou lixo eletrônico, as vezes este e-mail pode parar lá (foi o q aconteceu comigo)</p>
<p>3) antes de fazer a coleta eles vão ligar pra vc, caso vc não tenha recebido o e-mail ainda, basta avisar na ligação que a transportadora tem os seus dados, então eles mesmo imprimem e levam pra você</p>
<p>quando me ligaram, eu não tinha olhado na caixa de spam, então disse q não tinha recebido o e-mail e o cara q venho buscar trouxe junto a etiqueta.</p>

    <title>Shame on you Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Shame on you Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>This isn't right, just had to say something. It's **** and absolutely ridiculous Microsoft doesn't make the Kinect adapter anymore. This is how you treat your loyal customers? I bought an Xbox one x day 1 and decided to await to buy the adapter. What a mistake. Now, if you can find one, the price is through the roof. To my knowledge there was no indication production on the adapter would be stopped. So now I have a worthless Kinect. As an early adopter I&nbsp;am very disappointed. I bought a surface, Xbox one, one x day one and this is what I get. I even still use a Microsoft windows phone believe it or not. I have always been very pleased with Microsoft products and this one hurts. Shame. Do the right thing and send or sell me one at the original price. Or you could just keep making them. Shame. Can someone at support make this right?</p>

            <p>I think you need to bite the bullet mate and just purchase one. I did today and paid £119 including postage. Prices are going sky high since this news about adapters came out. in just a few hours of me purchasing it at the said price the same company is now adding another £20, so selling for £139. </p><p><br /></p><p>But if you have any luck getting one out of Microsoft&nbsp; at the original price of £39.99 let me know.</p>

            <p>I do not want to use my kinect bad enough to fork up 6, 7, 8x the original price of the adapter. Hopefully a 3rd part starts making them.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>As far as "support" goes, I just had to say something. Anyone reading this knows it isn't right what msft has done. All peripherals were supposed to work with xbox one x and now they don't.

That's exactly what they did, they SCREWED us.<br /></p> 
  <p>The thing is you can keep arguing about it with MSft but where will it get you. Your still short of an adapter And Microsoft aren't all of a sudden going to change their minds, and start supplying people with adapters. It is up to you to decide how important the Kinect is to you and what steps you want to take in order for you to use it. I was umming and arring about the adapter. I was looking in December last year, in MS store, Amazon. I refused to pay £80 for what should have been £40. Then the price shot up to £119, and the same day MS announced they were stopping the production of the adapter. I bit the bullet and brought one. I had the original Xbox One, which I gave to my sister and brought myself the Xbox One X. This is why I needed the adapter. I wasn't happy about paying such a high rice for a lead. but my Kinect is now working. Yes if I saw the video beforehand I would have made up my own adapter. So decide how important The Kinect is to you then decide what your going to do. If it ws me i'd
  <p><br /></p><p>The kinect is $40 worth of importance to me. Not enough to try to rig one up. I'm more disappointed than anything. I'm sure i'm not the only one that is upset. Oh well, just have to wait for a 3rd party to make one. Besides, mstf were the ones that said all peripherals would work with the one x so that makes them liars. <br /></p> 
 </blockquote> <p>Well like some else said to me,&nbsp; when the adapter was available all peripherals did work so yes they where right. it's all about marketing. You could always buy a used Kinect camera cheap and modify that, or if you not confident enough and your not to far from me and based in the uk I could solder one up for you. you get the bits i'll do the work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Everything does work, you can't blame Microsoft for greedy scalpers jumping in and buying up stock. They announced 25th October that the Kinect was not being manufactured, so it would figure that the adapters would be stopped soon after. They probably manufactured more than enough but scalpers got them first.</p>

<h2>            Seeing Skype credit</h2>
                    <p>This is the second time I have asked this and have not received an answer.</p>
<p>Since the new update of Skype I no longer see how much credit is left on the screen.<br />
It used to be visible in the top left corner during the call so one could keep track of</p>
<p>it. &nbsp;Where has it disappeared to?</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>

<h2>            Jack undetected</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody, here is my problem.</p>
<p>I recently bought a new computer wich I built myself. I then proceed to install Win 10, by using a key. Then, I connected a speaker, and the sound was perfectly fine. The day later, so yesterday, I tried to connect my headphones, and they were not recognized,
 the PC simply doesn't seem to see they ara connected.</p>
<p>The headphones work properly on another PC (with Win8), and I even try to connect another headphone, but it didn't work either...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The headphones don't appear in the Device list, while the speakers do, but I have 4 "NVIDIA HDMI Output (Port x)" where x is 0, 1, 2 and 3.</p>
<p>I also have "Realtek HD Audio 2nd output". Everything seems to be unpluged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to check the drivers, (NVIDIA High Definition Audio and Realtek High Definition Audio), but they are updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also checked the connections Inside the pc (you never know) but they all seem okay. I don't know what to do, and I really need the sound, could you help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: Okay, so I've got something new: When the graphic card isn't there it works perfectly fine. I have a HDMI port on it, so it might be this. But when i try to change the settings and put something else by default, I can't, the case is grey.</p>
<p>I will try to show you my screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT2: Oh, no, it doesn't work without the graphic card... At least not anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT3: Oh, but with just an HDMI connection, i can have the sound...</p>
<p>It seems that the problem really comes from a conflict between the onboard card sound and the graphic card...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My motherboeard is a MSI h110 pro-vd, and my graphic card is GeForce GTx 950.<br />

            Could be a hardware problem, even an interaction issue caused by the GPU card.<br />
<br />
Check with the motherboard maker and the GPU card makers' Supports.<br />
<br />
Tough to troubleshoot a system at home due to the limited amount of known good hardware to swap in and out.<br />

<h2>            Windows 8, Windows Media Player Bug&#58; Server Execution Failed.</h2>
                    G'day Mate<br />
<br />
If you open a video file from Windows Explorer and close Windows Media Player while it's still playing Windows Media Player doesn't close properly and if you attempt to open another video file it gives the error server execution failed.<br />
<br />
This problem doesn't occur if you stop the video before closing Windows Media Player.<br />
<br />
A work around is to open Task Manager and kill Windows Media Player before opening another video file but that's annoying.

I decided to try your advice on the off chance it was corruption and it was still producing the error message.<br />

I even ran a sfc /scannow check and it didn't solve the issue.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am replying to this question because I think I can add something.</p>
<p>I have the very same problem, on 2 computers now. One is win7 32bit running on E521 Dell at home, the other win7 64bit, running on i7 Dell at work. The problem is as follows:</p>
<p>- I click on an mp3 or movie file. It opens and plays.</p>
<p>- I want another mp3 so I close media player while it is playing. I seems to close correctly.</p>
<p>- I click another file. Then media player does not open, and comes with the "server execution failed" error after 15 or 20 seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- I close that error window immediately and click an mp3 immediately. It opens and plays!</p>
<p>- When I now close media player and click yet another mp3, it hangs again and gives the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here is something interesting:&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I wait 5 seconds after closing media player before I click a new mp3: same problem.</p>
<p>When I wait 15 seconds after closing: it plays! All the time. Repeatedly. No problem. But I need to wait 15 seconds...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fyi: other media player like VLC don't give this error, but I like media player more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the media player reset under "troubleshooting" and it has indeed reset some things, but no difference for the error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping for a solution...</p>

<h2>            Another bulging screen and expanding battery</h2>
                    <p>I just noticed this tonight that the keyboard would not close flat to the screen. At first I thought it was a keyboard cover fault but on closer examination I saw that that screen on the left hand side had become separated from the frame.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device (<span>Surface Pro 4 - 256GB i7 8GB) is still in warranty, unfortunately at this time of night
 in the UK there are no MS reps to chat to, so I will be calling on Saturday in the hope of getting some help.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Anyone else in the UK has had this problem and what was the outcome?</span></p>

            That command only works if Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 came preinstalled on your computer. If you are running a retail copy of Windows 10 or upgraded from a retail copy of Windows 8.1 or Windows 7, it doesn't work.<br />
