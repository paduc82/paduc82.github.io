<h2>            How do I change the color of the toolbar in Microsoft edge internet explorer.</h2>
                    I Just downloaded Microsoft 10 windows and was wondering if I can change the color of the toolbar on the Microsoft edge internet explorer at the top of the page. I know I can change it from light or dark but both options are hard to see and hurt my eyes.
 I also tried to change the color using in the computer settings with the theme but that changed the color of everything I just want to change the toolbar only.

    <title>Tendonitis&#63;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Tendonitis&#63;&#33; </h2>
                    
<p>Well, I'm posting within this forum in search of some kind of wise advice from someone who may or may not have experience with tendonitis. I imagine the majority of those who access this forum are parents of gamers, so it is likely someone will be able to
 help me out. I am 25 years old. Throughout the release of the Xbox One, I've been playing a lot of games. I play a lot of COD and Battlefield, but I recently purchased Killer Instinct. I played it a good while, probably about 6-8 hours. Yeah, I play a lot
 of games. I have never, ever experienced pain in my hands, forearms, or wrists until after I put the controller down and finally let Killer Instinct go. I woke up the next morning with little pain, that is until I picked up my controller and jumped into a
 game of COD. I proceeded to crouch using the right joystick and found that pressing down on the joystick prompted a sharp pain in my forearm. A little pain in the thumb joint, no pain in the wrist, it''s basically all in the forearm. I've done my research
 on various 'what if's' and found it to be inflammation of the tendons/tendonitis. It's been 3 days and I'm still in a good amount of pain. It has always been normal to be a little sore after a long bout with a video game, but that always subsides. I can't
 really go see a doctor, but all they will tell me anyway is to ice it and give it rest. No numbness anywhere in the hand, so it's not CT. Just a little joint pain and pain in the forearm when I press down on the right joystick with my thumb. Is there anything
 I can do? Is this going to heal? I've read story after story about people who suffer with this on and off forever. But I feel that my condition is not as serious as others considering the movement I have in the thumb and the lack of pain in other parts of
 the arm, wrist, and hand. Let me know what you think.&nbsp;<br />
Thanks!</p>

<p>You were playing a fighting game. You deserve the worst kind of pain imaginable.</p>
<p>Seeing a doctor would probably be in your best interests. For playing fighting games, not for your arm, silly.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I'd recommend thinking up a better excuse for how you hurt yourself, unless you're okay with telling friends and family that you injured yourself playing video games.</p>

<p>Well, I appreciate you expressing your personal opinion towards my situation, though it is rather... off. I could point out the games in which you play, such as GTA V/IV, CoD. All of which harbor sociological debate. I was unaware that I had to make an excuse.
 Some people play a lot of video games, and the majority of us have grown up playing video games. I am married, I am in school for game design, and I live a pretty comfortable and productive lifestyle. I resorted to posting in this forum due to the lack of
 knowledge about tendonitis from those that I have spoken with and who I am close to. All and all, it is no big deal. I would appreciate a response from someone who would rather pass knowledge rather than ridicule.

<p>See a doctor if he pain continues. Also, consider taking a break from gaming for a few days if possible. I've had thumb pain in the past, but it was brief and didn't last.

<p>Haven't played a whole lot since the pain started. I guess that's all that I needed. My arms are still pretty stiff and odd feeling, but I think I'll be g2g by the time Titanfall drops. xD</p>

<p>Oh, and I've thought about getting a fight pad for Killer Instinct, but they are pretty expensive right now. Probably not interested enough in the game to drop 200 bucks on it.

<p>You can get a decent fight stick for less than 200.00, unless you're going pro...anyways- Take a few days off. PBFX2 had my forearms hurting after a particularly brutal score griding session (Paranormal...I'm lookin' at you). Took a few days away from it,
 and things got better. Still shows up when I play too much PBFX2 or MvC3. Comparativley speaking, I have an issue with my right shoulder &amp; elbow from surfing too much. It still acts up after a few laps in the pool, and I haven't been on a board in years. =/
 &nbsp;Look into typing stretches, that'll help you strengthen/limber your forearms.</p>

<p>Definitely. Well, still playing KI. Not so much as a bit of stiffness here and there. I keep thinking back to my brother's skating days. I mean, we're only 25, but over the course of our teenage years, he suffered one too many sprained ankles and knee bangs.
 Used to be extremely good at it, now he can't skate at all. It's all RSI issues, imo. I think more people should be aware that they will potentially mess something up in their arms, hands, fingers, by playing for an extended period of time. The more I talk
 to people about it, the more I realize that it's a bigger problem than I even thought. Especially those who are playing in leagues and MLG games. Talked to a guy who used to play a lot of street fighter 4 and recently came into KI. He told me that after so
 many years of playing with a controller, he basically had to pick up a fight stick so that his hands wouldn't hurt. To say the least, he's even a better player now that he uses a fight stick. Last time I used one, I just couldn't stand it. Those were the Street
 fighter days, though. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Sounds like RSI (repetitive strain injury) best thing to do is stop playing video games for a while until the pain and aches subside. Doing the same thing for several hours at a time tends to do that. It is quote common I used to get RSI in my hands, fingers
 and arms when working on a assembly line sorting Apples. It really sucked when I came home and wanted to play a game of Halo to relax. The best thing to do is just relax and let it fix itself.</p>

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Store app. Perform these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search. 
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Store app, it should work fine now. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!       
        </p>

            Hi Lucas
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience, try the following steps below.
<br />
<br />First, try signing out of the Microsoft Store. Click your Profile picture at the top right, click your account then sign out.
<br />
<br />Restart your computer, launch the Microsoft Store app, sign in again, then attempt downloading again. 
<br />
<br />Other things you can try...
<br />
<br />Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete try opening the Store again.
<br />
<br />Also check if the Store works in another user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: wsreset.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.
<br />
<br />Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />Reinstall the Store:
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (Admin) 
<br />At the command prompt, type the following then hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /F /FI "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.
<br />
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.

<p>It sounds as though the downloaded compressed (.rar) file was password protected by the entity that created it. In that case, the password would need to be obtained by you from that entity. Recheck the download site for a password, a hint comment or contact
 info of the entity that uploaded the file to the site.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1) Your subject line has nothing to do with your question. If you have the glass effects, then Aero is running. See:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-is-Windows-Aero" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-is-Windows-Aero</a><br />
<br />
2) You cannot set up a wireless connection to your TV as a display, it has to be physically connected to an external monitor connection on your computer.<br />
<br />
3) You cannot watch TV on your computer unless you have the proper tuner card added on or built-in to the system.<br />
<br />
Please try to confine your issues to a single subject per post with a subject line that matches the question. Different users with differing expertises can then address each of your problems.

<br />
Use whatever scanner software you have to bring in the scan and then save it and attach it like you would any other file to the email.

            Hi
<br />
<br />I'm so sorry you are facing issues! 
<br />
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor Specialist on Microsoft. We are experienced users who assist the Support Staff by helping out fellow users in the community. 
<br />
<br />Could you please share some more details on how it is not working?
<br />You can not launch skype? Or you are getting an error message?
<br />
<br />Looking forward to hearing back from you. 
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week! 
<br />Margarida

            Hi
<br />
<br />That is strange indeed. There may be some privacy setting (on your side or on her side) that need adjustment. To help with that higher level of access is required. 
<br />
<br />May I recommend that a start a live Skype support agent :
<br />- Please click here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/s...</a>
<br />- Select "Privacy and Security" (see image)
<br />- Then click on chat.
<br />
<br />Kind regards
<br />Margarida<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f2435287-7994-4fc6-82d1-82bd34a60227?upload=true" />

<h2>            Wrong accounts overlapped</h2>
                    <p>I think there is a duplicate account OR that someone is using my skype. The names, the contacts, are both odd. I would like someone to review both accounts, and help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to use Skype a lot, but it has been awhile. I found my phone balance and added more, but when I had to sign back in, a different account came up.</p>

<p>If you have a recent backup of your data files then you could try a destructive Factory Restore. Check the Sony FAQ pages for instructions.</p>
<p>If you have no recent backup then you need to get the machine serviced. Tell them that they must salvage your data files before attempting to fix the problem.</p>

<h2>            Modifying File association for existing profiles - without using GPO</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simple enough question. How to I modify file associations remotely on machines which a user profile already exists without using GPOs</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my very specific example :</p>
<p>
</p><p>Newly Imaged windows 10. </p>
<p>User X logs on.</p>
<p>Adobe Acrobat gets deployed to the machine.</p>
<p>How do we get user X that is already logged on to automatically open PDF files with Acrobat? I have already used DISM to import the XML for file association, which works perfectly fine for new users. &nbsp;But already existing users will get the prompt to choose
 which app to use, and having EDGE as the preselected first program will result in users clicking OK for EDGE (users gonna be users...They don't always understand what they are doing)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was very easily done in windows 7 by importing the correct registry entries. Why is this not possible anymore? or am I mistaken? If not, why change something so simple and easy to something that leaves the possibility of error in the hands of the users?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            My Xbox One factory reset on it&#39;s own</h2>
                    I left my console on today and went to do something when I returned I found that I had to put all the information back in like I had just bought it.&nbsp; I had to log back in and also download my games I am still waiting for the first game to load so I don't
 know if I lost all my progress as of yet.&nbsp; I have done some research in the past the "Alpha" program was causing this to happen but I am not a part of this program and I have not had an update since a month prior.&nbsp; Has anyone had issues with this as I have?

<p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/105712c4-b39b-4637-a38c-0e0d367f91de" title="NUCL3AR M3T3OR">NUCL3AR M3T3OR</a>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us in the forums for this question. Sorry to hear that your console factory reset itself mysteriously. If you aren't a part of the Xbox Insiders Preview Program (and your console isn't as well), then this may be a 'one off' occurrence.
 Although, sometimes if there is something wrong going on in the OS or something is corrupt, the console will automatically reset itself out of the blue, which has actually happened to a friend of mine before. No worries though concerning your game progress
 as that would have been saved to your profile in the Cloud if you were connected to the internet and not offline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do know that the Alpha Preview ring had an update go out yesterday, so if you aren't sure that you've been (or your console) unenrolled then you can do so via the Insiders App. &nbsp;<a href="https://news.xbox.com/insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">April
 3rd New Preview Alpha 1904 Update (1904.190402-1745)</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The direct instructions on how to leave the program are detailed in our&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Insider Program FAQ</a> just in case you need them. I'd also recommend
 reporting this via the Insider Hub app anyhow, especially if you've already unenrolled, as that kind of feedback is super important and may also help out other individuals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this helps out!&nbsp;</p>

            Hi there!<br /><br />Many users have been reporting having problems with the new version.<br /><br />Based on customer feedback, Microsoft is extending support for Skype 7 (Skype classic) for some time. <br /><br />You can provide feedback here:<br /><a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype-ideas/filters/my_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype...</a><br /><br />You can see the post detailing this change here <a href="https://blogs.skype.com/news/2018/07/16/upgrade-to-the-latest-version-of-skype-for-desktop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.skype.com/news/2018/07/16/upgrade...</a><br /><br />Since we are being discouraged to suggest downgrading to the classic version but after many advices you still are having troubles, then you can try installing Classic Skype here <a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />The first thing that i will check is a left click on the 3 dots (top left on Skype) then settings and make sure that incoming calls is enabled.
<br />
<br />Another thing that you can check is an option that says "Allow calls from anyone" make sure that is enabled.
<br />
<br />If nothing works, go to privacy settings &gt; manage how people find me on skype and double check there if that's the email/number that your son is trying to reach you.
<br />
<br />Regards.

            Press Windows Key+X 
<br />Click Windows Powershell (Admin) 
<br />
<br />Enter the following command then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.SkypeApp | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />  Open start menu
<br />    Type in "powershell" 
<br />    Right click on "Windows PowerShell"

<br />
<br />Then paste the following command
<br />
<br />get-appxpackage -AllUsers Microsoft.SkypeApp | foreach { Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml" }
<br />
<br />Press Enter
<br />
<br />After the install process finishes, you have the Windows 10 Skype app back
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report,then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

                    <span><span>So the audio coming through both the built in speakers and my headphones sound terrible
 and sort of have an echo effect. I know for a fact that it is not a hardware issue because those headphones sound perfectly fine with my phone. Also I have gotten the audio coming through my headphones to sound perfectly fine with this laptop (although there
 was a slight static noise in the background) as well as the built in speakers, but it went back to sounding awful when I restarted to see if it would last. I noticed that in device manager (when the speakers sounded good) under sound video and game controllers
 there was "High Definition Audio Device" listed instead of Realtek which is what is usually there. Once I restarted, the Realtek driver was back, and the audio was back to sounding garbage. Then I went to control panel - View advanced system settings - Hardware
 - Device Installation settings and selected no. Then I clicked on "update driver" and manually selected "High Definition Audio Device Version 10.0.17763.1 [9/14/2018]" and now the High Definition Audio Device driver is staying there even when I restart, but
 the volume thing in the task bar has a red x, and when I hover over it says "No speakers or headphones are plugged in."</span></span>

            Hi BC.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />First try the steps here:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/setting-your-headset-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/setting-your-hea...</a>
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Autoplay to look for the device and change the default behavior in it's Dropdown Menu.
<br /> 
<br />Right click Volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, Open Sound Settings, in dropdown menus at top make sure Headphones are selected.
<br />
<br />If not choose Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Also try the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Go to the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose Sound controller device, on Driver tab choose Roll back or Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Do the same for the headset device and/or it's microphone.
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC or Device maker's Support downloads web page. While there also check that the Chipset, BIOS, Display, USB, Network and all other drivers are the most current.
<br />
<br />Sometimes it helps to unpair or disconnect all other Bluetooth devices from the PC in Bluetooth settings, then try again to connect the headset.
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  
<br /><a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.  
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki</a>...
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-</a>...
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi bluecourts
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model? Dell makes several models of the XPS 15.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.

<div style="text-align: left">
<p>When you have a Dell system, using the entire model number may help.&nbsp; But the High Definition Audio device is the basic Windows driver.&nbsp; You should be running the latest drivers Dell supplies for that system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be a Realtek audio device which also installs the Waves Maxx Audio which is used to select a device you plug in and change mixer settings.&nbsp; Once you install the driver, check to see if you get the popup after plugging in a Headset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your system is older than a few years, it may work differently.</p>

<p>I have an XPS 15 9570 with an i7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for answering. So I have actually done this a few times. I went to Dell's website and downloaded the latest Realtek driver for my computer. The installer uninstalled the existing Realtek drivers first and had me reboot. When it restarted, I clicked
 on the sound icon in the task bar and it said High Definition Audio Device and the audio sounded significantly louder and better then it did before on both headphones/speakers. Then the installer opened again and had me restart again to reinstall the Realtek
 drivers and now the audio is back to sounding bad. So I would much rather use the High Definition Audio Device driver because for some reason on my PC the Realtek sounds pretty awful. But I am confused because when I tried to manually use that driver, it didn't
 work</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, I have only used Windows for about a year (I used Windows 10 on an iMac for 11 months with bootcamp, and only got this laptop 3 weeks ago) so I really don't know what I am talking about.</p>

<p>The audio driver for the Realtek version 6.0.1.8603.&nbsp; A driver install may give you options but removing the old version is probably best.&nbsp; It will normally remove the old version, reboot then install the new version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sound like you are not seeing the Realtek audio in the Device Manager like I show below.&nbsp; Did you install the Waves Maxx audio driver also since it may not be necessary.&nbsp; Are all other drivers updated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not know how to open the Device Manager, right click the Windows and select from the menu.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are receiving this error message and I will be happy to answer your query. However, let me ask you a few questions;</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you able to boot the device&nbsp;to desktop?</li><li>Did you upgrade to Windows 8.1 from Windows 8 through Windows Store?</li><li>Do you remember making any specific change in the computer prior to the issue?</li><li>Do you have installation media for Windows 8.1?</li></ol>
<p>This issue can be caused due corrupted/missing system files. I would suggest you to try the methods below and check the status.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> First of all let's try the restore the system to earlier point in time when it was working fine.</p>
To restore your PC to an earlier point in time:
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap
<span><strong>Search</strong></span>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<span><strong>Search</strong></span>.)</span> </p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter <span><strong>Control </strong><strong>Panel</strong></span> in the search box, and tap or click
<span><strong>Control</strong> <strong>Panel</strong></span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter <span><strong>Recovery</strong></span> in the Control Panel search box, and then tap or click
<span><strong>Recovery</strong></span>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span><strong>Open</strong> <strong>System</strong>
<strong>Restore</strong></span>, and then follow the instructions. </p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> <span>
<em>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you have installed after that date are removed.</em><br />
<br />
</span><strong>Method 2:</strong> If the system restore does not fix the issue, I would suggest you to perform Refresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To refresh your PC:</strong></p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap
<span><strong>Settings</strong></span>, and then tap <span>
<strong>Change</strong> <strong>PC</strong> <strong>settings</strong></span>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, click
<span><strong>Settings</strong></span>, and then click <span>
<strong>Change</strong> <strong>PC</strong> <strong>settings</strong></span>.)</span>
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span><strong>Update</strong> <strong>
and</strong> <strong>recovery</strong></span>, and then tap or click <span>
<strong>Recovery</strong></span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Under <span><strong>Refresh</strong> <strong>your</strong>
<strong>PC </strong><strong>without</strong> <strong>affecting</strong> <strong>your</strong>
<strong>files</strong></span>, tap or click <span><strong>Get</strong>
<strong>started</strong></span>. </p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>If you upgraded your PC from <span>
Windows&nbsp;8</span> to <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span> and your PC has a <span>
Windows&nbsp;8</span> recovery partition, refreshing your PC will restore <span>
Windows&nbsp;8</span>. You’ll need to upgrade to <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span> after the refresh has finished.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Warning:</strong> </span><em>Apps you installed from websites and DVDs will be removed. Apps that came with your PC and apps you installed from the Windows Store will be reinstalled. Windows puts a list of removed apps on your desktop after
 refreshing your PC. </em><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

<p>The games should appear in your My Games section of your xbox dashboard.</p>
<p>Let me know if you require more details on where it is and i'll give a detailed walk through once i get home to double check it. I don't remember where it is reliably enough to put it down on paper at the moment.</p>

<p>Well I have looked in "My Games" and the only thing there is 4 arcade games that I guess are free or something because I have not downloaded them.</p>

<p>I did last night - turned off the console to see if I could see them this morning - no dice. &nbsp;Not in "My games" - show up as downloded but the only option I have it to re download them or delete them. &nbsp;These were not expensive games but I did download them
 to the HD to play and cannot do that. &nbsp;I am just baffled as to why.</p>
<p>I see one of the games I downloaded weeks ago now finally says Play when I got to my download history. &nbsp;I hit play and this message shows up:</p>
<p>"to use this item, play the game it was downloaded for". &nbsp;then I have the option of OK and it goes right back to Play, Download Again or Cancel. &nbsp;This is just too frustrating.</p>

<p>Sounds like that would be a game add-on and not a game itself. What are you trying to play?</p>

<p>Well, You may be right about the addon - although it does not list it as an addon. &nbsp;I will work on this and get it figured out. &nbsp;I am not a techno idiot but don't have a lot of experience with xbox 360 - had it a year and have never really played with it
 - funny how that happens - just no time. &nbsp;I'll get it figured out but if I don't, I will certainly be back asking questions when I KNOW for sure I have downloaded the actual game. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for trying to help - appreciate it.</p>
