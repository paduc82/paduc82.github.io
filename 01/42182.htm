            <p>After installing my HP Photosmart 7510 on my new Windows 8 computer in local&nbsp;wireless network mode,&nbsp;all seemed okay at first, but it would not print.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike other older devices, Photsmart 7510 would not "take" or run when telling Windows 8&nbsp;to operate the
 device as&nbsp;in a previous version.&nbsp;&nbsp;As well&nbsp;"Troubleshoot" would not fix the problem.&nbsp; The solution was to get windows to search for a new print driver.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Windows 8, move mouse to right side of desktop screen and select SEARCH when the hidden menus pop up.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Type in "Device Manager" and select SETTINGS icon.&nbsp; In the SETTINGS screen which appears to the left, select DEVICE MANAGER.&nbsp;&nbsp; A long list of devices appears.&nbsp;&nbsp; Scroll down to PRINTERS and select HP Photosmart 7510 series Class Driver.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right Click on this
 line and select UPDATE DRIVER SOFTWARE.&nbsp; On the next screen select SEARCH AUTOMATICALLY FOR UPDATED DRIVER SOFTWARE.&nbsp;&nbsp; A list of drivers appears with the second one auto-highlighted saying HP Photosmart 7510 ---- do not use this, it does not "take" or work.&nbsp;
 Select the first in the list,&nbsp; "HP Photosmart 7510 series Class Driver ..."&nbsp;&nbsp; This one installed successfully and made my HP Photosmart 7510 printer work just fine.</p>

    <title>windows experience rating restarts pc - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            windows experience rating restarts pc</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
brief history:-<br />
My pc was having some problems including random restarts, somethings including bad sectors and a T.E.C of April 2013 and one instance of total failure to even see there was a HDD present led me to believe I had imminent hard drive failure, I bought a new harddrive
 and used the pc's restore disks to install everything fresh including the OS Vista Home Premium.
<br />
<br />
Main Issue:-<br />
Anyway during the install at the very end whilst doing performance check the PC restarted unexpectedly, after restarting it seemed to skip this step of the installation and started fine. The PC worked much much better but when I tried the WEI rating it restarted
 at CPU assessment, when I look in winsat the test ends at<br />
<br />
winsat\main.cpp:1161: &gt; Running Assessment: cpu '-encryption2'<br />
<br />
nothing appears after this point.<br />
I followed some posts on here and did a sfc scan I think its called- nothing was wrong except for that thing it tells you to ignore umm I forget damn it don't ask me to do it again I went through all the steps and it said it was a common error that was wrong
 something to do with an ini misreading. <br />
<br />
Anyway during all this I tried restoring AGAIN and the exact same happened the restart during the install in exact same spot, have now updated everything and anything I can find and still the same happens during the WEI, it also very randomnly and very occasionally
 restarts during some youtube videos but with other youtube videos it is fine.<br />
I have done stress testing with some online thing that tests your CPUs through silverlight it had all 4 cores running at 99% and didn't fail or restart.<br />
I also ran 3dMark benchmark tests and it was fine. <br />
I want to pull out my hair!<br />
Please help :)<br />
<br />
ps, I have looked at perhaps updating BIOS as a possible fix (scares me) but my motherboard is listed as 'DIXONS G31MX Series' and I can find no support whatsoever for this motherboard, I am awaiting 'knowhow' [formerly 'thetechguys' formerly 'pcservicecall'
 (Philips the pc manufacturer refers me to pcservicecall) (sighs)] to get back to me on why they are so useless!<br />
<br />
pps. I read somewhere someone with a similar issue fixed it by turning off some 'green' setting in their BIOS it was GPU for CPU but I do not have the same setting to try it.&nbsp; I have tried changing a couple of things in the BIOS to no avail such as EIST (forget
 what it stands for). As the pc is running so damn well now except for these specfic problems I can't help feel there is some kind of simple explanation rather than its a hardware problem as surely some of my games would cause restarts as well instead of jsut
 the WEI and a few youtube videos. Before I go buy more new hardware I really want to check it isn't a vista specific problem or something fixable within the BIOS etc thoroughly.<br />
<br />
pps some system details<br />

            Hi, thanks very much for the reply, I should of said I'd tried both these steps before but it didn't hurt to retry again.
<br />
<br />
Method 1: There are no xml files or any files in the datastore, never has been any there since I restored pc I'm not sure about before this. (I unhid hidden files and dbl checked) There are 2 old runs showing from 2006 &amp; 2008 in the winsat log if that makes
 any difference. I'll post whole log below in code box. (I'm surprised the old outputs 06/08 remain even after restore- they were pre buying the pc so must be from during build I presume)<br />
<br />
Method 2: the admin cmd instruction winsat formal ran at first then restarted pc, the last line I saw before that was the first - encryption line, will see if that is where it ended in log below.<br />
<br />

    <title>Right speaker distortion - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beastthsindstry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Right speaker distortion</h2>
                    First off, I'd like to say the Surface is wonderful, and I have no regrets traveling as far as I did to get one. I'd even put together a review for it (<a href="http://verytechnical.wordpress.com/2012/10/29/microsoft-surface-review-is-it-truly-the-best-of-both-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MY
 MICROSOFT SURFACE REVIEW</a>) which was very positive, and I was all too happy to ditch the iPad and my Android tablets as this would supplement all the needs they satisfied (and then some)...
<div><br />
</div>
<div>... but I seem to be absolutely doomed to keep getting Microsoft Surfaces with hardware problems - which mentally has me thinking that the Surface experience itself is synonymous with hardware problems. My first one came packed with one solid line of messed
 up corrupt pixels, and as soon as I tried to explore the media side of things, I'd noticed that the right speaker crackles with this sound of distortion as if it were blown. Sometimes it takes about 20 seconds to get into full bloom and when it does, it's
 completely unbearable.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I think something's loose in there, because when I apply compressed air to the right speaker, it'll give me distortion-free audio for about 8 seconds before it starts being problematic again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any advice that can be given short of having to have this replaced <i>again</i>&nbsp;potentially being without my tablet for a week? I'm just ready to quit running into hardware issues so I can fully enjoy the Surface experience.</div>
</div>
                </div>

            Many laptops have a hardware switch or a function key [F key] that turns on or turns off the wireless hardware. Perhaps your wireless hardware is turned off. Check your Users Manual, see
<strong>page 7 item 18</strong> for the location,&nbsp;or the Dell support pages for help.<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t Set DEFAULT Printer using Windows 8</h2>
                    I have installed the Network &nbsp;device printer, which is attached to another computer and also has a direct network connection to the local sub-net.&nbsp; When I am on the system as myself, I can do what I want.&nbsp; But, when my wife is logged on then she cannot
 set the device to default.&nbsp; In fact the device does not even show for&nbsp; her in WORD.&nbsp; When you check devices and the look at the printers, the device is there.&nbsp; When you Right click the printer, the list is very short and does not include "Set As Default Printer".&nbsp;
 She can even look at the print queue.&nbsp; Both her and myself are the PC Administrators.&nbsp; So, she should have the rights to do what she needs to do.&nbsp; Please help me figure out what is wrong&nbsp;using Windows 8.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Emmett,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for choosing Windows 8 and for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have mentioned that it is not possible to set the printer as default printer from your wife’s account even though she is an administrator and also that the printer is not even listed when you try to print from certain programs like Word. We’ll help you
 with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a few questions first, to get a clear picture of the issue;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>What is the make and model of the printer?</p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Are you able to set the printer as the default from your user account?</p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Are you able to use the printer in other programs (like browser) except Word on your wife’s account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>It appears that the issue is caused due to some incorrect permission settings or some network settings. I would suggest you to try these steps and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the built-in Printer troubleshooter to fix any errors with the printer settings. Refer these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press Windows key +X, select Control panel</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on troubleshooting and click on the view all option on the left panel</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Run the Printer troubleshooter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Change permissions</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check if the user account has permission to print and manage the printer. Refer these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press Windows key +C, select control panel</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Under Hardware and devices, select view devices and printers</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Locate your printer and right click
</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on the Printer properties from the menu and select security tab</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Select your Wife’s user account name from the list of user accounts</p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Make sure that all the check boxes against the permissions are marked as “Allow”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the permission is already set as “allow”, then this could be a network setting issue. Check if your Wife’s account is configured correctly to the network and check the network options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3: Re-install the printer</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the permission settings and the network settings are set correctly and yet you are facing this issue, I would suggest uninstall and re-install the printer and check. You can right click on the printer icon from the devices and printers window, right click
 and select “remove this device”. Refer this link to install the printer again:</p>

            The device manufacturer is always the best place to start when you're having hardware problems.&nbsp; Look at the troubleshooting and user guides on
<a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/hp-deskjet-3600-printer-series/304534/model/375448/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Not only the information below but if I check for Updates it will continually look for Updates and not stop. I think this started after I tried to install the Microsoft .Net Framework 4 Client Profile update. Another issue with this is do you need this for
 a personal computer, that is 1 computer? Also the Update shows up as failed 2 times in my installed updates. &nbsp;So I was looking for an answer for this and it seems the fix for the update problem requires you to have SP1 for Windows 7. So either way I think
 I need to know what the error code indicates if anybody recognizes it.&nbsp;<br />

            Okay so after changing the Update setting to Never Install or Download Updates the Update for Microsoft .Net Framework 4 Client Profile has been canceled. &nbsp;Since doing that and resetting Updates to Ask first to Download I got an Update Agent Update which
 was successful. Still no Updates yet even though my Belarc Advisor says I need over 100 Security Updates missing? Now what?&nbsp;

Well here is the fix I found for the Windows Update problem.&nbsp;
<p>
Windows Update is taking an unusually long time to scan and install updates

Symptoms

<div>

<div>
Consider the following scenario:
<ul>
<li>You do a clean installation of Windows 7 or you have not checked for updates for a long time.</li><li>You try to install updates for Windows 7 from Windows Update.</li></ul>
<br />
In this scenario, you may experience a long delay identifying and retrieving updates from the Windows Update service.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
Cause
<div style="margin-left: auto">
<div style="margin-left: -24px">
<div>
<div>
<div>
This issue occurs because the latest updates for the Windows Update service&nbsp;aren't installed.</div>

    <title>unable to login using fingerprint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lee_j  say:</h3>
<h2>            unable to login using fingerprint</h2>
                    <p>Hi all<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have a lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 2 (ThinkPad X1 Carbon -Type 20A7, 20A8), windows 8.1 Pro. I am required by company to add the following local group policy as shown below<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Interactive logon: Do not display last user name . The options available are enable and disable<br />
<br />
If the option disabled is selected, I am able to login with fingerprint. The login with fingerprint icon appears with the user profile. If the option is enabled, I am unable to login with fingerprint. I&nbsp; will not be able to login even if I try to use the fingerprint
 device<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As you can tell by now, I have the latest driver from the Lenovo website. Device shows that biometric device has been installed. I tried to register the fingerprints in the following order and tried to log-on with the policy disabled first. I will be able
 to log-on with fingerprint. But if I enable the policy, I will not be able to log-on with fingerprint.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1) First, I used the default windows fingerprint registration method as demonstrated &nbsp; http://www.hecticgeek.com/2014/10/validity-sensor-5011-windows-8-1/<br />
</p>
<p>2) Next, I uninstalled the driver. I then installed the latest Lenovo Fingerprint Manager Pro (with driver) and tried to register fingerprint. Same result<br />
</p>
<p>3) Next, I combined Lenovo Fingerprint Manager Pro by installing the latest Thinkvantage Password manager 4.7. Same result<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any help, solutions or ideas? Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Johnny</p>

            <p>Hi Johnny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is your computer connected to a domain network?</p>

    <title>Fixed IP addresses on Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> questor-13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fixed IP addresses on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have a network which contains a number of XP and&nbsp;win98 machines which play just fine together.&nbsp; They have fixed IP addresses.</p>
<p>I would like the new Windows 8.1 machine to have a fixed IP address, but have not been able to get this function to work.</p>
<p>I have tried the un-documented&nbsp; "netsh int ip reset" command, but this only erases the fixed IP address and restores DHCP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's too bad that&nbsp;the "Support:Repair" button was removed from the "Local Area Connection Status" window.&nbsp; This button worked every time the IP address had to be change in XP when setting up experimental devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What did this button do, and can the same procedure be used to fix Windows 8.1 ??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I've starting seeing the same issue in our library. Some times office repair works some times it doesn't. But I can't figure out what's causing this error.&nbsp;

            <p>Some follow up:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to upgrade from windows 8.0 to windows 10 I was not able to find a method or link that would complete the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not knowing if there was a more efficient way I was able to find a link after boot to upgrade windows 8.0 to 8.1: &nbsp;(Update to windows 8.1 for free). &nbsp;Once windows 8.1 was installed I rebooted and then found a link to upgrade to windows 10.0. &nbsp;I upgrade to
 the 64 bit version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MediaCreationTools64.exe was downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took about an hour and then nothing opened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was no switch to windows 10 and no message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A reboot was performed and it displayed:</p>
<p>Keep your PC on until this is done.</p>

<p>Don't turn your computer off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it automatically rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again it displayed:</p>
<p>Working on your updates.</p>
<p>__% complete</p>
<p>Don't turn your computer off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then checking the desktop there was no change from windows 8.1. &nbsp;Windows 10 failed to be installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I downloaded&nbsp;MediaCreationTools64.exe again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It opened:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 setup</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you want to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>upgrade this pc was the default and next was clicked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it displayed downloading windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>feel free to keep using your pc</p>
<p>
</p><p>progress __%</p>
<p>
</p><p>How come it did not reboot to windows 10 the first time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do if it remains on windows 8.1 and does not reboot to windows 10.0?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This computer came with pre-installed windows 8.0 and had multiple restoration and multiple re-instillation of the windows 8.0 operating system using disks in the optical drive.</p>

            On this computer I was finally able to upgrade 8.0 to 8.1 and then upgrade from 8.1 to window 10. &nbsp;In order to do the upgrade to 10 it required Microsoft remote access and modifications of the software. &nbsp;Several hours later I was able to boot to windows
 10. &nbsp;According to the person in the remote access it was not necessary to start with 8.1 to get the free upgrade to windows 10. &nbsp;This individual did not provide information on the findings or modifications as their aim was to upgrade to windows 10 (partner.support.services.microsoft.com
 chat with location in the Philippines.)

<h2>            Is it safe to set a service I&#39;m unsure if it&#39;s needed to manual&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm vaguely recalling something from XP about setting services that you are unsure if they are needed or not to "manual", and I'm wondering if I can screw up the system by accidentally setting the wrong service to "manual" instead of automatic the way I
 can by disabling them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several services that I'm not sure that I need at all, and a few that I know I'll only need 1/2 the time, depending on where I'm using the laptop. I'm leaving those few set to automatic since it's impossible to predict when those time are and what
 is needed depends on my location.</p>
<p>Anyways, this is Vista Home Premium on a laptop with only 1gb of RAM, so turning off whatever I don't absolutely need is vital. Is it safe to set everything to "manual" for instance?</p>
<p>If not, what absolutely has to be set to "automatic"?</p>
<p>I'm looking at these two sites for guidance on what can be turned off:</p>

<div>You'll have to try and see what happens. Some programs will automatically </div>
<div>start a service set to manual when it needs it. Other programs only look for</div>
<div>a running service and so don't start the service if it's not running </div>
<div>(Windows Defender is an example).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For instance, ITunes has 4 or 5 services. Itunes will autostart all but one </div>
<div>of them (the Bonjour service). So you can set all the services with ITunes </div>
<div>in the name to manual. But the bonjour service needs to be automatic (or you</div>
<div>need to start it manually).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>DO NOT set everything to manual.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Use those sites to guide you.</div>
