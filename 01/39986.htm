<h2>            Computer freezes on boot screen if I don&#39;t reset BIOS</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a computer that freezes on the boot screen. It can be fixed by resetting the BIOS, but the fix is only temporary. Any idea what the problem might be or what I could do to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is a Toshiba Satellite C50-B-1C4 running Windows 10 with the creators update.</p>

<p>Hello Adrian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a lot of possible reasons that caused your PC to behave like this. One of these could be related to your software being corrupted or it could also be related to a hardware issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to come up with an effective resolution, we'd like to know more of your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any changes to your settings prior to this? If so, can you tell us about it?</li><li>Did you recently install any software or updates?</li><li>When did the issue start happening?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes disconnecting all the worked USB dongles do the trick. <em>USB dongle
</em>means the device which is connected to your computer with a USB cable including blue tooth, SD card readers, flash drive, wireless mouse dongle, and more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that did not change anything, boot your device in <em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17419/windows-7-advanced-startup-options-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a></em>&nbsp;with Networking. This
 will starts Windows in safe mode and includes the network drivers and services needed to access the Internet or other computers on your network. Once your device is in safe mode, reboot to normal mode and see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If starting your PC in safe mode did not work, we suggest that you disable fast startup. Here is how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>T</span><span>ype&nbsp;</span><strong>power option&nbsp;</strong><span>in the search box from Start, then click&nbsp;</span><strong>Power &amp; sleep settings&nbsp;</strong>from the top of the result<span>.</span></li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Additional power settings</strong>.</li><li><span>Click&nbsp;</span><strong>Choose what the power button does</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>Click&nbsp;</span><strong>Change settings that are currently unavailable</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>Untick&nbsp;</span><strong>Turn on fast startup (recommended)</strong>.&nbsp;<span>Then Click&nbsp;</span><strong>Save Changes</strong><span>.</span></li><li>Reboot your Windows 10 into the normal mode to see if it succeeds.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>We also recommend updating your device drivers. </span>This problem can also be caused by an outdated, incorrect or corrupt system driver. You should verify that all your devices have the right driver, and update those that don’t.To do this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Start</strong> button, type<strong> Device Manager</strong>, and select it from the list of results.</li><li>Expand one of the categories to find the name of your device, then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select
<strong>Update Driver</strong>. For graphics cards,&nbsp;expand the&nbsp;<strong>Display adapters</strong> category, right-click your graphics card and select
<strong>Update Driver</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>.</li><li>If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;these steps don't work,&nbsp;try reinstalling the driver:&nbsp;Open <strong>Device Manager</strong>, right-click (or tap and hold)&nbsp;the name of the device, and select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>. Restart your PC and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Update us with the result so we can further assist you.</p>

<p>Actually, provided no Achievements have been earned, a game can be removed from your play history.&nbsp; I'm not in-front of my console right now, but I recall it being under the Xbox Guide and viewing Achievements.&nbsp; As you're scrolling up and down through the
 list, a game with no Achievements will show the option to remove it by pressing one of the face buttons.</p>

<h3> draconis onyx  say:</h3>
<h2>            . Background downloads not working 360</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;Hey, my 360 is having issues where the background downloading doesn't seem to work anymore. I have tried downloading many different things and none of them will download even though I've checked and double checked my settings. All as they should be.</p>
<p>The latest download is Games with Gold: Dishonoured and before that was Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare.</p>
<p>I'm unsure of what to do and could really use some detailed answers besides: Go to settings &gt; console &gt;&nbsp;startup and shutdown&nbsp;&gt; background downloads &gt; on.</p>
<p>I've tried re-setting and other methods. I just want to save electric and watch TV while it does it's intended job.</p>
<p>Thanks for any assistance.</p>

                    <p>I downloaded and installed a font, and it is showing up in my fonts directory and in all my programs, but it always displays as the program's default font. Tried closing and re-opening programs, uninstalling and reinstalling the font, etc. I don't think
 it's a problem with the font file, as I know other people have used it.<br />

            <p>Hi Alison,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the font is not getting applied for the programs on the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if you can provide the following information related to the issue:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which is the program that you are using on the computer (on which fonts are applied)? Is the issue specific for this program?</li><li>Which is the font that you are trying to apply for the program? Is it a true type or a post type font?</li></ol>
<p>If you haven’t tried, check if you are able to change font for a different program. Refer to the link to do so:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows7/change-your-font-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows7/change-your-font-settings</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you have installed a TrueType font with exactly the same name as a PostScript font on the same computer, Windows won't know which one to access, which could result in a font type being altered. To avoid this, don't install different types of fonts
 with the same name. </p>
<p>
<span>Please let us know the status of this issue.

            <p>Hi Alison,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This specific font work with Microsoft Excel. That means Windows is able to use it. But, as said earlier, the font is not getting applied for specific programs such as GIMP or Picmonkey.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are able to apply other fonts and the issue is specific to this font, you may contact the font author and check if this applies for the list of programs that you are using or facing issues with.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please feel free to let us know if you need any other assistance on Windows. </p>

<p>
</p><p>I am trying to setup my Microsoft account again after I removed it due to a corrupt profile; during the removal procedure I elected to keep files and settings.&nbsp; I logged in with an administrator account and&nbsp;created a new local account successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I try to switch it to an online account in "Settings, Accounts, Sign in with a Microsoft account instead", I receive an error message after typing in all my Microsoft credentials.&nbsp; "Oops - something went wrong. Whatever happened, it was probably
 our fault.&nbsp; Please try again".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the Microsoft Account trouble shooter app, which reports no errors.&nbsp; Any help would be most appreciated.</p>

            <p>I am having this exact problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen others report this problem elsewhere on the internet as well. There is not solution documented.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed the instructions and still no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running the Microsoft Account troubleshooter is of no use since this problems relates to converting one's local account to a Microsoft Account and the troubleshooter diagnoses problems with a Microsoft Account. As is obvious, if one cannot convert the local
 account to a Microsoft account then how is one to diagnose a problem with the MS account when, on the computer in question one does not exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to convert other accounts on the same machine without issue. The account that will not convert is in use without issue on another windows 8.1 device, as well as a windows phone device. I highly doubt there is an issue with the account it's self.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the account I am attempting to convert is the primary user. I am unwilling to delete the account and "start over" as there are settings, configurations, etc that would be lost and too time consuming to re-create.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can also tell you, that, as the primary user on this system, this account had, at one time used Windows Live Mail, and the other products as well, (Writer, Messenger, etc). This user also has Outlook and the rest of Office 2013 installed and actively in
 use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other users that were successfully converted never had any of these other things configured on this device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the future, more useful messages for troubleshooting the problem would be appreciated, yet MS doesn't seem fit to include the reason why "something went wrong".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is quite irritating!</p>

            You probably shouldn't delete your bluetooth driver. You should probably turn your bluetooth radio off until you need it. You should have some way of turning it on or off with a function key combination.<br />
<br />
If you can't turn it off using function keys, turn it off using your bluetooth software. Check your vendors support page on other ways to turn the radio off when you're not using it.<br />
<br />
Bluetooth comes in handy when you want to sync your cell phone or other device.<br />

<h2>            &#34;Continue on PC&#34; doesn&#39;t semd the link to my PC</h2>
                    <p>Hello there</p>
<p>I have been enjoying the "continue on pc" featire for quite sometime, but then all of a sudden two months ago it stopped working. I thought that it might be an updated that got something wrong with this part of the app, but nothing was fixed. I tried to
 uninstall reinstall it on my phone, i also made sure that i have the most recent update of the app on my pc ,but nothing helps. What happens exactly is, i am in a website for example, i click share and then continue on my pc, my phone sends this small messege
 saying "Sent! Check pc", but then it never opens on my pc! No matter how long do i wait, or try it over and over.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            I have tried both, but no luck. I can not pin point where the problem is, tthink that it is with my pc though, because my phone seem to be seeing my pc no probelm ajd even says "sent! Please check your pc", but my pc doesn't recieve it. I can not uninstall
 the app and reinstall it on my pc to be sure though

            <p>I tried what you suggested and it did not help. &nbsp;I can only find the pictures if I open motion picture browser. They were in live photo gallery before. It always had a drop down menu to click and it would let you click a folder or all photos and videos.
 &nbsp;I have no idea why it doesn`t now.</p>
<p>I thank you for trying to help me.</p>

    <title>How do I remove Forza Horizon 3 from my hard drive after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thrash daddy  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I remove Forza Horizon 3 from my hard drive after uninstall&#63;</h2>
                    &nbsp; I got a refund for the ultimate edition and uninstalled the game afterwards. My computer is showing it as uninstalled but it's still in my WindowsApps folder taking 49.2 GB of space. When I try and delete it I receive a "do not have permission" prompt.
 I don't know how to get the game off my computer and I'd rather use the space for something else. Any help would be appreciated!

            <p>It happened to me too before with my Gears of War. I was able to totally remove it by using Revo + CCleaner. You can just use the portable ones so no hassle of uninstalling it afterwards.</p>

<p>
</p><p>For CCleaner, I lost my link on my bookmarks. Just download one on the net.</p>

</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

    <title>Deleted Office 2.8 folder in windows in registry editor. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bmelecio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleted Office 2.8 folder in windows in registry editor.</h2>
                    <p>Long story short, I was unable to do a certain action in word 2013 so I went on the forums and found my solution. I deleted&nbsp;<strong>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\TypeLib\{2DF8D04C-5BFA-101B-BDE5-00AA0044DE52}\2.8] @="Microsoft Office 16.0 Object Library"&nbsp;</strong>off
 of windows registry but this did not fix my problem. So I backed up the registry and then completely deleted the 2.8 folder and that fixed my problem. Now my question is, will this affect my pc in anyway? I have the rest of the 2.8 folder backed up but not&nbsp;<strong>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\TypeLib\{2DF8D04C-5BFA-101B-BDE5-00AA0044DE52}\2.8]
 @="Microsoft Office 16.0 Object Library"&nbsp;</strong>will this be a problem down the line?</p>

            You are very welcome, you just have to go in the registry to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\TypeLib\{2DF8D04C-5BFA-101B-BDE5-00AA0044DE52}\2.8, and when you are there on the right side make a right click, click new and add a Dword registry with the same values.

            Yes you can make it with the same values, but if you deleted the registry and you did not take a screenshot of those values there is not like a trash bin for the registrys, if you use the name as a dword registry and add 1 i think you should be fine, usually 1 is for enable a registry and 0 to disable it.

            Oh ok, thanks. so you said I should be fine, right? or should i do a system restore/fresh start and backup that folder just in case? I know the folder belongs to office 16 and I don’t use it, but it came downloaded when I bought my laptop (not the full
 version) so I feel like it wont be a problem. Something with the 2016 version was preventing me from doing tasks in 2013 so I had to delete that registry. If I ever upgrade to 2016 those registry keys would just get reinstalled when 2016 is installed, correct?&nbsp;

            Yes the folder should be there again if you install Office 2016, but just in case is not a bad idea the restore/refresh and then backup the folder.

<h2>            I updated my drivers on Windows 10 and now nothing seems to work</h2>
                    I'm using a Windows 10 64-bit. A few weeks ago I updated my AMD drivers and when I rebooted my computer, things just totally changed. It logs in, but it will only log me in on a temporary account. I tried fixing this by creating a local account instead
 of using my Microsoft login, same thing. None of my apps will start and I get an error message. I figured one of my driver files was corrupted, so I have tried uninstalling the drivers, running SFC command, and even restoring my laptop (including in Safe Mode)
 and nothing will work. I always get an error message saying it can't perform any of those. The SFC command says "Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation". When I go to uninstall the drivers I get a message that says "Windows Install
 Service could not be accessed. This can occur if the Windows Installer is not correctly installed", but I did check and it is running. I'm just totally confused and lost about the whole thing. Does anyone know what I could t

            <p>When I went to do this, the only restore point that I could select was yesterday. There wasn't one available to select before the update (which is also weird?), but I thought I would try it anyways to see if it would work.&nbsp; It said:</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Restore did not complete successfully. Your computer's system files and settings were not changed.<br />
Details:<br />
System Restore failed to extract the original copy of the directory from the restore point.<br />
Source: %ProgramFiles%\WindowsApps<br />
Destination: AppxStaging<br />
The restore point was damaged or was deleted during the restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after that happened I tried it again, but this time logging in with my Microsoft account, which was what I used before it kept telling me that it could only log me in on a temporary account, and there still wasn't a restore point earlier than yesterday
 to select.</p>

            <p>I'm pretty sure it was just the graphics card I updated, but I might be wrong on that since it was a while ago.It was installed through AMD Catalyst. I don't have a factory restore of a win10 install media. I use Avast Antivirus and it uses UEFI. I'm not
 sure what the driver version was before, and I did try AMD's clean tool to try to remove it but I just got an error that Windows Install service couldn't be accessed to remove them.

            <p>Virtualization should be turned on in the bios.</p>
<p>on the clean up image error, I found this at&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://www.eightforums.com/performance-maintenance/36366-error-87-online-cleanup-image-restorehealth-option.html</p>
<p>gives some options to running the command.</p>
<p>Windows installer&nbsp;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/cc185688(v=vs.85).aspx</p>
<p>I would try to turn on virtualization in the bios first, thencheck &nbsp;the widows installer (services) windows installer, &nbsp;last download operating system update from here&nbsp;<br />
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>try the first top option update now, if that fails download media creation tool, select option 2 so the iso can be burned to a usb or dvd.</p>
<p>? is the bios strictly uefi or hybrid ? good option to write down current bios settings before making changes. &nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40966a99-a8c5-4d64-9b35-c6b4eefe6c2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/40966a99-a8c5-4d64-9b35-c6b4eefe6c2d" /></a></p>

<p>Can you access the catalyst software from the tray icon or right click on desktop, run from there ?</p>
<p>Hp update software can cause issues on windows based computers, especially if the device was updated from a previous version of windows.</p>
<p>Try to find a windows 10 compatible driver from the HP product page for the system and install that version.</p>
<p>If now win10&nbsp;compatible driver is avalible, download the driver from here;</p>
http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop/legacy?product=legacy3&amp;os=Windows+10+-+64
<p>Do not pick the crisiom beta driver tab, this driver will cause issues.</p>
<p>I currently use a AMD 3350m with 6620g hd gpu, the 15.7.1 was the last stable driver I could use.</p>
<p>All of the crimson drivers will make the system unstable due to the gpu technology that it does not support, making the cpu run at its highest on all cores.</p>
<p>If you get the system stable, do not let the&nbsp;catalyst software update to a new version, this will result in the same issues.</p>

<h2>            File Explorer save current session feature</h2>
                    <p>Does File Explorer, when being exited, have the option to save the current tabs and views for the next session? This would be similar to how Explorer and Firefox have the option to Use Current Pages in Tools/Internet Options to open the same pages and locations
 as the previous session.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be so easy to implement if it doesn't exist and would be a productivity enhancer.</p>

            <p><strong>There is no way to set the initial folder that Windows Explorer will open to!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Simplest way to implement this is to right click the folder you want to open and select Send to - Desktop Create Shortcut and a shortcut to that folder will be placed on your desktop, the view to last selected for that folder (Details, list . . . etc.) will

<h2>            Printing conversations</h2>
                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>I was trying to copy and save a conversation on skype, and I found some info on Google but on the right click doesn't work to copy the conversation. It's not a problem with my mouse, but Skype doesn't allow me to right click in the middle of the conversation
 to select all.</p>
<p>Is there a way to print the conversation or select it and paste it on&nbsp;a Word&nbsp;document?
</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>N.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since your camera is working in Skype but not Windows Camera, it could be that your camera is using a "stream.sys" driver which will not work with modern camera apps like Windows Camera. Step 4 in the troubleshooting document can help you identify if the
 driver uses "stream.sys." </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've walked through the full troubleshooting document you may need to contact Acer for an updated driver.</p>

            <p>Hello Riyaz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a 'stream.sys' camera driver it won't work with modern camera apps like the Windows Camera app or some other windows store apps. You could contact Acer, but usually camera drivers of this age are no longer receiving updates. You might consider
 buying an inexpensive USB webcam if you'd like to continue to use the Windows Camera app. If you decide to go this route, be sure to check that the webcam is&nbsp;Windows 10 or Windows 8 compatible. That should ensure you get a camera with a modern camera driver.</p>

            We recommend you to run the System Configuration Utility as an administrator. To do this, follow these steps.<br />
1. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, right click on it from the list, and click Run as administrator.<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> now there is no icons or a task bar only the background photo so i can't click start,
 but i can get to windows task manager and i do new task "msconfig.exe and&nbsp;go from there &nbsp;</span></em></strong><br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.
<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">it never prompt me for a password
</span></em></strong><br />
2. On the General tab, click the Diagnostic Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> once i go through it this way it restarts but still no icons like it did&nbsp;before
</span></em></strong><br />

<h2>            Consent UI for administrative applications wants network access&#63;,  is this normal behavior.</h2>

This only just started happening a week after a fresh intall on windows 7 home premium.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I right click to run a program as an administrator,&nbsp;&nbsp; I get a popup notification from my firewall for this file.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this normal behavior and safe to allow? &nbsp; I
 have been running this same program as administrator for a couple days without this file ever asking for network access.&nbsp; it just started now...<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

            I found out this only happens if I have resource monitor open.&nbsp; If its not open consent.exe does not attempt network access...&nbsp; This is very strange and I wonder if others have had this issue.<br />
