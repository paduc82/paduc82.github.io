    <title>Bluetooth headphones out of sync with new PC - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth headphones out of sync with new PC</h2>
                    I just bought myself a new pc and it's been really nice, however whenever I connect my headphones, there is a really annoying lag. Whenever I watch Youtube videos it happens if I skip through the video, while I'm gaming it lags, probably by half a second.
 I've tried updating drivers, disconnecting and reconnecting, I have no updates to install, and I've run the troubleshooter about five times and it doesn't help. With my old laptop the headphones connected with no problem and zero lag, the same on my iphone.
 At this point I'm really not sure what to do.

            Hi jtipton2,
<br />
<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />Have you tried using the Bluetooth drivers on your Laptop manufacturer's website?
<br />
<br />Sometimes that could be helpful.
<br />
<br />Regards.

<br />A. What is your computer's make and model? For example Lenovo T470
<br />B. What is the Windows version and build? To check this, type winver in Windows Start Search (Cortana) box and click winver.

<h2>            Does Windows 10 Work Offline</h2>
                    Stupid question but I ask due to a recent incident. But will I have access to my hard drive without internet connection? A week ago my Toshiba C55 could not connect to Microsoft Account briefly. Because of that I was put in a temporary account in my own
 laptop and had no access to my hard drive or previous user settings. Issue was resolved when I restarted and was able to connect again on second try. So is that supposed to happen when I can't get online?

            <p>Certainly not a stupid question.&nbsp; In general the answer is yes you can use Windows 10 offline.</p>
<p>In fact as a test I tried both disconnecting from the Internet and disabling my network card completely.</p>
<p>In all cases I was able to log in with no problem, and get access to all my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key here though is that you were logged in with a temporary account.&nbsp; Since that is a different account, it certainly wouldn't/shouldn't have access to your data files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question comes up as to why Windows logged you in with a temporary account.&nbsp; The normal cause of this is if your user profile files got corrupted in some way.&nbsp; The strange part of this is that in your case once you got your Internet connection back
 things seems to work again.&nbsp; That suggest that the "corruption" was either caused by the lack of an Internet connection or fixed by it when go logged in (or both).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked for your problem on this site (which is a very good site with very good people on it):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tenforums.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And they have steps on how to fix such a problem (I searched for temporary account), but the answers all seem to be for people where this problem didn't magically fix itself with the Internet Connection coming back.&nbsp; It might be a good idea to post what
 happened to you, and see what they have to say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might also add that it might be a good idea to create a local account with administrator privileges, so just in case such problems come up you can log into that account if you need to fix things.</p>

 is odd. When I see it in a reply, one of the colours has changed, its no longer bold, the spacing is odd, and when I hover over my phone number it seems I can click on it, although nothing happens.&nbsp;

            Very difficult to say. How did you create the signature? If you used a complex HTML editor like Word, anything can happen when it's transported to a simple HTML application like Windows Live Mail.<br />
<br />
You could open the HTML file with Notepad, then use Ctrl-A C to copy it all and then paste it into your reply here so someone could spot what's wrong with it. You can edit out any personal information before submitting.<br />

            <p>XP was the last OS in need of codecs...As far as youre canon software goes,chk with canon.com</p>
<p>for Win10 downloads.If none show,maybe R.click on the canon icon/properties/compatability tab,reset</p>
<p>for older OS...Also,who buys upgrades,unless its the OS,none are warranted.</p>
<p>Also,download a utility from microsoft,called " Print Migrator" this small utility gives alot of info</p>

            I've been in Win 10 for a year or two and believe I too could view canon cr2 raw files until just recently. I think, but not now for some reason and have been unable to find a win 10 camera codec pack.... any ideas or links appreciated! Thanks, Rich

    <title>Windows 10 Night Light not automatically turning on - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Night Light not automatically turning on</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using the Night Light feature on Windows 10 for a while now, but recently I have noticed that half of the time it doesn't seem to turn on automatically, even though the current time is later than the scheduled sunset time, and the schedule is turned
 on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment I am having to manually enable it when I notice it has not kicked in, but as you can imagine that's a pretty rubbish solution. I am considering using f.lux instead to dim light levels but I would prefer to avoid downloading/installing an extra
 application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me with this? I've attached a screenshot below which should demonstrate the issue clearly as you can see my system time and the Night Light settings which contradict its behaviour.</p>
<p>

            Hi, Lewis,
<br />
<br />What steps have you taken to resolve the issue. If I know, I then will not repeat these solutions.
<br />
<br />Using Windows Registry:
<br />
<br />Navigate to this location
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudStore\Store\Cache\DefaultAccount
<br />
<br />Now delete these two registries key.
<br />
<br />$$windows.data.bluelightreduction.bluelightreductionstate
<br />
<br />$$windows.data.bluelightreduction.settings       
        </p>

            Sorry, I had not finished with the instructions when my system reloaded and submitted without my help, lol.
<br />
<br />Reboot the computer when finished removing the keys from Windows Registry then retry Night Light Settings.

<p>
</p><p>I deleted those registry entries and restarted my PC. I turned the Night Light schedule back on again, and the light was dimmed without me having to turn it on manually, so that's a good sign.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I can't confirm right now whether this has solved the issue completely, but I will make sure to post again in this thread if the problem persists. If the issue doesn't come back within a week or so then I'll mark your answer as correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankyou.</p>

            Update Graphics Card driver if still experiencing issues.
<br />Uninstall Graphics Card driver 
<br />Reboot to reload the driver.
<br />Recheck Nightlight settings
<br />
<br />Have you recently installed new apps? 
<br />If yes, try uninstalling to determine if they are interfering with Nightlight settings.
<br />
<br />Several "fix" steps found here

<p>I already updated my graphics card driver and generally try to keep it up to date anyway.</p>
<br />
<p>I looked at the article you linked but any fixes listed on there that are applicable to me, I have already tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, the issue was not present and the Night Light functioned correctly, but it has been incosistent for a while now so it's impossible to tell if anything has made a difference until it fails to turn on again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless there is anything else that you or another person can suggest then it seems like I'll just have to put up with it. If it continues then I might just accept that it's faulty and get a third-party app instead.</p>
<p>

            Reinstall and re-register the apps.
<br />
<br />Right click on Start &gt; Select PowerShell (Admin)
<br />Copy/paste the following text into the window then press Enter.
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />Once the command is executed, close PowerShell and reboot the system. See if Night Light Feature works.
<br />
<br />Question: Would you mind posting how you fixed the issue (solution) for other members who may be experiencing the same? It would be appreciated

            Okay, just updating this to confirm that the Powershell command did not fix the issue - my computer started up this morning with the Night Light enabled even though it was a few hours after sunrise time and the schedule was on (apparently).<br />

Please report this problem as :<br />

You should choose to boot in Safe Mode (tapping the F8 key as XP is starting to load) and if the last thing you will see loading is:<br />
<br />
...system32\BOOTVID.dll<br />
<br />
The likely problem is a missing kdcom.dll - which you can easily replace.<br />
<br />
Any Microsoft engaged MS Answers Support Engineer "expert" can tell you how to do that - this is their job.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I also have no idea what an emergency kit is - except for human beings and animals.&nbsp; Those I got.<br />
<br />
The continuing and confounding problem here is the MS Answers forum "owners" implementation.<br />
<br />
We know nothing about your system.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum implementation does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and
 agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
What is your Internet browser and version?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
What do you see (exactly) that you don't think you should be seeing and when do you see it?<br />
<br />
What do you not see that you think you should be seeing?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />

    <title>Computer says &#34;starting windows,&#34; and after about twenty - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leightonmeyers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer says &#34;starting windows,&#34; and after about twenty minutes, shuts down.</h2>
                    My laptop is refusing to start up. When I go to boot it, it displays the "Starting Windows" icon, like it normally does, but then it freezes and remains locked on that screen for about twenty minutes. After that, it shuts itself down. This problem has
 been persisting for four days, and no threads on the Internet seem to help. I tried to do the "Last Known Good Configuration" thing on start-up, which failed. It won't start in safe mode either.
<br />
<br />
My computer has had a lot of viruses, and I was trying to clean them off my system with AVG Antivirus and Spybot Search &amp; Destroy. I had restored maybe a day or two before this problem, then used Windows Live to update it. I left it on my bed before I went
 to work so it could finish its cycle (I have a bad habit of doing this), and I came home that day to see it off. I tried to turn it on, then it got suck on the start screen. I took out the battery and tried using Window diagnostic tools to find out why it
 wouldn't start. Then I used advance tools to recover to an earlier date. I tried to restore it back to the day of the initial update and two days before, and with each restart, it got stuck on "Starting Windows." This has happened each time since.<br />
<br />
Model: Sony Vaio<br />
Model Number: VPCF115FM<br />
Operating System: Windows 7<br />
It's about a year old.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated. I can't afford to have my laptop professionally fixed.<br />

            Hi Aryesh
<br />
<br />Did you start a System Restore, by choosing a data to go back to or are you performing a System Reset?
<br />
<br />If that is a system Restore, check the hard drive light on your PC, is there intermittent hard drive activity?
<br />
<br />If that is a Windows Reset, your best option is to force your PC to shut down (hold the power button) and then start that operation again . ..

<p>Hi Leroy Port,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums.</p>
<p>Go to the OneDrive <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Auto Save</strong> tab &gt;<strong> Update folders.</strong>&nbsp; There you will be able to
<strong>Stop Protecting</strong> your Pictures folder which will stop the syncing of your Pictures folder to OneDrive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quoting from this article:&nbsp; </p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/sync-your-documents-pictures-and-desktop-folders-with-onedrive-d61a7930-a6fb-4b95-b28a-6552e77c3057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/sync-your-documents-pictures-and-desktop-folders-with-onedrive-d61a7930-a6fb-4b95-b28a-6552e77c3057</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Important:</strong><span>&nbsp;When you stop protecting a folder, the files that were already protected by OneDrive stay in OneDrive. If you no longer want those files in OneDrive, you'll need to move them to a local folder on
 your PC yourself. Any new files you add to that folder on your PC won't be protected by OneDrive.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>I believe you will find a local Pictures folder located in
<strong>This PC</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that helps.</p>

<p>No, the only way to update your content is for the console to be connected to XBL. Instead of a library internet connection you should try a friends/family members connection. Some public places that offer internet service block certain ports and it may
 affect your downloads.</p>

<p>Actually this library doesn't block the ports because they have LIVE (Wii, PS3, 360) competitions all the time during the summer :) they told me i need to get a WiFi Connector(xbox one) and i should have no problem</p>

<p>Now when you say you have been using your friends accounts to play the game is this on your xbox console that you are using them?</p>

</p><p>This is only happening with your account on your xbox?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have your tried removing your account from the xbox and then readding your account to the xbox?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you checked the subscriptions tab in settings on your xbox to make sure that you have an active xbox subscription?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you having any other issues with doing anything that requires a gold subscription like playing multiplayer or starting a party?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried doing a hard reset of your console by holding down the power button on the front for about 10 seconds for it to shut off then unplugging it for about a minute then plugging it back in and starting it up?</p>

</p><p>Please check your Microsoft account online to make sure that the game shows up under your purchases and also that you are showing as having an active live gold membership. If both of those come up as true, please contact support.&nbsp;</p>

            After the last recovery suggested by ACER, I have reintalled AVG, iTunes, my files from my old computer, and a print driver for my HP that is compatible with the 64 bit Windows 7. &nbsp;The problem seems to happen most often whenever the computer wakes up for
 the sleep mode. &nbsp;Thank You

            i am having the same issues on a toshiba quosimo. this issue only happens on windows 7. never happens on windows vista.<br />
<br />
I thought it was my samsung, so $250 and a new phone later, and I find the problem is still there. Not happy, and would love it if someone could tell me how to fix it. I sometimes get hours with no dramas, sometimes its minutes.<br />

            <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Through exhaustive research, I found many times this is caused by interference from other access points in the vicinity. Change
 the channel on the wireless router. If you don’t have the credentials to the router, call your service provider and ask them to change the channel. Most routers are pre-programmed to channel 6. I changed it to channel 10. It connected immediately and never
 dropped again. Try this before trying anything else. You may save yourself from wasting 7 hours like I did….ENJOY!</span></p>

                    <p>I have a keyboard and mouse attached into my xbox. Whenever I have two accounts signed into my xbox, the games will always use the account that is not being used ( But is still signed in). Is there anyway to fix this

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Scan for Malware in Safe Mode with Networking.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/how-to-start-windows-in-safe-mode/#winxo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/how-to-start-windows-in-safe-mode/#winxo</font></a></p>
<p><strong><u>Windows XP</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>Using the F8 Method:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Restart your computer. </li><li>When the machine first starts again it will generally list some equipment that is installed in your machine, amount of memory, hard drives installed etc. At this point you should gently tap the
<strong>F8</strong> key repeatedly until you are presented with a Windows XP Advanced Options menu.
</li><li>Select the option for <strong><em>Safe Mode with Networking</em></strong>&nbsp;using the arrow keys.
</li><li>Then press enter on your keyboard to boot into Safe Mode. </li><li>Do whatever tasks you require and when you are done reboot to boot back into normal mode.</li></ol>
<p>Once in Safe Mode with Networking, download and run RKill.</p>
<p>RKill does NOT remove Malware; it stops the Malware Process giving you a chance to remove it with your Security Programs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, download, install,&nbsp;update and scan your System with the free version of&nbsp;Malwarebytes AntiMalware in Safe Mode with Networking:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</font></a></p>

            I have tried everything that was suggested even though it was out of date, especially as you say there is no longer a Homegroup in this version of Windows 10. I should say that our other laptop which is running Windows 8 can both see the hard drive and
 open the files. I can only assume that the appropriate connections that were there with the Homegroup have not been accounted for when they took it away.
