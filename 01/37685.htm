<h2>            I get an &#34;access denied&#34; msg when I try to open my C drive&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    My grandson was using my laptop.&nbsp; I got it back from him and was unable to access my C drive.&nbsp; It gives me an error that says access denied.&nbsp; I cant do anything with it.&nbsp; I tried to burn a photo CD, It would not let me in, I again got the access denied.&nbsp;
 Is there anything I can do to fix this without loosing all my photos, music, etc.?&nbsp; I am at my wits end.

<p><span>Do you have another administrator account on the system that you can login to to see if it has the same problem?&nbsp; If not, try any other user account on the
 system and see if it has the same problem?&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd like to know if the problem is with the system or with that particular user profile.</span></p>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work.&nbsp; I think this is the most likely solution to work even if you need to use the CD to run the process.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make
 the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted,
 push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</a><span>&nbsp;along with burning software like:
</span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</a><span>&nbsp;and, of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32.&nbsp; Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It may want to schedule itself to start at the next startup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Agree and then reboot so the program can run. It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>====================================================================================================================</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It may just be a permissions issue.&nbsp; Here are some guidelines on how to change permissions and ownership and you may need to do so for the entire
 drive (that is, give yourself Full Rights Permissions and Take Ownership)..</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><span>To see your permissions, right click the folder/file, click on properties, and check out the security tab.&nbsp; Check to see what permissions
 you have by clicking on your username (or user group).&nbsp; Here are&nbsp;the types of permissions you can have:
</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 You need to be an administrator or the&nbsp;owner to change permissions (and sometimes being an administrator or even an owner isn't enough - there are ways to block even them from access (though a smart administrator knows these ways and can get around them -
 but usually shouldn't because they were denied access usually for a very good reason).&nbsp; Here's how to change folder permissions in Vista:
</span><a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To add take and grant full right permissions and ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:
</span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/</span></a><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>To fix this problem with the folders, take
 Owner tab.&nbsp; Click edit and then click the name of the person you want to give ownership to (you may need to add it if it isn't there - or it may be yourself). If you want it to apply to sub-folders and files within that folder/drive, then check the box for
 replace owner on sub-containers and objects and click OK.&nbsp; Back out and now there's a new owner for the folders/drive and files who can change permissions as needed.&nbsp; Here's more information on taking ownership of a file or folder:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To add take ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:
</span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/</span></a>.</span></p>
<p><span>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p><span>If that doen't work, your user profile may be corrupt.&nbsp;
<span>To fix this use
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If that is the only available Administrator Profile (you need to be an administrator to fix this), enable the Hidden Administrator Account (HAA) using
</span></span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx?&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=US&amp;guid=&amp;sloc=en-us&amp;dg=microsoft.public.windows.vista.administration_accounts_passwords&amp;p=1&amp;tid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055&amp;mid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx?&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=US&amp;guid=&amp;sloc=en-us&amp;dg=microsoft.public.windows.vista.administration_accounts_passwords&amp;p=1&amp;tid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055&amp;mid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055</span></span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If you can't remember the password, try nothing as that's probably what you (or the vendor) did during installation.&nbsp; Once done, be sure to deactivate the HAA to save it in case it's needed again and for security purposes (since people often try to hack into
 systems using this account).&nbsp; Do NOT use the HAA as your administrator account because if you lose the only administrator account on the system or it becomes corrupt again then you are hosed.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I hope one of these procedures helps.&nbsp; Please post back
 in any case - if the problem persists, we'll try some other options.&nbsp; If you have any questions as you go along, just post them.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Good luck!</span></span></span></p>

            Verify that the disk does not say OEM on it, and that you have an upgrade or retail key to go along with it.<br />
<br />
You should be able to initiate the install from within Windows 98. If that's not possible and your computer doesn't support booting from a CD, you may need to initiate the install with a floppy disk.<br />

            <p>Let's try to reproduce the issue by creating a new user profile. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can check this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/5de907f1-f8ba-4fd9-a89d-efd23fee918c/create-a-local-user-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how to create a local user account
 on Windows 10. If the issue does not happen on the new profile, there could be some broken system components on your old profile. Let's resolve it by repairing the system following the instructions below:<br />
<br />
1. Open an elevated Command Prompt. Right click on <strong>Start button</strong> &gt; select
<strong>Command Prompt</strong> (Admin).&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
2. Copy and paste the command, <strong>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</strong>. You will get a message "
<strong>The restore operation completed successfully</strong>."&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
3. Restart your PC to apply changes.<br />
<br />
Please note that this process will take time. You will notice that it's being stuck on 20%. It's a normal way since it's checking and configuring necessary changes on the broken components.</p>

            You cannot "see" your digital license. Digital license means your activation information is stored on MS servers and as soon as you do a reinstall it would automatically activate without your key.

<p>I upgraded 3 computers from retail copies of Windows 7 Pro to the free upgrade to Windows 10 in 2015, so my Windows 10 license can be transferred, but I understand that I am only entitled to a one time transfer for each one of these?<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have 3 Windows 7 Pro sets of 25 numbers as a license, but I do not know which set of numbers belongs to which computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Can I still use my Windows 7 pro 25 license numbers if I have to get a new motherboard or hard drive?<span>&nbsp;

How does the MS server know which one of my 3 Computers I am using to choose the digital license? Is there a way that I can log into Microsoft and have them record my digital license? And where do I download the new clean install of Windows 10?

            Yes, this is the problem.  It means that someone has activated Windows with a Volume License Key meant only for business or organizations that activate a large number of PC's, which need to check in with the organization's server regularly to reactivate.  
<br />
<br />This can be because a discount key was purchased that was actually a VLK.  Sometimes it's even done when Windows is reinstalled by a shop - unnecessarily because the PC either came with a Windows Product Key embedded in the BIOS/UEFI firmware, or it was already activated for free Upgrade and would have reactivated after a reinstall had they given it the chance and not interrupted this by installing the illegal key.
<br />
<br />If you know Windows was originally activated legitimately by one of these methods then to fix the problem what I would do is go offline to remove the Volume License key and then restore the Generic Product Key that is used to activate with the Digital License issued by Upgrade or Factory install.  Then we'll see if it activates:
<br />
<br />1) Go offline by opening Action center at the right end of Task Bar, then clicking on Airplane mode to turn off internet.  
<br />
<br />2) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click to Run as Administrator, then right click to copy and paste this command in and press Enter:  slmgr -upk
<br />
<br />3) Restart PC and then insert Generic Product Key for WIndows 10 Pro from here:    <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-...</a>
<br />
<br />This sets everything back to default so that if there is a Digital License issued during a proper Upgrade it should reactivate within a few days.  If not we will need to try something else:  
<br />
<br />What Windows Operating System came on that exact model PC originally - you can google it's make and model to read the specs to find out?  If it says Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 Home version then that is a clue you need to reinstall Home instead of Pro to try to activate.  We might even be able to still activate it fresh with a Windows 8/8.1 Product Key read from the BIOS or on the Windows 7 COA sticker on the PC, or any of those retail keys.
<br />
<br />If nothing else works you may need to reinstall the licensed Windows edition that came with that PC, or buy a copy of Windows 10 Home to activate it.  I would buy only from a major retailer who backs their purchases or Microsoft here:  <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-10-Home/productID.319937100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I am glad to help.  Nice work!
<br />
<br />You should have no problem transferring hardware as long as you image over the same install, move hard drive, or reinstall using the last available bootable media for Single Language which is usually a few versions older and found here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Windows Update will then bring it current to the latest version.  
<br />
<br />Burn the media to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>.  Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />If you'd rather keep your present install I'd use Macrium to save it externally as an image then reapply it using the bootable rescue media it will create for you:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>
<br />
<br />On Motherboard changes it requires reactivating following these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />Normally OEM keys cannot move to new motherboards but if you sign in with the MS Account which has the activation linked to it, run the Troubleshooter and all else is correct so it offers the new hardware to move the license to, it should make a one-time exception to be allowed to move OEM to a new motherboard.   If not contact Microsoft Support by one of these methods:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />As to the Pro Upgrade, make sure you actually need the extra features because most Home users don't, and there are better alternatives to the Pro features available (like AnyDesk or TeamViewer) for free.   These are discussed here along with other alternatives:

            When downloading iTunes, do not run it from its current location, instead, save the installer to your hard disk to your Downloads folder, then run setup from there.

<p>Unfortunately the answer is No. You will have to treat this event as a learning exercise. Here are some pointers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deleting drivers that you do not recognise is risky. If you feel that you must delete them, start by creating an image of your installation. Store it on an external disk. Boot your machine with a Windows Repair CD or flash disk and check if you can see
 the image.</li><li>Using third party software to interfere with Windows is also risky.</li><li>Important or irreplaceable files must at all times be stored on at least two independent media. Treat this event as an incentive to implement a robust backup scheme.&nbsp;</li></ul>

            <p>The drives you found were system drives Windows 10 creates, which are not supposed to be accessible by users.</p>
<p>The third party software, deleted these drives and that is why Windows 10 would not start.</p>
<p>In the future, do not use third party software to delete these as they do not respect the Windows 10 Repair Structure</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you used Toshiba Recovery it more than likely wiped out all your personal Data, there is one possibility, do you have a Windows.old folder on your C drive, if so, your files could reside there in the users folder . . .</p>
<p>

<h2>            Where are accessory programs, how can I see them&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My Dell Studio 1555 runs Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>Using XP there was a folder containing accessory programs such as Notepad, Wordpad and many others - very useful, and I used it often. With Windows 7, the list of programs at 'Start' doesn't include a folder of accessory programs, and I only found Notepad
 by using the search facility.</p>
<p>How can I add a folder of accessory programs to the Start list of programs, so I can get to see what's available? Searching for 'accessory programs' in<strong>Help</strong> produced no help with this query.</p>

            Hi Andee.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />No expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the tens of thousands) has recommended Avast for 7-8 years since it bloated up and started causing issues, but we do solve problems by having it uninstalled.
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.   If you want the best on-demand scanners install and run Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner free scanners.  
<br />
<br />To clean it up run Avast Clear after uninstall to check for leftovers:  <a href="http://www.avast.com/en-us/uninstall-utility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.avast.com/en-us/uninstall-utility</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />If you type Defender Security Center in Start Search, open it, then choose Virus and Threat Protection Settings, is Controlled Folder Access turned On?
<br />
<br />Also in Security Center under App and Browser Control, is Check Apps and Files set to Block?  Change to Warn.  
<br />
<br />Is Device Guard enabled?  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/68913-enable-disable-device-guard-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/68913-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />This may have been caused by Windows Updates.  Check which Updates were installed right before the problem began, and if necessary uninstall them from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.
<br />
<br />You can also try to roll back using System Restore to a point before this began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if the Update installs and causes the same problem again uninstall or roll it back again, then immediately hide it using the Hide Updates tool from Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary try taking ownership of any folders that won't allow access:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Unable to type in a different language</h2>
                    I am currently running Windows 7 Home Premium on a Samsung laptop. My default language is English. I have added Chinese (Simplified) under input languages and am able to switch between these two languages in the language bar, however when I try to type

<p>Hello Thomas<br />
<br />
I am a fellow Community member here to help. I am very sorry to hear that you are experiencing this difficulty. I know that it is extremely frustrating to say the least.<br />
<br />
As you already know, the new version of Skype is still under development and as such as lacking many of the features and functions of classic Skype and contains many bugs.<br />
<br />
While there is not yet an ETA, it is expected in the very near future that Microsoft will begin rapidly releasing updates for the new Skype in order to add features and functionality and correct known bugs.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, Microsoft has listened to user feedback and has decided to continue supporting classic Skype into the foreseeable future. If you are interested in returning the classic Skype for the time being it can be gotten here<br />
<br />
<a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a></p>
<p><br />
if you should choose to return to Classic Skype, you will likely still see notices that an update is available. However, you can ignore them, at this point in time there is not a deadline for upgrading and there is not a definitive date for when support of
 classic Skype will cease.<br />
</p>
<p>I do hope that this is helpful to you. I definitely feel your frustrations on this one. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance I am happy to help when I can.<br />
<br />
I do hope that you have a great day. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Once you have installed it, all you need to do is change the product key located on the Certificate of Authenticity (COA). Lets take a look at how to do that.
</p>
<p>Click Start, right click Computer</p>
<p>Click Properties</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset1_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d461%26amp%3bh%3d145" height="145" width="461" /></a></p>
<p>Scroll down to Windows activation.</p>
<p>You will notice it displays a time until Activation but be completed. Also the Product ID indicates it is using a default key, this is only for the 30 day grace period allowed until you must activate Windows 7.
</p>
<p>Click the link, <strong>Change product key</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset2_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d455%26amp%3bh%3d398" height="398" width="455" /></a></p>
<p>Enter the product key located on the COA sticker located at the bottom or (sometimes in the battery compartment of your laptop), you can also find it at the top or side if its a Desktop computer.&nbsp; It looks something like the following:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/image2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fimage_thumb2.png%3fw%3d438%26amp%3bh%3d156" height="156" width="438" /></a></p>
<p>Proceed to enter the product key and click Next</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset3_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d460%26amp%3bh%3d403" height="403" width="460" /></a></p>
<p>Wait while Windows attempts to activate.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set4.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset4_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d459%26amp%3bh%3d402" height="402" width="459" /></a></p>
<p>If all goes well, within a minute, you should see this screen. </p>
<p>You can further confirm Windows 7 is activated by checking the Windows Activation status:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/set5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f04%2fset5_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d468%26amp%3bh%3d98" height="98" width="468" /></a></p>
<p>Notice Windows 7 now displays OEM within the Product ID to indicate the product channel it is licensed from. Please note, this also works with Windows Vista if you are still running that version.</p>
<p>If you are unable to activate Windows 7 using the Change product key method, you can try phone activation and speak with a call agent who will assist with reactivating Windows 7:</p>
<p>How to activate Windows 7 manually (activate by phone)<br />

            Installed both 32 bit and 64 bit versions and still missing the dll file. I ended up installing the 32 bit version of wamp and that managed to install correctly.&nbsp;
