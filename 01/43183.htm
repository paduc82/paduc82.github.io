            <p>The warranty on a second-hand Xbox console is void, and the purchaser assumes the risk for any previous modifications or unauthorized activity. Even if the console’s ownership has changed, the console may still be subject to a ban. If you purchase a console that has been previously banned you will not be able to connect to Xbox Live, and the ban will not be lifted as a result of the change in ownership. We recommend customers who believe they have not committed actions on the service to warrant a ban to contact previous owners or users of the console.</p>
<p>If you have purchased or intend to purchase a second-hand Xbox 360, you can check its current ban status by entering its serial number into the&nbsp;<a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com/Home/ConsoleCheck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Console Check Tool</a>:&nbsp;<a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com/Home/ConsoleCheck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://enforcement.xbox.com/Home/ConsoleCheck</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span><span>Method 1:<br />
<br />
</span></span></strong><span><span>You may run the Qbasic program in Windows 2000/XP compatibility mode and check if it works.<br />

    <title>WINDOWS SEARCH is always using way too much CPU - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> toupet fiasco  say:</h3>
<h2>            WINDOWS SEARCH is always using way too much CPU</h2>
                    Hey,<br />
<br />
I recently bought a new laptop running Vista Business (Intel Core 2 Duo CPU, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** GHz, 4 Gig Ram) and almost from day one my CPU has been clogged and runnning at very high %, even when i'm not doing a lot. The problem seems to be the searchindexer.exe,
 which routinely takes up 50% of my CPU. <br />
I have tried removing xml files from the indexing list and i have rebuild it, but to no great avail.<br />
<br />
What causes this problem,&nbsp; and is there any way to fix it without removing the feature?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
<br />

<p><span><span>Hello Toupet Fiasco,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The searchindexer is set to perform as a background process and will only run full speed when the system is not being used for a period of
 time. It will automatically pause when the user starts using the system. This large amount of activity with this component only happens once, when the search index is first built.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here are a couple of things that you can try:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 1:&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Try to install the latest Service Pack on your computer.
</span><span>When you install Service Pack 2, the newer Search 4.0 is also installed and the search index has to be completely rebuilt.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2:
</span></p>
<p><span>Try to stop, end the process from the Task Manager and then reboot your computer and check if
 it the CPU usage still spikes up.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 3:
</span></p>
<p><span>Try to run a Malware scan on your computer. You can try to run the Microsoft Security Essentials
 following the below link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</a>

    <title>Screen saver settings in Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maldwynpate  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen saver settings in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just bought a Lenovo Laptop with Windows 8 preinstalled.&nbsp; I upgraded it to 8.1.&nbsp; I have the 'Administrator' account for the laptop and I am the only one that uses it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having problems with the screensaver settings.&nbsp; At the moment the screensaver kicks in after 1 minute and I have to use a password to get back in to my computer. I've tried changing the settings with the following procedure: In Desktop mode I bring up
 the charms menu and select 'Control Panel', select 'Personalise' and then click on 'Screen saver' in the bottom right hand corner of the screen.&nbsp; I then get the Screensaver Settings dialogue box.&nbsp; It's set to 1 minute, so I change it to a different setting
 - let's say 10 minutes.&nbsp; I also uncheck the box next to it so as not to require a password after the screen saver. I click 'Apply' and 'OK'.&nbsp; However, within a minute, the screensaver again activates and I'm required to use a password to regain access the
 computer.&nbsp; I go back into the Screensaver settings to check,&nbsp;only to find that it's reverted to 1 minute again.&nbsp; (The 'Password required' box remains unchecked, however - even though I did have to enter a password).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the problem is that I can't seem to change the settings.&nbsp; Clearly, having to enter a password every minute or so is very annoying.&nbsp; Do you have any advice or further suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate any help,</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mal</p>

            <p>Hi Mal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Microsoft community, we’re here to help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what you have described, it appears that some user profile files are corrupt. I would suggest you to try these steps and check:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I would suggest you to disable the screen saver option and re-enable it and check if the issue persists. If yes, then change the screensavers and check if that makes any difference. If these steps didn’t help, then try the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a new user account and check if the issue persists in the new user account. If the issue doesn’t occur in a new user account, then the user account related files might be corrupt in the old user account. If the issue persists in the new user account,
 then some system files might be corrupt. In this case, I would suggest you to run a system file check. System File checker (SFC) scan is done to check if there are any corrupted system files that could be causing this issue. Refer to this article:</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply Ben.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I've discovered the problem: I had set up an exchange email account and it seems that that overrode the screensaver and password settings. &nbsp;I've since deleted that account and the screensaver and password settings are functioning again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a pity really, since I've tried to set up another of my email accounts on the laptop but with no luck. &nbsp;It's a talktalk.net account and I've been on the phone to both TalkTalk and Microsoft and neither can get it to work. So my Windows laptop will have
 to remain without email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, I only bought the laptop because some bits of software I need to use only work on Windows. &nbsp;So the Windows laptop will be very much a 'third' computer as I use an iMac and a MacBook as my main computers and hardly ever have any problems with them.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, once again, for your efforts. &nbsp;Yes I've tried those settings - both IMAP and POP3 but I keep getting the message that the server cannot be found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the office Outlook app, my talktalk account appears, although it seems to be frozen at about a week ago - not receiving nor sending. When I try to modify the account settings via Control Panel,the account doesn't show at all saying 'no account', or something
 similar. &nbsp;I would really like to delete this 'frozen' account from Outlook as it simply takes up space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a positive note, I've managed to set up an old btinternet.com account without any trouble at all but because the aforementioned 'frozen' talktalk account, the btinternet account appears way down the page. Anyhow, I now have a means of sending emails from
 the laptop if ever I need to.</p>

    <title>heating issue with Surface pro 5. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brunoossavou  say:</h3>
<h2>            heating issue with Surface pro 5.</h2>
                    <p>hello I live in Gabon (Africa)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ambient temperature here is about 28 to 30 degree C. I have a surface pro 5 (intel i5), protected with a UAG rugged cover.&nbsp; I have noticed that my surface felt hot. I started to notice it a few weeks ago. I decided to put the air con to 23 degrees C
 and remove the UAG rugged cover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And notice that the surface cooled down in about 15 to 30 min after I put the air con and removed the rugged cover. So I don't know if it cooled down, because I put the air con or because I removed the cover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So My question is, can the rugged cover can interfere with the cooling process of the CPU? which can explain the heating of the surface.</p>
<p>I used that cover to protect my surface against any dropping accident, please can u advise?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            Hi, BrunoOssavou. You can further isolate by testing to remove the cover but retaining the normal room temperature first. Then try to cool down your AC but don't remove the cover. Normally, any&nbsp;<span>pillow, blanket, or other soft material can
 block the airflow and this may cause device overheating. </span>

<p>Are you perhaps participating in the Windows Insider Release Preview branch?</p>
<p>The cooling fan of my Surface Pro 5 suddenly stopped working a while ago, and yesterday I received a replacement device with a functioning fan. After installing a few apps I decided to join the Release Preview program, and received beta drivers and firmware.
 After installation the fan also stopped working on the replacement device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please check if you can hear the cooling fan, if not you're likely affected by the bad firmware update from the Release Preview.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm afraid there is no rolling back procedure yet. I've been in contact with the Surface support team, and they have not heard about this problem yet, so I guess I'm the first to make the connection between the fan and the firmware update, since the firmware
 has been out there for some time now and hasn't been pulled yet...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this gets noticed by the Surface team, so they can release a fixed version ASAP</p>
<p>

<p>It has been almost 24hr that I dropped the protecting cover and I do not have that warming issue even when I am working in ambient temperature, maybe it is too soon to declare but it seems like in hot countries like mine, it is not advisable to cover the
 surface pro 5. perhaps the aluminum material of the surface pro uses the surrounding temperature in its cooling process, since aluminum is a very good thermal conductor, thus the cover which is in rubber maybe, have the effect of reducing the thermal conductivity
 of the aluminum, and this is why I had that warming issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I am tempted to believe, maybe I am wrong but I will continue to observe and see if it changes, but so far so good.</p>

<h2>            I cant &#39;update to the latest version of windows 10&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Ive been trying to update this piece of sh*t since 2017, probably the entire year. Possibly 2016, maybe before that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen nothing on google to help me with this, no one has the specifics of my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i'll explain:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have version 10240. But I need version 16299.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But It hasn't let me update at all. Ever. It always says, when I try to update: "You'll need to free up some disc space on your PC (8GB required)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 28.0 GB, I'm using 2.19 of that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I always click "Free up disc space now"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, when I do that, nothing happens at all. Sometimes when I click, it's already clearing something from the last time I clicked it. Sometimes the update window just completely closes itself for no reason? Sometimes, when I click the disc cleaner
 and it works, I'll be clearing some stuff like temporary files or stuff like that, and It will be cleaning, and I'll wait. But then for some reason, it closes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Listen, I'm not an expert at any of this. But I gotta say, this computer I have is a piece of ****. And so is windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>IDK what to do! and clearly it just thrives on pissing me off. Because I can't go about my day online without that update popping up at random moments. And I just want this hell to stop. So I would appreciate some help, because clearly I got no idea whats
 happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what I do know is I can't update. It just doesn't let me.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Please let me update.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>TLDR: Windows 10 a ****. My computer is falling apart. Life is in shambles.</p>

</p><p>The issue that you're experiencing usually happens if the computer doesn't have a sufficient memory allowance required to install the update. To further isolate the issue, we would like to aske for a screenshot of the where you see the available space on
 your computer. (See sample picture below.) <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54bf88ec-8b12-4ee5-95b2-6b88273e8320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            cannot record streaming audio in Win 8 pRO</h2>
                    I cannot record streaming audio in Win 8 using any software ... Sound forge (updated driver) Audacity (just installed as a test) and your "Sound Recorder" ... They will all record from a microphone but not playback.&nbsp; The file must be saved to the HD and
 then it can be played back using the media player ... Also I cannot use the onboard DVD/CD appliance, it continually tells me to insert a disc ... My external HP dvd1040 works just fine, but that is not the point ...&nbsp; Could these two problems be related? ...
 In the Device Manager it tells me the DVD/CD unit is not plugged in and there are several HDMI and S/PDIF devices that show not plugged in ... From time to time, it (they) changes ... Sometimes it, the device manager, shows four items other times ten to twelve,
 most unplugged ... I have Win 8 Pro from a clean installation, not an upgrade, from Vista (up to date, at the time) ...

            <p>Hi Jame,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the computer time is not synching. We will help you.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you trying to synch the clock with internet timing?</li><li>Did you check if the clock is running properly in BIOS?</li></ul>
<p>Your computer's clock is used to record the time whenever you create or modify files on your computer. You can change the clock's time and time zone.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<div><span>Press&nbsp;<strong><span>Start</span></strong> button, </span>type <strong>
<span>Control Panel</span></strong>, click <strong><span>Date and Time</span>.</strong></div>
</li><li>
<div>Click <strong><span>Change date and time</span>. </strong></div>
</li><li>
<div><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f18abb370-ac1e-4b6b-b663-e028a75bf05b_48.jpg" />&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></div>
</li><li>
<div>In the <strong><span>Date and Time Settings</span> dialog box</strong>, do one or more of the following:</div>
</li></ul>
<div>&gt;&gt; To change the hour, double-click the hour, and then click the arrows to increase or decrease the value.</div>
<p>&gt;&gt; To change the minutes, double-click the minutes, and then click the arrows to increase or decrease the value.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; To change the seconds, double-click the seconds, and then click the arrows to increase or decrease the value.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>When you have finished changing the time settings, click <strong><span>OK</span>.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p>To change the time zone, click <strong><span>Change time zone</span>. </strong>
</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the <strong><span>Time Zone Settings</span> dialog box</strong>, click your
<strong>current time zone </strong>in the <strong>drop-down list</strong>, and then click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>You can synchronize your computer clock with an Internet time server. This means that the clock on your computer is updated to match the clock on the time server, which can help ensure that the clock on your computer is accurate. Your clock is typically
 updated once a week and needs to be connected to the Internet for the synchronization to occur.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Press&nbsp;<strong><span>Start</span></strong> button, </span>type <strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong>, click
<strong><span>Date and Time</span>.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li><li>
<p>Click the <strong><span>Internet Time</span> tab</strong>, and then click <strong>
<span>Change settings</span></strong>. <span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f18abb370-ac1e-4b6b-b663-e028a75bf05b_48.jpg" />&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password
 or provide confirmation.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Select the check box next to <strong><span>Synchronize with an Internet time server</span></strong>, select a
<strong>time server</strong>, and then click <span><strong>OK</strong></span>.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If your computer is on a domain, you can't synchronize your clock with an Internet time server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Keep us posted to help you better.</p>

    <title>How To Connect Laptop Optical and Audio Output to TV and Surround - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bentedds  say:</h3>
<h2>            How To Connect Laptop Optical and Audio Output to TV and Surround Sound&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Due to budgetary issues, I can't afford to buy a 3D TV/Blu-ray player. Luckily, I have a different solution, as my laptop has a BD-ROM drive, and also has CyberLink PowerDVD 13, which allows me to live-convert Blu-ray 3Ds to anaglyph red/cyan, meaning I'm
 able to watch 3D movies on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as you can probably tell, this is rather impractical. So, I tried connecting up my laptop to my TV via HDMI. Though the picture is crystal-clear, the sound is far from. The HDMI cable is only outputting in 2.0 Stereo, meaning that my poor 5.1 surround
 sound system is being abused by a cluttered and distorted downscaled sound mix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The suggestion I'm probably going to get is that I need an external sound card. Well, I can find none that don't use 3.5mm jacks to plug into the speakers, which is a problem because my setup works slightly differently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, a DVD player acts as the hub for the surround sound. My TV is sort-of a bypass, as all sound outputs go through the TV, then to the DVD player, then out through the 6-channel setup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To put this in perspective: Blu-ray Player --&gt; HDMI Cable --&gt; TV --&gt; HDMI Cable --&gt; DVD Player --&gt; Surround Speakers</p>
<p>
</p><p>So then, how am I able to get my 5.1 surround sound output from my laptop if it's only outputting in 2.0? And can I do this whilst my laptop's screen is being projected onto the television?</p>

            <p>Right, I think I've figured it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a DisplayPort on my laptop, so it's going to have to be a USB 3.0 to DisplayPort, then a DisplayPort to HDMI cable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To put this in perspective: Laptop --&gt; USB 3.0 Cable --&gt; DisplayPort Adaptor --&gt; DisplayPort to HDMI cable --&gt; TV --&gt; HDMI cable --&gt; DVD Player --&gt; Surround Sound</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think it would work? This would be a much more cost-effective way if so, costing only around £30.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Try the below methods and check if that helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong>I would suggest you to update the display driver to the latest by visiting the computer Manufacturer website and install it in compatibility mode.</p>

            <p>Hi Preeti,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I re-installed my Intel HD graphics and my Nvidia GTX 770m. Both uninstalled and installed in a clean way. It still drops by 30%.. And btw, I installed the latest Nvidia graphics card provided by my laptop manufacturer. It was for Windows 10 and cant be
 run in compatibility mode for windows 8. If run in compatibility mode, the Nvidia Graphics Card cant be detected. And there is no troubleshooting tab in the Advance Settings on Change Display Settings. What can I do?</p>

            <p>I had this problem, and the answer is stupidly simple. Windows 10 by default is set to use the integrated graphics on the CPU. To bypass this, use the Nvidia control panel, Under 3D settings &gt;&nbsp;Manage 3D Settings: Change preferred Graphics processor: (To
 High&nbsp;Performance Nvidia processor) &gt; Apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This by default should apply Nvidia to be directly responsible for all graphic related hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please upvote!</p>

<p>Well, after deleting all Story Mode episodes and then re-downloading them 4 times, we finally are able to download episode 4 for free now. I would suggest you move all story mode episodes to an external drive if possible, then delete all Story Mode files
 from the console. Then you'll have to download the Story Modes again, you may have to do this more than once. You should also be sure to close out of the game just to be safe and then just keep trying. If you don't have an extra storage device to save your
 previous versions, I'm not sure what to tell you other than you'll have to replay them I guess.</p>

<p>Note that while the connection is not encrypted (a security hole in my opinion because it transmits your credentials in the clear), you do need to authenticate to your outgoing server.&nbsp; If this were my service, I'd never use it at an open WiFi hotspot.</p>

Many utilities and Programs need to be run&nbsp;as administrator in order to function properly, especially older utilities/programs that haven't been updated to support Vista yet.</p>
<p>
All shortcuts in Windows Vista have a special property that you can set that will allow the application torun as Administrator.</p>
<p>
To set this property, just right-click on any shortcut, and click the&nbsp;<strong>Advanced</strong>&nbsp;button on the Shortcut page to get to the Advanced Properties dialog.</p>
<p>
You'll see a dialog with a checkbox for "<strong>Run as administrator</strong>".</p>
<p>
From now on, the application will always run as administrator if you use the shortcut to launch it. (You'll be prompted by UAC if you have it enabled).</p>

<br />
<br />No definative driver was named in the crash, although it looks to be caused by a driver.
<br />
<br />The next step,
<br />Let us try finding any misbehaving driver
<br />Enable Driver Verifier: 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />(Must create a Restore point before)
<br />
<br />Upload the newer dumps when you get Driver_Verifier_detected_voilation. 
<br />
<br />Please note that the system might crash before you reach the desktop-if it does please let us know so that we can guide you to disable Verifier.

<br />
<br />C. Recommendations
<br />
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />Type restore point in Cortana Search &gt; Create a Restore point &gt; Check whether against your drive, Protection is ON or not. If not ON, click Configure button below to Make it ON &gt; Now press Create to create a restore point 
<br />
<br />2. Some third party drivers are causing BSODs. To know if a third party driver is one of the causes - Enable Driver Verifier and generate dump files and upload to Onedrive and share the link here (Don't forget to turn off Driver Verifier after the job is done). Do read the instructions carefully particularly how to get back into Windows when you get the crash.

            <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may check the programs that start with Windows and disable the unnecessary ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Start Task Manager ( press CTRL+SHIFT+ESC ), go to Startup tab, right-click the Name column and in the menu shown tick "Command line". From the list, right-click the programs you want not to run at startup&nbsp;and click Disable.</p>
<p>2. Start msconfig.exe, Startup tab and disable the unwanted programs.</p>
<p>3. You can also look into the registry and delete the entries for that programs:</p>
<p>Start-&gt;regedit.exe</p>
<p>look under HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>under </p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</p>
<p>
</p><p>and delete the entries that you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. After doing&nbsp;the steps above&nbsp;&amp; restarting, start Task Manager and look into Performance tab at how high the processor activity stays when idle; if the processor activity is high you may look into Processes tab to find the process that uses the most the
 processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Do an antivirus scan.</p>

            There's really no reason to use Sleep Mode. I hate to say it, but throughout all the editions of Windows there have been issues with it. If you feel like you want to stop using your computer a while and want to save power, shut down then restart when you
 come back to your computer.<br />

            HI clwydclwyd,
<br />
<br />I am sorry to hear that you are having problems getting connected to a personal hotspot.  I do have a few questions to see if I can help you get connected:
<br />
<br />1. Can you tell me if the hotspot is password protected?
<br />2. Is it showing at all that you are connected?  meaning it shows in the task bar that you have a wifi signal even though you can't get to the internet?
<br />3. Can you tell me the exact message you are getting when you try to set up the hotspot?
<br />4. have you tried connecting to this hotspot with your phone or other device to verify you can actually connect to it?
<br />
<br />I look forward to speaking with you,
<br />
<br />Danielle       
        </p>

            Open Mobile hotspot settings (Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Mobile hotspot)
<br />    Turn on mobile hotspot
<br />    Under "Related Settings", click Change adapter options
<br />    Take note of which adapter is connected to the internet and which adapter is your mobile hotspot (typically named "Local Area Connection* [#]")
<br />    Right click the adapter that is connected to the internet and click Properties
<br />    Go to the Sharing tab
<br />    Uncheck "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection". If it is already unchecked, skip this step.
<br />    Click OK
<br />    Again, open Properties &gt; Sharing for the same adapter.
<br />    Check "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection"
<br />    (If you get a popup that says "Internet Connection Sharing is currently enabled...", click OK.)
<br />    Under "Home networking connection:", select the mobile hotspot adapter
<br />    Click OK
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network adapters
<br />Right click then uninstall all virtual adapters
<br />
<br />Open Start then type: regedit
<br />Right click Regedit then click Run as administrator
<br />Navigate to the following registry key:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WlanSvc\Parameters\HostedNetworkSettings\
<br />
<br />Delete the following key: 
<br />HostedNetworkSettings
<br />
<br />Restart then try again.
<br />
<br />Run the Network adapter troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Network adapters
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart to see if it works.
<br />
<br />If not, you can try updating both your Network adapter drivers or uninstall them.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand network adapters
<br />Right click your adapter, click uninstall
<br />
<br />Exit Device Manager then restart
<br />
<br />Windows 10 will re-detect them and reinstall them. 
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />Open a Command Prompt Window as Adminstrator
<br />
<br />Run these commands and hit Enter:
<br />(replace name and PW with the mobile HotSpot Name and Password from your screen capture)
<br />
<br />netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid=name key=pw
<br />
<br />netsh wlan start hostednetwork
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Network &amp; Internet - Wi-Fi - 'Change adapter options'
<br />
<br />Look for a new "Local Area Connection #..."
<br />(It should show "Microsoft Hosted Network Virtual Adapter" as the Adapter).
<br />
<br />Right-click this and select "Properties",
<br />
<br />Select the "Sharing Tab. Check "Allow other network Users to connect through this computer's Internet connection"

            Thank you for getting back me. First I would start with forgetting the network. Then reboot your machine and try to add the network again.<br /><br />I have included a resource on how to forget the network on windows 10:<br /><br /><a href="https://kb.netgear.com/29889/How-to-delete-a-wireless-network-profile-in-Windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://kb.netgear.com/29889/How-to-delete-a-wi...</a><br /><br />Also if that does not work, I found this resource with a few more advanced options:<br /><br /><a href="https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-cant-connect-this-network/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-cant-conne...</a><br /><br />Please let me know if that helps!

            Hi clwydclwyd,
<br />
<br />I am so sorry I miss-understood your problem.  For your laptop and being able to create the hotspot on your laptop, I did find a few resources for that error specifically.
<br />
<br />First, I would try to update the wifi driver.  The driver specifically, I have added this youtube video that walks through it exactly.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNx_0CI6IqQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNx_0CI6IqQ</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/SNx_0CI6IqQ?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/SNx_0CI6IqQ?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, i would recommend troubleshooting the network adapter.  Steps to do that are here:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking-winpc/we-cant-set-up-mobile-hotspot/683338d1-3c66-43ed-8ae0-76626e183552">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If neither of those options work, then I would recommend reviewing the resources below that may help with other steps.
