    <title>CDRW&#47;DVD Drive will not read known good cds&#47;dvds - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taylorc157  say:</h3>
<h2>            CDRW&#47;DVD Drive will not read known good cds&#47;dvds</h2>
                    <p>I just got this Dell OptiPlex 745, it's refurbished, and so far I've encountered 2 problems with it.&nbsp; The main issue, and the one I need fixed to enjoy this PC is the cd/dvd drive.&nbsp; It simply refuses to recognize discs that I know are good and have content,
 they work fine on my laptop with no issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first insert a disc, either a cd, a game, or a movie, nothing happens.&nbsp; The drive whirrs, then the computer acts as if nothing has changed.&nbsp; Un-phased by this at first, I simply went into "Computer" right clicked on my drive, and looked for auto-play,
 sometimes it's there, sometimes it's not.&nbsp; Let's assume it's not there every time, auto-play is nice but my main focus is to get this thing to play the disc period.&nbsp; I then select "Open" and wait.&nbsp; It attempts to open the disc, but instead of starting an install
 wizard, opening the&nbsp; media player, or otherwise attempting to locate the content that exists, it wants for me to burn.&nbsp; It states, "How do you want to use this disc."&nbsp; The 2 options being, like a flash drive, or with a cd/dvd player, the second option is unselectable,
 and the first attempts to format any disc within, thankfully only tried on write protected discs so my content has not been lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to resolve this on my own, I first checked the driver, it's up to date, states it's the best driver, and I could not find another on Dell's website.&nbsp; So, in my zeal, I uninstalled/reinstalled the drive.&nbsp; No change.&nbsp; On to searching the internet.&nbsp;
 I found something about checking my registry files for something about upper/lower level stuff and altering that, I don't recall the exact file locations specified but suffice it to say the upper/lower levels they had mentioned were not there.&nbsp; The main file
 where they were supposed to be located was, just not this lower/upper stuff.&nbsp; I've done my fair bit of TSing PCs over the years but registry edits were not something I was too keen on learning and prefer to leave to programmers.&nbsp; Will be more than willing
 to look again though, perhaps I missed something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is updated and the people I bought it from don't have tech support available again for 2 days.&nbsp; If I could resolve this before then, perfect.&nbsp; My warranty is 90 days so I don't intend on self fixing this for too long.&nbsp; If anyone has any ideas,
 I'm all ears.&nbsp; The next step I'm taking tomorrow is yanking the thing open and reseating the cords to the drive and motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have any insight as to what else I could try on my end?&nbsp; Any suggestions are welcomed and appreciated, and if it fixes it I will promise my undying loyalty in your plan for world domination.&nbsp; At this point, I feel only an amazing evil mastermind could fix
 this silly thing.</p>
<p>

            As a side note, I just opened Roxio for the first time on this PC, and discovered it is not detecting the drive.&nbsp; Likely it needs replacing, but here's hoping reseating the cords works.&nbsp; Will update once I've done that, far too lazy and enjoying browsing
 the web to shutdown and mess with it tonight.

            Hello Taylor,
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><div>This issue could be with the CD/DVD drive lens. There are several instances where because of the issues with lens, there are possibilities that some DVD/Cds not get detected, some might not play and some would show a blank when you try playing it.</div>
<div>Since you have mentioned that your computer is&nbsp;refurbished, there could be possibilities of some issues with the CD/DVD lens.
<div>As you&nbsp;mentioned you have&nbsp;90 days warranty. You may get in touch with tech from which&nbsp;you&nbsp;have purchased the PC and let them know about the issue with the lens and get it fixed.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>You may also use any third party software and check for any CD/DVD lens cleaner and check with the issue</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can
 be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Please reply with the status so that we could help you further.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Did you run windows update troubleshooter:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open the Windows Update troubleshooter by clicking the Start button , and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under System and Security, click Fix problems with Windows Update.&nbsp; If you're prompted
 for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>Also try accessing <strong>safe mode</strong> (F8) and un install the recent updates. Next time if you want to upadte your computer try custome update.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Atith</p>

            Seems astoundingly clear to me that this:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
" Hi <span>Atith,</span>

<p><span>I tried to shut it down and restart, but the same message comes on after windows resumes, and i am not able to go to enter msconfig. Any advice? "
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>definitively indicates that Windows is NOT booting up.&nbsp; So how the heck can he "Click the Start button . . . etc etc etc?&nbsp;

            Hi Guys,&nbsp;
<div>Just a quick note. I think on Windows 7, the installation of update happens on Shutdown and not on restart.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I had the similar problem, but at least I could restart the machine by keeping the shutdown button (Physical button on the laptop) pressed for a longer time. This forces the computer to totally shutdown. And then brief press of the same button makes the
 laptop restart.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Once in restart mode, the updates don't happen. You can then use the steps outlined in the earlier post.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Are you using a third-party antivirus software that may have a firewall enabled?&nbsp; If yes, disable the third-party firewall.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows 8 comes with Windows Defender and will automatically disable if a third-party av software is installed (McAfee, Norton, etc...)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Open services.msc</p>
<p>Scroll down to Windows Firewall</p>
<p>Right click on Firewall and select Properties</p>
<p>Startup Type should be set to Automatic</p>
<p>Service Status should be "Running"</p>
<p>If the service is stopped, click on start </p>
<p>Click Apply, Ok</p>
<p>Close the Window</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If firewall is already started, try this</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Right click on start button on Windows Desktop and select Command Prompt (Admin)</p>
<p>Type the following pressing Enter when finished.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>netsh firewall set opmode enable</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You should receive a message the command has succeeded and&nbsp;<strong> “netsh firewall” is deprecated; use “netsh advfirewall firewall” instead. For more information on using “netsh advfirewall firewall” commands instead of “netsh firewall”, see KB article

            <p>It would take some extra effort to actually delete the Themes folder and if you did the reply from the Microsoft engaged alleged "expert" will not help you replace it.</p>

    <title>Touch screen not working after Windows update. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rainhamd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touch screen not working after Windows update.</h2>
                    I have an Acer Aspire R7 and have had touchscreen problems since a few weeks after I got it. Initially the touchscreen worked fine, then it stopped, started, stopped started etc. It would work fine for a few days, then just stop. After spending hours on
 the phone to Acer, posting on here etc, I eventually gave up trying to resolve the problem (if I add up all the time I've spent on this I'm sure it would be about 20 hours!), and put it down to a dodgy connection to the screen. It stopped working at all many
 months ago, then a few weeks ago I realised that the function had returned! Today the touchscreen was working fine, then I had a notification that my laptop needed to restart for Microsoft updates. I left it to restart and update, but then when I signed in
 again the touchscreen function had stopped working!! It has to be something to do with the Microsoft update. Please, does anyone have any ideas?

<h2>            Memory use by Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    <p>I'm running WLM Version 2011 (Build 15.4.3555.0308) under Win Vista/64.&nbsp; A couple of times recently, I've received a notice on my screen informing me that my 'memory is low,' and that I should close and re-open WLM.&nbsp; On both recent occasions, I wasn't doing
 anything noteworthy in the program; all mail had been read and filed or discarded, and nothing was waiting to send.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the typical memory usage for WLM?&nbsp; Right now, with the program running but simply sitting there, Task Manager tells me it's using 92,460 K of "Memory (Private Working Set).&nbsp; Is this typical, and why should it change with nothing happening?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear about this issue about your payment method not being able to be added to your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this the only payment method that you have put on the account or have you put others in the past from the same bank?</p>

<h2>            Certificate Templates on the client side</h2>
                    <p>
Hi,<br />
<br />
Good day to you all! I hope this is the right place to ask this.<br />
<br />
I have a few questions related to how certificate templates are being stored and distributed under AD CS:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>How do the clients get a list of applicable certificate templates&nbsp;</strong>from the enterprise CA, which is shown at the time when a new manual certificate enrollment is performed (e.g., someone goes to certmgr and request for a new certificate)?</li><li><strong>How are certificate templates being stored&nbsp;</strong>on both the CA side and the client side? Is there a directory that the templates reside in? Or are they just a collection of Windows registries (e.g.&nbsp;Software\Microsoft\Cryptography\CertificateTemplateCache
 under HKCU and HKLM)?</li><li><strong>Is it possible to&nbsp;programmatically read and parse certificate templates on the client side</strong>, ideally via some Microsoft provided public API? I am asking this because sometimes it is useful to check, verify and debug that&nbsp;<br />
a) clients are getting all the expected templates;&nbsp;<br />
b) the content of templates are as expected (particularly useful if there were templates of duplicated names, or an old template has its setting changed but the name is kept);&nbsp;<br />
c) applicable clients are indeed getting the same list of templates.</li></ol>
<p>
Please bear with me as I am a rookie to AD CS.</p>
<p>
Thanks!</p>

</span></span></span><span>Do you remember making any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try the following methods to check the status of the issue.</span></p>

            <p>Hi&nbsp;Santosh Rai,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - The User Profile Service failed the logon</p>
<p>2 - I created so many accounts, local, not local, admin, regular, even using prompt command...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not showing up the new user on&nbsp;<strong><span><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList&nbsp;</span></span></strong>that's the main point, I can do a thing to solve it cause it just does not create the profile. No
 user files are created...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read someone used this to solve it http://www.tweaking.com/content/page/windows_repair_all_in_one.html</p>

    <title>Socket 1151 MB, Windows 7, USB controller - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alfred_bowman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Socket 1151 MB, Windows 7, USB controller</h2>
                    <p>I decided to build a PC using the latest CPU technology. &nbsp;That meant using a Skylake CPU on a Socket 1151 motherboard. &nbsp;I wanted to run Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't install Windows 7. &nbsp;The &nbsp;installation proceeded to the point where it was necessary to use the mouse. &nbsp;The mouse didn't work and the installation came to a screeching halt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reviewing the MB manual, I gleaned that the integrated USB controller (made by Intel) requires a driver that Windows 7 doesn't have. &nbsp;That's when I learned of slipstreaming, which is something I've never done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured it would be a cold day in you-know-where before Microsoft released such a driver for Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before attempting slipstreaming, I tried to think of a way to finesse the problem. &nbsp;Are there such things as USB 3 mice and keyboards that the USB controller could operate? &nbsp;What about installing a USB 2 PCI/PCIE port card in the expansion bus in the hope
 that the Windows 7 installer would find it, install it, and use it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that if I were to attempt slipstreaming, I would have to find and download the USB driver that the port requires.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my dilemma.</p>

            Hello Alfred,<br />
<br />
<br />
Installing a USB 3.0 mouse or keyboard may not work on your case as Windows 7 doesn't have a built-in driver for USB 3.0. Also, before installing a USB 2.0 PCI/PCIE port card in the expansion bus, it will be best to consult the Motherboard manufacturer first.<br />
<br />
If you have other concerns, just let us know.

<p>Thanks for your response. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just learned that Microsoft has pretty much foreclosed running Windows 7 on a Skylake-based PC anyway by denying updates. &nbsp;So, it will be &nbsp;Windows 10 for me.</p>

<p>with avi there is sub codecs it is very important to stick with pure avi format if using that</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also you can use small programs that does batch jobs like Super@ and convert any format to any format including xbox formats'</p>

<h2>            Overheating and restarting, especially with multiple browser tabs open</h2>
                    My computer has had a problem with overheating since I bought it. I got a new heatsink, which helped things a little. During most activities, including gaming, the temperatures seem to not get too high. However, I notice that if I open several tabs in
 an internet browser, the temperatures will get as high as 65 c and then my computer will restart itself. Any advice?

            You don't say what processor your have.&nbsp; I assume it's a desktop PC.&nbsp; 65C is at or near the limit for most CPUs, and some will tolerate heat more than others.&nbsp; Have you checked in Event Viewer for any clues?&nbsp; If overheating is the culprit, you might need
 to (a) make sure that there's good contact between the CPU and the heat sink (over the thermal paste) (b) clean out the inside of the case, making sure that dust isn't blocking the fan grates and (c) leave the PC running with the side panel off for a while
 to see if the extra ventilation makes a difference.&nbsp; If it does, you might need more airflow in the case.&nbsp;

            <p>I'm not very good at this, but I will tell you what I can.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My processor is AMD FX(tm)-8350 Eight-Core Processor 4.00 GHz with 32 GB of ram.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I looked at the event viewer it showed that there were over 90,000. Is there something specific I could search for?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the paste is good. I actually replaced the original fan and had someone who does this for a living put it in for me. Taking the side panel off can decrease the temperature.</p>

</p><p>Not much relating to heat in the event viewer logs but you do have close to 50000 errors regarding your broadcom driver in the last 3 days.&nbsp; It MAY be part of the problem but there is no definitive proof.&nbsp; I would install the newest broadcom driver and see
 if it fixes the issue.&nbsp; Another question does the problem happen in safe mode with networking?</p>

<div>Ok.. Did it seem l like the Package I sent you above installed properly without giving you any errors?<br />
<br />
If so. Then lets try this next.<br />
<br />
Go to start, control panel, unistall a program.<br />
<br />
Now, how many&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Microsoft C++ entries do you see here? And which years, and X 86 or 64 versions do you see?</div>

</div>
<div>Thanks, your missing two.. The 2005 and 2008 64 bit versions.<br />
<br />
Please install this.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21254</a><br />
<br />
and afterwords, install this<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=18471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=18471</a><br />
<br />
Then restart the computer.. Then install this<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15336</a><br />
<br />
Then after, install this one.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=2092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=2092</a><br />
<br />
Now, you must restart the computer again..&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Then for good measure , Install this final program<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851</a><br />
<br />
Once all this is done.. We must unfortunately restart one final time..<br />
<br />
Then, try to install Flight Gold.. Same error? No error?<br />
<br />
<br />

<div>Ok.. Your getting the error when you try to install the actual downloadi itself?<br />
<br />
Or.. The flight sim?<br />
<br />
If its the actual download.. Then something is wrong with your C++ packages.<br />
<br />
And we should<strong>&nbsp;uninstall all of</strong>&nbsp;them.. And then follow the steps below from scratch.<br />
<br />
install this.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=21254</a><br />
<br />
and afterwords, install this<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=18471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=18471</a><br />
<br />
Then restart the computer.. Then install this<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15336</a><br />
<br />
Then after, install this one.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=2092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=2092</a><br />
<br />
Now, you must restart the computer again..&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Then for good measure , Install this final program<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851</a><br />
<br />
Once all this is done.. We must unfortunately restart one final time..<br />
<br />
Then, try to install Flight Gold..&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<div>1. Un-install or completely remove FSX garbage.<br />
2. Insert DVD-1 and go to SDK folder and run setup.exe<br />
3. After it's done, we need to install SimConnect mannual, to do this&nbsp;<br />
3.1 Goto 'Program Files' folder<br />
3.2 Goto 'Microsoft Games\Microsoft Flight Simulator X SDK\SDK\Core Utilities Kit\SimConnect SDK\lib'<br />
3.3 Run SimConnect.msi<br />
4. After that done, Install the game as normal (Run setup.exe from DVD1)<br />
<br />
Check if you have latest Visual C++, else download it here<br />

            <p>Hi, I have now found out what the problem was. It wasn't office exactly. Rather having just reinstalled windows 7, windows update was not functioning properly. Hardly any updates had been installed. I had to run the 'windows update diagnostic' program from
 Microsoft support. Once that had fixed the update&nbsp; problem about 180 updates were installed. Once they were installed the problem with the error mesage was solved. I don't know which update fixed it but one of them did.</p>
