<h2>            WD My Passport not showing up on my Lenovo Yoga 2-in-1 11, Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have a MyPassport that I had previously used for files on my MacBook Pro. When I switched to my current laptop, I simply saved everything on my MyPassport to access it later, but now I have run into a problem. My computer recognizes that a device is plugged
 in, shows that it has Set Up the new device, and shows it under "Devices and Printers"&nbsp;as well&nbsp;as in Disk Management.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Beyond that, however, I can't access it or any of the files on it. Can anyone help me? What do I do to get it to show up on this screen? I don't want to lose any of the files on it.

            <p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that Windows 10 downloads to D: Drive and I will be happy to answer your query.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be due to insufficient space. However, if you think you have enough space in C: Drive, let's&nbsp;manually change the download location and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following steps apply in Internet Explorer:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;C</span></span></span><span>lick on <strong>Tools </strong>
and select <strong>View downloads</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In View downloads window, click on
<strong>Options</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d. </span></span><span>Now enter default download location and click on
<strong>OK </strong>button. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Create a new <strong>Download </strong>folder in <strong>C:</strong><strong> drive</strong>, manually copy and paste in the location. Also make the same drive as default location following the above steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, refer to: </p>

 445GB free, but my Windows 10 download was going to my D Drive, where there was virtually no free space. Anyhow, I cannot get Windows 10, for free anymore.</span></p>

<p>Hello StephenSantos,</p>
<p>I am wondering whether there are universal problems with downloading WINDOWS 10? and other upgrading issues? Thanks for reading my problem belwo.</p>
<p>I have a DELL INSPIRON laptop which <em><strong>was</strong></em> running happily with WINDOWS 7 Home Premium installed
</p>
<p>I give below the background:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Last Monday I needed the latest version of WORD rather than WORD STARTER 2010 in order to printout a document.</li><li>So reasonably I opted for a "free trial version of OFFICE 365 2016" (1 MONTH) available on MS website&nbsp;ON THE LAPTOP. This took some 3 hours with many prompts and screen messages saying, "your computer will start and restart a number of times...". I was
 told that this was normal.</li><li>I suspect WINDOWS 10 was also downloaded(partially?) and is conflicting with my installed WINDOWS 7. I did not opt for WINDOWS 10!</li></ol>
<p>RESULT: NO VERSION OF WINDOWS WILL now RUN ON MY LAPTOP. All I get is a blank screen with a flashing pointer, nothing else. I
<strong>can</strong> access SAFE MODE with command prompts &lt;type&nbsp;HELP&nbsp;for a full list&gt; but not SAFE MODE with networking on Win 32 bit. Have not got any installation disc for a clean instal because laptop was purchased with WINDOWS pre-installed...perhaps a
 WINDOWS upgrading disc can be used?</p>
<p>
</p><p>GUIDE TO PROBLEM RESOLUTION: What I suspect has happened is that there are some registry settings from WINDOWS 10 interfering with WINDOWS 7 (or vice versa) so&nbsp;some WINDOWS files are now corrupted/partially installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there someone out there who could offer any help? I believe in the simplest and most effective of computer/software guidance. Perhaps a vital code for a registry setting is required? Many, many thanks in advance.</p>

<p>If your payment method is tied to a subscription, you'd need to replace it with another payment method first, or just wait until the subscription ends (call phone support to disable auto-renewal if you want to wait it out:

<p>Be sure to cancel the auto-renew *before* you see the charge on your bank account as by then it may be too late to request a refund. (For myself it wasn't charged until 30 days after the 'billing date')</p>
<p>If you do opt to call them to cancel the auto-renew be sure to have all the information listed from the above page handy.</p>
<p>Hope everything works out!</p>

<h2>            Kernel security check failure on my new laptop &#58; ASUS ZENBOOK UX51VZA</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have encountered this problem wi th my new laptop.<br />
<br />
I don't know if it is because of drvers problem or bad RAM hardware....<br />
<br />
I tried to search some program like memtest that could check the RAM Memory for Windows 8 but I found none.<br />
<br />
I can provide the file error in the c:\windows\minidump if necessary.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help<br />
<br />
Kind regards.<br />

            <span>Most likely a driver bug where a driver tried to free the same kernel memory object twice. Or something corrupted the list of memory objects. (this can be caused by issues with RAM, or a bad driver that overwrites into memory that is should
 not)&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>the problem is hard to track down because by default the checks are not done at the time the driver asks to free the memory but at some time later when the system actually tries to free up blocks of memory.</span><br />
<span><br />
</span>
<div><span>if you know what driver you suspect, you can run driver verifier on it and turn on checking and it will bugcheck when the actual problem occurs. Problem is for a graphics driver it will really slow down your driver and may actually obscure
 the issue and make it harder to find.</span><br />
<br />
<span>-and again it can be other drivers that actually stomp on memory and change links in the linked list data structure.</span><br />
<br />
<span>- and it can be virus that do this on purpose to gain access to kernel data structures.</span><br />
<br />
<span>I will recommend the following:</span><br />
<span>check your OS files by running&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>sfc.exe /scannow</span><br />
<span>then start updating 3rd party software that has device drivers</span><br />
<span>free virus scanners screw up a lot, then old software that has drivers.</span></div>

            It will be great if you can send me the minidump for deep analysis and to reach conclusion.

<h2>            Slow Windows 10 Search</h2>
                    <p>Hi community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 home edition search is extremely slow. I'm based in a region that doesn't support Cortana (Australia) so that feature is switched off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Start Menu search is extremely slow. I find it easier to browse and find the apps myself. But finding the more traditional Windows options like Control Panel is difficult so ideally would like to improve things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already rebuild my Index and ran the Index Troubleshoot Wizard which didn't come up with any results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm only using the built-in Windows Defender for anti-virus. Tried a SFC /scannow just to see if it had any bugs. Came up clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
                </div>

            <p>From the Search Index, try to remove all HDDs, except the ones with apps installed. Then rebuild it. If that makes it faster, you can try to re-add the other drives.</p>

            Hi haydnguy,
<br />
<br />If you right click it and choose delete does it delete?
<br />
<br />If not, right click and choose Permissions
<br />
<br />Choose your user account in the resulting dialog and give yourself full control
<br />
<br />Then try deleting that key again . . .

    <title>BSOD Whilst Installing Windows 10&#58; VIDEO_DXGKRNL_FATAL_ERROR - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> asmith_91  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD Whilst Installing Windows 10&#58; VIDEO_DXGKRNL_FATAL_ERROR</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been attempting to upgrade my Windows 8.1 machine to Windows 10 but the installation process is always interrupted at the same point (at 93% of the Drivers installation process) by a BSOD with the same Stop Error Message: VIDEO_DXGKRNL_FATAL_ERROR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had a bit of a Google around the place which has resulted in me attempting the installation procedure without GPU drivers installed, with specific GPU drivers installed (eg, only Intel Graphics, only nVidia, most recent, 2-3 previous versions). But
 these efforts haven't made the slightest bit of difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding to this, crashdumps aren't being created at all. EventViewer is showing Event ID 46, pasted below. Attempting to fix this has also been rather unfruitful. As far as I can tell, crashdumps are set up correctly, with adequate pagefile resource and WERS
 service has not been disabled.</p>

            <p>So after quite a lengthy process of uninstalling all Graphics Drivers (nVidia and Intel) and reinstalling one or the other and running the upgrade process, I managed to update
<em>to</em> Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, updating Windows 10 is now revealing the same problem, and nothing I can do seems to fix it. It's really frustrating as it is quite a lengthy process when the update software has to download and ready itself before the actual updating can begin.</p>

            <div>Hi</div>
<ul>
<li>What is the antivirus program installed on the computer? </li><li>Do you receive any error message?</li></ul>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>I would suggest you to disable any security program on your computer and check if it resolves the issue.</div>
<div>After checking for the issue you need to re-enable the security program on your computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> Running the computer without firewall or the anti-virus software is a potential threat to the computer; make sure to enable the security software after completing the troubleshooting steps and after identifying the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2: </strong></div>
<div>I would suggest you to place your computer in clean boot and try installing&nbsp;updates and check.</div>
<div>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:<br />

            Both did not work...I feel that since I am unable to uninstall IE9 and it is showing error, even updates are not working because it might not be able to modify the existing installation.

            <div>Hi,</div>
<ul>
<li>Does this happen only with Internet Explorer updates?</li></ul>
<div>You may follow these methods:</div>
<div><strong>Step&nbsp;1:<br />
Run the System Update Readiness Tool (Checksur.exe).</strong> <br />
To do this, follow these steps: <br />
1.&nbsp; Download and run the System Update Readiness Tool. This tool runs a one-time scan for inconsistencies that may prevent future servicing operations. For more information about how to download and run the Checksur.exe tool, click the following article number
 to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/947821</span></a><br />
2.&nbsp; Try to install updates again.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>Try performing SFC scan on the computer.</div>
<div>SFC /scannow is a super-useful command you can use in any Windows version. When the SFC (System File Checker) command is used with the /scannow switch, the tool will scan all of the important Windows files on your computer and replace them as necessary.
<div>Missing and corrupt operating system files (like many DLL files) are arguably the biggest cause of major Windows issues. Considering that, plus the fact that SFC /scannow is completely automatic and very easy to use, the tool should usually be one of your
 first troubleshooting steps.</div>
<div>Refer:</div>

            Above steps did not work.
<div>The problem occurs only for IE9 update.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I am sure it is happening because windows is unable to modify the IE9 installation because I am unable to uninstall IE. I tried from command prompt(run as admin) and gets error access denied. Operation failed error 0x80070005.Also if go to turn off windows
 features to turn off IE it shows no options, completely blank!</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 crashes repeatedly</h2>
                    <p>I have&nbsp;HP Pavilion Notebook with windows 10, recently the windows started to crash several times.. the last minidump file was today before couple hours, and it shows Unknown_Image.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last thing, this issue started after updating the windows with the recommended drivers from HP Support assistant, since that I have made the reset for the laptop twice, but it`s useless... I would really appreciate if you supported me.&nbsp;<br />

<p>There were several different stop errors reported involving several different drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Driver Verifier appears to be enabled so I would suggest to disable the Driver Verifier as it is skewing the results and may be causing system instability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To&nbsp;disable the Driver Verifier:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Key + R &gt; type <em>verifier.exe</em> in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; Delete existing settings &gt; Finish</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, from one of the dump files:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>BugCheck 1A, {8887, ffff980004e182a0, ffff9803038a03f0, 700}</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Probably caused by : hardware_ram</strong> ( ZEROED_PAGE_CORRUPTED )</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>That error as well as that&nbsp;there&nbsp;were several different stop errors and drivers involved point to a hardware issue with the first suspect the physical RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try testing the RAM with a memory checker such as Memtest86+:</p>

    <title>AHCI driver installation fails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lilbro  say:</h3>
<h2>            AHCI driver installation fails</h2>
                    I have a Gigabyte GA-MA770T-UD3 (1.0) BIOS Vers. F9G. When I try to load the AHCI driver I downloaded from Gigabyte, I get an installation failed error every time. If I set the BIOS to AHCI or not, the driver still fail to install. If I leave the BIOS
 set to AHCI Windows freezes at the swirling dots screen and I have reboot and change the BIOS back to IDE. If I go to Device Manager as suggested in another post, there is no entry for SATA drivers or controllers even tho' all three of my drives are plugged
 into the SATA ports on the mobo. So far, there nothing I've found that will solve this problem so I can properly set up my Samsung 859 Pro SSD. Suggestions?

            <p>1st,after a BIOS update,a pc shutdown is prefered.Also,BIOS settings usually,</p>
<p>by default,do not have SATA controller,or RAID installed,one has to manually set</p>
<p>for this in the BIOS..Also,no matter which HD type one uses with that pc,its not</p>
<p>drivers the pc looks for,its simply activating the BIOS,everything is "plug &amp; play"</p>
<p>and/or youre adjusting a controller setting (on or off),drivers are a windows</p>
<p>adjustment,&amp; the BIOS configures the set-up to run for windows..</p>
<p>Either way,try this link for more.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 2 is Blazing Hot After 2-Hour Skype Session - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim lewis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2 is Blazing Hot After 2-Hour Skype Session</h2>
                    <p>Wanted to report that my Surface Pro 2 became extremely hot during a two-hour Skype 2-way HD video chat with our daughter on 3/1/14 (all available updates applied).&nbsp; Suggest that Microsoft work harder to maintain a satisfactory internal temperature ABOVE
 ALL and to alert the user to extreme situations like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had a 2-hour Skype session over high-speed Wi-Fi.&nbsp; Both our daughter and we were using HD webcams (ours was built-in SP2 cam).&nbsp; Started out on battery at about 55% charge.&nbsp; Somewhere roughly an hour into the chat SP2 alerted that battery was low (set to
 notify at 25%).&nbsp; So I dutifully plugged in the AC.&nbsp; At the end of the 2-hour chat, I touched the back of the SP2 to close it and was alarmed at how warm it felt.&nbsp; The utility program CPUID said that the SSD temperature was 100 deg F!&nbsp; The processors were something
 like 145 deg F (or more) - don't remember.&nbsp; I was so shocked at the SSD temperature when the room temp was 70 degrees F!!&nbsp; At no time did I hear the SP2 fans come on but then I might not have noticed due to nonstop chatting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've only been through something like 23 equivalent-full recharge cycles with my SP2.&nbsp; Before my "hot" little Skype session, the wear level on the battery was usually showing 0% to 1% battery wear-level.&nbsp; Now it's at 3% wear-level for the several days since
 by either CPUID or running "powercfg /batteryreport" at the Admin Command Prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Li-ion batteries are degraded by exposure to high temperature.&nbsp; I was looking forward to using my SP2 for Skype video chats with relatives.&nbsp; Perhaps Microsoft has deliberately minimized use of the SP2's fans to create the illusion of a quiet-running tablet
 and to not interfere with Skype chats.&nbsp; My system cooling policy is set to ACTIVE both for Battery and Plugged In so I expect much better cooling from the fans, especially when the device is running on AC and the heat generated by charging is going to contribute
 to the overall heat of the battery.&nbsp; At 70 deg F room temperature with the processors in the upper part of the upright tablet, the system ought to be able to maintain a lower overall internal temperature, especially for the battery, than that of the processor
 unit itself, which is naturally going to heat up from the workout&nbsp;of processing HD video to and fro over the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After my hot little video chat, I will certainly not be recommending the&nbsp;Surface Pro 2&nbsp;as the device to get for any processor-intensive tasks unless one likes blowing wads of money on devices with irreplaceable batteries.&nbsp; If Microsoft is going to make a
 machine that runs hot, they'd better make one with a battery that can be replaced at a very reasonable cost.&nbsp; Or how many more 2-hour video chats per week can my SP2 endure?</p>

            <p>145f is what, little over 60C? thats not even remotely massively high temperature. cpus can easily go over to almost 100C, but usually thermal systems kick in long before that for user confort. in the surface's case, the chassis acts like a radiator and
 heats up very well, similarly to metallic chassis laptops like macbooks, that do get very hot indeed. 100f for the ssd temperature also doesn't mean much, especially considering its not a mechanical drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>your points over the battery might have some merit, but it is a necessary evil for a compact form factor. Personally, i see my battery levels fluctuate up and down all the time so i don't really look at them with much interest other than observing long term
 trends.</p>

</p><p>I'm not worried about either the processor or the SSD temperatures per se.&nbsp; Since Microsoft provides no way to read the battery temperature directly, I'm presuming that&nbsp;the battery temp is&nbsp;AT LEAST as hot as the SSD temperature if not even hotter since the
 battery has the charging juice flowing through it as well as being heated by the frame conduction as you note.&nbsp; And an implicit consideration is that the room temperature is only 70 deg F.&nbsp; In the summer we let our house rise to 80 to 85 deg F as we live in
 a very dry, hot part of Texas and could expect cooling bills of $400 to $500 a month otherwise if we tried to keep the houe in the 70-75 deg F range (3400 sq. ft. house, outside temps 100 to 110 deg F sometimes).&nbsp; So if the battery is at least 100 deg F at
 70 deg F room temperature, how hot is it going to get at 85 deg F room temperature?!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do agree that I'm raising the alarm a bit early.&nbsp; To find out the truth, I need to keep on cooking my SP2 in 2-hour Skype chats and see how long the SP2 battery can last.&nbsp; But I don't want to do that.&nbsp; Another thought that has since occurred to me is that
 maybe Skype programming itself is at fault.&nbsp; Microsoft has said that the SP2 only has one microphone and it's placed where it is to minimize audio interference from the fans when they kick in.&nbsp; Could it be that some "bright" person at MS decided when running
 Skype to suppress fan activity as much as possible to give a better Skype Experience (thus screwing the SP2 battery in the process?!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I should be looking for a utility that makes the SP2 fans run when I want them to.......i.e., could set the fans to kick in when my SSD temperature (or ideally battery temp) reaches a certain point.</p>

            <p>You are well under the designed operating temps... I've run my SP2 since release (October) regularly at 80C (Microsoft's CPU throttling point)&nbsp;with high CPU/GPU usage for hours on end without any issues.&nbsp;The device is designed to run at these temps all day,
 but won't get any hotter.&nbsp;You might not have heard fans because&nbsp;60C isn't that&nbsp;hot by mobile component standards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a SP1 before I upgraded to the new SP2&nbsp;and it ran even hotter when pushed regularly&nbsp;for the year I had it, due to Ivy Bridge simply running hotter than Haswell, without any issues&nbsp;or noticeable&nbsp;loss of battery life.&nbsp;These are fantastic little devices
 packed with power, heat is normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As posted above, 62C is much cooler than I typically have mine and is well below the temp Microsoft chose to start throttling.&nbsp;By their very nature of using a i5 full speed CPU with GT cores running at 1100mhz, temps will be much higher than regular tablets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another note, by using Skype on battery, it is draining the battery creating heat as well as using the CPU...&nbsp;and then when you plugged it in the battery was making additional heat while charging back up. When I run intense programs I plug power adapter
 in first and the rear casing stays noticeably cooler as the battery isn't getting hot while draining or charging.&nbsp; I don't use Skype however so not familiar with how resource intensive their app is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck and enjoy.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the feedback on your experience.&nbsp; AFAIK, the SP2 ALWAYS runs off its battery.&nbsp; It's not smart enough as some laptops. are to switch to running on AC directly when it's battery is fully charged, for example.&nbsp; So I'm not sure your advice really
 works to begin a Skype session plugged into AC because one is presumably still going to be draining and recharging the battery simultaneously, generating heat in the battery along with heat provided by the processor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a good article on maintaining Li-ion battery life: says to avoid running at full charge, avoid high temperatures and very low temperatures.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/169669/debunking-battery-life-myths-for-mobile-phones-tablets-and-laptops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/169669/debunking-battery-life-myths-for-mobile-phones-tablets-and-laptops/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, when running any laptop at home on AC for prolonged periods, I always remove the battery and keep the battery at 40% to 50% charge when not in use for prolonged periods.&nbsp; I do lose the advantage of UPS function for my laptop during sudden power outages
 by not having the battery in so I put it back for critical updates, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even Microsoft in its advice on preserving Surface battery life warns against exposing the device (and battery) to high temperatures.&nbsp; Says the upper operating limit is 95 deg F (35 deg C, which means I shouldn't use my Surface devices (or my Nokia 1520)
 outside during summer in Texas!).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/battery-and-power" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/battery-and-power</a></p>
<p>(see very last section on Battery Care)</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me there is not much difference to a device that gets very hot by taking it outside at &gt;95 deg F (35 deg C) and a device that gets very hot from intensive use.&nbsp; Seems to me a bit of Pollyanna to say that these are tough little devices designed to take
 the heat when Microsoft is specifically warning to avoid abusing the battery with excess heat.</p>

            <p>While I completely agree in theory with these battery care instructions and even removing when not in use, I don't in practice or reality... to me it defeats the purpose of having these new longer lasting batteries if I'm never going to use them, so I accept
 that I'll lose a bit of life over the time I own and use the device.&nbsp; I haven't removed a laptop battery in 10 years, and even after a year or two of general laptop usage and extended times plugged in sitting on a desk, battery life is still only marginally
 different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My SP1 held up well, and didn't ever show any noticeable battery life reduction after about a year of daily usage, with temps regularly running at 70-80C on the CPU.&nbsp; From all I've read, the SP1 and 2 both share the same batteries, and are top shelf units.&nbsp;
 I have noticed over time that the reported battery wear will fluctuate up and down 5-10% , so I don't really put much stock in what it actually means.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me the operating temps is exactly that; the recommended external temperature range the devices are designed to operate in.&nbsp; Based on that, I fully expect my SP2 to run just fine doing anything without&nbsp;battery&nbsp;damage or shutdown if I'm in that range regardless
 of what internal temps are... and at 95F I'm sure they'll be running at 80C when pushed and the CPU will throttle as needed to not heat up further.&nbsp; I can vouch that I've yet to have my SP1 or 2 shut down due to heat, where as my IPAD will regularly shut down
 in the hot cockpit of my plane in the summer sun.&nbsp; Granted, we are talking about battery issues so that's neither here nor there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And finally, my reasoning for plugging in before doing anything CPU intensive is to prevent the battery from draining quickly.&nbsp; When pushing the CPU/GPU, I can easily drain the battery in a little over an hour, and of course this creates loads of heat that
 we both know the battery hates.&nbsp; Plugged in, it floats the charge and will often say something along the lines of "98% Plugged in, Not charging" and the power adapter is supplying the power instead of the battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said all that, would I prefer an easily accessible and removable battery?&nbsp; Of course! :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: For the record, when the CPU or GPU is running at 70C+,&nbsp;I'm not doing&nbsp;normal&nbsp;office tasks.&nbsp; Benchmarking, BF4, Planetary Annihilation&nbsp;type games&nbsp;etc with the GPU running at 80%+usage constantly.&nbsp; I've never seen any internal temp pass 80C, the CPU
 will throttle first as designed.</p>

            <p>I'm an older retiree on a finite budget so I want my $1400 256 Gb SP2 to last at least 5 years even though the technology will be incredibly obsolete by then, it should still be an excellent computer for most purposes (and admittedly I'll still be able to
 use it on AC when the Li-ion battery no longer holds much of a charge)..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think Li-ion battery technology has improved much over the years.&nbsp; There have been recent articles in the NY Times that the Li-ion battery is still the Achilles heel of mobile devices both in terms of capacity and long-term longevity.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Microsoft
 web site for Surface used to say that the battery will last through <strong>hundreds</strong> (not thousands) of recharges but eventually need to be replaced, (meaning if you want to pay $479 out-of-warranty, you'll get a refurbished device as a replacement).&nbsp;
 There has apparently been a "cleansing" of references to the finite lifetimes of the Surface/Surface Pro&nbsp;batteries as I can no longer find the description on the MS site (might hurt sales, eh?!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not worried about the CPU temperature at all.&nbsp; It's the battery temperature.&nbsp; With an Android device (I have several), there are great widgets to set alerts for high or low charge levels, high or low temperatures, and you can set the alerts to gently
 or flagrantly alert you continuously when you reach a limit (Win8 alerts cut out after about 5 rings/chimes for battery life purposes.&nbsp; Great!).&nbsp; Clearly Android recognizes the importance of battery monitoring whereas Microsoft doesn't.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen the "plugged in, not charging ....." message down at 50% charge or so, so I'm not sure it means all that much except the OS still has to get with it reporting on actual device status.&nbsp; If you carefully read the forums, you'll find that the SP1
 and SP2 do not have switching power supplies: the current to run the device always comes from the battery and the power adapter always charges the battery.&nbsp; So the message you see may simply reflect that the power adapter for reasons of not wanting to exceed
 a voltage, overcharging the battery, etc., has elected to stop charging the battery even though it's not fully charged or it might be a bug in Microsoft software.&nbsp; That status indication has been reported as a bug by some users:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro2-surfhardware/surface-2-pro-plugged-in-not-charging/373cf050-4b10-49b5-88d0-d64970820029">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro2-surfhardware/surface-2-pro-plugged-in-not-charging/373cf050-4b10-49b5-88d0-d64970820029</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Plugged in, not charging is not listed as an official status indication for Surface batteries, either:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/battery-meter-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/battery-meter-frequently-asked-questions</a></p>
<p>(see second linked item on what icons mean)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another observation in forums is that Lenovo and Sony are smart enough to have power supplies that can be switched to stop charging a battery running constantly on AC at 80% (or whatever you want) to spare the stress of charging the battery to 100%.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
 expensive Surface does not.&nbsp; The expensive Power Cover will just dump all its charge into a Surface, whacking the battery up to 100%, rather than let you bleed charge in up to a predetermined level or run entirely off the Power Cover battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the point of all this is that in selling a relatively expensive device with an irreplaceable battery, Microsoft ought to do everything it can to let the user optimize the life of the battery including providing better controls/monitoring over battery
 temperature and charge level rather than run with the philosophy that the device is going to be obsolete in a few years so who cares.....&nbsp; I do when it cost me $1400 a pop plus hundreds more for accessories.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Might have found the answer to why a Surface Pro 2 can be close to 100% charge, e.g., 98% charge, and deliberately show "plugged in, not charging."&nbsp; From the Microsoft Blog "What's New in the Surface Pro 2," there is a paragraph stating that the battery
 will still be functional (doesn't say to what degree) after 1200 full charge/discharge cycles.&nbsp; And, more importantly relative to the above, the same paragraph states that the firmware is designed to avoid shallow topping off cycles that are very deleterious
 to battery life, meaning you drop to 98%, then immediately start charging to 100% again and round and round you go.&nbsp; So would seem to be an undocumented feature that charging is switched off for some part of a shallow discharge cycle from 100% to avoid repeatedly
 recycling short distances near 100% charge.&nbsp; Says battery charging is managed.&nbsp; Doesn't say switches to AC to avoid battery charging......MICROSOFT: It pays to ADVERTISE!&nbsp; The # of cycles and the charge managing are nice features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another note, extending my Don't Get Your Battery Hot/Protect It's Life rant, here are two more great links.&nbsp; The first from LifeHacker basically culls from Battery University.&nbsp; The second from Battery University explains what's going on around 100% charge
 and why spending a lot of time around there plugged in&nbsp;is not good for the life of your Li-ion battery.</p>

            <p>Some quick notes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Surface Pro's screen tends to get hot the longer it's lit up, especially with the brightness turned up and also especially if the power profile is on 'high performance'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen will get hotter if there is more white on the screen than other colors, so if you can choose a different color background for Skype than the default white that may help a bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Surface Pro is in your lap or your hands, that may be harder on the unit&nbsp;getting good airflow than if it's just sitting easel-style on a tabletop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find that the 'balanced' power profile still runs the Surface Pro 2 very well--you might consider switching to this profile as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That won't keep the Surface Pro from getting hot during a continuous 2-hour Skype session, but it might reduce temperatures or delay the worst of the heat by a bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps!</p>

 with my Surface Pro, though.&nbsp; The great thing about the webcam is that it's internal GPU offloads video processing from the computer so if I used it with my Surface Pro 2, there probably would not be so much internal heating (and maybe less battery drain if
 its dedicated GPU is more efficient at video capture/compression?!).&nbsp; But my Dell laptop is hooked up to a 20 inch external monitor so I get a much better picture of my video caller than I do on my tiny albeit Hi-Res Surface Pro 2 screen.&nbsp; The device is not
 the latest and greatest webcam but can be had for about $70 on the Internet so it's a great compromise in price/performance and reviews of some of the other newer webcams suggest that might not work as well in practice as this device that's been around for
 a while.</p>

 the signal is bad, is slow and after 10 minutes there is no internet again. Also happened that the 'limited ascces' thing show up, and once the networks didnt even had any name, SSID problem or something. So except working correctly it did everything.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It is not a router problem, because it behaves exactly the same everywhere. The drivers are updated and I have started it in safe mode and still the problem persists.&nbsp;</span>

<div><span>Im getting really frustrated and I dont want to format the laptop. So, please help? Anybody has an idea?</span></div>

            <p>Hi Vikitoria,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you update the network drivers by visiting the manufacturer's website?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This issue may occur if the Enable IEEE 802.1X authentication for this network check box is selected. If this check box is selected, but there is no server to authenticate against, the connection is disconnected. If you reestablish the wireless network
 connection, it disconnects again after a short time.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1:</b> </span></p>
<p><span>Disable IEEE 802.1X authentication </span></p>
<p><span>To disable IEEE 802.1X authentication, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span> </span></span></span><span>Click Start, type ncpa.cpl, and then hit Enter.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span> </span></span></span><span>Right-click your wireless network connection, and then click Properties.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span> </span></span></span><span>Click the Wireless Networks tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span> </span></span></span><span>Under Preferred networks, click your wireless network, and then click Properties.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span> </span></span></span><span>Click the Authentication tab, click to clear the Enable IEEE 802.1X authentication for this network check box, and then click OK two times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Remove and re-create the wireless network connection</span></p>
<p><span>To remove and re-create the wireless network connection, follow these steps:</span></p>

<p><span><span>g)<span> </span></span></span><span>Under Choose a wireless network, click the wireless network to which you want to connect, and then click Connect.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the above steps does not help&nbsp;you may&nbsp;update the Router firmware from the ISP and check.</span></p>

====================================<br />
On an XP system...you should be able to copy the <br />
original (unedited) photos from the following folder:<br />
<br />
XP System:<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\&gt;user name&lt;\Local Settings\Application<br />
Data\Microsoft\Windows Photo Gallery\Original Images<br />
<br />
If the folder is Hidden...try the following steps to unhide it:<br />
<br />
Windows XP -<br />
Go to...Control Panel / Folder Options / View tab.<br />
Tick..."Show Hidden Files and Folders" / Apply / OK.<br />

<p>hi again,</p>
<p>t'was as you said, except that the file was in 'windows photo gallery' rather than 'windows live photo gallery' for some strange reason, and now it lets me revert, however.........</p>
<p>hope im not bothering you but, it does not let me see adjustments in real time; only after it has been 'saved', after which i can see the adjusted picture&nbsp;and revert again.</p>
<p>once i move the adjust buttons, the image goes completely black/disappears; any ideas?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

=============================================<br />
I can only guess this issue is occurring on the new system?<br />
Which version of Windows are you running?<br />
<br />
I would suspect that your video driver may need to be updated .<br />
<br />
One way to verify a video driver issue is to reduce the Graphics <br />
Hardware Acceleration.<br />
<br />
See the following articles for instructions...<br />
<br />
(272193) PI: How to Troubleshoot Graphics Issues<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=272193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?kbid=272193</a><br />
(scroll down to : reduce the graphics hardware acceleration setting)<br />
<br />
Lower hardware acceleration<br />
<a href="http://help.aol.com/help/microsites/microsite.do?cmd=displayKC&amp;docType=kc&amp;externalId=15391" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://help.aol.com/help/microsites/microsite.do?cmd=displayKC&amp;docType=kc&amp;externalId=15391</a><br />
(Windows 7 / Vista / XP / 98 / ME / 2000)<br />
<br />
If you reduce your Graphics Hardware Acceleration <br />
and realize an improvement, it's an indication that you <br />
need to update your video driver.&nbsp; Improvement or <br />
not...be sure to return the acceleration slider to Full.<br />

            <p>I am having the same problem with &nbsp;ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery missing from the Device manager every time I reboot my Acer 5755G laptop. The problem is without it running my laptop turns off without a warning when the battery runs out and these
 is also now way of knowing when it is going to happen. Re-<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">scanning for new hardware loads it again but I always forget to do this and run out of battery. I am worried that this problem is going to kill my battery as it must be running
 down too low then recommended. This never happened with Windows 7 64bit but after upgrading to Windows 10 64bit it is happen 100% of the time.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues with Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to run the power troubleshooter and check. Follow the below steps:

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the search, type Power and then <strong>run the Power Troubleshooter.</strong>&nbsp;
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>

<p>Can you get into safe mode? Restart your computer and immediately start tapping F8, on your keyboard before the boot process reaches the welcome screen. If it fails to enter safe mode the first time, try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are successful in entering safe mode, use system restore to take your computer back to a time before you installed the app.</p>

<p>Prueba borrado de cache. Pon tu dedo en el botón de inicio de la consola por 10 segundos hasta que se apague. Luego espera otros 30 y vuélvela a encender. Después de haber intentado esto reinstala el juego. Puede que te funcione :D.</p>

<h2>            how to improve the performance of my laptop</h2>
                    <p>hello</p>
<p>i have a lenovo ideapad 330-15ikb with intel i5-8250u. 1.60ghz, 8GB RAM and windows 10 home 14393 with bios version 8tcn44ww. I also have intel uhd graphics 620 of 4178 MB and vram of 128 MB. With these configurations my laptop works fine without lagging.
 I have installed windows 10 pro 17763 and the bios is same (8tcn44ww) as it is the latest bios version. After installing windows 10 pro the performance of my laptop was reduced and some times hanging. its taking time to sign in and even opening my computer,
 transferring files. Every operation, application got slowed down.&nbsp;<span>So now I am looking for answers on how to improve my performance.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you in advance</span></p>

            2&nbsp;way to do this ....<br />
I'd say the&nbsp; <strong>1st method is most feasible</strong> :<br />
<br />
1. Do a system restore. Take the <strong>date </strong>when you did NOT have such problem as your&nbsp;<strong>restore point</strong>.<br />
<br />
<span><span>Start button &gt; search box, type&nbsp;<strong>system restore</strong> &gt;press Enter key &gt; uac prompt &gt; click Choose a different restore point &gt; Next &gt; select the date as your restore point,
 click it &gt; Next &gt; Finish<br />
Sit back and wait. The machine will re-start when it is done.<br />
<br />
2. Rest your cusor inside the vertcle " toolbar " ( it's called Taskbar, not toolbar ), right click &gt; see if there is a checkmark at " Lock this Taskbar ", if yes, un-check it &gt; now left click inside the taskbar and HOLD &gt; drag the cursor towards the bottom
 &gt; make sure you checkmark " Lock this Taskbar "<br />
<br />

<p>clicking on rotation does NOT fix&nbsp;a taskbar problem</p>
<p>using rotation is for a screen including icons, writing, with&nbsp;everything&nbsp;turned sideways, not for just&nbsp;a taskbar that has moved elsewhere</p>

This also means .ISO media (which is a digital replica of a disc) will also be delivered at a slower pace. This decision is partly because Microsoft wants Windows Insiders to stress test the new Windows Update mechanism for updating to revisions of Windows 10 in the future. This will be a new part of delivering revisions of the operating system in the future to both businesses and consumers. For persons who prefer to upgrade using physical media, this will continue to be an option available. In this article, we take a look at using that option.">How

            Hello! I am a Microsoft Independent Advisor, I would love to help you out!
<br />
<br />So to clarify you are trying to open the installer from onedrive?
<br />
<br />I think the best thing to try is to download the most recent installer from discords site, save it to a local filepath like your desktop. Then right click on the icon and select "run as administrator"
