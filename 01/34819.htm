<h2>            Xbox one headset constantly picks up background noise, even in a silent room.</h2>
                    <p>Today I got off the phone with Xbox support and explained my problem, they told me that the problem is 'super weird' and informed me to start a new thread to seek help from the community and also so that they could pass the forum onto their engineers.<br />I'll explain the problem, when in a party chat, either alone or with friends, my headset is constantly saying that the microphone is making noise even in a completely silent room. This normally wouldn't bother me, but this has a knock on effect of picking up all background noise, the smallest things, even just turning on my desk chair, my friends have reported being able to hear my chair spinning even though it is as quiet as can be. As I said, I spoke to an engineer and he said that the problem was 'super weird'. I have already purchased a new controller and a new headset, cleared my MAC Address, and tried 5 different WiFi connections, all with different ISP's.<br />If anyone has any help, that would be more than appreciated.&nbsp;&n

            Hello.
<br />
<br />It appears that this USB/AUDIO board on the front panel of your tower has cables that connect it to the motherboard. According to HP advisory document, these cables could loosen over time. Please take a look at this HP advisory document to get the full details and troubleshooting steps:

<br />
<br />If any of the suggested does not work, you might want to speak with a local computer repair shop to diagnose the hardware.
<br />
<br />I hope that helps

            In addition you can run the HP hardware diagnostics by powering up the PC while pressing the ESC key.  See if it reveals more about the hardware problem.
<br />
<br />Type Device Manager in Start Search, click on Sound devices, are any in error?  Update the Sound driver from the HP Support Downloads webpage for your exact model or serial here:  <a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers</a>
<br />
<br />If no newer, in Dev Mgr on Sound device Driver tab, uninstall the sound drivers, restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Type troubleshoot in Start Search, open Troubleshooters, run Sound PLayback and Hardware&amp; Device troubleshooters.

<h2>            Network printing causes explorer to crash</h2>
                    I am having trouble printing to a Xerox printer that is attached to a print server on our network. I have installed the latest print driver but no help. I can print to the printer if I plug my computer into it directly (USB), but not over the network.
 I have tried different IP address and different ports. When I try to change the settings on the printer Windows Explorer stops working and has to&nbsp; restart. This is a recent problem - I have printed to this same printer many times. No new software has been
 installed. Help!!

            Definitely do straight IP printing.<br />
<br />
You didn't mention if you had any security software running.&nbsp; I would also try to disable it and see if printing starts flowing again.<br />

    <title>Always booting from the wrong drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> openclosed123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Always booting from the wrong drive</h2>
                    <p>Background:</p>
<p>My PC froze and upon reboot it said system repair failed and just looped until I manually selected a disk to boot from. It lets me boot from an old backup disk (what was my main disk when I first got the PC) but now won't let me boot to what is my new disk
 that has windows installed. During the crash it scrambled my drive letters so the reason it was failing startup was because it was pointing to an external harddrive as the first boot option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How my HDDs are set up:</p>
<p>Drive 0 C: original HDD with windows, hasn't been used in 6 months</p>
<p>Drive 1 D: extra storage HDD</p>
<p>Drive 2 F: external HDD extra storage</p>
<p>Drive 3 G: extra storage HDD</p>
<p>Drive 4 J: new windows installation partition K: extra storage HDD</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drive J, prior to the crash was drive C and J was assigned to the old drive. Now, no matter what HDD I select on bios boot, it always boots to C:, the old HDD. I need to be able to boot to the J: drive. I've ran chk dsk scans, I've opened cmd in boot and
 reassigned the letters so they were swapped (it "worked" but didn't actually change them once the PC booted), I tried unplugging the old drive (the PC wouldn't boot to any drive then), and a number of other things, but it just will not boot to the new drive.
 I can otherwise access it normally. I can open the J drive and look at the files when booted in C:, I just can't get it to boot to J:. I tried downloading a 3rd party program for disk management but it won't allow me to mark disk 4 as "active". That may be
 because it is GPT instead of an MBR, but it has always been a GPT because it is more than 2TB.</p>

<p>K: is a partition on Drive 4, I had been booting to the J: partition for 6 months and suddenly it is no longer allowing it. J: partition is simply a clone of the C: drive, windows installation and all (except at this point the C: drive is 6 months in the
 past file-wise).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its purpose is not to dual boot, but was to replace the old drive altogether because it is over 8 years old and will surely fail eventually.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the drive letters are showing in Windows doesn't really mean much when booting... But the fact that they changed indicates something else changed\ happened as well...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What determines which drive your machine boots from is determined by a UEFI Bios setting... If it is not correct the machine will not boot...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the HDD boot order was somehow changed by the crash... The thing is that with a UEFI System windows boots from "Windows Boot Manager"... Not a "Partition" on the HDD like you may be accustomed to...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does boot to a partition, but the Windows Boot manager itself is on the EFI partition that is usually between 100MB and 300MB...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that you may need to temporarily unhook your old OS drive to correct your boot problem... In reality it is not a good idea to have two drives with a OS on them unless the machine is specifically setup to "Dual Boot"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not possible to "Hide" or switch the "Active" status on a GPT drive... That option does not exist with GPT...</p>

<p>Please <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/post-a-screenshot-of-disk-mgmt/04a8ef8c-c882-404e-a26b-89867c4ddf55?tm=1441932228382">
Post a screenshot of Disk Mgmt</a> which we read like a doctor reads Xrays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the OS presently on J was installed correctly from booted media then it should also display as C when booted.&nbsp; Was this the case?&nbsp; If the other hard drives were attached during install it will normally update the boot files on the original Windows drive
 instead of creating its own in order to Dual Boot.&nbsp; We must see how this is configured to know for sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Often it's only necessary to install <a href="http://neosmart.net/Download/Register/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
EasyBCD (click Download - no Name or Email required)</a> to delete the drive failing to boot in Edit Boot Menu tab, then from Add OS tab add it back again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
But let us see the screenshot first because there are many possible complications.&nbsp;

            It was the case when it was working, but I can't get it to boot to J (thus making it C) at this point. I'll post an image in a moment when I plug the old drive back in (it doesn't want to boot without it right now).<br />

<p>Well, unfortunately after I plugged the original hard drive that it was booting to back in, it no longer wants to boot at all so I am unable to get to disk manager now. The best I can do is a list partition from command prompt for the disk I'm wanting to
 boot from:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Partition ###&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Size&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offset</p>

<p>Partition 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 297 GB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 228 MB</p>
<p>Partition 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recovery&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 459 MB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 297 GB</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Partition 3 is the J: drive and Partition 5 is the K: drive</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you even see "Windows Boot Manager" in the Boot Device list of your BIOS or your Boot Options screen... Your boot files should be on partition 2 100MB, but will appear as Windows Boot manager...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible you may need to boot with recovery or installation media and try a Startup Repair...</p>

<p>The presence of the EFI System and MSR reserved partitions on the old install means it's a UEFI install to GPT disk.&nbsp; When you installed to the new disk it used the existing EFI System partition to Dual Boot so that when it was detached the new install cannot
 boot.&nbsp; Had you not wanted the old install you should have unplugged it's drive during install.&nbsp; If you did anything else like installed the new Windows in Compatibility mode please advise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if this were the Legacy BIOS&nbsp; with an MBR disk we could simply mark&nbsp; the new install's partition Active and run a few Startup Repairs or Rebuild the BCD to get it booting.&nbsp; But for UEFI there must be at least the EFI System partition to boot it.&nbsp; You
 can create one by shrinking the Windows partition from the left by a minimum 500mb I'd recommend.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then try either a bootable partition Manager or Diskpart from the Command Prompt of the booted Windows media to create the EFI System partition:&nbsp;

</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can create it but it still won't boot then try a Startup Repair, or <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-rebuild-the-bcd-in-windows-2624508" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Rebuild the BCD in Windows [10 to 20 Minutes]</a> as a last resort to export <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
and</span> rebuild which often works.&nbsp; **Note that the commands given to copy boot files must reference the EFI System partition and not Windows partition.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When doing these operations unplug all other physical drives.&nbsp; Plug the target Windows drive into SATA 1 which should be DISK 0. &nbsp;&nbsp;

            Well, I followed the EFI tutorial and it seemed successful until I rebooted. Now even the Windows Boot Manager won't work so I can no longer get to command prompt to try rebuilding the BCD.<br />

<p>This is not a standard place to find this sort of information. I never even realised that the "Profile Icon" contained a menu, but what would I know. I have only been using MS Windows since v2.11 (yes 2.11, not 3.11).</p>

<p>You can still reach those controls in a more traditional way in those releases (Skype 8.x). Simply access it from the menu bar using your keyboard with or without the mouse. This can be accomplished by pressing the ALT key.&nbsp; ALT F will get you to File.&nbsp;
 ALT H will get you to Help. ALT H B will get you to the About under Help. </p>

<h2>            Somebody has changed my LIVE accounts email and password.</h2>
                    
<p>Ok so, ill try and explain this as clearly as i can. And if you got any questions, just ask. I want to get this solved and am willing to explain this as clearly as i can.</p>
<p>I found out a while ago that somebody has somehow changed my LIVE accounts email address and the password too. I have no clue when this happened, i just discovered this few weeks ago. There hasn't happened anything yet as far as i know, but if my xbox breaks
 down and i want to recover, i can't and the account has my credit card on it too andi cant delete it since i dont know the password. I have the account on my Xbox and i can play with it and all, but as i said if something happens that the account gets deleted,
 i cant get it back since i dont know the password.</p>
<p>And also, when i log with the email and password i used to have before somebody changed them, it logs in with this account from which im posting from. I have been searching from Google and have discovered nothing expect when i searched the email address,
 it referred me to a page of some student from California. http://www.studyinaustralia.gov.au/northamerica/Community/Student-Ambassador-Program/List-of-Ambassadors/2011-2012-Student-Ambassadors/Kota-Uyeda-University-of-Queensland As you can see, the email matches.</p>
<p>I wanna know if its possible to get this account back, because i have put alot of money in it and i can also provide all the information you need. I have phoned the support and they locked the account for few days a while ago and said they cant help. They
 didnt even ask me for any information.</p>
<p>This is really frustrating, so please help me Microsoft!</p>

            <p>Hi! It is odd if the one you've talked to on Xbox LIVE support did not ask you for any information regarding security question or the number to your mobile, if you have set up one of these options to secure your Windows Live ID that is. If you have set up one of these options then they should be able to retrieve your Windows Live ID.</p>

<p>That's the problem here. The guy swapped hes email to my account and created a new blank account (this one) where he put my details... i don't know for real, but this is what ive come up to in my head... And this is why i can't get the account back with
 the security questions or phone number... I can't get it why they just can not switch the details back to mine if i can tell them nearly everything of the account and when it was created or the credit card details that i have on the account. Damn this is frustrating...

<p>Yeah i know, but i thought that if i could get the account back to my control i wouldn't have to cancel it. Can you say that if i give the support a call and explain the thing and give them all the info i got, could i get the account back into my control?
 The guy hasn't been using this account at all, he just changed the email dunno why. No one ever has threatened to hack my account or anything.</p>

<p>Can you explain more about what you mean by "glitchy"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, what kind of computer is it and could you please post your audio hardware ID here?</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>1. Run Device Manager</p>
<p>2. Go to Sound, video and game controllers</p>
<p>3. Double-click your audio device</p>
<p>4. Go to the Details tab</p>
<p>5. Select Hardware IDs</p>
<p>6. Right-click to copy them and then paste them in a reply here</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            I have a Toshiba Satellite C650D laptop and I am having the exact same issue as well with my audio. By glitchy, it's this robotic hitching that occurs every 2-3 seconds for me while watching/listening to anything that involves audio. I could be playing
 a game, watching YouTube, listening to Soundcloud, it happens everywhere.<br />

            <p>Hi to everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>here is the 1st method </p>
<p>which is to install windows once again</p>
<p>2nd method is</p>
<p>to uninstall the current audio driver and install another latest driver for example I would ask you to install realtek versions as it is much popular</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>try both the methods let me know tis is useful or not</p>
<p>thank u</p>

<p>Thanks Steve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is great advice. If your computer is less than 2 years old, your first stop should be the manufacturer's web site to get the latest driver. If your machine is older than two years, take a look at my blog post for some audio troubleshooting tips:</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have query where I would like to understand the difference between the SIP address, UPN and PrimarySMTP for a account setup for Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the Sign-in Address and Username that is to be used to login to Lync or Skype for Business Online? Is it the SIP or UPN or Primary SMTP for both Sign-in and username, considering all 3 are different (example - SIP: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, PrimarySMTP:
 *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and UPN: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If the PrimarySMTP, UPN and SIP are all different, will it cause a conflict or issue while signing into Lync or Skype for Business?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the above scenario, the user's mailbox is on the On-premises and has a MailUser object on Office 365 with Skype for Business Online (E3) license assigned.</p>

            <p>Hi Probjot,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SIP address the address used by Skype for Business to locate users and thus communicate. UserPrincipalName is your account’s sign in address. You use it to sign in to OWA, Outlook client etc. SMTP address is the sender address displayed at recipient side
 when you send emails out. </p>
<p>Usually, we’d better keep these three address same. Otherwise, unexpected errors may occur during the daily works.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is highly recommended that you keep these three addresses the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brook </p>

<h2>            Windows Hello REFUSED my PASSWORD, held my computer for ransom and FORCED me to use a PIN</h2>
                    <p><strong>I am beyond angry right now</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 computers, one for work and one specifically for artwork. The one for artwork, my all-in-one MSI is the one I tried to sign into today with my password, however it's saying I have to create a PIN. I used to have one but it was useless and annoying,
 so I took it off and was able to get into my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skip to today where I tried to sign in with my PASSWORD, my correct PASSWORD and the PIN window straight up REFUSED to let me even ACCESS OR USE MY OWN COMPUTER WITHOUT CREATING A PIN.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I am not kidding, my OWN COMPUTER was held RANSOM BY
<strong>MICROSOFT</strong> until I made this useless, stupid, idiotic PIN.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can understand why I am furious by this, as I am certain this is a legal violation by all rights. Why is THIS PC being held ransom until I make a PIN to sign in when I have stated REPEATEDLY that I
<strong>DO. NOT. WANT. A. PIN.</strong><br />
<br />
I have a PASSWORD. A PASSWORD that works FINE. I am the ONLY PERSON who uses this computer, you have NO RIGHT to lock users out of their PC to force them to create a PIN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am furious, and I want this resolved <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em><strong>ASAP.</strong></em></span></p>

<p>After spending a while with a very helpful Technician, I'm going to put a copy here of how to get rid of Windows Hello PIN so it doesn't give you the same grief or lock you out of your computer like me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, open your Windows Settings and go to Windows Defender/security settings (or you can type 'Windows Defender settings' in the search bar in the taskbar and select it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on 'Windows Security'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on 'Account Protection'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scroll down to 'Windows Hello' and somewhere on there, you should see 'dismiss'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on that, and you should never be prompted for a PIN ever again.</p>

<h2>            CROPPING PHOTOS WITH WINDOWS</h2>
                    I lost my Windows 10 when my operating system crashed. I was pushed all the way&nbsp; back to Windows 7 which does not have great photo cropping software. I got Windows 10 free as a promotion from Microsoft, but I do not think I will get that offer again. How
 can I get just this Editing Software as it is so much better and more advanced than the 7 software? Can someone let me know if I can get this advanced software on 7, or do I need to sign up for the whole ball of wax and pay for the entire Windows 10 suite,
 or, if at all possible, I could at least get a reduced rate for Windows 10 so I can use this software? Thanks.&nbsp;

            You can go back to Windows 10:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Digital License
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Reinstall by Performing a Direct Clean Install
<br />
<br />If Windows 10 was already installed and activated on your system, just proceed to perform a direct clean install as described in the following articles.

<p>Wow!<span>&nbsp; </span>I see 36,564 Events under Application and hundreds of Warnings and Error messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see 60,823 Events under System logs and hundreds of Warnings and Error messages.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 and 7 file sharing&#58; Cannot connect to a network&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> firedan1176  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and 7 file sharing&#58; Cannot connect to a network&#63;</h2>
                    I have a "home server" setup on a windows 7 machine (Note I'm not using Windows Home Server but I am simply using Windows 7 as a 'home server'), and it's worked ever since I've gotten windows 10 on this computer. When I am able to see the 'server' on my
 Windows 10 machine, I am not able to connect to it. I cannot see my Windows 10 machine on the server, though. They are both on the same workgroup. When I try to join a HomeGroup on my Windows 10 machine, it says none is available, but when I try on my server,
 it says there is one available but on my computer before I got 10. I've been trying for hours to get the two to work, and no success. HomeGroup isn't working, none of it is! Can someone guide me in the right direction? I'm sure firewall isn't the issue....

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow these steps and try to run the HomeGroup troubleshooter:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> on the keyboard.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Control panel</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Type “<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>” without quotes in the Control panel
<strong>search</strong> box.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> and click on
<strong>View all</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>HomeGroup</strong> troubleshooter and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also follow the same steps and run the Shared folders troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue is not resolved, I would recommend posting your query in the TechNet Forums:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>That are not the problem which you gave solution.</p>
<p>It is Cumulative Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3081424) error.</p>
<p>If you can't update that, you can't file sharing or networking.</p>
<p>Please go to the following link</p>

<p>
</p><p>delete the ProfileImagePath which is not yours.</p>
<p>Then, update that by windows update or manually downloaded update.</p>
<p>After that you can do as you like.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade - explorer.exe generating Network Activity - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> satessa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade - explorer.exe generating Network Activity</h2>
                    <p>After the WX upgrade which was very smooth, started to note Network Activity with Explorer.exe on checking with the Resource Monitor. &nbsp;Similarly checking with TCPVIEW there are lots of UDP connections with explorer.exe doing remote send and receive. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For completion I did a listing with Process Explorer, similarly there are over 20 remote connections, with SYN_SENT, ESTABLISHED and LISTENING.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for virus scan I did a Quick Scan with Windows Defender but nothing is showing up and more than that it seems like too elaborate sort of virus for now. I have noted in prior posting going back 5 years there have been reports of explorer.exe &nbsp;corruption
 leading to inappropriate NETWORK ACTIVITY and FIREWALL REQUEST, but wonder if there is more updated information.</p>

            I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10.
<br />

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            Hi RafailS, moving your program files form the Windows.old folder will not work, sorry!
<br />
<br />You should probably roll back the latest update to recover those
<br />
<br />Then is you feel these major updates are not or will not work on your system, maybe you should turn off Automatic Updates to have a stable system . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            Hi Rafail, a lot of the time this is caused by a hardware incompatibility . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

            Hello, 
<br />Try reinstalling the Printer.
<br />Right-click Start and select Run.
<br />In the Run dialog box, type in control printers and press OK.
<br />Locate your printer in the Printers section, Right click it and select Remove device.
<br />Restart your PC.
<br />If you have a setup media of the Printer driver(This is usually a CD or Setup program supplied with the Printer), run the utility and let the Printer Install.
<br />If you do not have a setup media, try adding a printer manually using "add a printer" button in the menu bar. It should automatically detect and Install the Printer.
<br />After the Printer Installs, try printing a test page to see if it works as desired.
<br />Retry the task again.

<br />Would like to look at Rollback logs.
<br />
<br />Share Setuperr.log and Setupact.log named from 
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Rollback\ 
<br />
<br />and 
<br />
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther
<br />You can open the folder by typing the path in Run or showing hidden files and viewing through explorer.
<br />
<br />Use Onedrive/Google Drive/Mediafire to share the files and drop the links in the next reply.

</blockquote>
<p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think most people misunderstand the question that is being asked regarding the Windows 10 Default Font problem.&nbsp; Here are the facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>You update/upgrade from an older Windows version (say Windows 7, 8.1, etc.)</li><li>Update/Upgrade goes well</li><li>You use a browser (any browser: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc) to browse, check mail, etc</li><li>Your browsing info is displayed in CAPS AND DIFFICULT TO READ FONT, like this screen-shot below:</li></ol>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4785db62-1375-4ef9-9d25-bf3a682aca1b" /></p>
<ol>
<li>QUESTION: Is there a setting to change in Windows 10 which will allow browser, email information to be displayed in Arial or some other custom font of the user's choice?</li></ol>
Thanks.
<p />

<p>Sometimes that link is problematic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you could get to that page it will only allow downloading of the Windows 7 installation ISO by entering retail or System Builder product keys so if your system is OEM (it came with Windows installed from the factory) you will not be downloading any
 ISOs from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you can pursue ideas that will work for some systems some of the time or you can pursue ideas that will work for all systems all of the time in which case I would look for ISOs here:</p>

<p>Hey&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me, I'm really appreciating your help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've tried with taking a photo and zooming in but it's just not clear enough. Last few parts I can just about make out but the first few are no good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any more ideas? I see you can buy COA on eBay, is that legal?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>If your 25 character product key it is not readable, you lost it, can't find it or doesn't successfully activate you need to contact Microsoft to get help with activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the product fails to activate you can see if you can activate online or usually the easiest thing to do it talk to an activation expert (an actual human being) at
<del>Microdot</del> Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start button/orb and in the box enter:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>slui&nbsp; 4</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Choose your nearest country (United States in the example), call the toll-free number to speak to a human being:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2ff74b23-213e-4156-ae50-91a1565ea50a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2ff74b23-213e-4156-ae50-91a1565ea50a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't press any keys on your phone, don't respond to any voice prompts, just wait, wait, wait and you will be connected to a human being.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Explain your situation and they should help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If they don't help or can't help just hang up and call back again and the chances are good that you will talk to a different person and eventually you should find some nice person that will help you.</p>
