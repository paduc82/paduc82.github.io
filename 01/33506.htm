<h2>            Lost Bluetooth functionality with &#34;clean install&#34; of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><span>I installed Win10 with the “Windows 10 installation media” DVD over the top of Win8.1, deleting all the partitions (as now there were 5 partitions) and made a "clean install" of Windows10 into the resulting "Drive 0 Unallocated Space".</span></p>
<p><span>This wiped some hardware drivers, at least for the function keys and bluetooth and it would seem also all the other Apps/Drivers installed by the manufacturer (such as Toshiba "PC Health Monitor", etc.).</span></p>
<p><span>However, the wifi seemed to still be working.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I then downloaded the function key drivers from the link above (but European version of the weblink) and running this brought the function keys back to life.</span></p>
<p><span>However, a download for the Bluetooth drivers doesn't exist at Toshiba(Dynabook) and Device Manager in Windows doesn't show anything on Bluetooth (therefore no option to enable an update or reinstall the drivers).</span></p>
<p><span>So, this means that I no longer have a bluetooth connection.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Q. If you know how to reinstall Bluetooth some other way (without doing yet again a full reinstall) then please do let me know.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For background info, my laptop was bought in June 2015. The spec is:</span></p>
<p><span>- Toshiba Satellite L70-B-130 installed originally with Windows 8 (I immediately upgraded to windows 10 when I bought it).</span></p>
<p><span>- Intel i7-4710HQ quad-core 2.5GHz</span></p>
<p><span>- 8Gb RAM</span></p>
<p><span>- Intel HD Graphics 4600</span></p>
<p><span>- AMD Radeon R9 M265X (with 2Gb dedicated memory)</span></p>
<p><span>- It was bought in Luxembourg, settings and control panels comes up in English (as selected during this latest reinstall), and it has a “Belgian (Period)” azerty keyboard.</span></p>

<p>Hello Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see the info provided in my message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows10 was 64bit, and the latest version (version 1903 - downloaded yesterday).</p>
<p>The previous OS was a clean install of Windows 8.1 (Home): though is that relevant given that I deleted all partitions during the clean install of Win10?
</p>
<p>

<p>Great. Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I checked the European site of Dynabook (which I was forced to use in order to input the correct model number of the laptop), bluetooth drivers were available for Win8.1(64bit) but not for Win10(64bit).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was afraid to use the Win8.1(64bit) drivers as I didn't know which type of bluetooth I've got (e.g. Intel, Broadcom or Atheros) and I was worried to corrupt my nice clean Win10 installation (that took me a while to learn how to do).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it that this "TC50182800C.exe" file you have provided is rather the Bluetooth driver for Win10(64bit)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bluetooth doesn't come up at all in Device Manager so I suppose that this will just plug in the gap?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed that in Update History it says:</p>
<p>"Intel Corporation Bluetooth - 10/8/2018 12:00:00AM - 20.90.1.1"</p>
<p>"Failed to install on ‎19/‎06/‎2019 - 0x8024ce0a</p>

<p>Could it cause any damage in case it is for Win8.1 rather than Win10? Or in case my Bluetooth is Atheros or Broadcom?</p>

            The issue is, it block the driver and says no such device exist or not applicable. 
<br />
<br />You can always create a system restore point in advance for peace of mind:<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/53e9cfc9-5a2c-4fc3-afc5-1fdd2e8fa57c?upload=true" />

<p>Ok. Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there by chance some way to know which Bluetooth hardware is in the laptop?</p>
<p>This way I can check before installing the driver, and hopefully avoid causing problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Given that I "clean installed" Win10(64bit) with the “Windows 10 installation media” DVD over the top of Win8.1 (thus deleting all the Win8.1 created partitions</span> in doing so), is it correct that I should install the driver for Win10(64bit)?</p>
<p>Or should I be installing the driver for Win8.1(64bit)?</p>
<p>Or does it not matter which one I install?</p>

            The Toshiba page for this make and model list several different model Bluetooth adapters. So, its kinda hard to determine which one it might have come preinstalled with.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />
<br />Click Machine name at the top
<br />
<br />Click the Action menu then scan for hardware changes then check if it shows up in the device tree.
<br />
<br />Also, click the View menu
<br />Click Show hidden devices
<br />
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Bluetooth
<br />Right click each entry then click Properties
<br />Select the driver tab, click Rollback if its not grayed out.
<br />
<br />If it is grayed out, right click Bluetooth driver then click uninstall
<br />Restart your computer then check if its working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Scroll down to Bluetooth Support Service
<br />Right click it 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab
<br />Click in the Startup type: listbox
<br />Choose Automatic
<br />Click Start
<br />
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Restart your computer then check if its working.
<br />
<br />Other things you can try include the Bluetooth troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to Bluetooth
<br />Click Bluetooth then click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, Restart your computer.
<br />
<br />If not, remove any other Bluetooth devices since they might be causing interference 
<br />
<br />You can also try pairing through Devices and Printers. Learn more:

                    Hello recentally I have been getting multiple types of crashes and I have no idea why, but the blue screen errors I get are system_service_exeception,DPC watchdog violation,page_fault_in_nonpaged_area, and 2 others 1 called memory management and another
 related to memory also, I have reset the computer and I still get these error's. I have no idea what error to tackle because by doing some of the processes to even repair it, it will crash within the time to even finish the problem.

<br />Your RAM appears to be at fault here. If you have multiple RAM sticks, try testing one by one to find the culprit.

<h2>            Bluetooth Battery Level via Battery System Icon</h2>
                    <p>We have all been there when our wireless devices (mouse/keyboard) stop responding. Or in my instance, using the Surface Pen buttons and suddenly they stopped working. You guessed it, my battery in my Bluetooth&nbsp;device died.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it be possible to update either the Bluetooth system tray icon or even the battery icon to display Bluetooth devices that indicate battery levels? As of Windows 10 Build 17639 when the battery level was added to the Settings&gt;Bluetooth &amp; Other Devices
 menu, I find that it is a hassle&nbsp;to have to go to a system menu in order to determine the battery level of connected devices. Making a quick check/lookup on the taskbar would be much more efficient for users.</p>

            Hi Chris
<br />

            <p>Hi Wendy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, we are limited in what we can do to help with lost or forgotten passwords by Microsoft Policy that applies to everyone who answers questions here on penalty of being banned from the Forum.</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/189126" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/189126</span></a><span>.But
 there are some options to try:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Do you have another Administrator account where you know the password that you can login to make the password changes to this account?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>First, make sure that you don't have the CAPS LOCK or NUM LOCK keys activated - this can change what you think you are typing into something else (different case or a number versus a letter) and cause the system to see what you entered as being wrong.
 Try using a blank for the password.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Second, if you have another keyboard you can use with the computer, try doing that. It may be that one of the characters in your password is not working properly on the keyboard or the keyboard is inserting extra spaces or something else that's making
 what you think you are entering not be what you are actually entering.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Third, see if a System Restore can resolve the problem per instructions in:</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940765" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940765</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can enable the built-in Administrator account in Safe Mode, but this will work only if there is no administrator account on the system (in which case one can access the built-in Administrator account through Safe Mode) or you know the Administrator
 password. Try a blank as many who setup computers disable this account and use no password (to prevent this very thing). If there is more than one administrator account on the system, you can use one account to fix problems with the other one or even create
 an entire new profile if required for that account. If you have only one Administrator account on the system and it is the account with the password problems and the above didn't help, then you have a serious problem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, if that doesn't work in this situation the only option we can suggest is to restore the system to factory conditions (or do a clean install). Though too late for this time, next time create more than one Administrator account so you
 have a backup in case something like this occurs again. A clean install will create a new Administrator account. Use it to make a few backups to prevent this from happening again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hopefully, you've been doing full backups and not complete image backups because if you've been doing images, they will retain the lost password information during a restore and will not resolve the problem AND trying to recover just the data from
 an image backup is challenging to say the least (if it can even be done depending on the software and method used). If you only have an image backup, then the best bet is to backup the data manually as follows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can use Knoppix </span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></a><span> with a good ISO copier like:</span><span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></a></span><span>
 along with a blank CD. Boot to the CD. This should give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way - but if you have another account on the system this disk may not be necessary - I'm not 100% sure if you can make a backup as a standard
 user - if not, then you will need to use the disk because while you could copy/paste, you won't have access to everything you want to save whereas that won't be an issue if using the disk) to backup your important data. If using the disk, you won't be able
 to backup to disks unless you have a second CD/DVD drive, so you'll need to consider where you are going to backup to - depending on how much data you have, perhaps an external USB HDD or maybe a high capacity flash drive or even an external CD/DVD burner.
 If that doesn’t work, try slaving the drive to another computer and recovering the data using that other computer to access the disk (in which case you can perhaps backup to that computer's drives if there is enough room and you have a way to access them once
 your computer is up and running). You may need to play a bit with permissions.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Installation Disk or the Manufacturer's Recovery Disk or the Recovery Partition – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps since you don't have the disks and can't make
 them, to get recovery disks which will be quite a bit less expensive than buying a new retail product if you can even find one these days - though more than just shipping and handling).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with many updates pending,... You may also need to re-activate the product
 (it depends on the method used, the Recovery Disks sometimes but not always automatically take care of it - if using an Installation Disk, you will definitely need to re-activate).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Once this is complete (or rather, during the process), you will create an Administrator account. Although the password should be safe and secure (the best is at least 8 digits using a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols)
 but at the same time easy for you to remember (you don't want this to happen again). Soon after you are up and running, create a standard user account for daily use and another administrator account or two for backup and emergencies (to try to prevent this
 from occurring again by having some alternatives - and it's also good in case something happens to your administrator account like corruption (then you have backup administrator accounts to repair the problem, or again you may be in the same boat as here but
 for a different reason).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kosh</p>

    <title>PS2 Keyboard not registering either parenthesis key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robert427  say:</h3>
<h2>            PS2 Keyboard not registering either parenthesis key</h2>
                    <p>I have a Z170 chipset motherboard with a&nbsp;keyboard PS2 connector.&nbsp; I have several IBM Model M PS2 keyboards that recently stopped registering both the left and right parenthesis keystrokes.&nbsp; All other special characters work.&nbsp; The parenthesis keys&nbsp;DO work
 in the DOS window for Command Prompt.&nbsp; I do not know when this behavior started but it would have been recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all of the following with no success:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Turning on and off Filter Keys</p>
<p>2. Removing the PS2 keyboard, both HID&nbsp;Devices in the Device Manager and then scanning for new hardware</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a loss but it is a Windows 10 issue as can be seen by the issue is repeatable with multiple PS2 keyboards and&nbsp;is not an issue in the DOS Command Prompt box.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>No error messages.&nbsp; Everything in Device Manager is normal.&nbsp; I am going to look into Logitech Gaming Software that I installed a few weeks back for&nbsp;newly purchased&nbsp;mouse.&nbsp; There maybe a connection because the Logitech software also has some Logitech keyboard
 functionality [which I don't have].&nbsp; I will try uninstalling the software this evening to see if that has any effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One update - I&nbsp;tried a PS2 to USB adaptor to connect the keyboard and the behavior of the parenthesis keys remained non-functional.&nbsp; I will also try a straight USB keyboard.</p>

            Another Update: 
1. I uninstalled the Logitech Gaming Software and the nonfunctioning parentheses keys still do not work.&nbsp; I installed the latest version of the Logitech Gaming Software with no improvement.

2. Using the on-screen keyboard and the same issue occurs - the parentheses keys, and only the parentheses keys, do not register the keystroke.

3. If I try to type in the code for the left parenthesis [ALT+0028]&nbsp;a&nbsp;question mark in a box is returned.

Any help with this situation would be greatly appreciated.

            Thanks for the suggestion.&nbsp; Although I did not mention it, yes I tried another machine and there is no problem.&nbsp; The fact that the Windows 10 on-screen keyboard exhibits the same non-functioning parenthesis keys&nbsp;tells&nbsp;me this issue&nbsp;is isolated to my one
 machine.&nbsp;

            <p>RESOLVED!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that I had bound the parenthesis keys to a function in the SoundBlaster drivers/software and it was active.&nbsp; Once I unbound the keys in the SoundBlaster software, the parenthesis keys&nbsp;worked as they should.&nbsp;</p>

            As a work-around, You can download Classic Skype and use that. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a> 
<br />
<br />Good news is that Classic Skype is not going to be retired. Its last date in service was 1-Sep-18 and it has been decided not stop the services to Classic Skype for some more time. It would nag you for updating to latest version which is v8 which you will have to ignore and tolerate.

<p>hi</p>
<p>yesterday i ran windows update on Vista (dell laptop) and it was starting to prepare installation. as it was taking too long and i had to go i clicked cancel installation and shut the windows down.</p>
<p>today, i started windows, it crashed twice but finally started. all seemed well until all of the sudden vista crashed, blue screen appeared with the following error:</p>
<p>stop: 0x0000007E (0xc0000006, 0x856df510, 0x8db5d7b4, 0x8db5d4b0)</p>
<p>since then i am not able to start vista at all. i tried to run safe mode, but it crashes every time with blue screen.</p>
<p>i backed up system partition using norton ghost several weeks ago, so i tried to recover it with ghost (it helped every time until now), but it didn't help.</p>
<p>also ran pre-boot diagnostics and there was no error.</p>
<p>i've tried to run startup repair from vista installation dvd but seems it's no use so far. i can't even run start up repair from system, but have to run it from dvd.</p>
<p>so, i'm running out of ideas what to do ... except for format c:\ and reinstall vista</p>
<p>if anyone could help me with some better ideas, i'd appreciated it</p>
<p>thanks</p>

You should check your HDD for errors (chkdsk C: /r /f).<br />
<br />
It is also helpful to take a look at the dumps with the Debugging Tools for Windows.<br />
<br />
Please start the Windows Explorer and go to the folder C:\Windows\Minidump. Next, copy the dmp files to your desktop, zip all dmp into 1 zip file and upload the zip file to your Skydrive [1] and post a link here, so that I can look at the dumps with the debugger
 and to to see the cause of the crash.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check this thread for information using BlueScreenView, MyEventViewer and other methods<br />
to troubleshoot BlueScreens - top 3 replies (+1 other).<br />

<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistarepair/thread/3deab2fa-4000-4136-8c78-a3d22b1db009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistarepair/thread/3deab2fa-4000-4136-8c78-a3d22b1db009</span></a><br />

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<p>Does the system have RAID? If so that is also&nbsp;very suspect.<br />
<br />
This error is usually a driver&nbsp;issue and display adapter (video) driver is the most suspect though it<br />
could be others.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs, hardware (heat) and major software issues<br />
can also cause the error. When you get to the driver section of the troubleshooter use my generic<br />
methods in the next message and then return to the troubleshooter if needed. <br />
<br />
Have you added hardware recently or updated drivers? Be sure to look in Control Panel - Windows<br />
Updates to see if any drivers were updated there. Other lessor possibilities include antivirus/anti-<br />
spyware/security programs.<br />
<br />
When you get to the driver and memory sections of the troubleshooter refer to the next message to<br />
update drivers and test memory and then refer back to the troubleshooter if needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 7E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0x0000007E&nbsp; which is also 0x1000007E</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>The SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a very common bug check. To<br />
interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates a memory access violation occurred.</li></ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the <em>Ntstatus.h </em>file that is located in the<em>inc</em> directory of<br />
the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p>If you are not equipped to debug this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have enough disk space. </li><li>If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the</li><li>manufacturer for driver updates. </li><li>Try changing video adapters. </li><li>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. </li><li>Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. </li></ul>
<p><em>If you plan to debug this problem</em>, you might find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter&nbsp;2<br />
(the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system<br />
was started with the <strong>/NODEBUG</strong> switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly,<br />
make sure that a kernel debugger is connected and the system is started with the <strong>
/DEBUG</strong> switch.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame supplies additional information.</p>
<p>If you do not know the specific cause of the exception, consider the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware incompatibility<em>. </em>Make sure that any new hardware that is installed is listed in the</li><li>Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List. </li><li>Faulty device driver or system service<em>. </em>A faulty device driver or system service might be</li><li>responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts,</li><li>and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error. </li></ul>
<p>If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable<br />
or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup<br />
sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS file system, you might be able to use Safe<br />
Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process<br />
in Safe Mode, you must start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote<br />
control program. If such software is installed, you can remove the service by starting the computer<br />
by using the Recovery Console and then deleting the offending system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help identify the<br />
device or driver that is causing bug check 0x7E.</p>
<p>You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS might to try to resolve the error. You should also<br />
run hardware diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, that the system manufacturer supplies.<br />
For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or<br />
after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is lack of disk space for installation and system<br />
BIOS incompatibilities. For problems during Windows installation that are associated with lack of disk<br />
space, reduce the number of files on the target hard disk drive. Check for and delete any temporary<br />
files that you do not have to have, Internet cache files, application backup files, and<em>.chk</em>files that<br />
contain saved file fragments from disk scans. You can also use another hard disk drive with more<br />
free space for the installation. You can resolve BIOS problems by upgrading the system BIOS version.<br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers<br />
however there are other causes.<br />

You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />

Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party<br />
keyboard and mouse, as well as other major device drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually<br />
by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<br />
For the Vista Memory Diagnostic Tool<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt;&nbsp; Memory - find Memory Diagnostics tool at top of list - Right Click -<br />
RUN AS ADMIN follow the instructions<br />

<p>hi SpiritX</p>
<p>just a thought, if i ran norton ghost to recover the whole c:\ partition, shouldn't it be all ready to work properly as it was at the time the backup was created?</p>
<p>i can't run vista in safe mode, i choose to run vista in safe mode, list of some drivers is displayed and then system crashes.</p>
<p>first time i used vista dvd i was asked to chose what kind of repair i want to do and i chose startup repair. since then, every time i start vista dvd, i'm not able to choose any other action except to run startup repair. startup repair has been performed
 for at least 7 time so far. if i don't use dvd, during the startup process i'm asked to run startup repair or run windows normally. if i choose repair system crashes again.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Running Ghost might work or it might not depending on what the actual cause is. The problem is<br />
that you might corrupt the drive even more if it fails.</p>
<p>Try using the Vista DVD to boot and select System Restore - back to a point before this happened.<br />
<br />
You probably need the help of a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a Best Buy or other<br />
Big Box Stores) or the System Maker's Support.<br />
<br />
The data can be saved by putting the hard drive into another computer as 2nd drive or into an<br />
external USB case. Either should allow you to copy the data to removable media such as CD,<br />
DVD, or USB drives.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>I have two document folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christo&#35;513  say:</h3>
<h2>            I have two document folders</h2>
                    <p>I have just discovered that I have 2 document folders, though not sure how long this has been.&nbsp;I also&nbsp;find the new search app in Windows 10 difficult to understand what is being displayed, and was quite content to locate folders and files in the Win 7 version.
 Though the search facility in early version of windows was far superior to anything we have now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are located as follows </p>
<p>(1) C:/users/name/documents, </p>
<p>(2) C:/users/name/documents/documents. </p>
<p>They do not appear to be identical as some folder titles are missing from the&nbsp;second documents folder (2).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I am having to search both folders to find 'stuff', which is frustratingly time&nbsp;consuming.
</p>
<p>Is there an easy way to transfer folders and files from the secondary documents folder (2), so that&nbsp;the other documents folder (1) holds eveything, without duplicates, so I can delete the secondary one (2), and end my search frustrations?</p>

            <p>Hi Syed,</p>
<p>The search app shows a lot of disjointed references, and is about as much use as a chocolate teapot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered the duplicity quite accidentally when I needed a file again which I had been working on and knew it's name, but could not find it in the folder where&nbsp;I expected to find it. I then carried out&nbsp;a search for the folder from the root and found that
 there were two folders of the same name, but in the&nbsp;two different Documents folders, so both Documents folders do contain folders and files.
</p>
<p>To avoid confusion, I have renamed the documents folder lower down the file tree Documents AGAIN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the contents to be different, but I would like all the files from one folder to be in one location, not two. That would save space on the drive, and search time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is already protected by Windows Defender, which I know is up-to-date as I use Secunia's PSI!</p>

                    <p>Hi - I am having two issues with W 10. I switched from Edge over to Explorer 11 as 11 looked more like my old windows-7 and brought up my favorites in the old left hand pane. When I go into my favorites and go to my Sun Life web site to print off a claim,
 the web site will not allow me to download a print file. If I sign into the Sun Life web site through Edge or&nbsp;Chrome, it will download.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Is there some setting I have to change and where would it be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My second issue in using Internet Explorer 11 as my default is: I have set my taskbar icon to Internet Explorer 11, deleted the taskbar icon for Edge; when I get an email through Outlook that has a link to the internet and I click on it, it takes me to and
 opens it in Edge instead of IE11. Is there a setting I am missing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rob&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Aswin, </p>
<p>Thank you for your help and prompt reply. For the browser issue, I followed your advice and links, to change the default browser to Internet Explorer 11 instead of Edge. Now, when in an email and I click on a link to the Internet, it pops up a window giving
 me a choice of browsers to use - ie IE, Edge, Chrome or App store. The IE is highlighted and it takes me right to IE 11. So this works, however, it would be nice not to have to respond to the pop up all the time and just have it go to the internet via IE.
 Is that possible, or do I just have to live with it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for the print issue, using the change to the default program. I signed into my Sun Life web site three separate&nbsp;times, using Internet Explorer 11, Edge and Firefox from the pop up window. At some point when I ask Sun Life for a print, it comes up with
 a download screen with a Continue or Cancel button. In IE 11, when I hover over the Continue button it just continues to show the Arrow and will not download. When I use Edge and Firefox, the arrow changes to a hand when I hover over the Continue button and
 I get the download and can print it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke with Sun Life and they told me they thought it was the browser I was using, not their problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts or ideas?</p>
<p>Thank you, Rob Byers</p>

<h2>            KB2856373 update failing with error 80070026</h2>
                    <p>I have been attempting to install update KB2856373 and Windows Update has been failing with an error code of 80070026 every attempt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running a clean (March 30, 2013) install of Windows 8 x64.&nbsp; I have run the Windows Update Repair Tool to repair the Windows Update components.&nbsp; It did not find any other issues and this did not resolve the problem.&nbsp; I have downloaded the stand-alone
 updater, restarted my computer to a clean boot and attempted to install it, this did not work.&nbsp; I do not have any other anti-malware or anti-virus software installed.&nbsp; Additionally, I have run the System Update Readiness Tool with no luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            So, I believe that I have traced the root cause of my problem:
<div><br />
<div>My primary hard drive is a 120 GB SSD, as a result, I also have a 1.5 TB traditional hard drive installed. &nbsp;In order to prevent write cycles and to free up space on my SSD, I used symbolic links to redirect C:\Users to D:\Users. &nbsp;Usually this causes no
 problems as everything is redirected without issue. &nbsp;However, in the case of this update, it needs C:\Users to be at C:\Users instead of symbolically linked to D:\Users.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have no idea why this problem occurs, but I figure at least determining the root cause can help those in a similar situation as myself and the MS software engineers resolve this problem with less of a headache than I had.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks so much for your help.</div>

            <p><strong>Do I have the option of delaying the download? </strong></p>
<p>You can configure Windows Update the day before July 29th 2015&nbsp;to check for updates but let you decide when to install them to avoid having the upgrade download automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you set your Internet connected as metered, Windows Update will not download the upgrade.

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d774db80-5327-4641-ad34-6ab82d85c7af" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 8/8.1, click the View Available Network icon in the system tray, then right click your Internet Connection and select the option to
<strong>Set as metered connection.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once this is enabled, then Windows Update will not download the Upgrade on such a connection.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you don't want updates to be installed automatically, you can choose to be notified when updates apply to your computer instead. Then, you can download and install them yourself, or you can set Windows to automatically download updates, and then notify
 you so you can install them yourself. Here's how to change how Windows installs or notifies you about updates:</p>

<h2>            Connected to internet, can&#39;t surf World Wide Web intermittently</h2>
                    I have recently got an infuriating problem that I cannot find the solution to anywhere on the web despite searching for days!!<br />
<br />
While I am connected to the internet (whether wireless or via LAN cable), occasionally the internet pages just stop loading and I cannot navigate or connect to any other webpages. This is despite trying various browsers - it happens on internet explorer, google
 chrome and mozilla firefox.<br />
<br />
When I look to my Networking icon in the taskbar, it still says I am connected ,with the 2 computers and a globe indicating connection to the internet. When I right click this and select 'diagnose and repair' after a while I simply get this message:<br />
<br />
"'www.microsoft.com' is not set up to establish a connection on port 'World Wide Web service (HTTP)' with this computer."<br />
<br />
The only way I can start navigating and surfing the web again is by re-starting the laptop, which is so frustrating when you are in the middle of some work. Also there is no particular time of the day, or anything that I can link to this happening. It just
 seems to happen randomly. Stranger still, if I am logged onto msn or yahoo messenger, I can still see who is online, send and receive messages! I just cannot surf the web using any browsers!<br />
<br />
I tried uninstalling google chrome and firefox, thinking they were the culprits, but it is happening with internet explorer too.<br />
<br />
Help!!!!<br />

            Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting on Microsoft Answers.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
There might be many reason for this issue.<br />
1. Issues with the network adapter drivers<br />
2. Issue with the network adapter<br />
3. Connectivity problem with the Modem or Router<br />
&nbsp;<br />
First I would suggest you to Uninstall and reinstall the Network adapter drivers on the computer.<br />
1. Open the Programs and Features window.<br />
2. Look to see if the device driver is listed. (See screenshot below step 3)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is, then right click on the listed device and click Uninstall, then Yes to confirm.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: Sometimes, you will get a notice to restart the computer to finish uninstalling the driver. If you do, then click on Yes to restart the computer when prompted.<br />
3. Close the Programs and Features window.<br />
Uninstall using Device manger<br />
1. Open the Control Panel (Classic View).<br />
2. Click on the Device Manager icon.<br />
3. Click Continue for UAC prompt.<br />
4. Click on the + sign next to the device you want to uninstall to expand it. (See screenshot below step 5)<br />
5. Right click on the listed device and click Properties.<br />
NOTE: You can also click on Uninstall<br />
6. To Uninstall Only the Device -<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: This will only uninstall the device and leave the device driver still installed for the device.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A) Uncheck the Delete the driver software for this device box.<br />
NOTE: If you do not have this option, then only the device will be uninstalled.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B) Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: Sometimes, you may be prompted to restart the computer to finish uninstalling the driver. If you do, then click on Yes to restart the computer.<br />
7. Close the device manager and restart the computer.<br />
Once the computer is back try to reinstall the driver back on the computer and check with the connectivity<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Also check with the network card.<br />
You can also try contacting your Internet Service Provider with respect to this issue.<br />

Hi thanks for this, if I uninstall the drivers, when I restart the computer, will Windows automatically re-install the drivers for the network adapter. If not, where do I get them from ?<br />
Secondly, I have lots of network adapters: Intel Wireless WiFi Link 4965AGN and Broadcom Netlink(TM) Fast Ethernet, and some bluetooth adapters.<br />
The problem occurs whether I am connected by cable or by wireless - therefore, should I uninstall the drivers for both these?<br />
<br />
Finally, the problem occurs in two different locations with two different ISPs and different routers, so I suspect it is a problem with this laptop rather than ISP/router.<br />
When I am at one location, I am connected by cable with a particular ISP - the problem still occurs. When I am at another location, I am connected by wireless with a different ISP, and the problem still happens.<br />
<br />

<br />
the router settings are fine i think because the problem is occurring in different locations with different routers and different ISPs....<br />
the zone alarm firewall seems to be working fine, i've even uninstalled it and the problem still happens

<h3> michal rek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows firewall block comunication to another subnet</h2>
                    <p>My network has 2 subnets /25 and Server in each subnet. In one of the subnet is computer which is used for managing servers via RDP. But there is problem with firewall on this computer. Firewall allow to communicate within the same subnet but blocks communication
 into (or response coming back?) the second subnet.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/5PkhY.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2f5PkhY.png" /></a></p>
<p>I have tried to set inbound and outgoing rule, allow MSTSC by wizard in main firewall control panel and nothing worked me. What I have done wrong or how to set up it correctly?</p>
<p>I had tested that when firewall is completely disabled communication works.</p>
<p>I had tested that Windows blocks all ports. I can't use FTP and SSH too.</p>

    <title>Drifting Mouse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beejay38  say:</h3>
<h2>            Drifting Mouse</h2>
                    <p>After installing Windows 10 upgrade from Windows 8.1, my mouse pointer has started drifts rather quickly from top to bottom of screen or sometimes from right to left.&nbsp; Once it starts, the only way to stop it and return to normality, is to reboot.&nbsp; This only
 happens when I run X-Plane 10 and Microsoft Flight Simulator X, but once started it even drifts when I've log out of these files and is there in all window screens.&nbsp; Both of these programmes worked fine in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Have a Nvidia GTX 780 Ti Video card and the latest driver for 355.60 for Windows 10.&nbsp; I've been in touch with Nvidia and they are very helpful but unsuccessful up to now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions or help.</p>

<h2>            I was able to download cod black ops map pack until 99&#37; after that it says can&#39;t download map pack&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I live in American Samoa US territory in the pacific so I'm not sure if we are included in the US region. I emaild xbox support regarding my downloading problem and they gave me a "supposed to be" solution for my problem. They asked me to ask a friend of
 mine that lives in the mainland US to download the map pack using my gamertag on their console. My friend was able to download the whole thing and confirmed it to me. So I went to my download history and tried to download the map pack to my console and I was
 able to download up to 99% but after that it says can't download the map pack???? I dont know if this is a region error since we are a US territory and if our physical address is included to US region. Also I'm just wondering if I ask my friend again to download
 the map pack to a flash drive using my gamertag and then send the flash drive to me, would I be able to use the map pack on my console for my online game? Plz help</p>

<p>well it doesn't work to US territory you need to be physically in continential US</p>
<p>you probably missed the part where you actually need the usb drive mailed to you</p>
<p>in theory you could have your friend recover your account (be sure its a trust worthy friend) and then download it onto a xbox formated usb drive then have it mailed to you that way you don't have to mail twice</p>
<p>however you may have to do a drm transfer if you want to play it offline</p>

<p>If I buy a xbox 360 sandisk 8gb flash drive and ask my friend to re-download it using my gamertag and send it to me would I be able to play those map packs on my console down here in my location? Im not interested with offline, I just wanna play the new
 maps online w/ my friends. Thanks for quick response.</p>

<h2>            Log On Broken &#58; error&#58; The User Profile Service failed the logon. User profile cannot be loaded</h2>
                    Well, I decided to create some new accounts on my PC. However, when I attempt to log on to them, I receive an error message saying " The User Profile Service failed the logon. User profile cannot be loaded". I checked one of the help pages which told me
 to use the Registry Editor to fix it, but it was unable to help. Are there any other methods I could use to fix my problem?<br />

<p>There are many reasons as to why they replaced it. License agreements ended or they just wanted to update it, with the newer game. Sadly either one means you'd have to find and buy a retail copy of the original. Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
It's not possible for anyone on this forum to bring back content. Each piece of content has a license attached to it, when a license agreement between a content provider and the content delivery comes to a renewal and it's ultimately decided not to renew it
 the content is pulled. It seems to be in the case here as well. If you'd like it back, speak with the content provider in this case EA to bring it back.<br />

    <title>How do I install&#47;play a PC game on a disc without a cd&#47;dvd - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I install&#47;play a PC game on a disc without a cd&#47;dvd drive&#63; Windows 10</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I recently bought and started using my new Omen 15 laptop in the last month. I got Windows 10 and I've been downloading games on Steam to play so far, but I recently pre-ordered Fallout
 4 and only just realized that when the disk gets here, I'll have no cd/dvd drive to play it with because my Omen doesn't have one... What's the best thing to do? Do I need to buy an external cd/dvd drive, and if so, where can I find one that is definitely
 compatible with Windows 10? Would I need to plug the cd/dvd drive in (with the disc inside) whenever I wanted to play the game? Please help!</span>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community, we appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to inform you that you can check with the nearest retailer and buy the external cd/dvd drive which is compatible with
<strong>Windows 8.1</strong>. Most of the device which work with <strong>Windows 8.1</strong> are compatible with
<strong>Windows 10</strong>. You may also contact the vendor of external DVD and check if it works with
<strong>Windows 10</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would also like to suggest you to copy the data of the&nbsp;game DVD&nbsp;in the flash drive using another computer and then plug the flash drive and install the game. You can also make ISO of the game&nbsp;and run directly
 form Windows 10.&nbsp;If it doesn't work please contact the game vendor support.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information is useful.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>
