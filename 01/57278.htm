<h2>            Skype call to BT landline problem with 1572 service</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp; when trying to ring a landline over Skype you get a message,&nbsp; ***....1572. the number you rang has opted not to receive certain calls. You may leave a message after the tone.***</p>
<p>Is there a way for Skype or the BT Call Protect 1572 service to be modified so that we can still call. It was ok before the 1572 facility was put on the line to stop nuicance calls.</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is possible that there is a restriction with Skype by the telecommunication provider that is the reason why you are getting this error when you tried to make a call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that being said, the best course of action would be for you to coordinate&nbsp; to the&nbsp;telecommunication provider to ask for information about the error you got. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h3> nicholasprussock  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I set up my bluetooth speaker&#63;</h2>
                    I just bought the new JBL GO Bluetooth Speaker. &nbsp;It worked fine yesterday. &nbsp;It works fine for my LG v10 phone, but today it is having trouble connecting to my Dell Inspiron laptop. &nbsp;It says it's connected to 'Audio Gateway'? &nbsp;When I try to set it up as
 the default device, nothing shows up other than the Realtek builtin speaker. &nbsp;I can't change it at all? &nbsp;Anyone have any ideas of how to fix this problem?

            Hi Nicholas,<br />
<br />
<br />
The issue you're experiencing with your Bluetooth speaker might be due to a variety of reasons. One of which is due to an outdated or incompatible driver.<br />
<br />
Just to make sure that we got it right, did the speaker work fine from the same laptop yesterday? Or it's the first time you'll use it with your laptop?<br />
<br />
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026226/windows-fix-connections-to-bluetooth-audio-devices-and-wireless-displa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here</a></strong> are some troubleshooting steps you may take to
<strong>repair connections to your Bluetooth speaker</strong>.<br />
<br />
Let us know what happens next.<br />
<br />

Regards.

<p>Yes Michelle,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The speaker worked fine yesterday and now it doesn't work. &nbsp;I have already tried updating the drivers, and it tells me that my drivers are up to date. &nbsp;The bluetooth pairs and connects my devices, but when I try to set it as the default audio, nothing shows
 up for it in the device manager. &nbsp;Also when i turn it off and back on, it won't connect. &nbsp;I have to remove the device and then add it again for it to connect. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Updating the Bluetooth drivers? Check.<br />
<br />
Have you tried reinstalling it? If not, here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click <strong>Start</strong>, then select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Right-click the driver under<strong> Bluetooth</strong>, then select <strong>
Uninstall</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Restart your laptop to automatically reinstall the drivers. Make sure that you update the driver after re-installation.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You may also check the latest Bluetooth driver from your device manufacturer's website, as these are sometimes different from just updating it in general from the
<strong>Device Manager</strong>. This depends on the device though.<br />
<br />
Since you've mentioned that your Bluetooth pairs and connects your devices, does this mean the issue persists on all the devices you're trying to connect through Bluetooth?<br />
<br />
Let's see if the same issue will occur from a different and <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/instantanswers/5de907f1-f8ba-4fd9-a89d-efd23fee918c/create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">new
 administrator account</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
You may perform a <strong>Clean Boot</strong> to make sure that no applications is causing the Bluetooth issue you're experiencing.

<p>Hhmmm. It really is strange that your speaker worked fine at first but didn't on the next day.<br />
<br />
Were there any changes made within the span of that the speaker works with your laptop until it didn't? If yes, what were those?<br />
<br />
Have you already tried booting your laptop into <strong>Safe Mode</strong> and try to use the speaker? If not, let's consider doing that.<br />
<br />
Starting your PC in <strong>Safe Mode</strong> can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC while using a limited set of files and drivers. Here's how to set your PC in
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>I</strong> key from the keyboard to launch
<strong>Settings</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select<strong> Update &amp; Security</strong>, then<strong> Recovery</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click the <strong>Restart now</strong> button under <strong>Advanced startup</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> when you get into the <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>Advanced options</strong>, then <strong>Startup Settings</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Restart</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>4</strong> or press the<strong> F4</strong> key from the keyboard after your PC restarts to start your PC now in
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You may also run the <strong>Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter</strong> to find and repair problems with your devices and hardware. Make sure that the speaker is connected when you run the troubleshooter.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the <strong>Start</strong> icon, then select <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Choose the <strong>Large icons</strong> option from the <strong>View by</strong> drop down list found on the upper-right part of the Control Panel window.<br />
</li><li>Locate then select<strong> Troubleshooting</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>View all</strong> from the left pane.<br />
</li><li>Locate and click <strong>Hardware and Devices </strong>to run the troubleshooter then follow the next steps.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, by the way, just to further isolate your concern, have you tried connecting other Bluetooth devices to your laptop? If yes, did it work as it should be or the result was the same with your speaker?<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

            I did the first option by putting my computer in safe mode. &nbsp;Bluetooth wouldn't even work on safemode. &nbsp;I tried right clicking the start icon, and control panel doesn't show up. &nbsp;I searched it and the device says its working properly. &nbsp;I updated windows
 10 as it prompted me the day after it was working. Now it doesn't work. &nbsp;I connected my phone to bluetooth and that works, but it's not an audio. &nbsp;I think the issue is I can't change the speaker from the builtin computer speaker to bluetooth speaker anymore.
 There isn't a drop down in the speaker icon to make switch. &nbsp;And when I pair device it says its connected to Audio Gateway. It didn't say that when it worked the first day. &nbsp;It's not a speaker issue, because it works for my phones bluetooth and is brand new.

            Just to triple check that you got the most suitable and updated drivers for your Bluetooth audio, have you already checked the suitable and latest Bluetooth driver and Bluetooth speaker driver from your driver manufacturer's website?<br />
<br />
Taking note that the speaker worked before installing an update, let's follow the steps found on this link to
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/15078/windows-make-older-programs-compatible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">make older programs compatible with the latest version of Windows</a></strong>. You may observe that the steps are pertaining
 to a program, instead, let's make it the latest driver or the driver setup file from the manufacturer's website.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it works.

    <title>Turtle Beach headphones - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> baron spamedi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turtle Beach headphones</h2>
                    
<p>My&nbsp;lovely girlfriend&nbsp;just bought me a pair of Turtle Beach PX5 7.1 wireless RF headphones as its my birthday shortly. (Love ya babe - you're one in a million!!!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are flippin' fantastic!! Just thought I'd mention it incase anyone's been contemplating dropping £170 to get a pair, but worried about whether they actually sound any good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can pair your Bluetooth phone up with them and answer calls using them without interupting or having to turn off game music etc. You can also pair up a bluetooth enabled music player etc and play music through the PX5's that way, with seperate volume
 controls for game sound, Xbox chat and Bluetooth it is really easy to get everything balanced the way you like it. I had been worried about drop outs etc after reading that some people experience clicks and pops with RF headphones due to interference. All
 I can say is so far I haven't had any problems at all with that and the sound quality is significantly better than the Turtle Beach x31 headphones I used to own although the battery life does seem slightly shorter, which is not really unexpected&nbsp; with all
 the extra tricks the PX5's can do. The base unit can also output the Dolby enhanced signal to a pair of wired headphones via a 3.5mm headphone jack on the front of the unit.</p>
<p>They are sturdy and made with better materials than the X31's were. There are two modes: Xbox mode and PS3 mode.&nbsp;Each&nbsp;mode has&nbsp;8 presets&nbsp;besides the standard Dolby Headphones surround sound setting. The presets cover a few different configurations such as
 Bass Boost, Treble Toost and other more unusual settings such as Footstep Enhancer. One clever aspect of this is that you can download new presets or indeed design your own by plugging your headphones into your computer with a USB lead and visiting the Turtle
 Beach website where they have the software tools. I must admit I haven't actually tried the editing software&nbsp;out yet as I'm happy enough just listening to the&nbsp;Main (Dolby Surround) mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I just bought my son a pair of the Turtle Beach XLC headphones recently - the sound quality is fairly poor&nbsp;when comparing them to the PX5's or X31's. It's just basic stereo from the TV headphone socket with the Xbox mic chat mixed in - no surround sound
 here. However they are easy to set up and smaller in size meaning they fit better on a child's head (he's only 9) than either the X31's or the PX5's.&nbsp;&nbsp;And they are much less costly to replace (£18) if &nbsp;they should get damaged.</p>

<p>Honestly - I can't recommend them enough! I really thought my X31's were good but the PX5's are much better than I was expecting to be honest, and clearly better than the X31's.</p>
<p>The other night I was bluetoothing 'Big Iron' as featured in the Fallout: New Vegas soundtrack from my HTC Desire HD to the headphones while playing Black Ops Zombies (an eclectic combination, shall we say) with the young 'un. I was also able to answer a
 phone call without any disruption to the whole process. It's awesome!!!</p>
<p>Cosmic Thoughts and xDADDYx &nbsp;- Thanks for the tip!! I hadn't heard of the XP500's but having just looked them up I see that you can buy a cheap Turtle Beach bluetooth adapter for the PX5's which make them work like the XP500's. Not sure I really need it
 but I might get it anyway! LOL</p>
<p>Whagi - I can honestly say I've had only two very brief (less than a second) dropouts in well over 20 hours of use. No other drop outs or pops at all. I also haven't noticed any interference with my phone using wifi when the headphones are on (I'm not using
 a 'N' router though if that makes any difference) I imagine this may vary depending on individual set ups etc.</p>

<p>OOOOOPS.</p>
<p>Just realised that my old headphones were Turtle Beach X4's (the ones that used Infrared instead of RF signals) and NOT Turtle Beach X31's. The PX5's still kick the X4's backside though!</p>

<h2>            Why does my labtop shut off with still some battery life left&#63;</h2>
                    When I have my labtop unplugged for some time, it shuts off. I understand this as the computer being out of battery. This would be fine, but upon bootup, the computer still has about 30%+ remaining. Why does it shut down with still battery remaining?

<h2>            Problem with Microsoft Account after sign in.</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a problem with an annoying notification window that seems to always pop-up after sign in to Windows 10 Home Edition. I sign in with my hotmail account. However, I'm getting this pop-up telling me there's a problem with my password for my gmail
 account. At one point I must have tried to use my old and outdated gmail account to link Windows 10. When I try and fix the problem (just to get rid of the nag) I cannot remember the password I used back in the day for the gmail account. I think it was originally
 used with my xbox360 or something. Anyway, I don't even want/need the account linked. How do I get rid of the nag for password?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently locked out of the account due to multiple login attempts and failure to answer security questions accurately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to use CMD prompt to delete the account but it doesn't show up (probably because I dont have the psw to add it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the last prompt had something to do with "MS Hello needs help accessing your other MS Account", or something like that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me rid this account without resetting my OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!!&nbsp;</p>

<br />Scroll down to Mail
<br />Select it
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />Click Reset

    <title>Windows 10 ruined my computer&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> juliaj101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 ruined my computer&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 has completely ruined my computer. Every aspect of my laptop experience has changed for the worse.&nbsp;I hate everything about all the interfaces. I have tried every suggestion to fix all the problems it has caused and nothing has worked. The only
 thing left is doing a complete factory reset. Will that get rid of Windows 10? Or should I just chuck it out the window and go over to the Mac side? I've already done the partial reset and all that did was wipe out all my apps and I am still stuck with this
 virus you call an operating system. I can't even use Internet Explorer anymore! Why? Microsoft Edge? No Thank You!!!!!</p>
<p>I have to say this whole thing is very deceptive and shady. Why would this be touted as a good thing? Eliminating any chance for recovery after 30 days. Really? Why?</p>
<p>I only "upgraded" because I was being harassed by your popups. You owe me a new computer, for the time&nbsp;spent trying to fix what you broke, and for the pain and suffering of losing all the apps I can no longer access!!!</p>
<p>I am under no illusions that anyone&nbsp;at Microsoft&nbsp;cares about any of this. I have researched this problem ad&nbsp;nauseum&nbsp;and all the replies from Microsoft can be summed up as "Suck it up suckers!"</p>

            <p>This is a community forum. Nobody from Microsoft here, so you're foaming in front of your fellow Windows 10 users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows 10 is not working for you, just restore a backup of your previous operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't believe in backups? Then we know who the real sucker is. Now you'll have to spend a good half day putting your computer back together:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Copy your personal folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) and anything else you don't want to lose (email, contacts, favorites, etc.) to a USB drive.</p>
<p>2- Restore the factory download to your computer - this erases your hard drive and restores the software that was on your computer when it shipped from the factory.</p>
<p>3- Run Windows Update.</p>
<p>4- Re-install all software you acquired after you brought the computer home.</p>
<p>5- Restore your personal folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had an image backup to restore, this would take about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't avoid Microsoft's advertising any more than you can avoid come-ons from other companies. At least in the case of Windows, you can refuse to accept the license and the install of Windows stops dead without doing anything to your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next time, do a little research before spewing forth in front of your peers, who could care less whether you switch to Apple, Linux, Chrome OS or Sega.</p>

            <p>Thank you for replying to me. I apologize for the foaming rant. You are the cooler head and you have prevailed. You are very right. I should have had back-ups in place and I never should have allowed the install without research. I will follow your instructions
 to perform the factory restore. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Once your computer is back, it would be a great time to learn about backing up. I can't begin to tell you what a difference this has made in my computing life. With scheduled backups running automatically, you will never need to stress about losing your
<p>
</p><p>There are two types of backup:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A file and folder backup is a copy of your important files and folders: documents, music, pictures, videos, bookmarks, email and anything else that's important to you. This can be as simple as copying from your hard drive to another place (an external drive
 or 'the cloud.') However, backup software makes it so convenient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A disk image backup is an exact copy of your entire disk, compressed into a single file. This is how you backup Windows and all your software. When you restore a disk image, your computer goes back in time to exactly the way it was when you made the backup.
 And it only takes minutes to make or restore an image backup. It doesn't take long to copy 0's and 1's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say you install a new driver, or some new software, or a new operating system and things don't go well. Now your computer is a disaster. What to do? Step 1: Shrug. Step 2: Restore a disk image made before you changed your computer and voila - like
 nothing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk image software is not easy to understand. But all the time you spend to learn about it will be rewarded with a deep sense of security and satisfaction.&nbsp;</p>

            Solve my problem Bull dog. Won't boot and won't go into safe mode just starts. We did have confidence in MS. Now that is lost. MS should never have allowed an upgrade without an install disk. Now I am typing on an $100 computer that I loaded with Ubuntu.
 That OS cost me $2.50!!!

When trying to install <em>Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5</em> , the set-up halts after telling me I may disconnect from the internet. I receive the message "Setup Error." My only choice at that point is to exit the set-up.<br />

What might I be able to to about this?<br />

                    Hi I have an acer aspire 5315 laptop and for some reason it won't start up it just turns on for a few seconds and then turns off. It's fully charged and I have even tried it without the battery in and just the charger connected. How can I fix this?

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Can you use Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8?<br />
<br />
The computer likely&nbsp;has a hardware issue and you need to contact <br />
a real computer shop (one that does its own in-house service and <br />
not leeks and peeks at a Best Buy or other Big Box Stores) or the <br />
System Maker's&nbsp;Support.<br />

    <title>Bluetooth stops working sometimes after hibernating - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth stops working sometimes after hibernating</h2>
                    <p>I have a Toshiba notebook which came with Windows 7, I upgraded it to Windows 10 and since then, sometimes, when coming back from hibernation, my Bluetooth radio stops working and I can't use my Microsoft Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going to settings, devices, doesn't list Bluetooth anymore on the left, as if the system never came with Bluetooth.&nbsp; Restarting the pc most of the time helps, though sometimes I need to restart it twice for it to start working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the Bluetooth is gone and I go to device manager, it doesn't list any Bluetooth devices, if I "show hidden devices", then it shows all the Bluetooth devices greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 copy suddenly not genuine.  Please help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I turned on my computer this morning and found that my copy of Windows 7 has suddenly become non-genuine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried "Validate Now" through the Microsoft website but got script errors running through Chrome and the Window just remained blank if I ran it through Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should also mention that I removed my cpu to apply new thermal paste to it about a week ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me. &nbsp;I don't want to have to pay over $30 for a new key from Bonanza.<br />
</p>
<p>I happen to have an MGA Diagnostic log handy right now:</p>

Of course you do not, that is a SCAM.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>That looks to be a "RETAIL" product key, so I assume it did not come pre-installed on the computer?&nbsp; How did the Windows 7 Home Premium get installed on said system, where'd you get that product key?</p>

<p>... reads like you will be limping along with software that cannot be activated (likely still works, just shuts down or something every so often?) for a while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other option: if a student, see if your school has some sort of Microsoft agreement that allows you to get software on the cheap.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other option: switch OSes to something free.&nbsp; Plenty of them out there.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Ich habe das Solitaire gekauft. Konnte es immer spielen. Habe Fehler Nummer 101 .Bitte um Hilfe.</p>
<p>Ein anderes Spiel habe ich aber schon am 30. 01.19 gekauft und nie erhalten. Ich kann dadurch noch nicht einmal sagen ,wie dieses Spiel mit Namen ist. Ich weiß nur, dass es eingeblendet wurde als Reklame und ich wollte mal was neues ausprobieren. Habe auch
 keine Freischaltung dafür bekommen, nur die Rechnung wurde mir Abgebucht</p>
<p>über29,79 Euro. bitte um Rückgabe des Betrages.</p>

<h2>            Computer BSOD and restarts every 10-20 minutes since Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Every 20 or 30 minutes or so my computer (Alienware laptop) goes into a BSOD, collects error information for 10 or 20 seconds, then restarts. I'm getting all kinds of different errors each time with some repeats. This has been going on for a couple days.
 I recently started writing down the errors, so far I've gotten:</p>
<p>
</p><p>memory_management</p>
<p>driver_irql_not_less_or_equal (fwpkclnt.sys)</p>
<p>kmode_exception_not_handled (fwpkclnt.sys)</p>
<p>bad_pool_caller</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do? I haven't installed any hardware/major software recently, it started happening as soon as I upgraded to windows 10.</p>

                    I have a toshiba with windows 8.1 on it. I was installing updates last night. When it was finished I rebooted my computer and got this error. I have tried everything. I tried the troubleshoot, restoring, watching videos on what to do, turning it off and
 back on, it doesnt give a percentage on when it will be done, but it has been doing this for hours. I have read all the support help and forums and everything. I don't have a DVD to use to restore it or whatever. Please help ASAP I have so much homework due
 this weekend and I've barely started.&nbsp;

 but if I'm on the Internet it switches to my start screen and I can't click any of my apps. The only thing it let's me do is hit the windows button on my keyboard that will send me back to what I was doing. The only way fix is to turn it off and then back
 on, but soon it does it again. IT only happens when I'm connected to the internet. I ran the onedrive troubleshoot and messed with the setting in onedrive but nothing has helped to far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            If you reinstall Windows on your computer, then surely it will fix the issues you're having with right now. But your files may be deleted along the process. In this case, just use a third party tool to recover them manually.

<h2>            Choppy video on uploading the video to YouTube on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Choppy video</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a fujifilm camera with 16GBS. My videos run smooth on my camera like it doesn't cut picture and stay on it while the audio moves on. So I was wondering, because I updated to windows 10 and had to reset my computer and its now not running smoothly,
 how do I fix it so it is running smoothly. I make YouTube videos and I haven't posted in like a week because every time I put my SD card in my computer and upload the videos to my windows 10 server the picture is choppy but the sound never is. The computer
 will select a picture to stick on for some frames and have the audio go smoothly through. I really need help. I use VLC to watch the videos before I edit them but if it's running choppy on there I don't know what to do. I've tried looking up tutorials but
 they are all on go pros. Just please help I need upload soon.</p>

<p>Hi Sonia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to narrow it down and provide you the proper resolution, may we know if you're trying to recover the bluetooth app that you have downloaded? Are you trying to delete or install it?<br />
<br />
Have you tried any possible troubleshooting steps? If yes, what are those steps and did you get any error messages?<br />
