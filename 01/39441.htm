<h2>            Can I uninstall Windows Defender on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I don't want windows defender on my computer. I don't want any programs running other than the ones I want. Lets be honest windows defender's pretty terrible and I'm already running malware-bytes but windows doesn't have an option to completely uninstall
 it. You can disable it but it will STILL COME BACK. I tried finding it under control panel but its not there. Does anyone know how to uninstall Windows Defender?

            You cannot uninstall it as it it part of the Windows 10 operating system. &nbsp;If you disable it as you have found out it will just turn itself back on.

All of those are Windows components which means something else drove them into Fault. Further analysis was of not real help.
Is this system (and major components) still under warranty? Be sure to check with their makers' support.
======
1A. Check with ASRock Support, their on-line documentation, diagnostics, and ask in their forum for known issues. Update the BIOS, chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers.

BiosReleaseDate = 12/18/2018 &lt;-- current BIOS date.
BaseBoardManufacturer = ASRock
BaseBoardProduct = B450M Pro4
1B. Even though the ATI video drivers are very current they could be involved. Check with ATI Support and Forums about any known issues. If there are no newer versions it may help to revert back to an older stable version.
Catalyst Control Center is from ATI so check with ATI Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in the ATI Forums for known issues.

2. Remove ALL power then reseat the cards, memory, and cables (on both ends when possible) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug.
3  Avast is either involved or helping to mask the root cause. So you need to uninstall it and run the Avast Uninstall Utility to prevent trouble causing remnants.

http://kb.eset.com/esetkb/index?page=content&amp;id=SOLN146 
4. Run the memory tests (see methods below).
5. As needed use ALL the methods in the troubleshooters below.
6. After ALL the above if needed run DriverVerifier to see if it can indicate a CAUSE (see DriverVerifier methods below).
==================================================

Drivers could be at fault however disk issues or antivirus/antispyware/security products are just as likely to be the root cause as they can force a driver to corrupt or go out of bounds. The video driver or something affecting it would be very suspect.
Be sure the drivers, BIOS, and low level chipset drivers are all updated by 
manually checking at the System maker and device makers' sites.
-----------------------------------
BCCode: 0A     0x0000000A
BCCode: 0A     0x0000000A  &lt;-- read this link
http://www.faultwire.com/solutions-fatal_error/IRQL-NOT-LESS-OR-EQUAL-0x0000000A-*1025.html
====================================================  
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide  Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names. (Also update the BIOS and low level chipset drivers.)
DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html
  
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.
http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm 
====================================================
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.  &lt;-- best method
www.memtest.org
MemTestX86 - Test RAM With
http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/14201-memtest86-test-ram.html 
For the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool.
Type in Cortana's search box -&gt;  Memory - find Memory Diagnostics tool 
at top of list - click it - in Windows 8/8.1/10 the name is "Windows 
Memory Diagnostic".
How to Run the Memory Diagnostics Tool in Windows 10 - name is 
"Windows Memory Diagnostic" - Control Panel - Security and Maintenance 
 - Administrative Tools - look for tool.
================================================
After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run 
DriverVerifier. (Remember to use the Windows 10 methods posted at the 
top of the original reply above.)

<p>Hello JimWynne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Process followed:</p>
<p>1) Open "Photos";</p>
<p>2) In "Collection", check the photo selected (small square upper right corner);</p>
<p>3) Right-click on photo selected and select "Share" in drop down menu;</p>
<p>4) In "Share", select "Recipient" and "mail to" email address;</p>
<p>5) For this try-out, I selected my other email address for "Send to";</p>
<p>6) Open link;</p>
<p>7) Photo selected and sent is displayed BUT with the possibility to call/view all the other pictures in the original folder.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello JimWynne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) NO, the photos I used for my tests were not stored on OneDrive;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) when in "Photos and clicking on "See more (…)" and selecting "Settings" from the dropdown, I see 3 folders listing OneDrive in their location in the "Source" list;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the same "Settings" screen, the "show my cloud-only content from OneDrive is "ON" and "Photos includes OneDrive content from" = "ALL FOLDERS";</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Just in case you should be asking: I copy/paste ONE of the photos from a small folder&nbsp;from its original location to the OneDrive&nbsp;Pictures folder, and got the same problem. (ALL photos from the original folder can be retrieved whilst I only selected the
 one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps!</p>

What are you trying to do?&nbsp;&nbsp; That sounds like a way to get two users of the pointer into trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, it happens to me sometimes that the pointer accelerates to the bottom of the screen and stays there until I rescue it with Mousekeys, presumably
 interrupting whatever improperly handled contention took it there.

Well lets just say&nbsp;I am&nbsp;playing a game online. It requires me to move and aim at the same time. I try to move while I'm aiming and it will not let me move. Or when I'm scrolling up it will not let me move my mouse (scrolling with the arrow keys).

            <p>It could be your your total vRAM 256 dedicated and 1647 shared.</p>
<p>Your video card and your computer are made to share system RAM, but only<br />
when you need to do so.&nbsp; For instance, if you are running an application<br />
(such as a graphics intensive game) that requires more memory than that which<br />
is available on your video card, the system kicks in to allow it to use<br />
general computer RAM.&nbsp; However, when your graphics usage has no need for<br />
system RAM, it's available for other uses. </p>
<p>"For example, if you have a video card that has 256 MB of onboard memory, that memory must be mapped within the first 4 GB of address space. If 4 GB of system memory is already installed, part of that address space must be reserved by the graphics memory
 mapping. Graphics memory mapping overwrites a part of the system memory."</p>
<p>The system memory that is reported in the System Information dialog box in Windows Vista is less than you expect if 4 GB of RAM is installed<br />

</p>
<p>Go into system information on the NVIDIA control panel (Desktop right click or in the Control Panel) and see what is the dedicated vRAM and the shared vRAM information.</p>

<p>I have the same problem with my XBox 360 (original model).</p>
<p>So I bought a new(-ish) HDD, and I still got the Red Light and E68 code.</p>
<p>But what's really interesting is I saw something on how to bypass the Xbox's startup (disconnect TV cable, switch on, wait 15 secs, then reconnect TV cable). I was taken to a login screen and from there I was able to access the HDD, either one!</p>
<p>But if I startup the console from cold, I still get the E68 error.</p>
<p>And I've tried a reported method for erasing any faulty updates ( press and hold 'Sync' button then switch on console, and don't release 'Sync' until console has fully started).</p>
<p>Could it be a firmware error?</p>
<p>And how can I fix this?</p>

 mgmt toolof windows and shrunk c: . but after a while an error message appeared it closed. and that 117gb free space now lost on my pc. but it seems on diskmgmt connected to my c volume. im adding a screenshot so u could see it. now my c volume shows total

<p>When I manipulate disk partitions then I always begin by creating an image so that I have an easy recovery path in case something goes wrong. Judging by your description something does appear to have gone wrong. Since, as you write, you have created a backup
 image your best bet would be to use it. As an alternative you could try some of partition recovery tools you can find with a search engine.</p>

            Hi,
<div>Thank you for posting the question. I will help you to find a resolution regarding the computer freezing when uploading pictures issue on the computer. Before that, I would like to ask few questions to narrow down the issue.
<div>1. Is this issue confined to any specific file format while uploading pictures? Have you downloaded these pictures from any other devices like camera or mobile phones?
<br />
2. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue? <br />
3. Is this issue confined only while uploading pictures to facebook webpage? <br />
4. What is the type of internet connection that you are using? (wired or wireless)<br />
5. Are you using any third party picture viewer programs on the computer? </div>
<div>6. Which is the browser that you are using to access websites? </div>
<div>7. Is the computer freezes or browser freezes? </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong> Boot into Safe Mode with Networking and check if the issue persists there.</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 update reboots computer while user is logged in despite group policy setting</h2>
                    <p>Ran into an issue the other night where my computer rebooted on its own after I installed some updates. I have the group policy enabled that I believe is supposed to prevent auto-restarts after patching when users are logged in. It looks like Windows still
 schedules a reboot anyways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Pavan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for the response, suggestions and assistance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your question, the computer is not on a domain or part of a server network. I'm an IT professional by trade and I added the settings to my local group policy to prevent upgrades and automatic installation/restarts. In addition to the No auto-restart
 policy I also have the policy for <strong>Configure Automatic Updates</strong>&nbsp;set to
<strong>3 - Auto download and notify for install</strong>. The latter group policy is working as desired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In reference to your suggestion, I initially was using the <strong>Notify to Schedule Restart
</strong>option however there are two problems with using this. </p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">1. The notification automatically schedules a restart and only gives you the option to change the schedule. This still can result in unexpected reboots because you could be notified for instance at 9 pm that your computer will reboot
 at 3 am and if you don't see the notification you can't prevent it.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">2. The possibly more troublesome issue is that Microsoft has released some patches that caused instability or even outages including System Firmware Update 1/19/2016 for the SP3 that caused BSODs due to it initially installing SP4
 pen drivers. Since firmware updates are rarely security related, I always check to see if others have run into issues before installing, which is what I did with this update. Thankfully my computer wasn't set to "Notify to Schedule Restart" so it wasn't automatically
 installed. The issue has since been resolved and I have installed the update, but had I been using the recommend option I would have had a broken computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally I would like WU to work as it did in all previous version of Windows. I would like the option to be notified to install patches, the option to select which patches to install, and the option to choose when a reboot will be performed. While I understand
 that this may not be desirable for the majority of home users, I am using the professional version of Windows 10 so I would hope that the needs of business users would be taken into account as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've included a couple of screenshots showing the settings that I have configured for reference.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for update and reply.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that in Windows 10 updates are installed automatically. There is no way you can schedule an update, choose which update you want to install. Also when you go to Windows update in settings it’s clearly mentioned that available updates
 are downloaded and installed automatically. It by design of Windows 10.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further if some features or options are not available due to design then you may want to leave a feedback on the
<strong>Feedback App.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type <strong>Feedback</strong> on <strong>search</strong> and follow <strong>onscreen instruction.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.

            <p>Pavan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 updates are only installed automatically if the settings are left default. As I mentioned, my system group policy is set to notify me if there are updates and allow me to choose to install them when/if I desire. I know this works because I receive
 daily notifications that there are updates available to install because I currently use Windows Defender. The issue I presented isn't related to automatic installation of updates, it's related to Windows 10 ignoring group policies that are supposed to prevent
 reboots of the system while users are logged in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If group policies are indeed ignored by design in Windows 10 please let me know. I'm a Consulting Architect responsible for guiding my clients technology roadmaps so I'd very much like to know if I should be telling my clients (and colleagues) to steer clear
 of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, while I understand that there isn't this option, there should be the option to not install certain updates. I had to forgo Windows Defender updates for over a month because they were bunched together with the bad SP3 firmware update and it's all
 or nothing. I looked at the Feedback App you mentioned and don't see a category for Updates (there is one for every other category), so it doesn't appear Microsoft is looking for feedback on Windows Updates.</p>

            <p>Having this issue as well. &nbsp;Super frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is ignoring Group Policy and patching our computers on its own. &nbsp;We have a centralized and controlled patch management solution that allows us to tell each PC what patches to install and when. &nbsp;(Solarwinds)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 seems to ignore the settings we apply in Group Policy. &nbsp;It patches the computers and reboots automatically causing serious frustration from the end user as well as IT Administration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This completely undermines our Patch Management solution and policy as we have no control over what patches are being applied. And obviously causing inconvenience to the end user as it randomly reboots their computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we stop this behavior in Windows 10 and make it act like all our other machines (Win 7 Pro 64bit)</p>
<p>This is the reason all corporate environments are so resistant to migrate to Windows 10. &nbsp;Dear Microsoft: You can't disable IT Controls for an OS in a corporate controlled environment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Gday Joel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue you describe is not exactly the same issue posted here.&nbsp; Have a search for "Windows 10 updates ignore group policy".</p>
<p>
</p><p>To put it bluntly, there is nothing you can do.&nbsp; Microsoft in their wisdom has decided to allow Windows 10 to totally ignore selected WU Group Policies.&nbsp; This is not documented in GPMC or anywhere else "official" but that's about it.&nbsp; Either you setup the
 new version of WSUS and have *some* control over patching or deploy SCCM.&nbsp; That's all you can do really.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            Hi prepaint 
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign In Options
<br />
<br />At the top of that settings window, you should see a drop down box, where you can change the login behavior after Windows 10 wakes from sleep . . 
<br />
<br />If you do not, please let me know . ..

            Hey prepaint,
<br />
<br />You can do this by going to Start, type in Sign-in options, and click on it when you see it. From there, you should see a new window saying Sign-in options. Under Require sign-in, select "Never".
<br />
<br />This Windows Central article (where I got this method from) also has a fair bit of options, if you have Pro you can use the Group Policy method, and so on: <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-prevent-windows-10-requiring-password-when-resuming-sleep" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-prevent-wind...</a>

<p>Thank you. That worked for not showing the log in screen when I wake it up but now the sign in screen appears at start up which Staples had eliminated for me when they set it up when I bought it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I stopped the situation on wake up this must have went back for some reason.</p>

                    <p>I have a Nokia Lumia 650 and earlier today the xbox app updated itself to a new name called "Xbox Console Companion" and now it crashes as soon as i attempt to open it. I have reset the phone twice to no avail and anyone any ideas of a fix?</p>
<p>How the heck can this be signed off as fit for release when clearly its bugged?</p>
<p>I cant figure out how i can revert back to previous working version</p>

            If you have tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it from the store then there not much that can be done as windows 10 mobile is on its last legs with only minor security patches rolling out.

<p>Tried that too with no luck..</p>
<p>They could at least make it easy to roll back to a previous version as a workaround but i cant find a copy of the .XAP file anywhere online</p>

            Yes, this is BS Microsoft and is costing me ton's of money.&nbsp; and losses in my games. &nbsp;&nbsp; this needs to be remedied quickly. &nbsp; It is happening to everyone with WP10. &nbsp; They only way I can change accounts on phone is to delete an account or login from the
 same account on a computer.&nbsp; We need a way of switching XBOX accounts on the WP10 easily.&nbsp; Maybe it's not the xbox console companion maybe there is anouther solutions. &nbsp;&nbsp; But I need a way to quickly change accounts, now I can't switch accounts without a lot
 of fuss and it is costing me money and points.&nbsp; BS Microsoft. &nbsp;

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to use Windows 7's built-in server, there is a guide on it here:</p>
<p><a href="http://digitizor.com/2009/06/20/how-to-install-a-ftp-server-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://digitizor.com/2009/06/20/how-to-install-a-ftp-server-in-windows-7/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://digitizor.com/2009/06/20/manage-settings-iis-web-server-ftp-server-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://digitizor.com/2009/06/20/manage-settings-iis-web-server-ftp-server-in-windows-7/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll also need to open port 21 in your firewall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be sure you have read all aspects of running av FTP server, since you are opening a path in to your computer from the outside world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want an alternative to the built-in server in Windows, try FileZilla:</p>
<p><a href="http://filezilla-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://filezilla-project.org/</a></p>
<p>Here's a guide to configuring it:</p>

            You cannot remote into PC's using Windows 10 HOME edition, you must have an upgraded version.

<h2>            pc to mac network problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi upgraded to win 10 pro...previous version i could 'see' in network tab the devices that are on the same wifi network</p>
<p>including my Macbook pro</p>
<p>Now it doesnt see the macbook, but strangely i can see the my PC on the macbook 'finder' in shared.. i can access the PC and copy/drag etc any files or folders to the mac... But i cannot do the same in the PC if it doesnt recognise that both computers on
 the exact same wifi connection..:: i have spend three consisitent days of 12 hours talking to tech's from microsoft who cannot resolved this problem associated with windows 10 pro upgrade.</p>
<p>Ive even rolledback to prevoius version but still no resolution..&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLease microsoft sort this out.. as other microsoft blogs appear to have similar problems.</p>
<p>The problem is compounded by some tech's who cannot/or wont when a mac is connected to the same network. I have spoken to applecare\</p>
<p>and the fact that the MAc sees and can access the PC means there is nothing wrong with the mac.</p>
<p>What a mess upgrading appears to have become..</p>
<p>next pc will be another mac</p>

<p>Hi MikeBarber3,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would like to know if do you still need further assistance with your concern. If so, there might be settings that just needs correction on your Windows to be able to see other devices on your network. Before we do any troubleshooting, I would like to know
 the following to have a better picture on your issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is this also happening to other devices connected on your computer?</li><li>Do you get any error messages when trying to detect other devices connected to the network?</li><li>Just to clarify, are the permissions already set on the other computer ready for sharing and access?</li><li>What is the version and build installed on your Windows 10?
<ul>
<li>You'd be able to have this checked by pressing the <strong>Windows button + R</strong> on your keyboard to open the
<strong>Run</strong> box and type <em><strong>winver</strong></em> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can run this <strong><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_networking10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">troubleshooter for accessing files and folders on other computers</a></strong> as an initial step. This way, Windows would be automatically
 diagnose and troubleshoot networking issues relating to it's sharing permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please don't hesitate to keep in touch for me to assist you.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update KB3046269 repeatedly installs</h2>
                    <div>
<p>For the last few weeks I've been battling my Windows 7 Professional SP 1 x64 installation. After Monday (03/16/2015), update KB3046269 keeps installing successfully, but after about 5 minutes after installation I am asked to instal it again. No other updates
 have failed to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone so far as to download the individual update msi and attempt installation that way, it too successfully completes, but does not take hold.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d9dc7425-be7c-46d5-9935-f816d87fe649" /></p>
<br />
<p>Looking back at the update history, it has always been successful:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fdee5020-e58d-47ff-9a0e-2279774d8af6" /></p>
<p>I attempted disabling my Security suite, this did not make a difference. I am at a loss and do not know where to go from here. Any real assistance in rectifying this issue would be appreciated.</p>

</p>
<p>I run an internal WSUS server and only 1 PC out of 50 is having this issue. </p>
<p>I have tried MS Fix-It and that was no help either. </p>
<p>I have tried being logged in as an admin and installing, </p>
<p>installing without logging in, </p>
<p>installing while logged in,</p>
<p>installed on shutdown, </p>
<p>ran KB#.msu from MS. </p>
<p>They all have the same result, successful install, then 2 minutes later, asks for it again.</p>

 Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; PC Doctor; TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Comodo System Cleaner; Advanced System Optimizer; CCleaner's&nbsp;<em>Registry Cleaner

<p>
</p><p>You know about assuming, right? I do <strong>not</strong> have IE 11 installed and refuse to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. Irrelevant. I built my computer. I am A+, Net+, and soon to be Security+ certified. I have a few MS certs and an HDI Service Center Analyst cert. I do not provide this info to brag, just to inform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. No, please see the answer to 1a.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I do not feel comfortable sharing that information. Trust me, if it is present, it is up-to-date and I have tried to install the MSW update after disabling the possibly present security software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Trust me, I'd <strong>never</strong> install a McAfee product on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Can we move past this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5a. I can understand how these updates being installed or not might be relevant. Are these updates directly related to KB3046269? As you probably expected, no, KB3046269 is not listed. All other updates you've inquired about are either installed or have
 been deprecated by newer updates or I do not have the programs installed that require them (yes, I went through the list and researched).</p>
<p>
</p><p>5b. I think 5a answers this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Java is up-to-date</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Adobe Flash is up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8a. I've already answered this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8b. IE 11 is not installed on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8c. I have FF installed and it is up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. I have in the past. I have recently researched and spoke with my boss whom is also my CIO about registry cleaning. I have chosen to discontinue use. Please do not make any negative comments about incompetence related to the use of registry cleaning utilities.
 I have been using Windows since Windows 95 and have been using registry cleaning for a very long time. I have never considered myself a Windows advanced expert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your assistance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>All my Windows 7 machines are saying that I need to install IE 11. So I say sure why not. I try to install it and I get the message that it needs to download some prereqs before it will install. So I say OK. I try to install the required prereqs and I get
 either it is already installed or not required. Meanwhile, I also have the update KB3046269 telling me that it installs fine, and 5 minutes later telling me it needs to be installed again. Lets see, I have tried everything I can think of... Clean boot, install
 updates manually, deleting the software distribution folder, reinstalling Windows 7 SP1, upgrading Windows 7 to Windows 7 because SP1 failed, everything else mentioned all other boards. NOTHING is working. What do I have to do to get it installed?</p>

            I am having the same problem as chris@zefon. All the usual tricks to fix windows update do not work in this case. Too bad that this tread is derailed about the importance of IE11, while the real problem is not being able to install it. Looks like the easiest
 solution is to reinstall windows. FYI, the user of that PC had ccleaner installed, might be related.<br />

<p>Bonjour le forum et a ses internautes, voila j'ai un énorme soucis sur mon compte xbox live. La semaine dernière je e suis connecter normalement et j'ai lancé black ops 2 et j'ai une mise a jour donc je l'ai faite et en me reconnectant cela ma dit que mon
 compte été banni jusqu'au 31/12/9999 alors que je&nbsp; peux vous jurer que je n'ai strictement rien fait. Je fais appelle au techniciens de ce forum pour qu'ils puissent me debannir, je vous en supplie, je ne veux pas tout perdre sur mon compte.</p>
<p>Je précise que je poste mon message avec une autre adresse puisque je n'ai pas pu accéder au forum avec mon compte banni.</p>
<p>Voila j'ai exposer mon problème e je vous en supplie une dernière fois, debannissez moi, je vous jure que je n'ai rien fait.</p>
<p>Merci de bien vouloir me répondre a cette adresse : <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></p>
<p>Merci et bonne journée ou soirée</p>

<p>Slt, pour commencer un ban ne tombe pas pour rien, pour toute suspension un mail est envoyé, indiquant la durée et le motif de la suspension, si besoin de précisions sur cette dernière ensuite il n'y a pas de support officielle et encore moins de personne
 pour te débannir sur la partie française du forum.</p>
<p>Pour cela il te faut te tourner vers le forum US, et y poster un message en anglais ou en français correcte et sans fautes.
</p>
<p>Attention, ce forum est modéré, cela veut dire qu'un message posté n'apparaîtra que lorsqu'un membre XBLPET y aura répondu, il se peut également qu'une réponse soit donnée par mail sans publication du message original.</p>
