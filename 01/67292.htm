<h3> david &#40;dacordave&#41; sanderson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot uninstall latest Windows 10 update.</h2>
                    <p>I have an Intel NUC7i7BNH desktop computer, 350Mhz processor, 16Gb RAM, 32Gb Optane Memory, running Windows 10Pro 64bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, my computer was automatically updated with the latest update (I presume).</p>
<p>Ever since then my computer has run into several problems:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I can no longer connect my computer via a HDMI cable to my Sony Bravia TV (error: &nbsp;Unsupported Signal. &nbsp;Check your device output). &nbsp;It worked fine on the TV up until the update.</li><li>The desktop blinks once, about every 10-15 seconds. &nbsp;When this happens, the page I am on is no longer the active page. &nbsp;I could be typing (like as I typed this information, the screen links, I then have to re-click at the point where I am typing... every
 10 seconds or so.</li><li>Trying to Windows 10 apps. &nbsp;Example - I select 'Settings', 'Update &amp; Security', then I want to select the 'View Installed Update History', but I ca't select it. &nbsp;Then there's a blink, and 'Settings' disappears.</li><li>Then I found that all my files, documents, etc, AND the operating system had all gone - just up &amp; went. &nbsp;This gave me the opportunity to perform a clean install of Windows 10 - which I did...
<ol>
<li>The computer would work on the TV again;</li><li>No blinking of the screen</li><li>Everything worked beautifully.</li><li>The I went out this afternoon, leaving the computer running to load some of the files I had had backed up. &nbsp;When I came home, Windows 10 had updated itself again, and all the problems were back.</li></ol>
<p>
</p></li></ol>
<p>In my deductive eye, there's something wrong with the update. &nbsp;Or it is not compatible with this Intel system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is any work arounds or fix-its, I would be really appreciative. &nbsp;I dont want to be having to reinstall Windows every other day. &nbsp;(Incidently, I had turned updates to only stable versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're right when you said that it's possible that the issue is occurring due to compatibility issues, but let's further isolate the issue first so that we can be sure. Which version of Windows 10 are you using? To check, kindly type
<strong><em>winver</em></strong> on the search bar, then press the <strong>Enter</strong> key.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly do a clean install again, then prevent Windows from updating by following the steps in this article:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3183922/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-windows-update-from-reinstalling-in-windo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to temporarily prevent a Windows Update from reinstalling in Windows 10</a>. Once you're able to prevent Windows from updating, kindly send us a screenshot of your update history. By doing this, we'll know which update is causing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, we recommend that you contact the original equipment manufacturer of your computer, and also report to them so that we can be sure if it's a compatibility issue or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

            There are several things to consider here.<br />
<br />
You say you upgraded from Home to Pro - in other words you didn't get an XP Pro installation CD and do a completely new installation?<br />
<br />
If you had done a new installation, it would have re-formatted your HD, deleting everything on it - including the motherboard drivers and utilities.<br />
<br />
Do you have a CD containing the motherboard drivers &amp; utilities? - because without them the pc won't operate correctly.<br />
<br />
The sequence is normally install a new copy of XP, including a re-format, then install the motherboard drivers &amp; utilities, starting with the chipset drivers.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a motherboard driver CD and are truly upgrading then, yes, the upgrade process will leave a lot of the previous installation on the HD.<br />
<br />
If you are happy to do a re-format &amp; new installation, then that is the quick &amp; easy way to get rid of the inherited material.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, try these methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy all the files in the Download folder except the greyed out files and save them in a different location. Now delete the Downloads folder. Create a new folder in the same location and rename it as ‘Downloads’. Now, move the other files back to the ‘Downloads’
 folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above steps didn’t help, then I would suggest you to run the DISM tool and check. Refer to these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open the Command prompt by clicking on the start button. In the search box, type Command prompt.</span><span><span>pen the Command Prompt window by clicking the

<h2>            Permissions</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be grateful for any advice on this one as Googled but no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changed laptop and had photos/music stored on WD storage device. Downloaded them onto new laptop but when I try and access any individual file it says I don't have the correct permissions. I can 'Enable Inheritance' on each individual photo but cannot do
 the same to the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I apply a permission to all&nbsp;my photos/music?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance.</p>
<p>

<h3> rfix78  say:</h3>
<h2>            Expanding folders in Explorer, scroll to bottom</h2>
                    
<p>Having read through many other forums threads&nbsp;on the same topic, I still don't understand that an&nbsp;answer has come, so I will ask it myself.<br />
<br />
When seeking to expand a folder in Explorer, that has already been selected, how do I avoid having the pane scroll the folder I have selected to the bottom of the folder list?<br />
<br />
I would like to know what setting will turn this off, what patch can be installed to fix it, or some other viable solution.&nbsp; Hopefully this will not be passed off with some work around that is not logical or inefficient to computing procedures.&nbsp; (After all,
 is not the purpose of computer use to create greater efficiency in our lives...)</p>

<p><span>Hi Rfix,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By default when expand the folder in the navigation pane the scrolling will be enabled. This is by design and you will not

<h2>            KB3081704 won&#39;t install, &#34;KB3106246 successfully installed&#34; on multiple occasions &#40;at least 6 times&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm having trouble with subj.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>KB3081704 failed to install (this goes on for two months at least - hard to say cos the update history somehow got deleted)</p>
<p>
</p><p>"KB3106246 successfully installed" many times already (today twice, a few days ago, etc etc - at least five times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Apparently, no other updates arrive, just these two (I keep comparing this with my other machine which has a newer build on it - there updates did arrive during the same period of time). An alleged newer build of Windows 10 won't arrive for this machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already ran Update Troubleshooter twice, the situation hasn't changed.</p>
<p>I already tried to restart all Windows services related to update - the situation hasn't changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(the affected machine's got a Windows 10 Pro 64bit upgraded from Windows 8.1 end of August).</p>

            <p>Hi Pargeo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the Version of Windows&nbsp;that is installed in your PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern and we will provide the assistance required to help you resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that <strong>KB3081704</strong> is the release update and
<strong>KB3106246</strong> is the &nbsp;update for the DVD player released Nov 12. To clarify you can refer to the link provided below and check</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3081704" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3081704</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To prevent the update to fail and&nbsp;to try reinstalling I would suggest that you use the Hide/Block update tool provided in the link below and check if it helps</p>
<p><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</span></a></span><span>

<p>1. Tab Win+R, in the dialog box type <strong>winver&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>2. This will open a windows which will show the latest version that is installed in your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you&nbsp;have <strong>Windows 10 1511 </strong>installed in your PC, I would suggest that you perform the installation using

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will automatically install the OS&nbsp;along with the latest build.&nbsp;I would like to inform, if you want to get the latest builds released by Microsoft, you will have to join the Windows Insider&nbsp;Program which will entitle you to the latest&nbsp;builds released.

</p><p><strong>Try Updating the Apps with issues.</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to update the Apps or games&nbsp;with issues, from the Windows Store. This may resolve the issue. Refer the link below for details about updating Apps on Windows 10.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists then uninstall and reinstall the game and check if it works.</p>

    <title>Aventail VPN Client will not connect on Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Aventail VPN Client will not connect on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having an issue with an Aventail VPN Client that will simply not connect.&nbsp; It used to work fine until a Windows update in February.
</p>
<p>HW is a Dell 15R 9530 laptop. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then uninstalling and re-installing it has had no effect.&nbsp; Installing on other Windows 8.1 clients (post Feb) works fine. &nbsp;I have it working on a Surface Pro 3 with Windows 8.1 Pro installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wondering if anyone else has seen this issue and any ideas on a fix ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Skype Manager</h2>
                    <p>Hello Dears,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've made an outlook account for the purpose to make my company call other branch. So I've set up Skype Manager for that account which inside I added Skype Accounts for members.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The accounts are working fine, but I can't log in Skype Manager anymore. it gives me the following page.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f9f8dac8-758a-4f17-b76f-992a97dadb0b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f9f8dac8-758a-4f17-b76f-992a97dadb0b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>My account is working fine, I can log in e-mail or Skype just fine. the thing is, I can't transfer cash to their accounts and also can't monitor their usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any Help?</p>
<p>

            <p>Make sure you don't have any antivirus interfering.&nbsp; See <a href="http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3</a>&nbsp; Then remove your mail account and close WinMail and then compact and repair the database (see

            You will most likely need to remove the left side panel and examine the motherboard to determine the serial number.

<p>Hey Twiggier, sorry to hear about the account issues! I'm afraid I'm slightly confused here--did you in fact change your WLID? A WLID doesn't necessarily need to be an @hotmail account; your WLID is the email you entered when creating the account, or when
 changing the WLID associated with it. If you're not sure what that email address is, you can call phone support. As long as you're able to prove your identity, they should be able to release the WLID to you. :-)

<br />
When it freezes, its a complete freeze, mouse doesnt move.<br />
<br />
Have to power off, back on, go to safe mode, then normal boot is possible.<br />
<br />
I have tried a related Microsoft Fixit tool, but no go.<br />
<br />
I am getting an error 800F0902 on Windows Updates.<br />

    <title>Xbox One says NAT is open yet still having issues&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One says NAT is open yet still having issues&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I've been having serious issues of late trying to connect to my buddy in GTA Online. My NAT is open according to my Xbox One and it says all services are available, but it still disconnects me from session due to an&nbsp;"unknown network error". Also even though
 my NAT says open when I check it in the network page and after running Test multiplayer connection and that saying it is open as well (Open-Your network is behind a cone NAT) when I play Destiny it tells me I have a strict NAT upon logging into my character
 with the popup on the bottom part of the screen, yet I've yet to see any issue while playing that game or Halo: MCC. Only have had issues with GTA: Online.</p>
<p>And I've also seen my NAT change back and forth between Open and Moderate from time to time but it never causes issues with anything else I play.</p>

<p>This is the exact issue I have and it makes me unable to play GTA Online! :@</p>
<p>- I can only get into a lobby with no more than 3 people in it but then it slowly whittles down to just me on my own...</p>
<p>- It says I have an open NAT with 60 download / 20 upload / all services working etc</p>
<p>- I've tried opening as many ports as I can on my terrible BT HH5 but it doesn't seem to work with the Xbone... &gt;_&lt;
</p>
<p>- I didn't have any of these problems on my xbox 360 &gt;_&gt; </p>
<p>- Your network is behind a cone NAT message... </p>
<p>- I have to hard reset my xbox every time I want to be able to connect to more than 1 person over GTA Online...</p>
<p>Do I buy a new router or keep trying different ports and restarting the router / xbox until I get it right!? I don't have the patience for this really. You expect these things to just work together once plugged in. Not need a degree in networking... argh...

<p>Personally, if I were you and knowingly have a flaky device I would put some money in a good gaming router and get rid of that constant question mark once and for all. &nbsp;Who knows your problem may very well disappear all together. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>The best way to do this in Windows 8 is to do a "PC Reset" which restores the computer to brand-new conditions, just like it came from the factory.&nbsp; After you do this, it will be at the "please enter the owner's name" screen, basically ready for "first time
 use" by the new owner.</p>

                    I was going to clear the cache on my xbox one as i heard it makes the system and games run smoother, I have extremely slow internet so redownloading every game update i have would truly be a pain. I know this was prevalent on this Xbox 360 that's why i

<p><strong><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><span><span>The issue you are facing is related to the files for Photo Shop Elements 8. There seems to be a conflict between the files used for drivers of printer/scanner with
 the files used with Photo Shop Plug-in. It is a non–Microsoft product and we would request you to get the required support from Adobe support website or from the dell support website. Also I would suggest you to visit the below mentioned link and check if
 this helps –</span></span></p>

</p><p>Tried Clean Boot again twice. No go. Still stuck in the same loop. &nbsp;Tries to update, decides it can't and removes what it tried to do. Back to same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Updates are available.</p>
<p>• Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB3176493).</p>
<p>
</p><p>• EPSON - Printers - EPSON XP-215 217 Series - Error 0x80070012</p>
<p>• Realtek Semiconductor Corp. - WLAN - Realtek RTL8192CU Wireless LAN 802.11n USB 2.0 Network Adapter</p>
<p>• Packard Bell Corporation - Display - Packard Bell Maestro 242DX</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to have lost the security update and I forgot to list the EPSON printer one oin my first post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas other than a complete re-install of Windows 10 &nbsp;- for the 4TH TIME!!!!!</p>

<h2>            windows 8.1 resume from sleep causes bugcheck 0x0000009f</h2>

<p>When I try to resume from sleep mode, the display remains black for a couple of minutes and then the machine reboots.</p>
