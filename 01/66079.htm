            Hi Rob0501 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />How to Boot from a USB Flash Drive in Windows 10 - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

Manual steps to recover a corrupted registry that prevents Windows XP from starting
The procedure that this article describes uses Recovery Console and System Restore. This article also lists all the required steps in specific order to make sure that the process is fully completed. When you finish this procedure, the system returns to a state
 very close to the state before the problem occurred. If you have ever run NTBackup and completed a system state backup, you do not have to follow the procedures in parts two and three. You can go to part four.
Part one
In part one, you start the Recovery Console, create a temporary folder, back up the existing registry files to a new location, delete the registry files at their existing location, and then copy the registry files from the repair folder to the System32\Config
 folder. When you have finished this procedure, a registry is created that you can use to start Windows XP. This registry was created and saved during the initial setup of Windows XP. Therefore any changes and settings that occurred after the Setup program
 was finished are lost.<br />
<br />
To complete part one, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Insert the Windows XP startup disk into the floppy disk drive, or insert the Windows XP CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive, and then restart the computer.
<br />
Click to select any options that are required to start the computer from the CD-ROM drive if you are prompted to do so.
</li><li>When the "Welcome to Setup" screen appears, press R to start the Recovery Console.
</li><li>If you have a dual-boot or multiple-boot computer, select the installation that you want to access from the Recovery Console.
</li><li>When you are prompted to do so, type the Administrator password. If the administrator password is blank, just press ENTER.
</li><li>At the Recovery Console command prompt, type the following lines, pressing ENTER after you type each line:
<div><span>md tmp<br />
copy c:\windows\system32\config\system c:\windows\tmp\system.bak<br />
copy c:\windows\system32\config\software c:\windows\tmp\software.bak<br />
copy c:\windows\system32\config\sam c:\windows\tmp\sam.bak<br />
copy c:\windows\system32\config\security c:\windows\tmp\security.bak<br />
copy c:\windows\system32\config\default c:\windows\tmp\default.bak<br />
<br />
delete c:\windows\system32\config\system<br />
delete c:\windows\system32\config\software<br />
delete c:\windows\system32\config\sam<br />
delete c:\windows\system32\config\security<br />
delete c:\windows\system32\config\default<br />
<br />
copy c:\windows\repair\system c:\windows\system32\config\system<br />
copy c:\windows\repair\software c:\windows\system32\config\software<br />
copy c:\windows\repair\sam c:\windows\system32\config\sam<br />
copy c:\windows\repair\security c:\windows\system32\config\security<br />
copy c:\windows\repair\default c:\windows\system32\config\default<br />
</span></div>
</li><li>Type <span>exit</span> to quit Recovery Console. Your computer will restart. </li></ol>
<strong>Note</strong> This procedure assumes that Windows XP is installed to the C:\Windows folder. Make sure to change C:\Windows to the appropriate &lt;var&gt;windows_folder&lt;/var&gt; if it is a different location.<br />
<br />
If you have access to another computer, to save time, you can copy the text in step five, and then create a text file called "Regcopy1.txt" (for example). To use this file, run the following command when you start in Recovery Console:
<div><strong>batch regcopy1.txt</strong></div>
With the <strong>batch</strong> command in Recovery Console, you can process all the commands in a text file sequentially. When you use the
<strong>batch</strong> command, you do not have to manually type as many commands.
Part two
To complete the procedure described in this section, you must be logged on as an administrator, or an administrative user (a user who has an account in the Administrators group). If you are using Windows XP Home Edition, you can log on as an administrative
 user. If you log on as an administrator, you must first start Windows XP Home Edition in Safe mode. To start the Windows XP Home Edition computer in Safe mode, follow these steps.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> Print these instructions before you continue. You cannot view these instructions after you restart the computer in Safe Mode. If you use the NTFS file system, also print the instructions from Knowledge Base article KB309531. Step 7 contains
 a reference to the article.
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Shut Down</strong> (or click <strong>
Turn Off Computer</strong>), click <strong>Restart</strong>, and then click <strong>
OK</strong> (or click <strong>Restart</strong>). </li><li>Press the F8 key. <br />
<br />
On a computer that is configured to start to multiple operating systems, you can press F8 when you see the Startup menu.
</li><li>Use the arrow keys to select the appropriate Safe mode option, and then press ENTER.
</li><li>If you have a dual-boot or multiple-boot system, use the arrow keys to select the installation that you want to access, and then press ENTER.
</li></ol>
In part two, you copy the registry files from their backed up location by using System Restore. This folder is not available in Recovery Console and is generally not visible during typical usage. Before you start this procedure, you must change several settings
 to make the folder visible:
<ol>
<li>Start Windows Explorer. </li><li>On the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Folder options</strong>. </li><li>Click the <strong>View</strong> tab. </li><li>Under <strong>Hidden files and folders</strong>, click to select <strong>Show hidden files and folders</strong>, and then click to clear the
<strong>Hide protected operating system files (Recommended)</strong> check box. </li><li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> when the dialog box that confirms that you want to display these files appears.
</li><li>Double-click the drive where you installed Windows XP to display a list of the folders. If is important to click the correct drive.
</li><li>Open the System Volume Information folder. This folder is unavailable and appears dimmed because it is set as a super-hidden folder.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> This folder contains one or more _restore {GUID} folders such as "_restore{87BD3667-3246-476B-923F-F86E30B3E7F8}".<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> You may receive the following error message:
<div>
<div>
<div>C:\System Volume Information is not accessible. Access is denied.</div>
If you receive this message, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article to gain access to this folder and continue with the procedure:
<div><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/kb/309531/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">309531</a>&nbsp; <span>(http://support.microsoft.com/kb/309531/ )
</span>How to gain access to the System Volume Information folder</div>
</li><li>Open a folder that was not created at the current time. You may have to click
<strong>Details</strong> on the <strong>View</strong> menu to see when these folders were created. There may be one or more folders starting with "RP&lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt; under this folder. These are restore points.
</li><li>Open one of these folders to locate a Snapshot subfolder. The following path is an example of a folder path to the Snapshot folder:
<div>C:\System Volume Information\_restore{D86480E3-73EF-47BC-A0EB-A81BE6EE3ED8}\RP1\Snapshot</div>
</li><li>From the Snapshot folder, copy the following files to the C:\Windows\Tmp folder:
<ul>
<li>_REGISTRY_USER_.DEFAULT </li><li>_REGISTRY_MACHINE_SECURITY </li><li>_REGISTRY_MACHINE_SOFTWARE </li><li>_REGISTRY_MACHINE_SYSTEM </li><li>_REGISTRY_MACHINE_SAM </li></ul>
</li><li>Rename the files in the C:\Windows\Tmp folder as follows:
<ul>
<li>Rename _REGISTRY_USER_.DEFAULT to DEFAULT </li><li>Rename _REGISTRY_MACHINE_SECURITY to SECURITY </li><li>Rename _REGISTRY_MACHINE_SOFTWARE to SOFTWARE </li><li>Rename _REGISTRY_MACHINE_SYSTEM to SYSTEM </li><li>Rename _REGISTRY_MACHINE_SAM to SAM </li></ul>
</li></ol>
These files are the backed up registry files from System Restore. Because you used the registry file that the Setup program created, this registry does not know that these restore points exist and are available. A new folder is created with a new GUID under
 System Volume Information and a restore point is created that includes a copy of the registry files that were copied during part one. Therefore, it is important not to use the most current folder, especially if the time stamp on the folder is the same as the
 current time. <br />
<br />
The current system configuration is not aware of the previous restore points. You must have a previous copy of the registry from a previous restore point to make the previous restore points available again.
<br />
<br />
The registry files that were copied to the Tmp folder in the C:\Windows folder are moved to make sure that the files are available under Recovery Console. You must use these files to replace the registry files currently in the C:\Windows\System32\Config folder.
 By default, Recovery Console has limited folder access and cannot copy files from the System Volume folder.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> The procedure described in this section assumes that you are running your computer with the FAT32 file system. For more information about how to access the System Volume Information Folder with the NTFS file system, click the following

</span>How to gain access to the System Volume Information folder</div>
Part Three
In part three, you delete the existing registry files, and then copy the System Restore Registry files to the C:\Windows\System32\Config folder:

<p>I can't connect to internet on my Xbox360S and it doesn't give any error codes. I Have tried everything to fix it. I've check'd my router settings, Xbox settings, all firewall settings. I have cleared the cache, deleted my profiles, rebooted the router,
 added my Xbox to DMZ, I tried Google's public DNS settings, tried to connect with my mobile network. I think I've tried like everything. Nothing works. It worked fine like a month ago.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            no wifi after update</h2>
                    <p>Hello, after the recent windows 10 update I am unable to connect to my Wi-Fi network. All other devices still work and connect just fine. I have rebooted the modem and router and still no luck. My Wi-Fi does appear on the network list but is unable to connect.
 I have checked Microsoft for other updates as well as driver updates for the network adapter in my laptop, everything appears up to date. I am currently running an Ethernet cable for internet which works but not ideal, obviously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone else has come across this problem and found a solution I'm all ears. Please and thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using an HP laptop,&nbsp;running Windows 10 Home. I am using a Netgear router. If you need any other information please feel free to ask.</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Assuming your WiFi used to work then I would update or re-install the latest driver.<br />
BTW check for updates to the router's firmware which can have an effect even if other computer OS's work fine.<br />

            There's a MS sheet called "Fix network connection issues in Windows 10" that has a series of steps to try. Didn't work for me, but might for you. I'd attach the link but I'm still just working off my phone, trying to find a solution.

            <p>Hello, thank you for your input.&nbsp;I have an update, sort of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I noticed a new app? in my Windows list, "Connect". I click on it and it opens and says "Router is ready to connect wirelessly". Opening the app just says this, there are no options to click on. I still do not connect automatically when powering on my
 laptop like before but this seems to work, for now, like every 3 out of 5 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I believe everything is up to date, Microsoft, HP, and Netgear I will take you advice and try reinstalling a couple of drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the lateness in my reply and will give you an update this weekend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and enjoy the rest of your week. :)</p>

            <p>Hello John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying all the things I am capable of doing&nbsp;(I'm middle of the road technical savvy) I ended up restoring to a previous point or "previous build" as some have called it. This worked for me, Cortona in my start up screen has reverted back to a simple
 search bar. I really don't notice any other major changes although it has only been two days.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Wi-Fi is back to automatically detecting and connecting when I turn my computer on so I'm happy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this works for you and a thanks to Laurine554 for the suggestion. I would also recommend, should this fix work, creating a restore point and labeling it "working Wi-Fi" or something like that&nbsp;just incase.</p>
<p>

 Windows 10, because the Homegroup would just sit forever trying to verify the password.&nbsp; They eventually had to log into my husband's computer and mine both to finally resolve the issue and get me back on the Homegroup.&nbsp; It's finicky, it is.&nbsp; But sharing straight
 on the network worked fine.&nbsp; Yesterday, not even the straight network sharing worked, but.. media streaming (which, comically, is under Homegroup)&nbsp;did.&nbsp; Go figure.&nbsp;
</li><li>"The remote computer isn't responding to connections on port 3587, possibly due to firewall or security policy settings, or because it might be temporarily unavailable. Windows couldn't find any problems with the firewall on your computer." is what I really
 wanted to know about.&nbsp; Since I could go to both other computers both via the homegroup or the network sharing, both other computers would go to each other both via the homegroup or the network sharing, but neither one could get to ME either way... well...
 that's one of those things that make you go hmm, and then bang your head on the desk a few times.</li></ol>

            I have this problem, too. In fact, I suspect half the world does. The homegroup works one day, doesn't work the next. What to do about it? Likely nothing. It's a bug, and Microsoft has no motivation to fix it. As usual, the comments of the Microsoft 'Support
 Engineer' are next to useless. The gentleman said in his initial request that he ran troubleshooting. What do you tell him? To run troubleshooting! The 'advice' given on here is a laughingstock. You don't even have the minimal courtesy and professionalism
 to read what the person's problem is. Your 'responses' are worse than boilerplate. They're just garbage. Shame on you.

            <p>I was going to call up Microsoft support and pay the $149 for the one year of home computer support until I read this and realized that it's not specific to my setup. Yes just like you but probably even crazier. I have two identical Windows 10 desktop machines
 both bought brand new at the same time with Windows 10 factory installed. Since the beginning I've had this problem where Machine B (the second one I set up) can see machine A (the first one) on the network always and with no problem, but machine A never sees
 machine B under "Network" in the File Explorer. Then a few weeks ago I figured out how to set up the files on machine B so that they are shared with the Homegroup, and it worked beautifully - from machine A had full access to the shared files on machine B.
 Today after having changed nothing in my networking setup, Windows tells me that I have no access to those files. I've been running the various Homegroup and Network troubleshooters on both machines but I get either "no problem" or on machine A I get this
 message about peer-to-peer grouping failing. On both machines some troubleshooters tell me that there is some network protocol that is not installed and then I run the fix and it says it's fixed, and then the next time I run the same troubleshooter it tells
 me I have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So ... back to the reliable thumb drive. So much for Windows networking. I now realize that the "help" I'd get from my service guy would be about as valuable as the help we get from the Microsoft folk on these message boards. Except it'd cost me $149.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10. So many bugs, so little time.</p>

            A word of explanation here. First I said that machine A could not see machine B and then later I said that machine B's shared files were successfully published to machine A. Yes machine A could access machine B's files (for a while) but only if I forced
 the Explorer on machine A to the folders on machine B by knowing machine B's network location; at no time does machine A automatically see machine B on the network.

            Not sure if this will be helpful to anyone, but after days of scouring the internet trying to resolve my networking issues (same as everyone--computers on network can be seen but not accessed) &nbsp;I discovered that not only did I have to reset my permissions
 on both computers to include "Everyone" with full rights, I also had to manually enter UAC settings and add each computer name under credential management. &nbsp;I can't precisely relate the steps because now Windows 10 won't even let me open the UAC settings on
 my computer, but the information is available on the internet. &nbsp;Just not here where Microsoft "experts" continually tell you to just run the troubleshooters. &nbsp;Apparently at this point security takes precedence over user-friendliness. &nbsp;Thank God for Dropbox!

            Interesting but I really don't want to give Everyone rights to everything. With the newer versions of windows you are supposed to be able to grant rights only to your "Homegroup". I followed those instructions carefully and a few weeks ago it worked and
 now (without changing any permissions on anything) it doesn't. Flaky, flaky, flaky.

<p><span>The initial problem was, Surface logo is on, then windows doesn't start. So I went to my Microsoft account and as I logged on I saw two image for my devices, viz windows 8.1 &amp; windows 10
 recovery image. So first I downloaded Windows 10 recovery image and as per</span></p>
<p><span>site instruction, (long press volume down button, power button press and release etc) when I tried to re-boot from USB stick, it shows following message :</span></p>

<h2>            Fatal Error during .Net Framework 4.7.1 Installation Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>After purchasing a new mouse, the software (Razer Synapse) would not run without having .Net Framework 4.7.1 installed.&nbsp; I have tried multiple times to install this but routinely end up with a unsuccessful install because: Fatal error during installation.&nbsp;
 I tried the repair tool to no avail, and finally uninstalled all .Net Framework programs from my computer.&nbsp; Upon trying to install 4.7.1, it failed with the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then used the cleanup tool to remove all traces of .Net Framework from my computer in hopes of a fresh and clean installation, but I still get this fatal error.&nbsp; Now that I have no trace of .Net Framework on my computer, other applications are now failing
 to work (i.e. discord).&nbsp; I've considered reverting to a backup, but to my surprise Windows backup has not been running for years... I really would hate to do a factory reset, so is there anything else I can try?? Here is the log:</p>

<p><span>I suggest you to run check disk on the hard drive to see if there are any corruptions.&nbsp;<br />
Follow the below steps:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows&nbsp;key +&nbsp;X</strong>, click&nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt (Admin</strong>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>You're getting no signal when you're connecting your Xbox 360 console with an HDMI cable, but you do get a signal when you connect your console with a component cable?<br /><br /><strong>If that's correct, here's a few questions/suggestions for you:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>When it's connected with HDMI, do you get any sound at all? Or is it no sound and no picture?</li>
<li>Are you using an Xbox 360 S console or an Xbox 360 E console?</li>
<li>Are you able to try a different HDMI cable with your console to see if that works?</li>
<li>Are you able to try your Xbox 360 console on a different TV to see if that works?</li>
</ol>
<p><br />Let us know and we'll work with you from there! ^_^</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You should backup your files before downgrading.
<br />Applications will need to be reinstalled.
<br />The custom install will archive your files, so you can recover them from the Windows.old folder - make sure you follow the instructions to the letter. 
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.
<br />
<br />
<br />If you don't want to do this, you can wait it out until the next version of Windows 10 1803, is released to see if it works better.

</p><p>Just to confirm, are you also receiving the same error code? If yes, please follow the instructions in the article:

</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this happened after an update, we can logically assume that the driver is experiencing a compatibility issue. Have you tried uninstalling the driver via
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/instantanswers/005a1acb-776e-4320-b9f2-3a2302a320da/open-device-manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Device Manager</a></strong> and installing it directly from the manufacturer's website?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will let you install the latest version and you should have no issues after. Otherwise, let us know so we can continue helping you.</p>

                    <div style="text-align: left">I've had the option to restart and update my computer for a while now. Last night I had a little bit of free time so I let it update. It took a while for the update to complete(about two hours). Not many changes were made(other
 than Cortona, something I don't use and small interface changes). I did not think too much about it and went to bed. This morning while I was watching a YouTube video there was a sync issue that started to go on if the video played for a while. The audio was
 late. I tried to play a game but I would get constant lag spikes? Is this happening to anyone else? Is it caused by Cortona? If so can I just uninstall it? This never happened before the update.</div>

            I don't exactly remember to be honest. I think I just uninstalled it directly from the control panel. Even then I doubt that is the issue since I have not had McAfee for over a year now.

            I ran it and fell asleep soon after. I woke up this morning and everything was working fine, moderate start up and video and audio sync was good. But only for about 30 minutes, when I went to watch another video it started to do the same thing again, go
 out of sync. I don't even know what is the problem. I did a clean boot, deleted unneeded system and internet files, updated my audio drivers, ran multiple antivirus scans, updated flash and disabled shock wave. Nothing is working.

            <p>Over the years we've learned that there are times when it's too late for the McAfee removal tool to "come to the rescue." This may be another one of those times. That being said and

<p><em>assuming Windows 10&nbsp;64-bit...</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious]<em> diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably

<p>
</p><p>5. What third-party anti-malware applications (i.e., <em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>) are installed, if any?&nbsp; What third-party firewall, if any?</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">It's really weird because all problems&nbsp;I had after the update&nbsp;except audio-video sync issues have fixed themselves. This is the only problem that persists. I did take notice of something. Earlier today I re-installed my audio driver.
 Audio-video sync was perfect for a while(like half an hour) then it reverted back to its old state. I'm not sure if this will help but usually when it does go out of sync it is accompanied by some weird "click" or stutter sound. Kind of like when audio is
 so loud it pops. That is usually how I indicate if a video is synced correctly. By the way, I do appreciate that you are still responding. All the help/tutorials I have looked up for have been a flop. If all else fails I will just go to the local computer
 store and ask them what's up.</p>

 I have had very small issues that I have been able to solve through standard searches. Not the case here! I first noticed that my Google Chrome shortcut kept disappearing from my tool bar below. I would then try the desktop icon to no avail. So I went to control
 panel &amp; uninstalled, &amp; reinstalled Google two days in a row. Obviously don't want to do that every day.... Now, something even more maddening is happening! I sell on eBay for extra income to supplement my disability pay. I haven't been able to renew listings
 the last two days due to this problem, much less type up new ones! My IT guy told me years ago to turn my java off for security reasons, &amp; only add it on a site by site need. I do the same with third party cookies. It seems worth it as I no longer get tons
 of malware, browser hijacks, etc., that I am aware of. I have a Premium version of Malwarebytes, &amp; a paid CCleaner from Piriform that I try to check every few days. I sat &amp; observed the cursor is available when my background remains dark (approx 8 sec.), then
 the color from my underlying "chosen theme" shifts to the lighter shade of the actual theme (approx. 8 sec.) which knocks my cursor out. Rinse, &amp; repeat...&nbsp;</em></strong></span></p>

 barely get more than two words &amp; the cursor just seems to jump into the stratosphere! I switched to a corded mouse thinking that would help. It didn't. I switched browsers, no difference. Now I see there was a driver update for the mouse &amp; it is seriously
 irritating to lose your spot to type more than two words! Help?

 the meantime, I have been unable to work on any area of my computer, (changed to usb plugin mouse, changed browsers, nothing makes a difference). I am only allowed to type for 8 sec., &amp; then my cursor disappears for about 8 seconds &amp; I am unable to type during
 that time frame! This is BEYOND frustrating &amp; despite posting on several support forums over this mouse update that was NOT successful - &amp; how it is affecting my ability to work effectively (which is costing me money every day that it remains unresolved because
 I can't put new listings in my eBay store)!! I have not had any responses in the forums. I don't know if this will even be read, much less whether anything will be done to resolve this issue! If anyone DOES receive this, PLEASE contact me at xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
 as one more day of this will cause me to end up in a padded room somewhere! Will Microsoft pay for that?&nbsp; Help!! Thank you in advance? MMC sent me to TechNet with this info. Hoping it may help? Also have screenshots of these errors.</strong></em></p>

<p>Hi Michelle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thank you for contacting me to try to help. I started getting more screen shots for you &amp; in the course of attempting to do that, I angered some new virus according to what I am NOW TOLD was a FAKE chat with Microsoft Live Agent? I believe I traced it
 to something that came up one morning when I started my computer. Something along the lines of "You have been enjoying "screenshade" or something like that, &amp; won't you donate today if you have enjoyed the service we have provided? I never downloaded anything
 of the kind! I have Premium Malwarebytes, but I tried to call them, &amp; the guy only wanted control of my computer, to put me on hold, come back on &amp; tell me to restart my laptop &amp; everything will be fine!!! I am sick to death of all of the "fake" support people,
 but that is what we deserve to go along with the "fake" news that our psychotic president keeps ranting about while he desperately tries to cover all of his illegal dealings. I suspect when I restart my computer, I will not be able to access it again, so I
 will just ship it back, &amp; throw the graveyard of laptops I have away WITH all of my private information in them. I'm not a quitter, but this has cost me a fortune to fight, &amp; every person I talk to says the OTHER person was the fake one!? Who is to say? I
 wasn't meant to withstand this constant barrage of information that has left me wondering if there is anyone left that isn't corrupt? I am sorry to have taken your time. I could send several, well actually somewhere near a hundred screenshots including when
 I tried to download msert.exe &amp; received a pop up saying this download didn't come from "THE STORE", are you sure you want to proceed with an unvalidated program (I had just downloaded seconds before from what was supposedly Microsoft support. It's no wonder
 people are running around talking about conspiracy theories! I've finally lost my sense of humor over it, along with my disability check. I apologize again. Thank you for responding, but my guess is it's too late.</p>

<p>......and latest update is my access to my laptop is limited. my cell phone was cloned &amp; locked me out, tried to post a service request with Malwarebytes Premium support, but the "entity" fighting for control would not allow me to post any screenshots with
 my similar query to MB then the submit key was blocked (kept getting a circle with a slash through it). I have also had HP attempt access, same problem there. I could download the program, but would not execute for me, so I sent a slew of screenshots to them
 per instructions. Shut my computer down out of disgust &amp; disbelief for several days. When I fired it up two days ago it seemed to work perfectly fine, i.e. no cursor jumping through this message yet, but I've seen this before, &amp; shortly after it starts up
 again. Now I know there is a mystery user signing in with full access, including changing ownership!&nbsp; I'm exhausted, I can't sleep, if I get any help, it doesn't take long before the call gets dropped, or my chat gets dropped, &amp; I haven't had a confirmation
 from HP that they did or did not receive all of those screenshots! I'm about ready to fold my business &amp; the I'll really be in bad shape. Any calls I tried to make to toll free numbers were re-routed to hard sell recordings that no doubt were just scams anyway!</p>
<p>I seriously don't even know who or how I can trust any correspondence by phone, text, email, land line, smoke signals, or Pony Express! Any suggestions now?</p>
<p>Thanks again as always!</p>

<p>Sorry, I didn't intend to ignore these questions.&nbsp; I have only had this laptop for 2 months. Where can I safely send the screenshots? Yes I did go through all of the work around steps with no change. My IT guy said it acts like the browsers are on continuous
 refresh, but he threw everything he had (in the line of malware/virus removal) at it, &amp; couldn't find a thing? Most of those programs I have left on here in case they too are being altered. I've had HP, AT&amp;T, Microsoft, &amp; the fake Malwarebytes number all looking
 at this, but so far nothing permanent works.</p>
<p>Thank you again!</p>
<p>Please NOTE TO ALL WHO USE MALWAREBYTES (A SUPERB PROGRAM BY ALL PREVIOUS STANDARDS) THEY DO NOT HAVE TELEPHONE SUPPORT, SO DON'T TRUST ANY NUMBERS YOU MAY FIND FOR THEM! THE NUMBER I WAS GIVEN IS 1-800-644-5716 AND IT IS ON MALWAREBYTES BLACK LIST OF NUMBERS
 ON THEIR SUPPORT WEBSITE.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also discovered my info went out with the Equifax breach, and I had the version of CCleaner by Piriform that recently had Trojans loaded into their files on one of their updates. If you use it, uninstall it, &amp; start with the newest version!</p>

</p><p>If you update the mouse driver and the mouse pointer keeps disappearing, the latest mouse driver version may not be compatible with Windows 10. We suggest that you roll back your mouse driver to resolve the issue. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the <strong>Start </strong>button and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Right-click your mouse driver, select <strong>Properties</strong>, and browse to the
<strong>Driver </strong>tab. </li><li>Press the <strong>Roll Back Driver</strong> option if available, and Windows 10 will begin the process.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
        </p>

 I went back to the list of Windows updates to find the one that says it was for a mouse driver, &amp; the date it was successful. Went to the Microsoft website &amp; looked under their historical list of updates, &amp; there is nothing noted about the mouse driver released
 update for the date it was suggesting as available either. I saw something today while browsing all over support sites &amp; possibly a few superhero websites (one becomes delirious after two months of this) lol&nbsp; !! My assumption after reading my MMC error logs
 for hours, is mention of 8 threads running at once, &amp; a reference to the system "looping"? I don't have knowledge of threads, &amp; what that would entail but the 8 caught my eye because by my count, I am able to type for about 8 sec, then the background above
 my Windows tabs will go from dark to light, or if I am typing in wordpad, or anything where the active window is in the color I chose, that is when I can type, &amp; when the color changes to an inactive window (white in most), I can not type until it cycles back
 after 8 sec. (could just be a coincidence or perhaps threads are equivalent to the 8 sec loop I am witnessing)? Some days I just marvel at the lingo I am now using with a semblance of understanding what I have actually said! I tend to go from screaming at
 my computer peppered with obscenities, to laughing a tad bit too hysterically as I crack jokes at myself, to myself, &amp; any fool that may be taping me for the "Christmas party video" at their jobs this year! Time to decompress after another 16 hour day chasing
 any whisper of a solution......&nbsp; I'm still fighting the good fight (or slamming my head into the wall) depending on how my madness translates on any given day! LOL&nbsp; Thank you again, sincerely!&nbsp; ~~ JAI</em></p>

<p>Buenas he llamado al numero de tenefono y me han dicho que pregunte aqui pk tengo la consola vetada, ya le comente al del telefono que la consola no esta modificada que es demostrable que se la puedo llevar al servicio tecnico de las palmas de gran canaria
 si hace falta me gustaria saber donde tengo que ir para que me miren la consola y me quiten la vetada de mi consola.</p>

<p>"... he llamado al numero de telefono y me han dicho que pregunte aqui ..."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Tranquilo, vuelve a llamar... que eso a sido un operador sin ganas de trabajar.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>La proxima vez que te digan eso, te recomiendo que le pidas sus datos y abrir un parte de incidencias. Eso de enviarte aqui donde solo somos usuarios como tu con ganas de ayudarnos entre nosotros, es tener mucho morro, mas cuando es él el que cobra, es decir,
 trabaja para solucionar problemas y atender al cliente.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>¿Lo de consola vetada te lo dice con algun mensaje explicito diciendo que esta baneado?</p>
<p>¿O crees que estas vetado y realmente la consola tiene algun fallo marcandose con las luces rojas (una, dos o tres luces)?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Yo te recomiendo que aportes datos palpables, como la compra de DLC y Arcades asi como juegos a peticion.</p>
<p>Aparte de los años que tengas en Xbox Live con suscripcion Gold.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Eso como minimo ya te serviria para que investigasen si fue un error en el sistema de baneo automatico.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>un saludo</p>
