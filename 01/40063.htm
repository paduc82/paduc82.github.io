<h2>            BSOD after windows vista to windows 7 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I was running windows vista 64 bit home premium ed on dell inspiron 1545 laptop, core2duo 2ghz, 4 gigs ram, and &nbsp;I upgraded to windows 7 64 bit home premium last week, from an ISO from the microsoft website.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked the MD sum and everything was fine. The actual upgrade install went fine also. I had a few programs that had problems so I reinstalled them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then, it had 219 updates to install, and it failed on most of them until eventually managed to install them all. Through it all, it took 4 days, and at least 100 bsod crashes i'd guess.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would crash trying to install an update every so often over that 4 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it seems everytime I try to update a driver, or install a new software, it crashes, The last two times involved audio driver update (IDT 92HD71B) and f.lux software (which I had installed on my vista)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't even look at the minidump file even though I have access to the folder with full control. It says I don't have access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a file I can upload or something so you can help me figure out what's going on here?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>is it normal to have this level of failures i am experiencing?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need some help urgently, thanks for any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW. the most common cause of the error was ox0000003b&nbsp;<br />

            <p>I did not know Windows had an ""emergency repair process".&nbsp; I hope the Microsoft engaged "expert" will tell us about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your system is a Dell that makes it an OEM system that came with Windows preinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tell us the Dell Service Tag Number (on a sticker or in the battery compartment).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tell us how and from where you downloaded the Windows 7 ISO you used to upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you installed Windows 7 Service Pack 1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is extremely unlikely that any Windows 7 installation ISO media is going to include drivers that are going to work on a Dell system (or any other system).&nbsp; The ones that may have been on your Vista system might not work either so you need to get those
 things from the Dell WWW site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After an install or upgrade you need to get the right drivers that match your hardware from the manufacturers WWW site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you should do it visit the Dell WWW Support site on this link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/4</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a manual System Restore Point before making any adjustments so if things get worse you can undo the changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the Dell Support site enter your Service Tag number or let it detect your system, then go to their Driver Update section and let it scan your system and install any driver updates it recommends like this example:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/957e3a98-f4f4-423c-8324-fea65590d2f3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/957e3a98-f4f4-423c-8324-fea65590d2f3" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When your system is up to date, restart and see how things look.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you were to do a clean install of Windows 7 you would still need to visit the Dell site to get the drivers you need.</p>

<h2>            Can I use a Micro SD card to store a system image or repair disk for my Surface Pro 4&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I put a 128GB Micro SD card in my Surface Pro 4 and would like to make it a system repair disk and also keep a current system image of c: drive on it, but Windows 10 won't let me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At (control panel &gt; file history &gt; System Image Backup &gt; Create a System Repair Disk), the applet shows my NTSF-formatted Micro-SD card but says I cannot use it for either a repair disk or a system image because it is not a CD or DVD drive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used USB thumb drives in the past to make a system repair disk. &nbsp;So I don't know what to believe. &nbsp;Is there an expert out there who can tell me what the current situation is? &nbsp;</p>

<p>

<p>Hi Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'm understanding you correctly, I believe the difference between recovery drive and recovery disc is&nbsp;simply the storage media. A recovery disc would be on a physical disc, i.e. CDs and DVDs, which might explain why your Surface is telling you that you
 can only use a CD or DVD. I would suggest writing a "recovery drive" to your Micro SD, through a USB card reader.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just recently completely reset my laptop running Windows 10 and made&nbsp;a fresh system image back up onto an external HDD. Windows called that a "recovery drive" not a "recovery disc."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give it a try and let me know what happens.</p>

<h2>            I am getting error 0x0000000d when trying add a printer through my wireless network with my new laptop using Windows 7. </h2>
                    
<p>I just bought a new Acer Aspire 5552 with Windows 7. Im hooking it up to my home network. Here is my network setup. My wireless router is a Westell DSL Router from Centrylink.&nbsp; the printer is connected to a Compaq desktop running Windows XP SP3. The printer
 is a LEXMARK X1100 which is connected via USB port to the desktop Computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; I can print from the desktop to the LEXMARK&nbsp; printer with no problem. My new laptop (Win 7) can see the Desktop PC and can access all the shared files. I have no problem sharing files between the machines. My new laptop (Win 7) can see the shared Lexmark
 printer on my network.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I can print on the Lexmark printer from my new laptop (Win 7) when I am connected directly to the printer using a USB port. after I installed the drivers from the lexmark disk, but when I try to add the printer through the wireless network I get the error
 0x0000000d. To add the printer on my new laptop through the wireless network I clicked on "Add Printer", highlighted the printer (Lexmark x1100) in the "Select A Printer" window, clicked on the next button, the "Windows Printer Installation" dialog box opens
 and says "connecting to Lexmark x1100" below that it says "finishing the installation", then the Add Printer error dialog box opens and says "Windows can not connect to the printer" under details it says "Operation failed with error 0x0000000d".I have installed
 and uninstalled the printer and drivers about 5 times so far. Found an updated Lexmark vista driver for windows 7 and download it but cant install it without connecting the laptop to the printer. I found what I thought was the fix but still not working. This
 is what I did so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I went to <strong>START</strong> then to <em>search programs and files</em> , put in<span><span><strong>cmd</strong></span></span>, then at the top of the window I right clicked on&nbsp;<span><span><strong>cmd</strong></span></span>selected
<strong>Run as administrator</strong> Then the dos window opened up with the prompt<strong>C: Windows\System32&gt;
</strong>I typed in<strong> net use LPT1\\KEITHS\X1100</strong>Keiths is the name of the computer running windows xp that has the Lexmark Printer hooked to it by USB cable now this is where I get confused, do you hit enter or just leave the prompt window open
 or close it...If I hit enter I get a<strong> System error 67 has occurred &nbsp; &nbsp; the Network name cannot be found
</strong>If I close it then go to<strong>Start</strong> , <strong>Devices and Printers</strong> , at the top select<strong> add Printer</strong> , Select<strong> local printer</strong> then from the Port list select<strong> LPT2</strong> then select<strong>
 LEXMARK Inkjet drivers</strong> then it shows<strong> Lexmark X1100,</strong> Select it then<strong> OK,
</strong>the <strong>installing Printer</strong> window starts but never finishes and you cant cancel it, I had to restart computer to stop it. When I restarted the Laptop it showed the Lexmark printer in the printer folder but still wont connect to the printer.
 This is driving me insane. Can someone help me please?</p>

    <title>Scrolling on mousepad stops working after every restart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> litsvania  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scrolling on mousepad stops working after every restart</h2>
                    <p>Every time there is some kind of update on my laptop I restart my computer, besides that I tend to leave it in sleep mode. After every restart though, regardless of whether there was an update or not all of the scrolling features from my mouse pad are gone.
 No scrolling down, no swiping corners, nothing. Every time this happens the only thing that I can do to get it to work again is go to Control Panel &gt; Mouse &gt; Elan. I click Elan, I click options and there I change nothing or click nothing all I do is press
 OK and the scrolling will work again. This didn't used to happen for the first couple of years with my laptop, it has been more of a problem within the last like 6 months and I haven't done anything specifically different to this laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's bothersome to have to go through this process every time I reboot my computer, and even more bothersome that I don't really change anything to get it to work again so I can't figure out why this keeps happening. Since it started it hasn't stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do?</p>

            <p>As the issue still persists, you are advised to uninstall and reinstall touchpad drivers (if you have not done this already) and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important</strong>: To reinstall Elan touchpad drivers, you may need to take assistance of your computer manufacturer. Thus, it is recommended to contact your computer manufacturer first and check if the drivers are available for download and only
 then, proceed with uninstalling the drivers.<br />
</p>
<p>To uninstall touchpad drivers, follow the steps below:<br />
1.&nbsp;Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap "Search".<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then click "Search".)<br />
2.&nbsp;Enter <strong>Device</strong> <strong>Manager</strong> in the search box, and tap or click "Device Manager".<br />
3.&nbsp;In the list of hardware categories, double-tap or double-click the category "Mice and other pointing devices" and go to your touchpad. Double-tap or double-click the touchpad name.&nbsp;<br />
4.&nbsp;Tap or click the "Driver" tab, tap or click "Uninstall", and then follow the instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstall the drivers and check if that resolves the issue.</p>

<h2>            Processor constantly working after Windows 10 update on 16 November 2016</h2>
                    <p>Good morning</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I installed the latest windows update, and since then my processor is constantly working, and the fan is running audibly all the time. I have a Dell laptop and first thought it was the DFS, but I have now disabled that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I check the only consistent operations are "System"and "System interrupts".</p>
<p>My computer now takes about 30 seconds to start up and to close down, whereas before the installation it was almost instantaneous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assist! Please give very clear step-by-step instructions as I am a techno idiot and struggle even to follow menu directions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards</p>

<p>
</p><p>To isolate your concern, can you provide us a screenshot of the CPU Details of your PC under Task Manager? Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, and then click <strong>Task Manager</strong>.</li><li>Under the <strong>Details</strong> tab, click on the drop-down arrow above the
<strong>CPU</strong> tab to arrange the program to descending order.</li><li>Take a screenshot. See image below.</li></ol>

<h2>            Error 0x80131534 &#58; Unknown COM Status Code when trying to run Crystal Reports in Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>I have an Accounting application that when it prints reports is supposed to call the Crystal Reports to display and print the report. It works fine on one PC, but on one particular PC it does not work and returns this error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error 0x80131534 : Unknown COM Status Code</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Crystal Reports on its own and runs fine. But when the program calls Crystal, I just can't get it to work. It seems to be a Windows problem and something having to do with the security of this PC not allowing control to another program. I've
 tried almost everything to no avail.</p>
<p>As I said, it works fine on other PC's but not this one.</p>
<p>This particular PC does not allow me to setup GoToAssist unattended access, which I can do on others. So something about this particular PC is weird. Perhaps anyone has seen this before? Let me kjnow if you need any more info.</p>

<p>Hello again. I did what you suggested, the error came up but there was nothing I could find in any of the Windows Event Viewer Logs.</p>
<p>The application came up with the same Error 0x80131534, then gave me an error message about invalid function count (which was i'm sure an error just for this program), then 3 messages about Invalid Member INTEROPFORM.</p>
<p>Hunting around the PC, I made myself an Administrator of the PC just to be sure. I noticed in User Control that none of belonged to the "Distributed COM Group". I thought that may make the difference, but adding us to the group had no effect.</p>
<p>I've setup Remote Unattended Access to that PC so I can log in anytime I want and try different things to get this error solved.</p>
<p>Might you have any ideas what to try next?</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

    <title>Recovery Disc not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> midgey17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovery Disc not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I acquired a Fujitsu Lifebook T902, 2 days ago. I familiarised myself with Windows 8, soon discovering 8.1 in the store.</p>
<p>After the upgrade, the physical buttons on the screen's bottom corner (volume + - etc.) stopped working. I was also receiving an error on startup, that the pointing device wouldn't work because Fujitsu System Manager failed to start. I attempted to fix the
 problems by reinstalling the drivers from their website with no joy. I searched the issue on the net and found a similar scenario in somebody else's thread on this forum. The suggestions given, were to perform a "clean boot" to narrow the problem down. I followed
 suit, and now my very new and expensive piece of kit is buggered.</p>
<p>On startup, the first load screen simply says Fujitsu across it (with loading circles below). There is nothing displayed about BIOS options and I tried pressing all of the F keys etc. I couldn't boot in safe mode as a result. The "Please Wait" screen is
 as far as I can get now. When the lock screen appears, the touchscreen/mouse respond and allow me to swipe back to the Please Wait.
</p>
<p>My next move was to put the Windows 8 Recovery Disc in and do another hard reboot. This has made no difference, I can hear the disc drive working as it reads the disc but nothing is loaded by it.</p>
<p>It has been a rather frustrating ordeal! Trying to research all of the issues has been difficult, and I now learn that the product ID is hidden away from me in the BIOS.... which I can't get into.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me?</p>
<p>How long must I "Please Wait"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>John.</p>

            <p>1. Insert your flash drive &amp; wait for it to be recognised.</p>
<p>2. Launch Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>3. Select the files to be transferred using single left click of mouse. (Hold down the CTRL key to select multiple files)</p>
<p>4. Press <strong>CTRL</strong> + <strong>C</strong> (at the same time) to copy the files to your clipboard.</p>
<p>5. In Windows Explorer double click on your flash drive.</p>
<p>6. In right-hand pane of Windows Explorer, right click on a blank area and select
<strong>Paste</strong>. The files will then start to copy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a number of ways of doing it - the above is one example. Dragging and dropping is another way.</p>

<h2>            Applications cannot connect to the internet.</h2>
                    
<p>so i got an eMachines with windows 7 on it and it connects to the internet just fine. IE can pull up any site and any content on the site so long as its within the browser its self. but other programs such as pandora desktop radio, World of Warcraft, AIM,
 and anything else that tries to connect to the internet, except for IE, cannot connect, many cant even detect the network. but when i use my laptop that has vista on it all the same programs connect without a problem, on the same internet line. i know its
 not the internet its something within the software on the desktop itself. thank you very much for your help in advance i know someone will know how to fix this problem.</p>
<p>The computer is completely factory, no new firewalls, no new virus protection, no off-brand updates, nothing except what&nbsp;came on it and games that cant connect.</p>
<p>my internet is through suddenlink communications, if you have any questions just ask and ill answer them.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>What is the exact error message you get on the page?</span></p>
<p><span><span>I would also suggest you to place the computer in a clean boot state and check if the start of
 the laptop gets faster. To place the computer in a clean boot state:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Start the System Configuration Utility</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Click
<strong><span>Start,</span></strong> type
<strong>msconfig</strong> in the <strong><span>Start Search</span></strong> box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or provide confirmation.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Configure Selective Startup options</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<strong><span>System Configuration Utility</span></strong> dialog box, click
<strong><span>Selective Startup</span></strong> on the
<strong><span>General</span></strong> tab.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click to clear the
<strong><span>Load Startup Items</span></strong> check box.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span> The
<strong>Use Original Boot.ini</strong> check box is unavailable.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<strong><span>Services</span></strong> tab.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click to select the
<strong><span>Hide All Microsoft Services</span></strong> check box.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong><span>Disable All</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>. </span>
</p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When you are prompted, click
<strong><span>Restart</span></strong>.
<br />
</span><strong><span><br />
Step 3: Determine whether the problem is resolved</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>After the computer starts, try to start the affected game or program or the issue you are facing to determine whether the problem
 is resolved. </span></li><li><span>If the problem does not occur after you restart, the interference is occurring because of a background program or service. In this
 case, see the "Determine what is causing the problem" section. </span></li><li><span>If the problem returns after you perform a clean startup, the interference is not occurring because of a background program or service.
 In this case, this article cannot resolve your problem. See the "How to return Windows to Normal startup mode" section to return your computer to the original startup mode. Then, go to the "Next steps" section for other resources that may help you resolve
 this problem</span> </li></ul>
<p><span><span>To return your computer to a Normal startup mode, follow these steps:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box. </span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type
<strong>msconfig</strong>, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or provide confirmation.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the
<strong>General</strong> tab, click <strong>Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When you are prompted, click
<strong>Restart</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Perform a clean startup to determine whether background programs are interfering with your game
 or program</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>

<h2>            &#34;PC refresh&#34; stuck in loop win8.1</h2>
                    <p>My Lenovo laptop running Windows 8.1 suddenly showed the BSOD. Error 0xc000021a.</p>
<p>After a few restart attempts, and failed auto repairs, it showed me some options. I think it's called the "Automatic Repair screen" I was able to start up in Safe Mode just fine.</p>
<p>I restarted to get into that same options menu. "System restore" said there was nothing it could do, so I decided to try "PC refresh" which (I think) would uninstall all my apps, and leave the laptop in the same condition as when I got it, but with all my
 files intact.</p>
<p>The refresh failed, and decided to restart itself, and now it is stuck in a loop. I don't know how to get back to the "Automatic Repair" screen, which at least offered some hope of a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I live abroad right now and can't take the laptop in for repairs, or at least it would be very difficult. Any hint on how to break out of the endless restart loop? Just holding the power button until the computer shuts off doesn't help. When I turn it back
 on again, it picks up right where it left off.</p>

            You can use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the Windows Recovery Environment.

<p>I tried restarting the computer with the power button many times. Originally, when I had the BSoD, that did prompt the Windows Recovery Environment options to appear. But after choosing "Refresh PC" option, it got stuck in a loop. That what prompted me to
 post this question. Force shutting down and restarting does not bring up the options anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After your comment, I found a video on YouTube showing the exact moment when to start holding down the power button, to make sure I was doing it right.&nbsp;https://youtu.be/aJYVh7_fXaY</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the directions, but the words "Preparing Automatic Repair" never appear. It just keeps loading into the same loop. First it says "Welcome", then "Setting up a few more things", and then says that setup failed and I need to restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think my only remaining options are to try and make a repair CD or USB. Or to find a repair shop, even though I am not in an English speaking country. Are there any other options?</p>

<h3> bill huff  say:</h3>
<h2>            missing msi.dll files in win xp sp3</h2>
                    when i start my system, a panel pops up "status" and trys to install a file called status.msi.exe or dll, sometimes either or both, and it asks for the location of the file which doesn't exist. then i asks for the system disk,which doesnt exist as the
 version installed was a preloaded version of xp prop sp3. so in oreder for the system to continue I have to use task manager to end the installation attempt of this file. I have used system file checker to attemp to locate this file but it canot conplete as
 it also asks for the windows xp sp2 instalation disk as well. is there a way to replace this file from another source that will correct this problem?

    <title>Copying DVD files turn into folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williambriggs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copying DVD files turn into folders</h2>
                    I am copying a non-encrypted DVD from my DVD reader to a network-attached drive. I do this frequently. Suddenly, some of the files being copied become folders. These folders have the same name as the file that was being copied. At this time I get a message
 stating "There is already a folder with the same name as the file name you specified. Specify a different name". I can then delete the folder and retry the file copy. Sometimes it works OK... other times it re-creates the folder and it goes round-and-round
 until it finally copies the file. I seem to remember something like this in the &nbsp;long-forgotten past, but I don't remember why it happened. &nbsp;Any ideas?

<p>I'm sorry if you missed the point... I am copying the disc to a hard drive on my network. I am not creating another disc. I tried to copy the "VIDEO_TS" folder to the hard drive. Within that folder there are NO other folders. However, occasionally a folder
 is created on the hard drive within the VIDEO_TS folder&nbsp;with the name of one of the files to be copied. That is when I get the message I referred to. Sometimes I can simply delete the bogus folder and retry the copy and it works. Sometimes it simply re-creates
 the folder. I have done this many times in the past with no such problem. I have tried copy/paste and simply dragging the folder, but it happens in either case.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I am aware of this. I do this a lot. I have many DVD files on that NAS server. I have tried copy/paste as well as dragging that folder (VIDEO_TS). I have also tried creating the VIDEO_TS folder manually and doing a copy/paste of all the files in the VIDEO_TS
 folder of the DVD. In every case there has been a few cases of the anomaly. Sometimes it's one or two and sometimes its as many as ten files that have the problem. The file extensions are not consistent either... sometimes .vob, sometimes .bup, sometimes .ifo.
 I am about to re-boot to see if this problem disappears.</p>

<p>I have software that will un-encrypt DVDs. However, none is necessary in this case because the DVDs in question are not encrypted. There is no "difference" in file systems that I am aware of. I have been doing this for years. Windows has always been able
 to copy the DVD files to hard disc. What is now happening is an anomaly I can't understand. Also, after deleting the bogus "folders" from the hard drive I am able to copy the file with the same name. The hard drive "DVDs" are playable. Yes, I have used DVD
 Shrink and others to compress DVDs, but that was so as not to use too much space. With today's disc capacities that is no longer an issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>A few years ago, I came across an MS recommendation for Windows 7 that the computer ought to be restarted at least every week [I think they referred to potential memory problems but I cannot find the link].&nbsp; Perhaps such precautions continue to apply to
 Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Personally, I find that my Windows 7 computer benefits from restarting every few days or some functions start misbehaving [just for example, if I have sent it to sleep several times manually or automatically over the course of a few days, then I often
 find that it can fail to sleep when told to by the power plan].&nbsp; </em></p>

            Hi sumeet
<br />
<br />Sorry, the official Windows 10 USB flash drives cannot be written to again, they are created specifically so they cannot be wiped and this cannot be changed by any method
<br />
<br />To create new Windows 10 installation media, you will need to use another flash drive (min 8GB)

    <title>Win 10 create recovery USB flash drive has two - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> travisteexp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 create recovery USB flash drive has two partitions&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I created a recovery disk on a 64 GB &nbsp;flash drive.</p>
<p>I had a few problems because it kept failing to complete the process.</p>
<p>The drive was originally formated to fat32 so it only had 32 GB.</p>
<p>Then I was able to go into dos prompt and use diskpart to clean it and then format it to ntfs and back to 64 GB.</p>
<p>Finally I was able to complete the creation of the recovery drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However????</p>
<p>Now it is back to fat32 and has two partitions again. &nbsp;The second partition is unusable apparently.</p>
<p>It has 32 GB in the partition that it is using, and 27 GB in the partition it is not using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that sound like what it is supposed to be doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I do this on a drive that has only 32 GB instead of using the 64 GB flash drive?</p>

            <p>A recovery drive is formatted as Fat 32 because UEFI systems need Fat32 in order to boot from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it will only use 32 GB for the drive.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 - blank screen on login for secondary user - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pawanm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 - blank screen on login for secondary user</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently purchased a laptop with Windows 8 OS. This is the first time I am using this OS. Initially I created an admin account and am using it successfully. Today I tried to add a secondary user. When I switch to this new user, it stays on the blanks screen
 with mouse pointer on it.&nbsp;However I can open up task manager and navigate to the folders of various processes and services (I tried it only to check if I can do anything). However I am not able to come out of this blank screen. I tried to delete this account
 and recreate a new one, but no use. I read on the forums that the start screen might be going on the secondary monitor. However I tried to connect laptop to the TV, but still sees blank screen on both. Windows+P keys also do not bring up any display menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise how to fix this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Pawan</p>

<div><span>​</span><span>Hi,</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span><br />
Thank you for posting the query in </span><span>Microsoft community!</span><span><br />
<br />
<span>You've reached the right forum for the question.
</span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Some of the common reasons for the black screen are:</span></div>
<div><span>1) The computer may have multiple monitors.</span></div>
<div><span>2) The video drivers are not updated to its latest version.</span></div>
<div><span>3) It may be due to some devices connected with the computer.</span></div>
<div><span>I will try my best with all my available resources to help you to fix this issue.</span></div>
<div><b><span>Method 1</span></b><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>Disconnect all the external devices (printers, scanner, USB <b>(universal serial bus)</b> drives, etc...) except mouse and the keyboard and then boot up.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span><br />
Step 1:You may try to boot into safe mode with networking</span></div>
<div><span>To start the computer with minimal set of drivers and files, follow these steps.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
a) Press the ‘</span><b><span>Windows + C’ </span></b><span>key on the </span><b><span>keyboard</span></b><span>.<br />
<br />
b) Click on </span><b><span>settings</span></b><span>, more pc settings and then </span>
<b><span>general</span></b><span>.<br />
<br />
c) Scroll down to </span><b><span>advanced startup</span></b><span>, click </span>
<b><span>restart now</span></b><span>.<br />
<br />
d) Click on </span><b><span>troubleshoot</span></b><span>, </span><b><span>advanced options</span></b><span>, Windows</span><b><span>Startup Settings</span></b><span>.<br />
<br />
e) Click </span><b><span>restart</span></b><span>, select </span><b><span>safe mode with networking</span></b><span>and then press
</span><b><span>enter</span></b><span>.<br />
<br />
</span><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Restart the computer to start in normal mode.<br />
Step 2: If the issue doesn't occur in safe mode with networking then you may perform a clean boot and check.<br />

            <p>This is not all all helpful. How can it be a start up issue when we can login with the primary user and everything is fine? So we login, create a new user account, logout, then login with the new user account, and all we get is a totally blank start screen.</p>

</p><p>Windows-D takes you to the old desktop which seems to work, but you cannot run any apps, e.g. word, excel, or another app that is installed unless you browse to it in file explorer and double click; then it works. The search charm on the start screen doesn't
 work. The Full Apps list on the start screen is also blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very disappointing that 2 y ears later, the same problem&nbsp;still happens on a PC that has been totally updated with all MS updates.</p>

<p>I agree, as of now it looks like Microsoft doesn't know the cause, of course resetting/refreshing/clean installing your windows 8 will resolve the problem but not fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Microsoft start giving your users real options</p>

<p>I have this problem also on my daughters windows 8 laptop. On a couple of occasions this happened to her. I am also an admin user on her laptop. As of this week, neither she nor I can get past the black screen when we login. We have the cursor, we can ctrl+d
 and open task manager, but we cannot get any windows desktop.</p>

<p>I have same situation.</p>

My task scheduler is throwing out a bunch of error messages when I try and run it.&nbsp; Basically, it says file has been tampered with or corrupted!&nbsp; This is my work computer and short of backing up every night onto a terabyte drive I am at a loss.&nbsp; I would rather
 not have to back up every night manually if I don't have to.&nbsp; Also, this prevents one of my software programs from uploading to a backup server every night, which needs to happen.&nbsp; This is how it looks and this is only one of at LEAST a dozen error messages.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2dd656c2-81bc-402e-b874-3356faf18704" />

    <title>Position of icon labels on Windows 10 desktop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Position of icon labels on Windows 10 desktop</h2>
                    <p>For some reason all of my desktop icons are suddenly displaying their labels to the right of the icon rather then underneath it. I'm sure there's a simple solution to fix this but I can't figure it out and despite trawling the net I can't see anyone else
 has been bothered by this! Below is a grab of how the problem presents...<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>

            Hi Steve,
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop
<br />Choose View - Small Icons, Medium Icons or Large Icons
<br />
<br />If that does not work, on your Desktop, press the keyboard shortcut:
<br />
<br />Ctrl + Shift + a number (0 - 9)       
        </p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for responding.<br />
<br />
The first solution just changed the size of the icons but did nothing to the text.<br />
<br />
The second solution did nothing at all...</p>

            Hmmm, for some reason your Desktop is in List view instead of Icons . . .
<br />
<br />Try pressing the Ctrl Key and using the scroll wheel on your Mouse

<p>It seems to be stuck in list mode. In desperation I've even done a system restore and it's STILL doing it. To make matters worse a lot of the icons are rendering on top of one another making my PC pretty much unusable. I'm at my wits end! I'm thinking of
 going back to Windows 7. It may be old but at least it's usable!</p>

            Thanks anyway Dave... Even the bloody troubleshooter doesn't work...<br />
