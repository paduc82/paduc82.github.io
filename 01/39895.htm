<h2>            changed file location for windows 10 upgrade &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to upgrade windows 8.1 to windows 10. &nbsp;After the windows update downloaded windows 10 installation files into the D drive, I merged C drive with D drive into C drive to increase the disk space. &nbsp;However, the windows update can not locate the windows
 10 files anymore because the D drive is gone; Neither can it re-download windows 10 installation files. &nbsp;It stuck there. &nbsp;Any solution? &nbsp;I appreciate it. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            netflix won&#39;t load on Vista anymore</h2>
                    Hi.&nbsp; I had watched Netflix stream through my desktop several months ago (Vista home premium).&nbsp; Evidently some download/update either DID or DIDN'T get loaded and now I cannot watch streaming netflix anymore.&nbsp; The Netflix help site directed me to uninstall
 Silverlight and reinstall it.&nbsp; I did the uninstall and the reinstall downloads but will not install - it states that my browser does not support the 64 bit silverlight.&nbsp; I do have 64 bit OS and I do have SP 2 installed.&nbsp; Any other suggestions or should I stop
 using Firefox and try a different browser?&nbsp; Thanks!

            <p>Hi ReneeStearns,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thanks for posting the question. It looks like the Netflix application is not working as expected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you have tried to uninstall and re-install and you face the same issue in Firefox, I would suggest you to use Internet Explorer and check if you face the same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you face the same issue in Internet Explorer try the steps&nbsp;mentioned in the KB article&nbsp;check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watching Netflix streaming media using Internet Explorer requires that you install Microsoft Silverlight. At times you may see issues when watching Netflix streaming media or installing Silverlight. You may experience one or more of the following issues:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>You may be prompted to install Silverlight even though Silverlight is already installed
</li><li>You may be unable to view streaming media from Netflix </li><li>You may be unable to install or uninstall Silverlight</li></ul>

the path you have given is not a system file in the error ,,,<br />
may be a third party software/malware has tampered the explorer....<br />
<br />
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp; (1)</b> Go to start&gt;run and type regedit and enter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the right side look for Shell which should have value of just explorer.exe just like this..Delete everything at right side of explorer.exe, if there is anything.

<b>&nbsp; (2)</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under same key Winlogon also look for Userinit&nbsp; check whether it is like in the below illustration... this is the way it should be ..

            Thanks for the very detailed instructions! I followed them exactly and also disabled all of my automatic start-up programs, but the message still comes up when I boot Windows 7.&nbsp; One possible issue: in the 2nd screen shot related to Userinit, my system
 does show it as Type REG_SZ but it also has to the right of that, under the Data column:" C:\windows\system32\userinit.exe," Please let me know if I should have cleared that. But if it looks OK, then thanks for helping me speed up the Start-up process, but
 the error still remains. Any other suggestions?

            If there is anythig other than this C:\windows\system32\userinit.exe, just delete from Userinit<br />
<br />
If it is still infected , or giving alert you can install a free malware removal tool and have a full scan<br />

<h2>            DVD formatting in the background--How do I know when it&#39;s finished&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to burn jpg files (2.3 gb)&nbsp;onto a DVD disk.&nbsp; Both computers using Windows 10.&nbsp; One computer (turnkey--dedicated for image processing only) crashed when I tried to copy images to the DVD.&nbsp; (never ever had this happen with Windows 7).&nbsp; Tried again
 and&nbsp;the desktop background image disappeared and went black.&nbsp;&nbsp; Second computer did successfully copy the images.&nbsp; But then I got this message that Windows is formatting the remainder of the DVD in the background.&nbsp; Question: How do I determine when the computer
 is done&nbsp;formatting&nbsp;so I can take out the DVD and&nbsp;give it to customer?&nbsp; I've been waiting and waiting.&nbsp; No message saying it's done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I've been a long time Microsoft products user.&nbsp;&nbsp; Excepting Adobe programs, all other programs are produced by Microsoft.&nbsp; I've always had very good performance with Microsoft products.&nbsp; But I believe I made the mistake&nbsp;by upgrading from Windows 7 to
 Windows 10.&nbsp; Now I feel like I'm&nbsp;being treated as beta tester and I don't have the skills&nbsp;or TIME to be that.&nbsp; Since upgrading to Windows 10&nbsp;both&nbsp;main use&nbsp;computers crash once a week or more.&nbsp; And then&nbsp;I get frequent requests (mandatory) to update without
 delay.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before&nbsp;Windows 10, my computers had not crashed in years.&nbsp; In short, I've gone from stability to instability overnight.&nbsp; I try my best to deal with&nbsp;frequent interruptions to fix this or that,&nbsp;but find in the process a most disturbing development, the
 number&nbsp;computer inconsistencies that&nbsp;have crept into my work flow when using Adobe CS6 programs in conjunction with Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;Only my third&nbsp;"computer" (Surface 3)&nbsp;seems to work without issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>1.&nbsp; Was I notified previously when I first upgraded to Windows 10 and now am facing this issue?</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Which application are you using to burn the disks in Windows?</p>
<p>In Windows 7, whenever I popped an empty&nbsp;DVD or CD into the computer, Windows provided its&nbsp;DVD writer app which opened up automatically.&nbsp; I expected the same thing with Windows 10, assuming that if the procedure was going to be different Windows would somehow
 tell me what to do&nbsp;after I inserted the new DVD into the computer &nbsp; That did not happen on May 13.&nbsp; I had to click on the DVD player and then drag stuff into it.&nbsp; There were&nbsp;no&nbsp;"hints" "messages"&nbsp;about what to do next.&nbsp; I eventually found a place to click
 burn.&nbsp; But when the burn was finished I got this message that the computer would continue formatting the disk in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How in the heck&nbsp;was I supposed to know when it would be&nbsp;done.&nbsp; There&nbsp;was no signal, no message.&nbsp; With Windows 7 OS when I completed the burn on&nbsp;a DVD, the disc tray opened up immediately.&nbsp; No delay.&nbsp; This delay in&nbsp;Windows 10 is not unique to burning a DVD.&nbsp;
 So many aspects of&nbsp;the new OS&nbsp;take a lot longer, not just a few seconds but minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It used to be that when some computing was in process there would be an estimated time and a bar that illustrated the decreasing time remaining before completion.&nbsp; With Windows 10, all I get is this little revolving circle and an occasional message on a&nbsp;full
 screen saying something like "we'll be done pretty soon".&nbsp; Exception, with formatting the DVD, I got nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But back to your question.&nbsp; Tonight I tested out both computers BEFORE completing another photography job.&nbsp; With my turnkey (photography/videography only) computer, when I inserted the DVD&nbsp;I did get a prompt this time.&nbsp; At some&nbsp;step later&nbsp;I got the prompt
 that the computer was formatting the DVD and after that it gave me choices.&nbsp;&nbsp;I followed&nbsp;each prompt but made a mistake by choosing Lightroom, so I canceled out and then had to manually pull up the DVD icon and drag images into the empty space.&nbsp; There&nbsp;was no
 way to go&nbsp;back and review previous prompts.&nbsp; After&nbsp;I finished the burn I again got that message saying that Windows would continue the formatting in the background while I continued using the computer.&nbsp; There was no message about when it would be completed.&nbsp;
 After waiting 5 minutes, I clicked eject button and saw that the DVD lights were flashing.&nbsp; A minute later the disc tray opened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took the DVD and inserted it into my "Internet &amp; Business" computer.&nbsp; I got no prompts and the DVD icon was not&nbsp;visible when I opened File Explorer and searched for it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I then went to Apps and clicked on Windows DVD.&nbsp; As soon as I did a DVD icon appeared
 and I was able to verify a successful burn.&nbsp; You know, with Windows 7 I didn't have to search and problem solve like this.&nbsp; Time consuming and frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Did I make any software or hardware changes recently.&nbsp; No</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; What is the make and model of my PC.&nbsp;</p>

NEW THOUGHT:&nbsp; With my work computer (video/photography editing only) I really&nbsp;want to go back to Windows 7.&nbsp; It's too late to automatically have that happen within the computer, however, I do have the original DVD's and code.&nbsp; There are so many not good&nbsp;unprecedented
 things that&nbsp;happen with this&nbsp;Windows 10 OS&nbsp;while I'm using&nbsp;Adobe CS6 programs, inconsistencies, computer crashes, reboots, system updates,&nbsp;things that take time and make me feel&nbsp;anxious about whether I can commit to jobs with specific timeframes&nbsp;without delays.&nbsp;Alas,
 my&nbsp;Windows Home Server (separate)&nbsp;doesn't have the capacity to back up 4 or 5 terabytes of images/videos and I refuse to use/trust CLOUD with something that cannot be replaced once lost.&nbsp; I will have to buy a new backup system before I can accomplish that.&nbsp;
 $$'s.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I really do feel like I've become a OS beta&nbsp;user and I'm not technically knowledgeable enough to quickly sort out things and problem solve.&nbsp; I loose a lot of time and end up uncertain about so much.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll keep Windows 10 on my Internet/Business computer because I want to stay&nbsp;in touch with new developments and&nbsp;know first hand&nbsp;when things hopefully become stable..&nbsp; Besides,&nbsp;there are not the same&nbsp;time&nbsp;limitations/contracts with its use compared&nbsp;with the&nbsp;work
 computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for listening.</p>

            <p>I not familiar with the term "latest build" when referring to computers and would not know where to look.&nbsp; I'm a fairly good computer user but not tech savvy.&nbsp;&nbsp;I imagine you talk about and do these kind of maneuvers on a daily basis.&nbsp; For me&nbsp;many of those
 same things encounter&nbsp;like once every 5 years or more.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's not enough experience&nbsp;for me to&nbsp;recall the terms used or processes involved.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All Windows 10&nbsp;updates are installed in a mandatory manner, so l assume all users like myself have no choice other than delay the update until 3AM the following day after getting a notice.&nbsp; Perhaps your fix it idea applies to other versions of Windows.&nbsp;
 Again I wouldn't know.&nbsp; But I don't understand why you would think there are Windows 10 updates waiting to install in my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the life of me I can't see how creating a new user account will have any bearing on how Windows 10 operates on my computer, at least in regard to a basic function like burning a DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my last communication I have found that the DVD on my turnkey computer&nbsp;now works.&nbsp; And no longer do I get a message after burning images onto the&nbsp;DVD&nbsp;saying that "Windows will continue formatting the DVD."&nbsp;&nbsp; That is&nbsp;three or four weeks after beginning
 this search for a solution.&nbsp; Anyway, that's an improvement for sure, but I cannot explain how it happened.&nbsp; Why now and not before?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>More on DVD burning:&nbsp; In the past, Windows 7&nbsp;and other versions&nbsp;always provided pop up prompts with what I call "post it notes", telling me my options and what to do.&nbsp; Windows 10 doesn't seem to be work that way.&nbsp; For example, I found myself hunting everywhere&nbsp;for
 the button to start a DVD burn after dragging images into the program.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;nowhere on the screen.&nbsp; In Windows 7 it was always at the top left hand corner of the screen.&nbsp; I had to search in the menus&nbsp;to find&nbsp;the burn button "hiding".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you kindly&nbsp;refer&nbsp;me to&nbsp;the best set of instructions for transferring my work computer&nbsp;back to Windows 7 from Windows 10?&nbsp; I've used this new OS long enough so that there is no chance of automatic recovery to a previous version.&nbsp; But I do have my original
 Windows 7 CD with code.&nbsp; Why now?&nbsp; I continue to&nbsp;experience&nbsp;multiple crashes and various&nbsp;inconsistencies when using various Adobe CS6&nbsp;programs.&nbsp; I need a more stable work process&nbsp;like I had with Windows 7.&nbsp; Please believe me, I have tried the best I can&nbsp;using
 Windows 10.&nbsp; I'm just not&nbsp;tech smart enough to overcome quickly&nbsp;all the issues that keep popping&nbsp;up and eventually become distractions to my&nbsp;photo/video work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for listening and your&nbsp;attempts to help.&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 reliability history reports unexpected shutdown every time - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nimrodelriver  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 reliability history reports unexpected shutdown every time computer shuts down</h2>
                    <p>Hello, the last three days&nbsp;Windows 8.1 reliability history reports unexpected shutdown every time computer shuts down, despite that the computer shuts down normally. &nbsp;It is then always really slow to start up back up. &nbsp;On the graph it also reports that apnmcp.exe
 and APNUpdater and 64Driverload.exe stopped working and when I check the performance in task manager the Asktoolbar Notifier is glitching until it loads. &nbsp;This is the only technical details the reliability history graph show for the apnmcp.exe it doesn't give
 details on anything else or anything on the 'unexpected shutdown' &nbsp;:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Description</strong><br />
Faulting application name: apnmcp.exe, version: 21.12.1.2516, time stamp: 0x55357be9<br />
Faulting module name: ntdll.dll, version: 6.3.9600.18007, time stamp: 0x55c4bc8e<br />
Exception code: 0xc0000005<br />
Fault offset: 0x00014dea<br />
Faulting process id: 0x700<br />
Faulting application start time: 0x01d12f45f1b45df6<br />
Faulting application path: C:\Program Files (x86)\AskPartnerNetwork\Toolbar\apnmcp.exe<br />
Faulting module path: C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\ntdll.dll<br />
Report Id: 4913385d-9b39-11e5-bf22-240a64f5ad36<br />
Faulting package full name:&nbsp;<br />
Faulting package-relative application ID:&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>But it isn't reported as an error or a problem report in the Action Centre and when I check for solutions nothing comes up and everything else is reported as working correctly and no action is needed. &nbsp;I also have done a virus scan, troubleshoot scan and
 Windows (C:) error scan and they all came back with nothing. &nbsp;As I say once it's finally loaded it runs fine and there are no error messages on screen, but it does take a long time to boot up and has continually loading icon for some time which I can't understand
 or why the reliability history reports an unexpected shutdown....</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing issues with your Windows 8.1 system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try the following methods and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to try to boot the computer in safe mode and check, Please refer to the below Microsoft article and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or
 an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may
 temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the
 computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a
<strong>SFC Scan</strong> and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to the following link given below.<br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

<h2>            social ban</h2>
                    <p>So over party chat I was literally call a <strong>[Mod Removed - Profanity]</strong> which really hits home for me as well as Manny other horrible things. in repliance I said shut up<strong> [Mod Removed - Profanity]</strong> once and thats all I said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know I swore over message in reliance to his voice chat which was stupid but how can it possibly be justified that this guy can rattle of racial slurs at me for ages and then I say one thing in repliance and get a social ban.
</p>
<p>all im asking is that I get un banned or at the very least he does get banned.</p>
<p>Thanks.<br />

<p>If you are offended or harassed by another person, report them, and then immediately mute and block them, so they can't talk to you anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then have the enforcement team handle the rest. As you see for yourself, the Enforcement Team works, and will act on your report if you really reported a Code of Conduct violation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still think that your suspension is unjustified, you can try to file a Case Review on https://enforcement.xbox.com/</p>
<p>
</p><p>But be aware, that you can only case review a suspension that is actually LONGER than 24 hours, as the investigation necessary to check your Case Review can take two working days, in which your account stays suspended. So you'd actually make the suspension
 longer if you had the chance to case review 24 hour bans.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Error 10010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aka_celador  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 10010</h2>
                    <p>I realise it's probably pointless but im wondering if anyone found the solution to error 10010 "this server did not register with dcom within the required timeout"?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically i've got this error with "Desktop Undo Manager" which has appid 3EEF301F-B596-4C0B-BD92-013BEAFCE793 and "Sync Integration Manager" with appid 9AA46009-3CE0-458A-A<span><span>354-715610</span></span>A075E6 even on a clean
 installation with no other apps installed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read that the common solution is just to ignore those issues since they do not mean anything to users and probably can't be corrected anyway unless they are related to a specific software but in this case they are related to Windows itself.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found out that a lot of people seem to have them but no one knows how to fix them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously /sfc scannow doesn't do anything and as i said the error appears even after a fresh installation of windows 10 on a separate formatter hard drive.&nbsp; It's also the only error to which i never found the solution over the years and it's the only error
 in windows events. I don't have any BSOD's or other issues and im only asking out of curiosity.

            <p>It's Windows 10 Professional. It's not connected to a domain and it's obvious that you don't know the answer the either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if i knew which application is causing that issue to appear - i would not have asked here. A simple search on these community forums and on the internet shows that quite a few people got that issue and have been asking about it for years.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's save to assume that it's a low level windows error that appears on some configurations. It does not appear to cause any harm or issues besides appearing in the event viewer and the event viewer doesn't mention anything besides the lines:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This server {3EEF301F-B596-4C0B-BD92-013BEAFCE793} did not register with DCOM within the required timeout.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>and</p>
<p>
</p><p>This server &nbsp;{9AA46009-3CE0-458A-A354-715610A075E6} did not register with DCOM within the required timeout.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise i would've probably solved it already. It is also not a permissions issue since they are all set properly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you know anyone who might want to figure out this "mystery of the century" in your company - please ask them and if you just want to put me through the motions - just let this thread die on it's own. It's not that big of a deal.</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish a MS guru to solve this out.. PLEASE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got dozen of entries, immediately after boot, like this one, <strong>Event 10001
</strong>DistributedCOM:</p>
<p>The Event number above is confirmed: not a typo. It's Event 10001.</p>
<p>Goes like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Unable to start a DCOM Server: {9AA46009-3CE0-458A-A354-715610A075E6} as Unavailable/Unavailable. The error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>on a Win10 Home, all patched and everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Already reading the error I wonder why in 2017, there is no link for things like
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc774391(v=ws.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Event 10001 </a>or <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/e55c9834-9fc6-4c2b-bea6-479208337aff/failed-to-execute-target-process-error-740?forum=itprovistasp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Error 740</a> or {9aa46009-3ce0-458a-a354-715610a075e6} : those are standard things, might be linked to MS site for easier search, no ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being a MCSE, I am going crazy to find a reason for that, given that in DCOM mmc console, this DCOM element (which does exist there) has absolutely no details (columns are blank, no detail or propriety whatsoever).</p>
<p>This might be cause by the fact that it didn't start, but I have doubts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't find any decent documentation on the Internet.. Just this site has something similar, but it's NOT it:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Why to have an <em>error message </em>if no one knows what that means ?</p>
<p>Appreciating any help on this one ! Thanks !!</p>

<h2>            USB 3.0 mysteriously disabled</h2>
                    <p>When trying to use a thumb drive on one of my USB 3.0 ports for backup, the backup fails and the port is reported as failed.&nbsp; Upon re-boot, the port is once again operational.&nbsp; For&nbsp; work around, I use a USB 2.0 port - no problem.&nbsp; I am currently using the

<ol>
<li>Plug your thumb drive into USB 3.0</li><li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>Device Manager</strong> then hit <strong>

OK</strong> to complete the uninstall process.</li><li>Unplug the device and restart your computer.</li><li>Plug in the thumb drive again. The device should automatically be detected and reinstalled after the system restart.

<li>If ever there's no prompt, you can go back to <strong>Device Manager</strong> and click

<h2>            Format a CD in Vista&#63;</h2>
                    &nbsp;How do I format a CD in CDFS format in Vista?<br />
Selecting Mastered under formating options still does a UDF format.

<p>DonnRoberts,</p>
<p>Vista natively supports LFS and UDF formats for Data burning. XrayJames is correct you will require a 3 party burning utility to format in CDFS (ISO9660).</p>

<p>A search in your favorite engine will result in recommended software that are capable of handling that format.</p>

                    My computer contracted the microsoft virus and I had to reformat my entire computer in order to fix the problem.&nbsp; When I did this I lost my previously purchased microsoft office 2007 program.&nbsp; Is there any warranty on this program or is there anything
 that I can do to get it back?<br />

<p><span>How did you get your copy? Did you buy it in store or online or via online download. I am guessing you don’t have the media anymore. You can contact Microsoft through the link
 below or via the phone. Just keep in mind you will need to provide some for form of proof of purchase even if you have warranty on this product.</span></p>

</span></span></span><span>,</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>If you want to share one Internet connection among several computers, you have two options:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Use Internet Connection Sharing (ICS).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Use a router.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>First let’s try enabling ICS. Also try disabling the security software and check.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Enabling ICS</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To enable ICS, on your host computer:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Network Connections by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button </span><span>, and then clicking
<strong>Control Panel</strong>. In the search box, type <strong>adapter</strong>, and then, under Network and Sharing Center, click
<strong>View network connections</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Right-click the connection that you want to share, and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>. </span><span>&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Sharing</strong> tab, and then select the <strong>Allow other network users to connect through this computer’s Internet connection</strong> check box.</span></span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span><span>Notes</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>The Sharing tab won't be available if you have only one network connection.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>You can choose whether to select the
<strong>Allow other network users to control or disable the shared Internet connection</strong> check box.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Optionally, to allow other network users to use services running on your network, click
<strong>Settings</strong>, and then select the services you want to allow.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To use ICS, make sure the local area network (LAN) connection on each network computer is configured to
 get an IP address automatically. To do this:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Open Network Connections by clicking the
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span> button
</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>, and then clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span></span><span><span>. In the search box, type
</span></span><span><span><strong>adapter</strong></span></span><span><span>, and then, under Network and Sharing Center, click
</span></span><span><span><strong>View network connections</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span>Right-click the LAN connection, and then click
<span><strong>Properties</strong></span>. </span><span><span><span>&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<span><strong>Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)</strong></span> or <span><strong>Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)</strong></span>, and then click
<span><strong>Properties</strong></span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<span><strong>Obtain an IP address automatically</strong></span> or <span><strong>Obtain an IPv6 address automatically</strong></span>, and then click
<span><strong>OK</strong></span>.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t access Internet</h2>

In the last days I've been having problems connecting to my home internet network.&nbsp;<br />
I've contacted the internet provider, which reset the routter and now it works fine for everyone. except me.&nbsp;<br />
I can connect to the internet through other computers or my smartphone, I can connect to the network and it's shows as if it was well connected, but no internet.<br />
Furthermore, I can connect and access the internet in any other network.<br />
<br />
Synthesizing:<br />
- Router and Modem is OK<br />
- Other devices access the internet just fine<br />
- Computer connects to network with no apparent problems, but can't access it<br />
- Computer connects and access any other network/Internet<br />

<h3> man chow  say:</h3>
<h2>            touch mouse kvm support</h2>
                    i have the touch mouse which is working fine on my win8 machine. i recently installed a kvm so i can switch between my win7 and win8 machines, but with the mini usb receiver plugged into the kvm, on both win7 and win8 the mouse pointer would only move
 left and right, but not up nor down. i assume something about the the mouse that is not supported by the kvm. what do i need to look for to find a kvm that supports the touch mouse?

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft community!
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>We are here to help you in fixing the issue and guide you in the right direction.<br />
<br />
</span>You may check if the mouse works fine when the switch is not connected&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
You may shutdown everything, including all connected computers and restart the KVM
<br />
switch. Then, start up all&nbsp;the PCs.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
You may check if&nbsp;the switch is compatible with Windows 7 and Windows 8.
<br />
Windows 7 :<br />

<br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong><br />

<span>What if a device isn't installed properly?<br />
</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly</span></a><br />
<span><strong>BIOS DISCLAIMER:</strong></span><span>
<br />
Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings
 can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 4:</strong></span></span>&nbsp;<span> <br />
</span></span><span>If it does not work, then test the issue in Clean boot.<br />

            Currently, only DDM class KVM switches can fully work with Windows 8 devices (such as Touch mouse of Logitech T620 and TouchPad of Logitech T650).&nbsp;&nbsp; You can check "class of KVM switch" under wikipedia link to understand why USB DDM class KVM switch works.
<br />
<br />
Attached is the video link show test of Logitch TouchPad and Touchscreen monitor with DDM KVM switch.

<h2>            xbox live charging a card that doesn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t have money on it</h2>
                    
<p>Around 6 months ago I used a visa gift card to pay for my 6 month xbox live gold subscription, I had thought that the card would only be charged that one time, but when I recently checked my xbox live status it was showing that I was a gold member, I was
 confused by this (because I though the gold should have run out by now) so I checked the xbox billing page, which had shown that the card that I had used 6 months ago had been billed again for a fee of $9.99, the problem is, I don't know why the card was charged
 and the gift card that was billed didn't have any money left on it. I don't know what do do about this problem and I'm currently worried that my account may get suspended for a mistake that I had no intention of making. Thank you in advance for any help I
 may get.</p>
