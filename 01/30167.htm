<h2>            Halo game used to work in Windows 7, after installing Windows 10 it does not work.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Halo Combat Evolved for pc</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought this game from Microsoft a couple of years ago. It worked ok on win 7 ultimate. So I installed it on win 10 and it won't let me play the game. It did quit working on win 7,and message came up that I need to install win 10 to play. Well I&nbsp;it installed,
 but will not start so I can play. Is there some patches that I need to get or do I have to get a new set of numbers from Microsoft to playReally love the game..Or do I have to wait for the November download ???</p>

                    <p>I have the weirdest issue. Started a few days ago.&nbsp; Whenever I visit any website in Edge, the moment I start scrolling down, the scroll bar freezes, and I literally can't scroll at all - not with the mouse or with the scroll bar.&nbsp; I have to close the tab

                    I am trying to install my Carmen Sandiego game onto my Vista computer.&nbsp; This disk worked fine on my XP computer.&nbsp; Sadly, my XP died and now I find myself a Vista user.&nbsp; I inserted the disk, started the install, and then suddenly, the install stopped dead
 and the message "This product does not support Windows NT" popped onto my screen.&nbsp; What I want to know is what does that message mean, and how do I get around it to install my perfectly good and entertaining game onto my computer?

    <title>windows 10 start menu still not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            windows 10 start menu still not working</h2>
                    <p>I run my own computer repair business. Tonight I am updating 5 systems to windows 10 for my clients. So far on 4 of the machines, ( all different makes and models), the start menu has failed and I have been forced to use 3rd party software to repair the
 problem because the fixes that I have read about don't work. ( powershell, SFC / scan - admin command mode... etc etc etc.) This isn't the trial version. This is downloaded right from the site.
</p>
<p>I am going to use this third party software because I can't believe that such a simple thing like the start menu not working still exists in the build Microsoft is releasing. When I click the start menu nothing happerns. I need to get to roll back the system
 to uninstall the update but can't do that because the start button doesn't work and I am not sure how to get there any other way.</p>
<p>I would suggest to whoever responds to this that a workaround that works would be appreciated and is described in simplistic terms so I can forward that to over 2000 of my clients who will be doing this upgrade at some point.
</p>
<p>For now, I think it is safe to just tell everyone to stay on Windows 7 and if your running windows 8 or 8.1 your out of luck unless you don't mind fixing your own operating system.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>This is my point of view and observation.</p>
<p>I also repair and build custom made computers (strictly desktops) for other peoples.</p>
<p>I don't have 2000"Clients", I am quite content with a few hundreds.</p>
<p>I am also running Windows 8.1 professional, and I can assure you "I am not out of luck", on the contrary I am "very lucky" to have windows 8.1 Professional as my most preferred Windows system.</p>
<p>And if I may add, it is way "Superior" to&nbsp;Windows 7 SP1" that is installed in one of my own "Build" Computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Putting this aside, lets address your issue/problem.</p>
<p>Some what interesting in some ways !!.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not clairvoyant, and whished you would have told us from what system version&nbsp;are you upgrading from,&nbsp;to Windows 10.</p>
<p>I hope you have made a "Backup and Restore" and a System recovery disk&nbsp;if you have upgraded from Windows 7.</p>
<p>Using that recovery disk while rebooting should solve your problem.</p>
<p>If not, you can open your "Control Panel" and access the "Backup and Recovery".</p>
<p>If that does work OR does not work out,&nbsp;you can always try this (The URL below)&nbsp;to upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>As far as I am concern, this below here is the best URL to go to, and the best method to upgrade to Windows 10. It' a long process but it is worth the time it takes.</p>

            <p>well</p>
<p>that is the link to the version of Windows 10 I am talking about.</p>
<p>Windows 8 was the worst mistake Microsoft ever made and they released 10 for free because next to Vista this was basically a useless and unfriendly user interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>here it is in their own words...</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.businessinsider.com/nadella-admits-windows-8-was-wrong-2014-10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded 2 machines from Windows 8.1 and one from Windows 7 not that that should matter as a new operating system is a new operating system and if something doesn't work in THE new operating system and you know about it( Their insiders Windows 10 had a
 busted start menu as well) </p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_desktop/start-menu-not-working-after-update-to-insider/838f2896-1bf6-4f45-8cf2-a3c764017a3a</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>then they might want to fix that BEFORE you release and update 50 million machines..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just saying....</p>
<p>Recovery disk while rebooting doesn't fix the BROKEN start button.</p>
<p>back up and recovery reinstalls the SAME operating system that has the problem ( if you want Windows 10- or your back to where you started from windows 8.1 which doesnt work and has a horrible interface.
</p>
<p>A real waste of my time doing this.</p>
<p>I was promoting it to my clients as an answer to windows 8 as I was using the insiders version and liked it.
</p>
<p>Then they updated it and the start button stopped working and they never properly fixed it. It is not a co-incidence that this happened to 4 of the 5 machines I am working on.
</p>
<p>The 5th one the start button works.</p>
<p>all were done at the same time using that link you sent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, like Vista, we will wait until they fix it and rename it Windows 11 and pay for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks anyway for your input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>L</p>

<p>
</p><p>Widows 8 was definitively bad news (Bad System).</p>
<p>That's why Microsoft released a free upgrade, called&nbsp;"Windows 8.1", thru the Windows Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to ask you a question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do you think Microsoft&nbsp;has given free Windows 10 upgrades, to consumers who are running Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 8.1 (all versions for both systems),but no free upgrade to consumers who are running Windows 8 (all versions)?.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I am just searching for an easy fix to the start button problem. </p>
<p>I feel bad for the consumers who aren't supported but realize that business is business and they aren't really GIVING away anything. Once they have everyone on their platform I expect there will be apps and things that cost money. They have a strategy behind
 every single thing they do and I am disappointed that that strategy didn't include a START BUTTON THAT WORKED. The single most used and integral part of every operating system since windows 95.
</p>
<p>Anyway, </p>
<p>I realize you were trying to help and we are off topic. </p>
<p>I was hoping for a elevated command prompt or something I could copy into powershell to reset the start button.</p>
<p>Thanks anyway</p>

            <p>Well on Topic, off Topic..........</p>
<p>I hope this is not off topic :</p>
<p>I may be misinformed , but it seems to me you are the only one in the history of this free Windows 10 upgrade, up to today, that has a start menu that doesn't do anything when you click on it.</p>
<p>Before I go, on your keyboard, bottom row of keys, second key on the left side with the Microsoft logo on it, have you&nbsp;tried it?.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

            <p>Lee,</p>
<p>I can assure you that the vast majority of&nbsp;Windows 10 users are unaffected by this "dead start menu" issue you say has affected all five of your upgraded systems. I speculate that it must be some third-party software (antivirus or a specialized device driver,
 perhaps?) you were installing when you did the upgrades. If that's not the case, then perhaps your installer image is corrupt. At this point, it would be useful to know the hardware/model #&nbsp;details of those five systems, and exactly what third-party software
 and/or device drivers, if any,&nbsp;you are installing. </p>

 One all I'm asking Microsoft is to add Backwards Compatibility.</span></p>

<p>GTA 5 comes out September 17 2013 and Splinter Cell Blacklist is coming out August 2013 so how is Splinter Cell &nbsp;going to be on the next gen and a title like GTA 5 wont be what your saying makes no sense at all.I'm very sure Rockstar will end up making GTA
 5 also for the Xbox One it's not going to have 3-4 month lifespan.</p>

<p>GTA V will almost certainly get a PC port, and since the Xbox One and the PS4 contain the same CPU architecture as a PC (X86) then it stands to reason that there should be an Xbox One and PS4 version eventually.&nbsp; Rockstar would be pretty silly not to.</p>

<h2>            Chrome and windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am experiencing some problems with chrome on windows 10. I am used to chrome and mostly used Chrome as my primary browser. But occasionally I have noticed when I am working on chrome sometimes ( not always ) chrome hangs and stops responding. If I try
 opening another chrome window it does not open although task manager shows the chrome is open.</p>
<p>When this happens my file explorer also stops working. If I try to restart&nbsp;my computer it takes ages to shut down.</p>
<p>So far I have observed it only happens when I am working on CHROME. Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling but the problem persists.
</p>
<p>So far I have seen on Microsoft community that people are having problems with chrome compatibility. Am I correct???
</p>
<p>Will really appreciate If someone can give me insight of what is the issue here and is my observation correct</p>

<p>I am not an expert in computers, you are an expert and you may be knowing much more than me. But whats the point of making another user account. Why to make things complicated when I already have an account. I was perfectly fine with my Microsoft account
 in windows 08. </p>
<p>The thing is that the HANG occurs occasionally, but its quite annoying. I have been reading the reviews and MSN community discussions. People are having some little problems with windows 10. Maybe as its in the initial stages of launch.
</p>
<p>I hope microsoft must be getting some feedback and must be working on some sort of corrective updates to resolve these minor but important issues in future.</p>

    <title>Windows Media Player - Unable to enable media streaming or &#34;play - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamestausch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player - Unable to enable media streaming or &#34;play to&#34; ability</h2>
                    <p>I have lost the ability to enable media streaming and the "play to" function on&nbsp;my Windows Media Player (Windows 7 system about 13 months old). I had and enjoyed this feature for about three weeks; using it to send music to a Sony SANS 400 speaker in another
 room.</p>
<p>Now, efforts to use the Play To function take me to the control panel where I am given a false choice to "enable media streaming." I say "false choice" because the ability to enable media streaming does not exist no matter what one does. The OK box on that
 screen is also dead. Nothing I do will restore my ability to use the play to or media streaming ability.</p>
<p>What I have tried so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the Windows Media Player troubleshooter and following all recommendations.</li><li>I tried the "turning Windows features on and off" suggestion from a previous inquiry a few months ago. When I re-start the computer the message "Unable to complete changes. Returning to previous status" (or something like that) appears and things remain
 unchanged re the WMP status and functions.</li><li>The inability to affect WMP via the "turn Windows features on and off"&nbsp;is a notable change from what I could do previously.</li><li>I have run the System File Checker. It found no problems or damaged files.</li></ul>
<p>The McAfee Virus Removal team recently removed a virus that had gotten past their program. They have reviewed their actions and assetrtively state that nothing they did would have effected my Windows Media Player's functions. They state there is nothing
 they can do about my Windows Media Player problems, and, that I need to contact Microsoft for assistance with my Windows Media Player problems. They also state my computer is currently 100% virus free.</p>
<p><u>Can anything be done to get back my "play to" function</u>? Also,&nbsp;I am my computer's administrator and it seems strange that I cannot make Control Panel changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Jim Tausch,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message or error code?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> You may refer the following articles and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Stream your media to devices and computers using Windows Media Player</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Stream-your-media-to-devices-and-computers-using-Windows-Media-Player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Stream-your-media-to-devices-and-computers-using-Windows-Media-Player</a></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b>Change settings for streaming media in Windows Media Player</b></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> You may also try to
<b>temporarily</b> disable Anti Virus and check if you can get the option to “play to”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Disable antivirus software</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a></b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Make sure you enable the antivirus software and other security programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Warning:</b> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus
 software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply. All suggestions were tried or have already been done. My problem remains unchanged and unsolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>Media streaming/Play To was working fine for almost a month</strong></u>. My device/remote speaker remains visible&nbsp;as a&nbsp;Play To menu choice. However, when one tries to send music to this choice - or when choosing the Stream menu choice More Streaming
 Options, I am taken to the Control Panel page Media Streaming Options/Turn On Media Streaming command - nothing happens. Both the Turn On command and the OK box are dead/they do not enable or turn on anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Temporarily disabling anti-virus and firewall by going directly to the Security Center, and then trying everything again, also produces no changes in the problem. When I follow the steps in method 2 to try to temorarily disable antivirus software, the Action
 Center page notes that "The Windows Security Center Service is turned off." Trying to turn this on produces the only error message seen in this whole process, "The Windows Security Center service can't be started."</p>
<p>Since my system is still under warranty, if we can't get back the Play To/media streaming functions I enjoyed for 4 of the past 5 weeks, can a new Windows Media Player be sent or downloaded?</p>
<p>Thank you, </p>

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>If you have another user account on the computer, check to see if the options to 'stream' and 'play to' are available. You may follow the steps in this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">document
</a>to create a new user account for testing if needed.</p>
<p>You may also follow the steps in this thread to turn off and turn on Media Player. This should reset Media Player to it's default settings. Follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <strong>Start orb</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Control Panel</strong></li><li>Select<strong> Programs</strong> <strong>and Features</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong></li><li>Expand <strong>Media features</strong></li><li>Deselect <strong>Windows Media Player</strong> (Click Yes on the warning box about resetting defaults)</li><li>Restart your computer</li><li>Repeat steps 1-7, this time selecting <strong>Windows Media Player</strong>. You will be required to restart the computer once the change is made.</li></ol>

            <p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>Regarding suggestion 1, trying while logged in as another user, produced a new screen that said if I enter my administrator password I would be able to proceed. Unfortunately, after entering my password I was right back at the screen that seems to be a key
 part of the problem - either the Control Panel screen that asks if I want to "enable media streaming" or the one that asks me to "choose media streaming options." Both pages are dead - inactive - with the OK box grayed out/inactive. Same as when I try when
 logged in as administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding suggestion 2, I&nbsp;just finished trying this. As I noted in my original post (second bullet point) I have previously attempted this step several times with each time being unsuccessful and producing the message (during the re-start startup) "Unable
 to make changes. Reverting back to previous status." Hoping it might be different this time, I tried your suggestion again&nbsp;this morning. Same result - no difference - the computer provides a message during start up that it is unable to make the changes and
 is reverting to the previous settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make this situation even more disappointing, we *were* able to enjoy the Play To feature for about a month before this problem started. What can be done?</p>

            Had same prob and spent hours trolling forums and trying the same fixes.<br />
i know this is an old post, but for anyone like me looking for an answer, the fix was in services.
<br />
the "UPnP device host" was disabled and the "SSDP discovery" was disabled switch both of those to automatic and streaming button works again.<br />
Make sure to turn on "SSDP discovery" first or "UPnP device host" wont stay on. <br />
Hope this saves someone the time i wasted. fixed in less than a minute. <br />

            <p>Hey! Thanks for the info. I'll keep it in mind if the problem comes back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After they were unable to help me, Dell Support referred me to Spyware Info Forum, or, spywareinfoforum.com&nbsp; WHAT AN EXCELLENT RESOURCE!!! After some moderately complex steps, that they walked me through over the course of a few days, the WMP Play To feature
 once again worked perfectly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ultimately, they found that a good part of the problem was due to "hosed file associations" after the MacAfee virus removal folks *helped* fix a separate problem. The folks at Spyware Info Forum are skilled professionals who want to keep their chops sharp
 and they provide first class comprehensive help in cases where nothing else seems to work. I can't say enough positive things about this resource.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a person goes there for help, you need to agree to follow step by step each detail of their advice. Then, when the problem is resolved, make a donation to them via PayPal if you have any class at all.</p>

<h2>            Gammla Gamertags som bara ligger och skrotar</h2>
                    
<p>Det finns en väldans massa gamertags som folk reggat men aldrig börjat användas, borde inte såna deletas efter tag ? För det är ju säkert många som vill ha dom gamertags som är tagna med reggade och bara skrotar, &nbsp;ett bra exempel är ju KarateKurt som jag
 använder för ett antal år sen, och så bytte jag gemertag, men ångrade mig efter några månader, men när jag skulle byta tillbaks till KarateKurt då hade en dansk tagit namnet, och den dansken har bara lirat ytterst litet på 2 spel, han har 15 i gamerscore,
 och hans konto har varit inaktivt i flera år och occuperar det namn jag vill ha, sånt är minst sagt frustrerande.'</p>

<p>De har sagt att de håller på och rensar men tar tid. Har själv varit ute efter MiXiE i 5 år. Han har också bara spelat en gång och har inte varit online på flera år. Fattar inte heller var problemet ligger. Kan de inte bara sortera t.ex "Profil inte aktiv
 sedan 2005, max gamerscore 50" och rensa.?</p>

<p>Har också läst om att MS håller på och rensar, men jag tycker iaf att konton som blivit reggade men aldrig använts borde deletas automatiskt efter typ 2 år max. &nbsp;Tycker ju att det även för MS borde vara skönt att storstäda bort alla skräpkonton som tar onödig
 plats. </p>
<p>Jag har försökt att få tag på den här dansken som har min gamertag, eftersom hans konto varit inaktivt sålänge så hade jag gärna kunnat tänka mig att betala honom för ett namnbyte om han nu har kvar sin xbox i nåt skåp nånstans, eller rentuav kanske få,
 eller köpa hans konto så att jag på såsätt kan byta hans gamertag och få tillbaks mitt namn som jag jäkligt gärna vill ha tillbaks.</p>

<p>Jag kan säga att du inte behöver oroa dig Luke117 ;) Det här handlar om konton som inte har varit aktiva på väldigt länge eller inte har några spel i sin senast spelade lista (jag har inte EXAKT koll på hur det görs men det är detta jag har kommit fram till
 på egen hand)</p>

<p>Jag tror inte MS deletar konton där någon köpt något spel på xbla eller games on demand,
</p>
<p>Det är nog bara konton som varit inaktiva i många år som har låg gamerscore som ryker,
</p>
<p>man tycker att det skulle funnits en delete mitt konto funktion, fast med bra säkerhet då såklart,</p>
<p>typ man väljer att deleta kontot i 360n, men måste bekräfta deletningen i sin mail som är bundet till kontot.</p>

<p>Jo så är det nog, &nbsp;I en annan tråd här i forumet skrev jag just det om underligheten i att MS tar bort spel från typ xbla, &nbsp;1 xboxklassiker &nbsp;spel som jag köpt är numera bortaget från onlineshopen, &nbsp;Destroy all humans, och xbla spelet marble blast ultra är
 också borttaget, det hade vart kul att få tag på nån ansvarig på MS och få reda på vad dom håller på med egentligen.</p>

<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />The ability to drive the resolution of that TV might be dependent on the video card in the laptop. It might not be powerful to go beyond 1920 x 1080.

            Hi Tyler.  I"m Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />1) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) Adjust the screen resolution until it fits and looks best at Settings &gt; System &gt; Display.
<br />
<br />3) Expedite all WIndows Updates to see if it pushed a TV/monitor driver which will assist.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Skype freezing, have to do a task manager to shut it off.</h2>
                    <p>Hi.<br />
<br />
Ok, the last few months my skype been freezing up and 'dinging' when I try to use it, like its 'unresponsive'.</p>
<p>I can't close it out on its own.&nbsp; I have to use task manager to close it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have uninstalled and reinstalled Skype for Windows several times and it still happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea?<br />
</p>
<p>I have a Dell Windows 10 laptop.&nbsp; I have used the Preinstalled Skype specifically for Windows 10 and didn't like too much.&nbsp; Takes forever to load.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Hi and thanks for responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype Version: 7.40.0.103<br />
OS Version:&nbsp; 10.0.15063 Build 15063<br />
<br />
I'm using Wi-Fi at my home which I think is DSL (Suddenlink)<br />
<br />
I am not getting any error messages.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It freezes up and 'dings'.&nbsp; I go to task manager and close it out.&nbsp; That doesn't log it out however which is fine. &nbsp; I can re-open it after a restart and it seems ok.&nbsp; So far no problems yet.&nbsp;</p>

2.&nbsp;&nbsp; On your keyboard, press the Windows key + R key. Then, the Run windows will appear.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Run window, type in <strong>%appdata%\Skype</strong> and hit Enter. <br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Look for a file named shared or <strong>shared.xml</strong> and delete it.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the folder that has your Skype Name.<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Locate for a file config or <strong>config.xml</strong> and delete it.<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Control Panel and look for Internet Options.<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the Advanced Tab and select Reset.<br />
9.&nbsp;&nbsp; Put a check mark under “Delete Personal Settings”, hit OK and then Enter.<br />
10.&nbsp;Close it when prompted.</span></span><span> </span></p>
<p><span><span>11.&nbsp;Restart Skype. </span></span></p>

</p><p>Please also let us know if you are seeing error messages (screen shots would be great if you can grab them). If you can upload screen shots here, please remember to use PC Paint or another tool to hide personal details, account and real names, and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another clue that would be helpful: do you have any credit or subscriptions on your account, or do you use only free Skype-to-Skype calling?</p>

<p>hello again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well since I did the fall update for win 10 (which my laptop doesn't like)<br />
</p>
<p>The skype 'dinging' is back.&nbsp; Its frozen up again.&nbsp; Wont even read 'unresponsive."</p>
<p>I finally took a screenshot and censored out anything that my friends said would get me in trouble or personal details.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ca2db0d-d828-4330-9858-f4ac9631c273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ca2db0d-d828-4330-9858-f4ac9631c273" /></a></p>
<p>See that it looks like a normal skype screen, EXCEPT the very top of the screen where its sorta greyed out.&nbsp; When its greyed out like that, it has become unresponsive and dings when you try to do anything to it, including move it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have redone all of the prior methods to get this fixed and I'm still coming up with a glitched Skype!&nbsp; And a buggy Win 10 fall update.&nbsp; T_T</p>
<p>All I'm asking for from ya'll is help with Skype.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have <a href="http://https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/browserbroken-after-fall-creators-win-10-update/eded537f-d881-48a2-a2e6-5d0226fd50e8?messageId=03ece85f-415d-4bab-9e0d-f6afc20a51a8&amp;auth=1&amp;rtAction=1510578626879" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            orange e-mail via microsoft edge</h2>
                    <p>I use orange e-mail, windows 10.</p>
<p>All has been good until this morning. I used my usual routine - desktop to Microsoft edge then I "or" in the search bar and click on the orange e-mail item. This takes me to the orange website and, up till now, clicking the website takes me to my e-mails.
 Now, when I come to the orange website there is text stating, "your session has expired. please log in again." I do the logging in but it&nbsp; does not take me to the e-mails. I spent over an hour with the orange 'phone help and about the same with a Microsoft
 advisor.</p>
<p>What has happened and how can I get back to normal?</p>

<h2>            Segoe UI Semibold font bug&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I came across the following irregularity in the Segoe UI Semibold font:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47f5bd21-84e7-420e-ae6a-53250a7e84b7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47f5bd21-84e7-420e-ae6a-53250a7e84b7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Only in 11pt the dots in i and j are not at the same height. Has this been fixed? Is there a newer version of the font?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            My computer detects my bluetooth headset but i cant play music through it</h2>
                    <p>I have a FUJITSU AH531. I got a bluetooth speaker off amazon, the sw50. my computer detects it and installs it but never asked me for a pairing code or anything. then i go into bluetooth devices it shows there. i right click and press bluetooth operations.
 it does a scan and says i can use it to listen to music and to press the link to begin. the problem is that the liten to music link is in light grey and you cant click on it? the speaker doesnt show in&nbsp;playback devices either. I have tried installing drivers
 off the internet with no joy. </p>
<p>any help much appreciated</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>cheers</p>

            <p><b><span>Hi HarryHansell,</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1) What <b>exactly happens</b> when you try to <b>play music</b> from the
<b>Bluetooth</b>?<br />
2) Who is the <b>manufacturer</b> of the <b>Bluetooth</b> <b>device</b>?<br />
3) Do you get <b>any error message or error code</b>?<br />
4) Have you made <b>any changes</b> on your computer recently?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
The <b>Bluetooth</b> that you are using creates an <b>audio bridge</b> between the computer and the
<b>Bluetooth</b>. You need to go to the <b>audio properties</b> and choose the <b>
Bluetooth Bridge</b> for your <b>primary audio output device</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><br />
<b>Method 1-</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to perform <b>Clean</b> <b>Boot.</b><br />
Putting your system in <b>Clean Boot</b> state helps in identifying if any <b>third party applications or startup items
</b>are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a
<b>Clean</b> <b>Boot</b>-</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></b><span><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: You need to follow <b>Step 7</b> from the article mentioned above to get the computer back to
<b>Normal Startup</b> after you follow all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p><span>Now check if you are able to play music.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><br />
<b>Method 2-</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You need to <b>Uninstall the Bluetooth drivers.</b><br />
To do so, you need to follow the steps mentioned below –</span></p>
<p><span>a) Click on “<b>Start</b>” and <b>Right</b> <b>Click</b> on “<b>Computer</b>” and select “<b>Manage</b>”.<br />
b) Now select “<b>Device</b> <b>Manager</b>” and <b>Right</b> <b>Click</b> on the individual “<b>Bluetooth</b>
<b>Drivers</b>” and select “<b>Uninstall</b>”.<br />
c) Restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would have you download the latest drivers once again from the <b>Bluetooth</b>
<b>manufacturer’s</b> <b>website</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Additionally, you may refer the articles mentioned below for further assistance-</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your interest in using windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to assist you better I would like to ask few questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the printer?</li><li>Have you installed the printer drivers?</li></ol>
<p>I would like to suggest you to run the Printer Troubleshooter by following the below steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on start and type ‘troubleshooting’ and press enter.</li><li>Click on ‘View all’ on top left corner.</li><li>Select ‘Internet Connections’ in the list and follow the prompts for troubleshooting.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, can perform a clean boot:</p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install
 a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>* Place the computer in a Clean Boot and check if the issue is occurring due to any third party programs.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the link to view the steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></p>

</p><p>After I cleared the error 10016&nbsp;from happening, I was able to print once more.

 it just says searching and doesn't do anything.

I am having similar problem. At first I could not print anything. Then all of a sudden it started printing. The very next day it stopped printing again. When I give the print command, whether to PDF or to printer (HP as well as EPSON), it freezes up and a round
 ring keeps turning. If I click anywhere on the screen (IE or Firefox or MSWORD or any other), the whole screen goes pale, and the program crashes.

    <title>Windows 10 - Must enter password twice to log in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 15zepedj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Must enter password twice to log in</h2>
                    I have had a Dell with Windows 10 for the past year and a half, that, other than needing to send it to Dell a couple months ago to fix an issue, has run incredibly well. My issue is that occasionally (now its most of the time) when I sign in with my pin
 or password, it has me enter it again to actually sign in, so I have to essentially enter it twice. It only does this when I must sign in after turning on my laptop. I used to have facial recognition on, but it would only recognize my face and then take me
 to my screen saver where I would have to enter my pin or password. I removed facial recognition and my pin, because then I would at least know that every time I log in I would only use my password, but the same thing keeps happening, and somehow the option
 to use my pin came back up at the log screen. I'll be removing the pin option again soon. I know this is a minor issue compared to others, but it's just incredibly annoying. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! :)

            Hi, Microsoft say they are aware of this issue and are working on a patch
<br />
<br />For now the workaround confirmed by Microsoft is:
<br />
<br />Go to Settings - Accounts - Sign-in options
<br />In Privacy sections
<br />Turn off the setting to “Use my sign-in info to automatically finish settings up my device after an update or restart”

<h2>            Too Many Recovery Partitions</h2>
                    <p><br />
</p>
<p>Hello guys. I am Rosed Vinaviles from the Philippines. I seem&nbsp;to have to many Recovery Partitions in my hard disk. Is there a way to remove some of them to make space in my hard disk. Also after accidentally removing a recovery drive during creation of a
 recovery I now have a Drive E: which I don't want. I want to delete it and extend my Drive C: to include that. Here's a screen shot:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd3e04dd-5893-4ca6-9bc2-82999ed453c6" /></p>
<p>I want to delete the 2 Health(Recovery Partition) and&nbsp; Volume (E:) after OS (C:) and then extend it. . Anyway I have another 490 MB Healthy Recovery Partition (which I think was created by the computer manufacturer).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

            <p>hi dont work for microsoft . try this </p>
<p>
</p><p>open cmd with admin rights</p>
<ol>
<li>Run Diskpart application by typing Diskpart </li><li>In the “Diskpart” prompt, enter rescan command and press Enter key to re-scan all partitions, volumes and drives available.
</li><li>Then type in list disk and press Enter key to show all hard disk drive available.
</li><li>Select the disk that contains the partition you want to remove. Normally, with just 1 hard disk, it will be disk 0. So the command will be:<br />
select disk 0 </li><li>Finish by Enter key. </li><li>Type list partition and press Enter key to show all available and created partition in the disk selected.
</li><li>Select the partition that wanted to be deleted by using the following command, followed by Enter key:<br />
select partition x<br />
where x is the number recovery partition to be removed and unlocked its space. Be careful with the number of this partition, as wrong number may get data wipes off.
</li></ol>
<p>Finally, type in <strong>delete partition override</strong> and press Enter key.</p>

<p>&nbsp;We're running ESET 4.2.67. I'm the systems administrator and antivirus signatures are up to date. I'm as certain as ESET is that my system is clean. Plus there's no alerts poppig up that my system is infected advising me to give all my bank details to them
 to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Whether or not any update is canceled or non-essential, they all fail when installed separate or in any combination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. What anti-virus application or security suite is installed and is your subscription current?&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender)?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)? Listed Above. Windows 7 comes with Windows Defender integrated, I
 believe. ESET offers PUP protection. No Firewall. All machines are behind a Sonicwall Firewall.</p>
<p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application or a McAfee application ever been installed on the computer? McAfee - it was removed with McAfee's uninstall tool.</p>
<p>5. Did a Norton free-trial or a McAfee free-trial come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.) No free Trials.</p>

<p>Assuming your McAfee subscription had not already expired by the time you installed the ESET suite, please&nbsp;open a no-charge support incident per my previous reply.</p>
<p>Comment: When Win7 SP1 is released later this year (one assumes), KB976902 will be a Prerequisite Update for SP1. IOW, SP1 will not be offered via Windows Update nor will you be able to install it manually unless &amp; until KB976902 is installed.</p>
<p>PS: There may be more SP1 Prerequisite Updates.</p>

            Fun Update! I was able to update Service Pack 1 via the stand-alone network install, but still no individual updates. The only viable fix I have received on this issue is to wipe and re-install. One of these days I might have a day where I am un-busy enough
 that it could be an option.<br />
<br />
Long story short - there is no fix for this problem.<br />

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the details in your post, it seems that not only Windows but also your Windows apps are showing search results. This can be due to incorrect Windows service setting or the indexing services. To help us provide the appropriate solution to your concern,
 we would like to ask for additional details. Please answer the following:</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div>
<div>The service name is Windows Search but even if it has been disabled, you should still see the "Search Programs and Files" box.&nbsp; No harm in checking though.&nbsp; Hit the
<strong>Windows key</strong> plus<strong> r</strong> on your keyboard and type:
<p><strong>services.msc</strong></p>
<p>and <strong>click OK</strong>.&nbsp; Scroll down until you find it and make sure the startup type is set to Automatic (Delayed Start) and the Service Status is Started.&nbsp; If not, click in Start and OK your change.</p>
<p>If the service doesnt exist, go to Programs and Features in Control Panel and click on "Turn Windows Features on or off".&nbsp; Scroll down, and check Windows Search.&nbsp; Ok, your change and reboot.&nbsp; Does the Search box appear when you click on Start now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks&amp;Regards,</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Pro&#39;s Metro Apps can&#39;t connect to internet after first restart</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recently I installed Windows 8 Pro x64 OEM, and I noticed after some &nbsp;time that my Store, Weather, Stocks, News, ... can't connect to internet anymore. However, all other applications are working.</div>
<div>Even weirder, after installing all updates i noticed that i can browse with my IE on desktop, but not one started from metro?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Long story short, after several reinstalls ( refresh option) I noticed following behavior:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. During first boot after install, EVERYTHING WORKS PERFECTLY. I can browse store, look at weather, everything.</div>
<div>2. When i restart computer, and every other time after that, is STOPS WORKING.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Another thing i noticed was that sound card (SoundBlaster Audigy) didn't work on first boot, but after restart it worked, so I guess that something happened after the first restart?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This was clean install (OEM version), and Windows are activated, and I tried signing in with and without live account (no difference).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help me, since this is quite irritating :(</div>
                </div>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>I finally found the issue.</div>
<div>The invisibility of active network pushed me towards the answer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The <u>biggest mistake</u> I made was using the refresh windows option, because it was worthless for my troubleshooting.</div>
<div><br />
<div>By mistake I selected my connection to internet as public on first install, and during refreshing the system didn't ask me that again.</div>
<div>By <u><b>setting the connection to private</b></u>&nbsp;after clean install (<b>no refresh</b>, brute force reinstall) made everything work after reboot and completely solved the issue for me.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><b>Why did the network disappear after reboot</b>? This is something weird and it shouldn't happen !!!</div>
<div>The network troubleshooter found no problems, since connection to internet worked, but it also had no problem with no network showing up or metro apps not working.</div>
<div><u>This should be fixed</u>, since it would be of great help in this scenario.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>TL;DR : Make sure you set your connection to private, or windows goes crazy and your metro apps don't work (and i also noticed visual studio couldn't deploy projects in that scenario, but that is another story).</div>
