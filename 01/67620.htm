    <title>Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2000, and Outlook 2003 print incomplete - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2000, and Outlook 2003 print incomplete emails if IE8 is installed.</h2>
                    
<p>The right side of the first page of a printed email from Outlook Express 6, Outlook 2000, or Outlook 2003 gets truncated on a computer running<strong> Windows XP</strong> SP3 that has Internet Explorer 8 installed.&nbsp; Emails containing tables are specifically
 affected, but it may be other emails as well. This issue is easily reproducible on any XP machine running IE8 and any version of outlook before 2007. It seems that Microsoft stopped using the IE print engine starting from Outlook 2007. Any of these same machines
 that will have this issue, if you uninstall IE8 and revert to IE7, the problem goes away.</p>
<p>I have been looking all over the web trying to resolve this problem. It seems that there are a few workarounds, but no fix for this problem for XP users. A hotfix was published by microsoft for this EXACT issue for Windows Vista and Windows 7 users. This
 hotfix will not install on an XP system. The link to the hotfix is here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/980333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/980333</a></p>
<p>There is another thread about this issue in the windows 7 forum:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/InternetExplorer/thread/8c629797-db1c-470c-92af-015e4ea03110" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/InternetExplorer/thread/8c629797-db1c-470c-92af-015e4ea03110</a></p>
<p>The issue in that thread was resolved with the hotfix I mentioned above, but when XP users joined in, it was recommended that someone start a new thread regarding this issue in XP. I have now done that and am awaiting a reply from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Possible temporary workarounds (for those of you having this issue):</p>
<p>1 - Revert back to IE7 (Not an acceptable solution in the corporate environment I am in).</p>
<p>2 - After opening the email, go to file and save it as an html file. Open the html file in ie8 or your favorite browser and print from there.</p>
<p>3 - Upgrade to Office 2007 or 2010 (If I wanted to spend money on a new product, I would do so. However, I refuse to do this simply because an older version I have bought stops working.</p>

            Success!<br />
<br />
So this is a summary of what I did:<br />
<br />
1. Started with an up-to-date XP SP3 installation with IE8 installed. At this point I have the right margin bug in OE6.<br />
2. Uninstalled the most recent Cumulative Security Update for IE8, which as of this writing is KB2559049. Rebooted.<br />
3. (You may need to perform this step in Safe-Mode) Renamed ieframe.dll in C:\Windows\System32 to ieframe.old. Manually copied ieframe.dll LDR version from the
 Rebooted.<br />
4. Verified that the right margin bug is now fixed. Windows Update informed me that the newest Cumulative Security Update for IE8, KB2559049, was now available to install, which I did. Rebooted.<br />
5. Checked the version of ieframe.dll that is now in my C:\Windows\System32 folder and it is 8.00.6001.23192(longhorn_ie8_ldr.110617-1815) as was hoped. Confirmed that the right margin bug still is fixed.<br />
<br />
This procedure proved 2 things that simply copying the LDR version from the most recent Cumulative Security Update into the System32 folder would not have proved.:<br />
<br />
A) This demonstrates that manually copying the LDR dll from a Cumulative Security Update and then applying the next update will keep the ieframe.dll on the LDR track. We do not need to worry that the next update will overwrite with the GDR (non-hotfix) version.<br />
<br />
B) There were a bunch of other dlls that were put on the LDR track when KB2559049 was reinstalled, so it seems that the LDR ieframe.dll may have dependencies on other dlls also being in the LDR branch, or vice-versa. Simply having the LDR ieframe.dll from the
 2nd most recent update in the System32 folder at the time of installing the newest one, caused the newest update to move other DLLs to the LDR track. This includes iepeers.dll, ieproxy.dll, iertutil.dll, msfeeds.dll, wininet.dll, and xpshims.dll (and very
 possibly others). That makes me conclude that my method (Steps 1-4 above) is superior to just manually copying in the newest LDR dll for ieframe.dll, since the other dependant LDR DLLs will be installed using my method.<br />
<br />
Ty to both Robert Aldwinckle and PA Bear for giving me help (even after I disappeared from the thread for over a year :P )

            <p>thanks, Cameron. I went to Acer help site, signed up,&nbsp;posted question. Two hours, 134 views, silence.&nbsp;&nbsp; made this up&nbsp;waiting... "Solution&nbsp;never&nbsp;needed if problem never happen"&nbsp;...with my luck,&nbsp;mine is first one this has ever happened to. I'll probably end
 up flinging it out my 5th floor window just to see if it can fly. Then, before the cops get here&nbsp;looking for&nbsp;the&nbsp;culprit responsible for the&nbsp;murder of&nbsp;a passing&nbsp;tourist by using a flying monitor to practically&nbsp;decapitate him&nbsp;of his head,&nbsp;I'll&nbsp;race off&nbsp;to the
 store and&nbsp;buy a Winmau Tournament bristle dart board,&nbsp;plus a set of Fansteel Black Widow tungsten darts&nbsp;to use&nbsp;for a replacement monitor if&nbsp;mine&nbsp;won't fly. Probably won't work, but&nbsp;I know darts&nbsp;always offer a good&nbsp;excuse to hoist a pint or two...a monitor
 never does that. Plus, unlike a monitor, if the darts are off center, just pull 'em out and throw 'em again. No manual needed. Darts&nbsp;are really hard to stick in a&nbsp;monitor, too. And&nbsp;darts are&nbsp;always fun to throw at your friends,&nbsp;especially after&nbsp;you've had
 that&nbsp;pint or six .&nbsp;But,&nbsp;try smacking 'em over the head&nbsp;with a monitor, see what happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oops...I seem to somehow have gotten a wee bit off track here. Sorry 'bout that, and thanks again. I do appreciate your help.</p>

            You've got to go with hammer heads! Way less bounce! Now, that being said, there should be buttons on your monitor that allow you to adjust the width, height, skew, etc...just hit them and see what comes up. I'm pretty sure I could sink my 24 gram hammer
 heads right through my monitor if it totally pi$$ed me off! LOL!

            <p><strong>yikes!</strong> such prowess... I, of course, am obviously terrified...I was hoisted&nbsp;up to&nbsp;chalk my name on the beams for my first ton 80&nbsp;was back in '65 at The Mayflower Pub over in Marin county. I played&nbsp;'A' league out of there&nbsp;for years, we traveled&nbsp;to
 bars&nbsp;all&nbsp;around the&nbsp;bay.&nbsp;Helped my game a bit, it did. Taking a chance in the mid 80's,&nbsp;I was able to&nbsp;play pro '86 thru '89.&nbsp; A while later, bored to death with practice, I started playing myself right hand vs. left. Within&nbsp;a month, I was better with my left
 than I'd ever been with my right. Heck yeah...and, displaying NO pride at all, I played pro soft tip for two years. I was really suprised to see how much money there was in soft tip. WAY more than steel. So easy, too.&nbsp;Compared to steel, the competition was
 much softer, so I&nbsp;really&nbsp;hated&nbsp;dropping soft tip.&nbsp;But a&nbsp;move from San Diego back here to the bay area,&nbsp;only to&nbsp;find NO soft tip here. Weird, eh?
</p>
<p>Anyways...I've recently seen&nbsp;a tattered old set of 17 gram softtips (two&nbsp;even had&nbsp;flights)&nbsp;around here somewhere. Be fun to soundly spank your hammer heads while using them...but what hand should I use?</p>
<p>So...seeing that I've hardly ever played, you&nbsp;understand why I'm terrified, don't you? heh heh...</p>
<p>Oh yeah...hammer heads are&nbsp;used by&nbsp;people who have trouble controlling their&nbsp;release.

                    <p>Please allow the (previously available) option to separate the chat and directory windows in the new version, running on PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An update should not remove valuable, widely-used features.&nbsp; I have had to downgrade to version 7.40 on my Win10 machine and disable all updates, until this feature is available, as I have multiple streams coming in from multiple people at the same time,
 and this allows me to better manage them visually on a PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q:&nbsp; Where can we see new feature lists, when they are released?&nbsp; (so I can look for this update)</p>

            Due to the setup of preinstalled apps in Windows Insiders builds you do need to join the Skype Insiders program separately.&nbsp; Other users have reported issues with being unable to sign-up from the program from their Windows Insiders builds.&nbsp; We're actively
 investigating.&nbsp; I'll circle back once we have a solution in place.&nbsp; Thanks for your patience!<br />

Three people claimed that a clean boot helped. What particular problem did it identify? Is there another way to do this? Windows 10 is notoriously difficult to boot into safemode, and the task of clean booting has become daunting. Is it really necessary to
 take an entire day on a Windows machine anymore to troubleshoot an error message this common?

<h2>            My Dell Inspiron 5535 freezes and makes a weird buzzing noise during or after I play a game</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I bought a Dell Inspiron 5535 laptop last month, and many times I have been playing a game, and the computer will totally freeze up and make a buzzing noise. If I leave it like that long enough, it will eventually go to a BSOD (Blue Screen of Death)
 which says "DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION", then the computer will restart. This will also happen soon after I play a game. I don't know what to do, and I just want this issue gone. Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>

            I couldn't find anything on Dell Support. If you could find something on it, it would be greatly appreciated. And no, restore/refresh/reset is not an option for me. I can't have my programs deleted.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The three minidump files showed three different errors with three different drivers causing the crash.</p>
<p>There was a PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (50) stop error caused by the cpuz135_x64.sys (CPU-Z driver). SolutoService.exe was the process that crashed.</p>
<p>There also was a DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (d1) stop error that appeared to be caused by the CT_ZTEMT_U_USBSER.sys (USB modem driver).</p>
<p>And there was also a SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (3b) stop error caused by the aswSnx.SYS&nbsp;(Avast driver).</p>
<p>I believe Avast may be causing stability issues on your system as other users have reported similar errors recently such as in the following thread;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-system/systemserviceexception-0x0000003b-blue-screen/b254d1dd-05ab-4326-b56b-abca422c783c">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-system/systemserviceexception-0x0000003b-blue-screen/b254d1dd-05ab-4326-b56b-abca422c783c</a></p>
<p>I would recommend to uninstall Avast and see if stability improves.</p>
<p>Consider using alternative security software such as&nbsp;Microsoft Security Essentials.</p>
<p>Avast drivers may have contributed to the other two errors but&nbsp;also consider updating the&nbsp;USB modem driver if possible and uninstall CPU-Z and Soluto.</p>
<p>If BSODs resolve you could try reinstalling CPU-Z and Soluto if you wish, one at a time, checking that the BSODs do not return.</p>

            <p>It appears the cpuz135_x64.sys may be a component of Soluto itself.</p>
<p>What I would suggest is to uninstall Soluto and see if the blue screens resolve.</p>
<p>Afterward you could try reinstalling Soluto using&nbsp;the latest version available.</p>

<h2>            Gamer Picture Not Being Accepted by Support&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I keep trying to use a custom picture for my Xbox profile picture but every time I try to use it, my profile picture changes back to my original Xbox gamer picture before i started using custom ones. Is this indicating that whoever regulates the use of profile pictures did not accept it? Sure it shows a "suicide theme" but that's not at all my intention. It's a picture from a children's show for God's sake and I personally think it'd look hilarious to have a profile picture. I don't see what's wrong with it! Here is a link to the picture.</p><p><a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/993047-tom-and-jerry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/993047-tom-and-jerry</a><br /></p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What is the exact error message you get while trying to uninstall the program?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The possible causes for this error are that your permissions do not grant you access to the folder where the installed files are located or the path to the folder where the installation files are
 saved has more than 256 characters. However, we can try a few troubleshooting methods and see if we can get the current version of the application uninstalled.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Run Microsoft Fixit tool.
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This tool will automatically repair the issues which prevent a program from being installed/uninstalled. Download the tool from the link below, run it and follow the onscreen instructions to allow
 this program to fix the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17588/windows-fix-problems-that-block-programs-being-installed-or-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Fix problems that block programs from being installed or
 removed</span></a><span> </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Change folder permissions</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above method doesn’t find and fix the issue, you may try changing the permissions of the folder where the current version of the program is installed. The default path would be C:\program files\EndNote
 and C:\program files86\EndNote if it is a 32 bit program. Please follow the instructions given below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Locate the installation folder as mentioned above.
</span></p>
<p><span>Right click on it and select

            <p>I'm having the same issue. Contacted chat support and phone support, both were unwilling to issue a refund and were being deliberately unhelpful. Other players have already secured refunds so they are apparently being selective. The game we purchased was factually misrepresented and we are being locked out of content we own. This is wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Install Disk - System Recovery Lists F&#58;&#92; as Location of OS, Not C&#58;&#92;</h2>
                    <p>Somehow, my OS was corrupted. So, after a few hours, I decide to use the install disk to repair the Win 7 OS. When I booted from the DVD drive, the System Recovery Option thinks the OS resides on the F:\ drive, not the C:\ &nbsp;SSD &nbsp;drive it was installed on.
 How do I change the destination on the System Recovery tool to C:\? There does not seem to be an option to do so, and I am hesitant to press next and cause more problems or lose more data. In short, HELP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>

</p><p>PS: I do not want to install Windows 10. This is not an option and should not be included in any responses because I would rather use an Abacas for my computing needs before I would consider W10.</p>

<p>The HDs on my PC are a 500 GB SSD and a 1 TB SATA named as follows:</p>
<p>Win7 C:\ and </p>
<p>Data F:\ and Data2 G:\ &nbsp;(The SATA drive is partitioned into 2 drives)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run the repair option from the install disk, it identifies Data F:\ as the disk to repay, a disk that contains important files etc.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
I would rather not accept advice that is counterintuitive and risk destroying important files - even though I have a backup of this drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, I decided to disable the SATA drive as a surefire method of protecting my data. After doing so and running repair, I found "Win7 D:\" as the only option to repair the windows install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, Windows repair does misidentify the drive letter of for the location of the OS. But it also sees to misidentify the drive altogether. So, should anyone else run into a similar problem, disabling the second HD during repair is the safest choice,
 while following the advice of a stranger on MS.com might proved to be destructive.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            XBOX360S HDMI - Works on 1 TV but not others</h2>
                    
<p>I've seen a few different threads with similar issues to this, but none so far that seem to have an answer.</p>

<p>I've owned by XBOX360S for some time. It was plugged into a Philips HDTV @1080P over HDMI and working fine. Last year, I changed out the TV to a Samsung LED 55" also @1080P. XBOX360S continued to work just fine. I kept my old TV and pushed it to the spare
 room.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently decided to upgrade to an XBOX one and sell my 360. I had the XBOX360 evaluated at a store (for trade) - they said it wasn't working. I took it home, plugged it into my Samsung TV and it worked fine. I then decided to try it on the older Phillips
 TV (which I had previously used) but no picture/sound - it simply says "Unsupported Format" - it is getting a signal, it just doesn't like it. (Yes I used the same cable).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to try it on a different Viewsonic LED monitor - same issue - a signal is detected, but it refuses to display. Plug it back into the Samsung and it works fine again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have formatted the HDD, Cleared the cache and tried changing the display settings while plugged into the Samsung to dummy it down to a lower resolution and then retry on the Philips. All to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's almost like the XBOX has decided to blacklist other TVs, but will only work with the one TV.</p>
<p>I also tried the Y + RT solution. I can see it trying.. screen flickers.. but no joy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that it works perfectly with my Samsung tell me that the HDMI port is working and my other TV/Monitors are working with computers, apple TV, u-verse with HDMI connected peripherals and the same cables. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm think that there must be some way to reset the XBOX360, but not finding anything. Help please :-)</p>

            <p>Is it possible that the refresh rate setting has flipped between 50Hz and 60Hz? So let's say old TV was 50Hz, when you used it on the Samsung it automatically changed to 60Hz and now 50Hz TVs cannot pick it up and display the signal (or vice versa)... Fairly long shot here, but it's worth looking at if you can.</p>
<p>Let us know how you get on. If it's not that we'll have to think of something else to try... :)</p>

<p>Thanks Maxen.. but that's not it. Both TVs are 60hz.. I'm in the US and I don't believe we use 50hz here (I want to say that this is a PAL option). It's not an option to change in the XBOX configuration. I even dug out my old composite/component cable that
 came with my original dead 360 and while I could get it to work on either component (at HD resolution 1080P) or composite, it still refuses to initialize on that TV over HDMI.

<p>If resetting your console's display settings ( Y + RT ) Doesn't work, then set the console to output at 720p on the TV that does work, and then plug it back into the TV that doesn't. If 720p still doesn't output properly, then there's an incompatibility
 between the console and TV, probably related to HDCP, but nothing you can really do if that is the case. If it does work with 720p, then just leave it at that. Very few, if any Xbox 360 games run at any higher resolution than that, and the console just upscales
 it when it's outputting at 1080i/p. Either way, your TV can do the upscaling in this scenario, when it stretches the full image over to your screen.</p>

<p>This sounds like a frustrating issue. I did a little reading on HDCP handshaking and found this set of troubleshooting steps:</p>
<p>"General 1:1 (or digital receiver between source and display) HDMI handshake troubleshooting</p>
<p>If you are having HDMI handshake issues / audio video drops in general without HDMI Distribution equipment (e.g. Source device directly connected to display with HDMI Cable or if your Digital Receiver is not recognized by the display as an HDCP device if
 between source and display) you might want to use a HDMI Switch between the source/receiver and the display. The receiver /source device then handshakes with the switch, the switch regenerates the handshake protocol and then handshakes with the display. The
 switch which has another HDMI timing/chipset than the source device then negotiates with the display. Only use this method as a last resort if no additional firmware upgrades are possible to the source device or the display.</p>
<p>HDCP handshake issues can be caused by the HDMI cables that are used if the pins are damaged or the cable does not conform to the correct HDMI specifications. Change the cable to test if this is the case before inserting a switch between source and display
 and use gold plated connector cables for best possible signal transfer on HDMI connections.</p>
<p>Most displays / sources have a sequence of buttons to press on the remote control or an option in the Menu to reset to factory defaults. Use this sequence or option to reset source / display to factory defaults and check if the HDMI Handshake issues are
 solved."</p>

<p>Irixion: That was one of the first things I tried. No joy. </p>
<p>Entexman: Yes. It does sound like a handshake problem. I will try some different cables for giggles. I tried a factory reset on the non-working TV - that didn't help.. it actually made some of the other attached devices stop working - although a couple of
 reboots later and those issues cleared up (for those devices) but still no joy with the 360. &nbsp;I haven't tried a HDMI switch but I don't own one either.

<p>Tried a few different cables today including the HDMI cable that came with my XBOX one. No change. &nbsp;FWIW the problem sounds identical to this one

www.ign.com/.../please-help-me-xbox-displaying-blank-screen-when-hdmi-used.188910714</a> he solved it by getting his XBOX replaced, but that sounds like a cop out. It isn't broken, because it still works perfectly on my Samsung TV.

<p>Really strange. Sorry that there is no easy fix for this one. &nbsp;It sounds like you did all the troubleshooting you can do. Maybe there is a problem with the HDMI port on the 360 and some TVs are more forgiving of the issue than others?

<p>It all probably stems to HDCP and its implementations. It could also be an incompatibility due to the version of HDMI that your TV uses vs the version of HDMI that the Xbox 360 uses. Depending on said implementations, some TVs may not be backward compatible
 for some versions.</p>

<h2>            outlook account different than microsoft account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there a difference between a Microsoft account and an outlook.com account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not overly happy with the idea of having all my browsing movements checked, I prefer to use a local account on my Windows 10 PC. &nbsp;I have begun recently to use One Drive. &nbsp;I get tired of having to sign in to my outlook.com account EVERY TIME I &nbsp;want to access
 One Drive. &nbsp;When I close my browser, I am signed out. &nbsp;So I opted to sign in using my Microsoft account, and see if THAT will keep One Drive open. &nbsp;But no such luck. &nbsp;I pass the first pane, and then am told "we need your password one more time. &nbsp;I use the
 same password as in the previous pane, and I am then told the password is incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing is to back out altogether and start again. &nbsp;All I want is to sign into my device to have (hopefully!) consistent access to One Drive. &nbsp;I do not care about apps and Cortana and bloatware and games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Coming to the pane that asks me to enter my "password one more time", I see an option to skip that and go to Next. &nbsp;No chance. &nbsp;Windows absolutely won't let me go there. &nbsp;I cannot sign into my own device. &nbsp;All I can think is that there is a difference between
 an outlook.com account and a Windows account. &nbsp;I can go some distance using my outlook email address and password but not get past the next step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I want is to sign into my device. &nbsp;As far as I remember, it is a personal computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened to the simple click bottom left to switch user?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I want is to sign into my device, and get quicker to the quirky One Drive - different kettle of stinking fish by itself. &nbsp;Even if it means my every keystroke is registered somewhere in cyberspace, and my emails will soon reflect adverts for stuff I read
 about but am not interested to buy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I remember, it is a personal computer. &nbsp;Is it?</p>

<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As far as I can tell, my outlook.com account is the only one I use to check email, have connected to my Office 365, and used when I first set up Windows 10 on both my desktop and
 tablet. &nbsp;"Your Microsoft Account" confused me. &nbsp;And when the screen told me the password for my Microsoft&nbsp;account is incorrect, I was even more confused. &nbsp;When I retried the issue, the "if you do not have a password, click NEXT," put me in a loop like karma/nirvana.

Mr. Praseetha K,<br />
<br />
Thank you kindly for your help.&nbsp; I found out through trail and error that<br />
the administrative tools folder had been moved to another area... I have<br />
no idea how that happened, but I was able to take and put it back into<br />
the C drive, under Progams, Microsoft, startup.<br />
So it works now :)<br />
<br />
Thank you again for your help, I appreciate it much<br />

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>just to be was this for the Xbox 360, since on the online store I can only find the Xbox One edition for this builder's pack.</p>
<p>You likely will be able to check what version it is via the transactions at <a href="http://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://account.microsoft.com/</a></p>
<p>If it is for the wrong version of the game, then I'm afraid that won't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is for the correct console version, then be sure to check if you can redownload it, by removing the content and reinstalling it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 Wireless Speed Wheel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> redzip42  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Wireless Speed Wheel</h2>
                    
<p>Hallo ich würde gerne wissen, warum das neue xbox 360 Wireless Speed Wheel nicht in Forza 3 richtig erkannt wird?&nbsp; Manuelles schalten mit dem Steuerkreuz geht nicht, was aber in Forza 4 problemlos funktioniert!&nbsp; In Forza 4 wird das Hufeisen ohne Probleme
 erkannt. Warum ist die Force Feedback Funktion fast nicht spürbar?&nbsp; Was mir auch aufgefallen ist in Forza 4, z.B wenn die Batterien leer sind und ich neue eingelegt habe, wird das Speed Wheel auch nicht mehr erkannt, erst ein Neustart des Spieles behebt dann
 diesen Fehler! Ich bin der Meinung, hier sollte Microsoft mal ordentlich nachbessern!</p>

<p>Das wurde extra für Forza 4 gemacht und dann wunderst du dich das es mit Forza 3 nicht richtig funktioniert? ;)</p>
<p>Und wenn die Batterien leer waren und dann neue drin sind ist es ganz klar das es nicht mehr richtig/ gar nicht erkannt wird da es nicht mehr mit dem Spiel kalibriert ist.</p>
<p>Nebenbei kann dir hier keiner weiter helfen da hier keine Microsoft Mitarbeiter im Forum unterwegs sind.</p>

<p>ok, ist eigentlich schade, dass hier keine Mitarbeiter von Microsoft im Forum unterwegs sind. So würden sie mal mitbekommen, wie fehlerhaft ihre Produkte sind. In der Werbung wird von der kraftvollen &nbsp;Force Fedeback Funktion geworben, warum spürt man in
 Forza 4 so gut wie nix! Das Lenkrad war eine gut gemeinte Erfindung nur leider nur noch bedingt funktionsfähig!</p>

<p><strong>Methode 1: Xbox Live Connection Test</strong></p>
<p>First at all you have to check your connection.</p>
<p>1. Press <strong>Xbox Guide Button</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Select <strong>Network Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Choose and select your Network.</p>
<p>4. Select <strong>Test Xbox Live Connection</strong>.</p>
<p>If it indicates your NATTYPE isn't open, please head on to the next solution.</p>
<p>Try following methodes to solve your NAT Problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Turning off Modem/Router</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Go to your Router/Modem and find the off/on button and then turn it off.</p>
<p>Note: If there's no off/on button set on your router, you can't find it, you can't reach it or whatever, find the power cable and turn it out of the outlet.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Ensure you have all devices that are connected with the Modem/Router shutdown.</strong></p>
<p>2. Wait 30 seconds and then restart the Modem/Router. (If you have no off/on button on it, just put the power cable back in the outlet.)</p>
<p><em>ETA 1 minute till the Modem/Router is ready.</em></p>
<p>3. Restart the device that was set on STRICT/ MODERATE first and this method should be helpfull for most of you (in this case your Xbox).</p>
<p>4. Please restart your Xbox Live Connection Test again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If this method didn't worked for you, please move on to the next method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Methode 3: Enable UPnP</strong></p>
<p><em>*Requirements*</em></p>
<p><em>- Name of your Modem/Router (+ Version).</em></p>
<p><em>- Internet Connection on your computer.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enable your UPnP (Universial Plug and Play).</p>
<p>If your Modem/Router supports UPnP, please enable it.</p>
<p>You can use the manuel or the website of the manufacture of your Modem/Router to enable it if you don't know hot to enable your UPnP.</p>
<p>When you have changed the settings of your UPnP, you have to restart the hardware to take effect.</p>
<p>Please restart your Xbox Live connection test again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If this method didn't worked for you, please move on to the next method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 4: Simplify the configuration</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wireless:</strong> Shutdown everything temporarly, except your Xbox 360/ Slim Console.</p>
<p><strong>Wired:</strong> Disconnect every cable temporarly from the Modem/Router ''except''&nbsp; the cable to your Xbox 360/ Slim Console.</p>
<p>Please restart your Xbox Live connection test again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If this method didn't worked for you, please move on to the next method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 5: Reversing Cable</strong></p>
<p><em>Wired only!</em></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Ensure you have turned off your Xbox 360/ Slim Console before trying this.</strong></p>
<p>1. If you have a cable from your Modem/Router to your Xbox 360/ Slim Console, please disconnect it.</p>
<p>2. Also disconnect the other side of the cable.</p>
<p>3. Turn the end of the cable that was plugged into&nbsp; the Modem/Router in the Xbox360/ Slim Console.</p>
<p>4. Turn the end that was plugged into the Xbox 360/ Slim Console into the Modem/Router.</p>
<p>5. Please restart the Xbox Live test again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this method didn't worked for you, please move on to the next method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 6: Factory Settings</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note: This works for ''Wired'' and ''Wireless''.</strong></p>
<p>1. Turn on your Xbox and wait till Xbox Home is loaded.</p>
<p>2. Go to<strong> Settings&nbsp;</strong> and then <strong>System</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Select <strong>Network Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Select <strong>Wired Network&nbsp;</strong> or <strong>Wireless Network</strong>, depending of what kind of Network you have.</p>
<p>5. Select <strong>Configure Network</strong>.</p>
<p>6. Select<strong> Additional Settings</strong> and then press on <strong>Restore to Factory Defaults</strong> and then select
<strong>Yes</strong>.</p>
<p>To restore the settings, please continue with the following steps on your computer.</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Windows Vista/7:</p>
<p>7. Go to start and typ in the search box the following commando: <strong>ipconfig /all</strong> and hit the ''Enter'' Button.</p>
<p>8. Find your connection, like Wireless Network or Local Area Network (LAN).</p>
<p>9. Write down the following Numbers from the items:</p>
<p>-<em> IPv4- Adress</em></p>
<p><em>- Subnetmask</em></p>
<p><em>- Standard Gateway</em></p>
<p>10. Now make a unique IP-Adress for your Xbox.</p>
<p>You can do this for example by adding10 numbers to your IP-Adress.</p>
<p>For example, if your computer IP-Adress is 192.168.1.1 your Xbox IP-Adress can be for example 192.168.1.11</p>
<p><strong>Note: Every IP-Adress needs to be ''unique''!</strong></p>
<p>Now you've to set the numbers you have write down in your Xbox Network Configuration.</p>
<p>11. Go to ''Xbox Home'' and select <strong>Settings</strong> (Right side).</p>
<p>12. Select <strong>System</strong> and then select <strong>Network Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>13. Choose <strong>Wired Network</strong> or <strong>Wireless Network</strong>, depending of what kind of Network you have.</p>
<p>14. On the page ''Basic Settings'' select <strong>IP-Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>15. Select the option <strong>manuel</strong>.</p>
<p>16. Select the option <strong>IP-Adress</strong> and then enter the IP-Adress you've writed down and then select
<strong>done</strong>.</p>
<p>17. Do the same with <strong>Subnetmask</strong> and <strong>Gateway</strong>.</p>
<p>18. When done, Press the <strong>B</strong> button and test your Xbox Live Connection again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this method didn't worked for you, please move on to the next method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 7: Port Forwarding</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>*Requirments*:</em></p>
<p><em>- Name of your Modem/Router</em></p>
<p><em>- Internet connection for PC</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the last method I know.</p>
<p>Port Forwarding actully means ''Opening Ports''.</p>
<p>To do that, do following:</p>
<p>1. If you don't know how to forward Ports, please contact your ISP (InternetServiceProvider) for further assistance.</p>
<p>If you know how to Forward Ports, please skip step 1.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Please enter the IP adress from your ISP into your webbrouwser.</p>
<p><strong>Note:&nbsp; If you don't know your corresponding IP-Adress, please consult the manuel or take a look at the site of your Modem/Router manufacturer.</strong></p>
<p>3. Log in.</p>
<p><strong>Note: If you don't know the name and/or password to log on, please consult the manuel, take a look at the back-side of your Modem/Router or contact your ISP.</strong></p>
<p>4. Then you can start ''Forwarding Ports''.</p>
<p>Do following to enable them:</p>
<p>Port 53: TCP and UDP.</p>
<p>port 80: TCP.</p>
<p>Port 88: UDP.</p>
<p>Port 1863: TCP and UDP.</p>
<p>Port 3074: TCP and UDP.</p>
<p><strong>Note: Some ports work only when TCP and UDP is enabled. If you have the ablity to select both you can enter the port one time instead enter them twice.</strong></p>
<p>5. Save the changes you've made.</p>
<p>6. Test your Xbox Live Connection again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this method didn't worked for you, please move on to the next method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 8: Contacting your ISP</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If none of these methodes worked for you, the only option that's left, is to contact your ISP (InternetServiceProvider).</p>
<p>Proberly there's a hardware issue inside the Modem/Router itself.</p>
<p>Now it's your ISP time to figure out what's wrong with the Modem and/or Router.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this was usefull!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows &#43; Volume Down hardware buttons do not take screenshot on Surface Pro 1.</h2>
                    <p>Was this changed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all fixes proposed, and have done a clean install as well with this still being an issue after a year.</p>
<p>When I press or hold Windows Hardware Button and Volume down rocker, instead of a screenshot</p>
<p>The screen gets an overlay like the ctrl alt del press without the options and a single sticky note pad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on and how do I fix this?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not respond with keyboard shortcuts, that does not solve the issue of the hardware buttons not functioning.</p>

<p>Hi Charles, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is possible that the Windows button is faulty. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Performing a 2 button reset may help you resolve the issue. To do that, follow the steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds.<br />
</li><li>Press and hold the Volume-up button and the Power button on your Surface at the same time for at least 15 seconds, and then release both.The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.<br />
</li><li>After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.<br />
</li><li>Press and release the power button on your Surface to turn it back on.</li><li>Try to take a screenshot. Please note that the Screenshots folder of your Pictures library under “This PC.”</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the 2 button reset did not resolve the issue, we suggest that you download and install the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49038&amp;751be11f-ede8-5a0c-058c-2ee190a24fa6=True" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
firmware and drivers update</a> for your device. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're still unable to take screenshots, then this could be a possible hardware issue. You can check the different methods of taking a screenshot using your Surface device by clicking on this

link.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you have any concerns. </p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>FWIW I hardly ever try to use that Logo button as a modifier any more on my Surface 2 Pro since it is so inconsistent but I just tried it as a test with W10 and saw a "Connect"&nbsp;dialog as if it would be a media control.&nbsp; Perhaps that is what you meant by
 "single sticky note pad"?&nbsp;&nbsp; Logo+VolumeDown still works as a screenshot on my Surface RT but of course that is with W8.1.&nbsp; My guess would be that the functionality has been changed in W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, I think we should also check the related one for Narrator,&nbsp; Logo+VolumeUp.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it still work?... Nope.&nbsp; Same thing.&nbsp; I have no idea what that Connect thing is supposed to be.&nbsp; Surface support probably won't think it is that big a deal since only&nbsp;Surface
 models earlier than Surface 3 have a Logo button.&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, other Surface models have&nbsp;various similar methods of overloading only the Power button as a "modifier".&nbsp;&nbsp;I find trying to add functionality that way to be even more problematic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH</p>

<p>THANK YOU!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unlike most Microsoft supports that have me running through steps like I haven't already tried that, when the bigger issue is if Microsoft change this feature themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great if Microsoft could test these things on the hardware they created and sold us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is weird that your surface brings up a connect feature, does it take a screenshot at all?</p>

<p>While I would like to say that the button could be faulty, there is nothing to suggest that.</p>
<p>The windows button works as normal when it is only pressed.&nbsp; Tap = Start Screen, Hold = Start Screen when Released.</p>
<p>The volume keys work as indented as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if the windows key was faulty, I do not think I could activate Narrator with Win+Vol Up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like there is a new build installing now, after that is complete, I will try the firmware update and let you know how it goes.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I updated to 15063.608 and now&nbsp;my symptom has changed.&nbsp; The functionality is still flakey IMO but probably usable as intended.&nbsp; If anything I think I have reinforced my impression that a Logo+Volume&nbsp; "press"&nbsp; may be really not so much as&nbsp;using the Logo button
 as a modifier but (incredibly) actually as the synchronous use of both&nbsp;(so it appeared&nbsp;more like needing to be able to do a precise tap on both hardware objects at the same time than first pressing and holding the Logo button and then trying to target the
 right end of the Volume rocker.)&nbsp;&nbsp; IOW don't be surprised if you can't make it work with one shot and don't be surprised if whatever happens when being unsuccessful causes something else to happen.&nbsp; This annoying aspect of the procedure applies also to the
 use of the Power button for its overloaded functionality.&nbsp; E.g. when you try using it you may variously put the machine to Sleep, Power it off or Hibernate it instead of accomplishing whatever doing the other thing would be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t access certain websites with any browser</h2>
                    <p>I can't access certain websites with any browser</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened with a few websites but the one that is really upsetting me is
<cite>https://<strong>simply</strong>.<strong>freetax</strong></cite><cite>.com</cite>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried IE, Mozilla and Opera</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all of them I click on the link then it takes forever for anything to load and when it does it is one of many error messages depending on the site.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not my ISP or router blocking the site because I can access it from any one of the 4 other computers in this house. It appears that the problem is confined to my desktop unit. I have tried turning off my firewall and antivirus. I have cleared history.
 I have no idea where to go next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help</p>
