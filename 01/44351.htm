<h2>            Microsoft games are &#34;currently not available in your account&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I've been playing Solitare, Mahjong, Minesweeper, Taptiles, Jigsaw, and Sudoku daily for a long time. Starting yesterday afternoon with Minesweeper, I'm getting a "currently not available in your account" error from some of them. I tried uninstalling Minesweeper
 and now I cannot re-download for the same reason (it errors when trying to acquire the license from the Windows store). Today, Mahjong and Jigsaw started with the same behavior. As of right now, the only games that will load are Solitare, Taptiles and Sudoku.
 Xbox app loads fine. The store is able to download and install other apps and games without a problem. Everything else appears to be working fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is on a first generation Surface Book (i5/256/dGPU), all current updates installed (I'm on the creator's update build of Win10). I have a separate desktop PC I have yet to check to see if the problem exists there, too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried wsreset and a reboot, but I refuse to re-register the store via command line. The last time I tried that, my store ended up so broken I had to do a total OS refresh and reinstall all my software. I don't have time for that right now.</p>

            Just wanted to add, I checked my desktop PC and as of right now, I'm seeing the same behavior with these games except Mahjong still works on that machine. Jigsaw and Minesweeper both say they aren't available in my account right now. So the issue appears
 to be either with my account (my husband's Minesweeper game is working fine with his account on his Surface Pro 2) or on Microsoft's side somehow. I've done nothing different, no new software installs nor any other issues, and neither of my machines has a
 virus.<br />

<p>The error code given appears to be pretty generic. It also applies to games on Xbox units. Only Microsoft can answer this issue, I think. I'm not going to try anything else on either of my PCs until they respond or fix the issue on their end. I guess my
 streak of completing all daily challenges for the above list of games is over until they fix this. I've logged into my MS account on the web, too, and there's nothing wrong there, either. From my perspective, everything should be fine. It doesn't appear to
 be corruption on my local machines unless that corruption has spread from my Surface laptop to my home-built desktop PC (both machines are on the creator's update).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm glad to see I'm not alone with this issue. A fix or a response sometime soon would be nice, Microsoft!</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: My guess is this is some sort of app/store license issue. Unfortunately, I have no idea how to go about fixing it myself. I'm a pretty big windows geek, but I don't mess around with the Windows Store stuff -- last time I did, I ended up doing a refresh
 of my PC to fix the mess that was left. Never again.</p>

            Thanks guys. Hopefully enough people will "me too" this thread that someone from Microsoft will take notice. There's a couple of threads here about Asphalt 8 exhibiting the same issue, and those threads are pretty long, so hopefully if the two problems
 are related, we'll see a fix soon.

<p>Me too! I've been playing these daily challenges for a long time - Solitaire, Mahjong, Minesweeper, Sudoku and Jigsaw. Started receiving the "currently not available in your account" for Minesweeper yesterday and Jigsaw today. I've recently been enjoying
 the new Ultimate Word Games challenges as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is on a desktop using Windows 10, which I've been using for quite a while.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried resetting and rebooting, but nothing seems to work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this will be resolved soon.</p>

<h2>            Camera device all of the sudden is gone.</h2>
                    <p><span>I turned on my SP4 the other day to sign in like I do normally with windows Hello, only to notice that "windows Hello couldn't turn on the camera." After some further investigation, I also noticed that there were no imaging devices showing up in my
 device manager. I've checked the BIOS, and both the rear, front, and IR cameras are turned on. What in the world is happening? Did something get disconnected on the inside of my surface? Any help would be appreciated. I'm kind of at my wits end here.</span></p>

<p><span>P.S. There are no updates to be installed, bc I know that's the first thing that will be asked.</span></p>

<p>I have the same problem. My camera worked fine until May, I use it every day with Windows Hello, and all of a sudden it kept telling me "Sorry, there is something wrong. Couldn't turn on the camera, make sure it is working properly." Which is not terribly
 helpful!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My camera works fine in the Camera App, but cannot be started by Windows Hello.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Device Manager does not show any "Imaging Devices" or any "Camera" devices. I have downloaded and installed the latest driver pack, but this has made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have trolled the Net and whilst this seems to be a common problem, I have not found a single solution that works for me. All scans complete with no problems, there are no hardware issues listed and so on.</p>

<div>The UEFI settings can be adjusted only during system startup. To load the UEFI</div>
<div>firmware settings menu:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Shut down your Surface and wait 10 seconds.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Press and hold the volume-up button on your Surface and at the same</div>
<div>time, press and release the power button.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. The Microsoft or Surface logo appears on your screen. Continue to</div>
<div>hold the volume-up button. Release the button once the UEFI screen appears.</div>

<div>Check the cameras, toggle on if off. If already on, toggle off and then on. Any</div>

<p>Thanks Barb,</p>

</p><p>No luck, the camera devices are toggled on, I tried toggling off and on, no joy. So I toggled off, restarted, then toggled on and restarted again, still no luck.</p>

            <div>Not sure exactly what you looked at in device manager, but try this--</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Open Device manager by typing</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>device manager</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>in the Cortana/Search field lower left hand corner</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Expand System Devices and find the Microsoft IR Camera Front and uninstall by</div>

<div>Then do the same for Surface Camera Windows Hello</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. restart your Surface twice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If this fails to resolve the issue,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Open device manager as above</div>
<div>2. Expand System Devices again</div>
<div>3. Find the&nbsp; MICROSOFT IR CAMERA FRONT - </div>
<div>4. right click/press and hold and then select&nbsp; Update Driver </div>
<div>5. Select Browse my computer for driver software </div>
<div>6. Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer </div>
<div>7. Microsoft IR camera front and then click or tap NEXT to install the driver </div>
<div>8. restart Surface twice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Then, go through the process again but select SURFACE CAMERA WINDOWS HELLO and</div>

<p>Barb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were no cameras listed under "System Devices", but there was an "Intel AV Stream Camera 2500" under "Sound, Video and Game Controllers", so I deleted that and rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now all the device drivers appear and the camera appears to be working fine with Windows Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Weird!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks very much for the help.</p>

            This is because Minecraft.exe is merely a launcher app. Once he logs into Minecraft, Minecraft.exe closes and the game is actually run in a process called Javaw.exe. So it makes total sense that Minecraft is recorded as only being open for a small amount
 of time. On the report, is a Javaw.exe listed with lots of time?<br />
<br />
Javaw.exe is found at either <b>C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin\javaw.exe</b> or <b>
C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin\javaw.exe</b><br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a Scam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the advice given to anyone who has any phone calls, popups, etc.&nbsp;like this about Malware, License Expiry, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We all have errors and warnings&nbsp;in our event viewer, which is another ploy they use to scare you</p>
<p>
</p><p>These so-called "Microsoft" Tech Companies either want to sell you worthless software, or gain Remote Access to your Computer to try and&nbsp;steal your Banking and Credit Card details and to also carry out an Indentity Theft on you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are the only one who knows if you have given them Remote Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have given them Remote Access and if&nbsp;you do Internet Banking, contact your Bank, explain it to them and change Passwords.</p>
<p>If you use your Credit Card online, cancel it and get a new one issued to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the only way that you willl know that you are free of them is to save your Data and do a clean install of your Operating System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Microsoft does not contact you, unless YOU have made prior arrangements with them to do so.</p>

            If a system afflicted with a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) will not boot, you will not be collecting any DMP files, you will not be collecting any msinfo32 information - sometimes you just may not be able to boot in any mode.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If the system does not boot, there is no need to link out to a Wiki article, right?&nbsp; Or if you do, the article might have two sections - one for if your system still boots and runs okay and one if it does not and then what to do in each scenario (just a thought).<br />
<br />
So why not ask that question (and lots of other questions) first - Does your system boot in any mode?&nbsp; If yes, link to the Wiki article.&nbsp; If not, do these things...<br />
<br />
It's a fine Wiki article and very helpful - but only if a system boots.<br />
<br />
There are lots of systems in the world today that don't have CD/DVD drives, most people in the world don't have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (or are not sure) and even if they do, they will not be helpful if they don't know, forgot or can't get past
 the prompt for the XP Recovery Console Administrator password (happens all the time - especially with XP Home) or if their system has SATA drives even if they have a genuine bootable XP installation CD it is probably not going to be helpful (without some BIOS
 fiddling).<br />
<br />
If you are getting a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) maybe you should start by telling is what it says.<br />
<br />
<div>Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If there is a file name listed under the STOP message, be sure to include that information too.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you. &nbsp;We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know what
<i>your </i>BSOD looks like.<br />
<br />
You say you put in more RAM and then got a BSOD, so if you remove the new RAM and go back to your original configuration, does the system boot okay?<br />
<br />
Where did you get this new RAM and how confident are you that it is the right RAM for your system?<br />
<br />
Then you should tell us the patient (the afflicted system) like what is your Compaq Presario model number (they make more than one) so we can look it up and find out more about your system.<br />
<br />
Then you should tell us the XP Service Pack installed on your system.<br />
<br />
Then you would tell us if the CD you have is a genuine bootable XP installation CD and if it is,&nbsp; is it the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Then describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; avast!. Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Finally, tell us:<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?</div>

            The BSOD&nbsp;was so fast I couldn't see what it said but the XP Pro I have is a genuine disc (bootable). I just turned it on and IE kept having errors and closing then it went blue and off. When I'd turn it back on nothing would happen, wouldn't load or anything.
 Does this help at all ? Also I don't understand what I'm supposed to do in <u>Tech Republic</u>, I've never seen anything like it before ?&nbsp;Thank You, Greg (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)

            That answers some of the important questions (please work on the others).<br />
<br />
The next time you restart, just before XP starts to load start repeatedly tapping the F8 key until you see a menu like this:<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
<br />
Enable Boot Logging<br />
Enable VGA mode<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Directory Services Restore Mode (Windows domain controllers only)<br />
Debugging Mode<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong> <br />
<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
Reboot<br />
Return to OS Choices Menu<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What you need to choose from that menu is the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure<br />
</strong><br />
Then if XP fails to boot normally, you will see an error screen with information and clues regarding the problem and then you can decide what to do next.<br />
<br />
If you do not see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option, you need to reset your system and start tapping the F8 key on the keyboard until you do see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you miss the F8 window of opportunity, you need to try again and start tapping the F8 key with more urgency (sooner and more frequently) until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure, then select it.<br />
<br />
You need to keep trying the F8 menu until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure option, and select it.
<br />
<br />
If your system ever does boot successfully configure it not to automatically restart on a crash:<br />
<br />
XP automatically restarts on a system failure, so configure your system so it doesn't do that, then you can see the error message.<br />
<br />
Configure your system to not automatically restart on system failure and to create a crash dump file when it does crash.<br />
<br />
Right click My Computer, Properties, Advanced, Startup and Recovery Settings.<br />
<br />
In the System failure section:<br />
<br />
Put a check mark in the "Write an event to the system log" box<br />
Put a check mark in the "Send an administrative alert" box<br />
Uncheck the "Automatically restart" box<br />
<br />
In the Write debugging information section, choose:<br />
<br />
Small memory dump (64 KB)<br />
<br />
Set the Small dump directory to:<br />
<br />
<b>%SystemRoot%\Minidump</b>&nbsp; (if there is no Minidump folder, it will be created when needed)<br />
<br />
Click OK, OK to save the settings.<br />
<br />
Restart your computer and then wait for the next restart/crash.<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 removed my DVD player</h2>
                    Like so many others, my DVD player was disabled by installing Windows 10. I installed the Windows update that gave me their DVD player but that didn't help. I have VLC, but it won't play either. I presume Windows 10 deleted my device's drivers, but since
 my device doesn't show up under hardware, I have no idea what kind of device I have so I can look for the drivers. Plus, from what I'm reading online, installing the drivers isn't repairing the problem. Suggestions?

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Conexant smart audio is an audio driver. If this driver is installed before upgrading to Windows 8.1 then you may need to update this driver or
 probably install the latest driver on Windows 8.1. This will ensure you experience trouble-free audio. Catalyst control center is associated with AMD drivers.
</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for&nbsp;your reply,&nbsp;Srimadhwa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is a Dell Inspiron 15R.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated Window 8 to 8.1 few weeks ago, and I think the steps I followed had me update drivers before running the update, but I cannot recall for sure whether that was what I did.&nbsp; Anyhow, I updated the drivers on Tuesday as described below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right after I updated to 8.1, I&nbsp;had two issues, but did not have time to deal with them until this Monday.&nbsp; The two issues were:</p>
<ol>
<li>An error message that "Catalyst Control Center Hosting Application has stopped working" every time after Windows started up.</li><li>An error message&nbsp;around 75% of time before Windows Starts up that says Windows encountered some error and will restart for me, and the error message&nbsp;is "Thread stuck in device driver".</li></ol>
<p>I contacted Microsoft Answers via chat this Monday evening and the support person ran something to fix the Catalyst issue.&nbsp; On restarting my pc after she ran what she ran, the Catalyst message no longer shows up, but then this "Failed to create Conexant
 Audio Factory, the Smart Audio will now exit" message came up for the first time ever since the update couple weeks ago.&nbsp; The support person said this is not from her fix or is an Windows update related issue.&nbsp; She said it could be malware and she would have
 to charge me $149 to fix it.&nbsp; I find it crazy that something got introduced during her fix and I then have to pay to get it fix, therefore I did not move forward with having her fix this.&nbsp; In addition, her fix did not fix the Tread stuck issue either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Microsoft Answers again on Tuesday evening, a different support person suggested that I contact Dell for their latest drivers because she believes both the initial two issues and the Conexant SmartAudio one are driver issues.&nbsp; She said that the
 Thread Stuck in Device Driver is because of the Catalyst issue and since the fix on Monday only got rid of the Catalyst error message but not the Tread stuck issue, the issue is a driver issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Dell and also found on their website a new driver for Catalyst and also one for Conexant that was released in Sept/Oct last year.&nbsp; I installed both plus a couple other drivers that was recommended for my system.&nbsp; The Catalyst message no longer
 appear.&nbsp; The Thread Stuck one also has not come up, but this Thread stuck one does not come up every time and I have logged on just&nbsp;few times&nbsp;since the pc is my home pc and because it has been Thanksgiving time out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Conexant error message remains and pops up every time still.&nbsp; I checked my Start-up programs and this program is already checked to start up each time.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not tried method 1 above yet because I wasn't able to figure out the R keys.&nbsp; Sorry to be
 dumb, but can you explain which are R keys please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the reason I worry that the Conexant error message is a virus is because the first Microsoft support person said it was not update related, but could be malware and she needs to use a 3rd party tool to fix it.&nbsp; Also there are various 3rd party tool
 sellers posting that this is a virus and to buy their tool to remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the lengthy info, but just want to provide the full info so you can better assist. Thank you again in advance.</p>

    <title>Is TataraTmp a Trojan&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cg1413  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is TataraTmp a Trojan&#63;</h2>
                    I have read the thread on TataraTmp but I am not entirely convinced.&nbsp; I only noticed this 'thing' recently and it keeps creeping back even if I deleted it time and again.&nbsp; Today is worse, it keeps booting me out of my normal internet connection and connect
 to it until I changed its name to something else.&nbsp; The reason I suspect it is a Trojan is that I notice its activity is more vicious and persistent whenever I signed into ebay, paypal etc.&nbsp; Anyway, I tried to uninstall O2 connection manager but it asks for
 permission to change the settings on my computer, which generally speaking appears to be normal but the file they want to change somehow gives me reasons for concerned as I don't want to jump from the frying pan into the fire so to speak.&nbsp; The file it wants
 to change is c:\windows\installer\48eb7.msi.&nbsp; I did a search and a Dutch site says it is a trojan or something like that, I don't know Dutch so its really difficult for me to know for sure.&nbsp; Any take on this please.<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is not a Trojan but TataraTmp is some kind of a community Wi-Fi network and it only appears if you
 use an Internet Stick or associated software and tries to override all other Wi-Fi networks. Since you have O2, it was probably installed when you inserted the O2 internet stick.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to contact O2 or post in the O2 forums:

            System32 is only a name. It doesn't mean you have 32-bit Windows. There's no point to changing the name of the folder because it serve no purpose other than cosmetics and every time you touch code you risk doing something wrong.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The benefits of using a 64-bit operating system are most apparent when you have a large amount of random access memory (RAM) installed on your computer, typically 4 GB of RAM or more. In such cases, because a 64-bit operating system can handle
 large amounts of memory more efficiently than a 32-bit operating system, a 64-bit system can be more responsive when running several programs at the same time and switching between them frequently.<span>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As per your computer, since it has 64-bit Windows, it can still perfectly run 32-bit programs thus, you are seeing this information. However, if you are running a 32-bit operating system, you may install
 a 64-bit program but it will have problems running since it does not meet the system requirement.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know if you need any other assistance. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Regards.<br />

<h2>            SP4 - Fan Problem &#47; CPU Spikes</h2>
                    <p>Hello guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>please bear with me while I explain the problem. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>The main part starts after the screenshot, so you can simply scroll down.</strong></p>
<p>to that. I only added the backstory, since I wasn't sure if anything I did </p>
<p>there with a previous issue I think I solved, is potentially at fault for my </p>
<p>current ongoing problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Backstory:</strong> In the end of Dec 2017, my original SP4 blew up ... quite literally</p>
<p>an explosive battery defect. It took me till early February until everything was
</p>
<p>sorted out with the guys who were supposed to deliver and collect my SP4s.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On April 17th, my warranty ran out. *<em>Insert sarcastic John McClane quote here</em>*</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, barely 5-6 months after I received my new SP4 and three months (!!) after</p>
<p>my warranty came to an end, I got another problem, which I'll explain here. I'll</p>
<p>divide it into two parts ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My SP4 started looking like this on a regular basis. 80-100% CPU power is truly no joke,</p>
<p>especially, since it heats up the hardware really fast. The problem was with the Microsoft
</p>
<p>Windows Search-Indexerservice and the MS WIN Search Protocol Host - which is currently</p>
<p>not on the screenshot but acted up quite often, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched the internet and finally found a few solutions. I rebuilt the entire index (C:/ only),
</p>
<p>re-booted the computer, ran as admin cmd.exe &gt; sfc/scannow, rebooted, ran security (Avast
</p>
<p>Internet Security and Avira Antivirus) on my computer (full depth). </p>
<p>Then I rebooted and did the whole thing a few more times just to make the !"§$ sure that there</p>
<p>was no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Main Part: Start here for the real problem:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>End of story-time? I though so, too ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days after this - and I was sweating the Niagara Falls since this obviously</p>
<p>interfered with my work - the second problem showed up ... and I'm honestly </p>
<p>dreading the answer you guys are going to give me ...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My CPU usage</strong> is down to 5-10%. I've got e.g. 2 WIN Explorer's open, 1 Excel, 1 Editor,</p>
<p>Taskmanager and Chrome with 5-10 Tabs. Of these tabs, one is YT for some music, and</p>
<p>the rest is mostly text based websites such as forums, e-mail (Outlook, Gmail) etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My usage time</strong> is approx. from 9am to 2am with short breaks for lunch and dinner. I only
</p>
<p>turn it on standby and don't bother turning it off, since I'd have to open so many settings</p>
<p>again. So it's basically on 12-17 hours per day, 7 days a week. Non stop, since six months.</p>
<p>I turn it totally off over night!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then I got the spikes ... weird ones, where I'm doing absolutely nothing, and then</p>
<p>out of the blue, I get a near 100% CPU spike into it. The fans start chugging along as if</p>
<p>they're doing some heavy video editing. And then it slowly starts to go down again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to TaskManager, it was always Chrome at fault for this ... somehow a bit
</p>
<p>unbelievable, since in the beginning, with the new SP4, I was able to handle it perfectly</p>
<p>fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&gt; Google: Chrome is a CPU and RAM hog. Ok, no problem. I shut down Chrome, turned</p>
<p>off my SP4. Waited for it to cool down, then re-booted, opened the TaskManager,
</p>
<p>opened Excel, opened a PDF ... opened Firefox ... no problem ...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>AND THEN ...</strong> with 5-10% CPU usage, the fans start running ... and they never shut down.</p>
<p>When I place my hand on the back of the SP4, it's hot enough to fry some eggs and bacon.</p>
<p>It's either running very quietly or it's churning very loudly. And the CPU never goes above 20%</p>
<p>in these cases. CoreTemp gives me between 40-45°C.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fan itself only shoots the air through the top left air vent. The other parts don't have
</p>
<p>any exhaust at all. Is that supposed to be like that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that dust got into the vents and are clogging it up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything I can try or do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

<p>Hi Lorenz, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Running the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit might help resolve the issue. The diagnosis and repair takes about 15 minutes as it would check for both Windows and driver updates. It will automatically install any missing Windows update or driver and firmware update
 for your device<span>. </span><span><span>Click&nbsp;<span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here&nbsp;</a></strong></span>to learn
 how to run the toolkit. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>After running the toolkit, force shutdown your device to ensure that all updates are applied.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the power button for a full 10 seconds, until the screen turns off, then release the power button.</li><li>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, use this two-button shutdown process to make sure your Surface completely turns off.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.</li><li>
<p>Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both.<br />
The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.</p>
</li><li>After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.</li><li>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If running the toolkit did not work, perform a clean boot. <span>This starts your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether background programs are causing the issue. Click
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> on how you can perform a clean boot.
</span></p>

            <p>Thanks Ramesh. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I click <strong>Restore Default</strong>, instead the prompt you mentioned, the system ask me: "The folder C:\Users\Xavier\Documents does not exist. Would you like to create it?". If I answer "No", nothing is happenning. If I answer "Yes", the system,
 then, ask me for the question to move files. If I say "NO", then the message is "Access is denied".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>???</p>

            <p>Xavier,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you'll need to fix this by editing the registry. Check out post&nbsp;<a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/shell-folders-merged-music-videos-same-folder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix Shell Folders Like Music And Videos Merged And Pointing To
 Same Folder</a>. Backup the "User Shell Folders" registry key referenced in the article beforehand.</p>
<p><br />
To automate the steps, download&nbsp;w10_usf_clear_override_hkcu.zip from the above page, unzip and run the enclosed REG file.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much. Problem is now solved regarding This PC folder and so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the name of the Users folder remains still "Documents", and it should be "Xavier". I don't know if can causes disturbs...</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Check this link, it is to run (Scannow and Dism) that are used to repair Windows system files.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>
<br />
<br />If the above does not work, follow these steps: 
<br />
<br />1.- First, close all the programs and files that you have open.
<br />2.- Click with the right mouse button in the Windows Start menu and select Control Panel. Then choose the category System and security. On the next screen, look down Administrative Tools on the right and click on that option.
<br />3.- One of those tools is the Windows Memory Diagnostic. Double click on it to open it.
<br />4.- The diagnosis gives two options to choose from. See what each one does and click on the one  you prefer:
<br />
<br />     Restart now and check if there are problems. It is best to select in most cases. Make sure to close all programs as I have asked before. The PC will reboot on its own when choosing this option. Right after, the check also starts automatically.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

<h2>            StarCraft II&#58; Wings of Liberty -- mouse pointer will not work during game</h2>
                    
<p>We installed the StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty game on my son's desktop computer.&nbsp; It is a Windows XP.&nbsp; There was no problem with installation.&nbsp; But when game loads and we type in username and password and the "accept Terms" comes up, the mouse pointer
 will not move for us to be able to accept the "Terms", therefore we cannot start&nbsp; the game.</p>

<p><span><span><strong>Hi HT0206,<br />
</strong>I see that many users have come across a similar issue and they fixed it by trying the below steps:<br />
<strong>Step 1: </strong><br />
Set DPI [Dots per inch] to 125% and then check for the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Right-click the Windows desktop, and then click Properties on the shortcut menu. The Display Properties dialog box opens.<br />
b. Click the Settings tab, and then click the Advanced button.<br />
c. On the General tab, DPI settings appear in a list in the Display area. <br />
d. Change the DPI setting to 120 DPI from the DPI setting drop-down list under Display, and then click OK.<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>Update the latest drivers for your display adapter.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Update drivers: recommended links:</strong><br />
</span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Update-drivers-recommended-links</span></a></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 3:</strong><br />
If the issue still persists, put the computer in a clean boot state and then check for the issue.<br />
Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:</span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.<br />

    <title>Windows 8 update &#38; audio - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertdenison  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 update &#38; audio</h2>
                    After an update for my windows 8 software, my computer decided it could no longer detect it's audio driver, and had no way of creating audio output. As such, I contacted microsoft support. A technician remotely accessed my computer (who appeared to have
 no idea what he was doing, as he merrily downloaded a program to detect missing drivers, which even I, with a basic knowledge of computers, could see were missing from previous pages), and set about uninstalling more drivers, and has now left my laptop unable
 to connect to the internet. ('Unkown Error' is displayed).<br />
<br />
My computer has now gone in to the retailer from which it was purchased for repairs. Simply put, I want to know how and who to contat to re-inburse the costs of the fix. The fault was not my own, and the technician Microsoft provided actually made matters worse.
 My windows 8 was within it's 90 day warrenty period, so I would expect any manufacture showing even the slightest customer care to be understanding given the circumstances.

            <p>Things go wrong sometimes but I think you had a responsibility to call Microsoft support back and let them&nbsp; decide to&nbsp;try,&nbsp;or not to try, to talk you through&nbsp;getting it back online via your phone call. &nbsp;They maybe could have arranged the computer shop to
 get you going online&nbsp;for no cost to you.&nbsp;&nbsp; They almost certainly could have got you&nbsp;online and a&nbsp;working computer on the phone.</p>

            ^ Thanks for that, I do understand what you are saying, and can totally see where you are coming from, to just give you further detail, I emailed Microsoft on Saturday and haven't received any reply at all. I work shifts which since then have been outside
 of their call centre opening times and due to personal commitments (distance learning that is time critical), I needed my computer back online immediately.<br />
<br />
I do see where you are coming from, however, the technician who dealt with my computer had a chance to fix it, and I did give them an email. Whilst I could have further persued options obviously with the timescale in mind I need my computer working again as
 soon as possible, and, I think, quite understandably after paying over £800 for the computer in question, you would expect a more timely response and customer focused attitude from a large company such as windows (especially within the 90 day warrenty period;
 I see it as Microsoft's responsibility to contact me if their technician chooses to help fix my computer and then causes futher issues).<br />

            To get your audio back, you should have just gone to the computer manufacturer's webpage, and gone to the profile for your computer.&nbsp; Then you should have gone to the Download and Install Drivers page and installed the latest audio driver.&nbsp; That typically
 works.&nbsp; The problem was that the computer was trying to access an outdated driver that didn't update with your operating system; naturally the driver's code didn't work.

            Hi there,<br />
<br />
No, this didn't work either. I went to the intel website (it's an Intel audio driver in question) and it couldn't detect a valid driver. The intel website had no valid version number and detected the audio driver as a Microsoft remote proxy (or words to that
 effect, it was worded: Microsoft, something something proxy - something to do with remote, sorry I can't be more specific).<br />
<br />
I'd also hasten to add, surely, if the resolution was this simple, the Microsoft technician who helped me could have come to the same conclusion without the need to remotely access my computer, download programs to it and uninstall other drivers.<br />

            The problem possibly was that your computer manufacture had customized the driver (most do), in which event you would need to get the driver form the manufacture and not from Intel.&nbsp; Intel would not have been able to tell whether you had the driver or
 not because&nbsp;the driver&nbsp;would be changed.&nbsp; If this is not the case, then&nbsp; will not ben able to help any further.&nbsp; I hope you solve the problem soon.

            Thanks for that.<br />
<br />
As I say, my actions were to check the intel website as it was an intel driver. I then immediately contacted windows live support and a live technician remotely accessed my computer. Again, I would question either the technician's competency or the depth of
 the problem, because this does sound like a very simple fix and clearly this was not the route the technician took.<br />
<br />
Obviously I am now unable to acheive any of these fixes as my computer cannot access the internet.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just checked Toshiba's website and the driver in question is not present when my laptop type is searched. Seems very odd.<br />

            <p>May I ask who connected to your computer, Was you able&nbsp;to get there name? Did&nbsp;they provide you with an service request&nbsp;number?&nbsp;Was it with the microsoft site them selves.&nbsp; which im sure there is only one site where you can get remote assistence and that
 is from the microsoft get live help centre, to find out more please see this microsoft based help, (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/get-support/windows/windows-8/repair-recovery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Repairing my software</a>)</p>
<p>If you could go into more detail / some more information about the questions that i have asked you in result this will help me more with the issue so it can be delt with.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing that&nbsp;I surgestion is to go to the link that i provided then when you are connected with Microsoft help/answer-desk, tell&nbsp;the person that you&nbsp;connected with&nbsp;another tech person before&nbsp;but made the issue worse and has broke some of your working
 software and that you need it reparied. If you have a service request please give it to them and ask them if they could check it for you and to see what notes the service tech person put. If he was with microsoft then there should be an service request on
 your account. Tell&nbsp;them what happend and tell them to fix the issue as it was not your fault describe that somebody has allready connected to your computer before, however the person who conneceted to your computer made the situation worser. Please Go into
 detail about what has happend and what has gone cupport/broke with your software. I can assure you that the live help person will get you back on your feet ASAP and give you the answers that you are looking for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem persits please do&nbsp;not hesitate to post back here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many Thanks for your understandment and I will be looking forward to be hearing from you soon with the result.</p>

<p>Was soll ich jetzt machen,? Mir ist gar nicht klar was ich gemacht haben soll !</p>

<p>Checke deine E-Mails ab.Microsoft schickt dort nämlich mehr Details wieso deine Konsole gesperrt wurde und für wie lange.</p>
<p>Ohne Grund passiert sowas nicht,überlege deshalb genau was du schreibst.</p>
<p>Falls diene E-Mail Adresse nicht mehr existiert dann schreibe das Enforcemen-Team an(nur english).</p>
