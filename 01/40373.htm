<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried to change the default program that opens it back to the java.exe and even changing all .jar files to java, but now every .jar file I have opens with CMD and to run it I have to right click and click open with Java, and that is very annoying. I've
 tried right clicking and pressing choose default program and chaning &nbsp;to java but nothing seems to happen! I don't know what to do can some one help me!</p>

            Hi, GabrielBaciu
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try entering Safe Mode to repair
<br />
<br />Turn off your computer; then, turn it on. 
<br />As soon as you see the Windows logo with the spinning dots, press and hold the power button until your computer turns off. Do this process twice.
<br />.-Turn on your computer for the third time, and let it load.
<br />.-You should get this message: Preparing Automatic Repair.
<br />.-On the next screen that would appear, click on Advanced Options.
<br />.-Select Troubleshoot.
<br />.-Go to Advanced Options.
<br />.-Click on Startup Repair.
<br />.-Wait for the repair to finish.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

            Hi Gabriel.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Any data that's not backed up is valued at zero because a hard drive can die at any time.  At the end of these recovery steps I'll give you easy practical options for backup:
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start or function: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  The bootable media is also the only method that doesn't require the password if you're stuck on that.
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1903 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />BACKUP INTRO -
<br />
<br />Your files should always be backed up because a hard drive can die at any time without notice.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can sync your Desktop, Documents and Pictures folder in Onedrive using Folder protection, or just drag valuable files into OneDrive folder, offering 5gb free with additional space for cheap: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn-off-folder-protection-onedrive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn...</a>
<br />
<br />Google Drive has a new Backup that allows you to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud in real time so it always has the latest version.  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/download/backup-and-sync/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/dow...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can manually drag or copy them to another hard drive, USB external or flash drive.  Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>   You can even use the Macrium program to mount and extract files from this image so it can serve as both image and file backup too.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Gabriel
<br />
<br />To prevent data loss, your best option may be to roll back that update and wait a while before installing it again, in the meantime, any bugs in that update will have been resolved . . 
<br />
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows

    <title>Webcam&#40;s&#41; not working with Acer 4820tg. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Webcam&#40;s&#41; not working with Acer 4820tg.</h2>
                    I've spent almost 2 weeks trying to rectify an issue with my Acer laptop. I'm completely unable to get a picture from the built-in webcam in any webcam software. I've tried maybe 10 different programs and each tells me that the webcam cannot be used as
 it is in use with 'another program' or words to that effect.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've uninstalled the Acer Crystal Eye webcam software and drivers and re-installed numerous iterations of it to absolutely no avail. When attempting to open the Crystal Eye software, it merely says 'Camera no found (sic)' and that's it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I finally gave up on the built in webcam as I've noticed that many people are having issues with Acer cameras, and went out and got a reasonably cheap Kodak camera. Upon plugging it in, its the same problem all over again - each program (such as Skype
 and the provided Kodak software) say that the webcam is not found, despite windows recognising it and saying it has been installed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I think ultimately the problem is there is a conflict between one of the programs which is preventing the others connecting to it. I've deleted literally all webcam software and tried installing just Skype but the problem persists.</div>
<div><br />
Any help would be much appreciated.</div>
                </div>

<h2>            HP built in Webcam driver for pavilion dv6899ee</h2>
                    
<p>hi this problem happened to me since i formated my original OEM&nbsp;windows vista home premium&nbsp;and installed windows vista Ultimate Sp1 then upgraded to windows 7 Ultimate</p>
<p>my built-in HP WEBCAM never worked again</p>
<p>i tried to check the official&nbsp;HP support ( 234 times spaciflly ) tried all their methods with no luck</p>
<p>there is no webcam driver for my above version of HP pavilion listed in the driver page</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hp support said there is no standallone driver for your webcam in our database because your webcam version should work once you download and install HP Quick Launch Driver and Media Center but i tried this with no luck</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then someone told me maybe your Webcam Original Software manufacture ( the company who sold their webcam destribution rights&nbsp;to HP before they decide to&nbsp;shut down or something&nbsp;can provide you with the driver compatible with your OS</p>
<p>my question is ( since my webcam is listed under USB 2.0 camera )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>can microsoft ppl provide me with a software or a tool to detect my hp manufacture and maybe try to search for similar number matched mine ?</p>
<p>i mean is it possible to determine which manufacture did hp bought their lousy webcam driver from</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>because i know HP can not be reliable to help me in this problem</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my webcam is not working since 2008</p>
<p>i checked the internal cables nothing is wrong so the problem is not in the hardware itself but only in the software because my device manager is listing it under the name USB 2.0 camera</p>

<p>&nbsp;if someone still has the original dv6899ee&nbsp;OEM windows&nbsp;vista home premium&nbsp;webcam driver or even the whole&nbsp;Backup DVD for the dv6899ee laptop</p>
<p>&nbsp;please do split it into whatever parts you feel compfortable uploading and upload it to me in any file sharing site ie. hotfile,fileserve,megashares etc and provide me the links in Private msg since microsoft does not allow it in here :(</p>

<p>hi this problem happened to me since i formated my original OEM&nbsp;windows vista home premium&nbsp;and installed windows vista Ultimate Sp1 then upgraded to windows 7 Ultimate</p>
<p>my built-in HP WEBCAM never worked again</p>
<p>i tried to check the official&nbsp;HP support ( 234 times spaciflly ) tried all their methods with no luck</p>
<p>there is no webcam driver for my above version of HP pavilion listed in the driver page</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hp support said there is no standallone driver for your webcam in our database because your webcam version should work once you download and install HP Quick Launch Driver and Media Center but i tried this with no luck</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then someone told me maybe your Webcam Original Software manufacture ( the company who sold their webcam destribution rights&nbsp;to HP before they decide to&nbsp;shut down or something&nbsp;can provide you with the driver compatible with your OS</p>
<p>my question is ( since my webcam is listed under USB 2.0 camera )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>can microsoft ppl provide me with a software or a tool to detect my hp manufacture and maybe try to search for similar number matched mine ?</p>

<p>Hmmmm,,,,,,,, my reply went away and didn't post?? &nbsp;Anyways, I did report them but it seems like that doesn't do much and to be honest, I pay good money for my xbox live membership as well as 2 additional ones for my kids, if it was free I'd expect this
 kinda garbage but as a paid service I expect a little more from microsoft. Thanks for the helpful post tho- &nbsp;;)</p>

<p>the sad thing is that they managed to get a god mode working :l and thats something that aint so easily achieved (i used to create hacks for PC F2P games so i should know) fun fact however is there were RARELY a paid or unpaid hack for F2P games that had
 godmode and if it was it was patched in a day or 2 isnt it kind of sad a company like activision wont do that?</p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with this question. As previously stated by our Ambassador, its possible that you're being asked to pair your second controller each time you turn on the Xbox if you've previously had it paired with another device, like a
 PC. In my own experience, since I share my console with those in my household, my controller is not the primarily used one and so, I too, need to sync my controller to my Xbox when it is not the first controller used that time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still feel that this is unusual, you can try troubleshooting the issue by checking to see if your controller or controllers require an update. Sometimes controllers can act a bit strange if not up to date.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/update-controller-for-stereo-headset-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update
 your Xbox One Controller</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this information helps out!</p>

 The first one took.&nbsp; The second one got the response ‚Äúerror message 0x80004005, and Windows Media Player still does not work.&nbsp; I first encountered the problem when trying to open a file that came on an email.&nbsp; I cannot open any file requiring Windows Media

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Be sure to check with the AMD/ATI support &amp;&nbsp;forums as you are probably not alone with the
<br />
issue. Also check with the Game makers' Support and Forums as these could be known issues.<br />
<br />

<strong>Re-install the drivers for your video - do not use the scan for drivers on this - update
<br />
them manually using the methods below. Be sure and get the Catalyst Versions.</strong><br />
<br />
ATI Drivers<br />
<a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx</span></a><br />
<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (use this for Video Drivers)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.
<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,
<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate
<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -
<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after
<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually
<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers
<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as
<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check <br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be
<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then
<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t let me log in at startup and it has been running fine for over a year before</h2>
                    <p>This all started after a Windows update. First I couldn't get the computer to power down, so I did it the hard way with the power button. Then the problems began when I tried booting up again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I log in with my PIN, it first says "Preparing Windows..." which it never did before. Then it says "We can't sign into your account. This problem can be often fixed by signing out of your account and signing back in."</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's puzzling right there, because I haven't signed <em>in </em>yet. I signed out of other computers I'm on and tried again. No luck.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched the site here and tried the fixes like changing the internet SSL options but again, no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also went to troubleshooter, reinstalled recent updates, and when it finished, it said it fixed a lot of things. Same result - Can't sign in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to get this computer going because I need the files that were on it. The backup failed so this is rather important.

            <p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the user that you're trying to access a local account or associated to a Microsoft Account? If it's associated to a Microsoft Account, we suggest that you enter the Microsoft Account password instead of the pin.<br />
<br />
For the mean time, we suggest to start your PC in safe mode and try to sign in from there. For steps on how to start your PC in safe mode, click
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>Thanks, Patricia. I forgot to mention that it is associated with a Microsoft account. I had already tried the password - no luck then or now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did follow your advice on starting in safe mode and trying to log in from there. No luck again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I might mention that has been odd from when I upgraded from Win 7 to 10. In Win 7, the computer had a name: Perfect. Once I moved to Win 10, I had to use my MS account and pass word (later changed to a PIN) to set up a profile.&nbsp; When I would boot
 up sometimes a "Perfect" ID would show up and it would never accept the PIN, then offer me the choice of logging in with that "Perfect" profile or my MS profile. I would always pick up the MS profile, log in, and work away. Minor inconvenience but when I would
 go to my Windows user controls to get rid of the "Perfect" profile, it would never show up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never seemed to make a difference in logging in - and I still get the two choices, with neither one getting things going - but I mention it because this is a log in problem, and that was non-standard to begin with.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards.</p>

            To further isolate the concern, have you tried signing into your Microsoft Account on a different device? Try to do so and check if the issue persists. If it does, let us know if you receive any error messages.

            I think your facing problem with MS account . Better to sign-in MS account via other devices , You might have chances to solve your issue&nbsp;

            <p>No, this is not the answer... I have logged into at least five other devices - laptop, two phones and two desktops - with my Microsoft account. And I have no problem with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember - this was working fine with Win 10 for nearly a year and a half. It's not like this is a conversion issue. The only conversion issue was that the Win 7 identity "Perfect" did not carry over to the Win 10 update. I've never been able to log in as
 "Perfect" even with my old ID. But when I tried to log in with my MS account, it's always worked fine. Until now. I can't log in under either ID.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what the update did, but I think it may have something to do with that. I did try running updates again, but it didn't help.</p>

            <p>We suggest that you perform a reset on your Windows 10 machine. When you reset your PC, you have the option to keep your files or remove them. For steps on how to perform a reset, see the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On the sign in screen, click on the <strong>power </strong>button, press and hold on the
<strong>Shift </strong>key, and then click on <strong>Restart</strong>.</li><li>After the restart, select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Reset this PC</strong> and choose to <strong>keep your files</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>I really thought this was going to work, but it didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went through the reset - last time I noticed, it had gotten to the 50% mark - then sometime after that, the message came back to the effect "Something went wrong and the reset could not be completed. No changes were made."</p>

<h2>            .NET Framework Error, have tried everything...</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So on this Alienware laptop anytime I try to connect to the internet I keep getting this .NET Framework message. I've read the other posts about this same question, but it's not helping. I ran Webroot and a microsoft 1-time antivirus cleaner and
 neither found anything. Ran the sfc /cleannow command 3 times, first one wasn't good, but by the 3rd time everything was repaired successfully and there were no corrupted files. Tried uninstalling and repairing the .Net framework under control panel and neither
 do anything, just ended up reinstalling it. Installed every update available. And finally, booted on safe mode, with the same error... I'm thinking of just a clean install, but I'd like to know what is the problem, it's killing me. Thanks for any help in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message reads as follow:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unhandled exception has occurred in your application. If you click Continue, the application will ignore this error and attempt to continue. &nbsp;If you click Quit, the application will close immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A non-recoverable error occurred during a database</p>
<p>
</p><p>(then in the details portion this is what comes up, it's mostly all gibberish to me...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>See the end of this message for details on invoking&nbsp;<br />

************** JIT Debugging **************<br />
To enable just-in-time (JIT) debugging, the .config file for this<br />
application or computer (machine.config) must have the<br />
jitDebugging value set in the system.windows.forms section.<br />
The application must also be compiled with debugging<br />
enabled.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
&lt;configuration&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;system.windows.forms jitDebugging="true" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/configuration&gt;<br />
<br />
When JIT debugging is enabled, any unhandled exception<br />
will be sent to the JIT debugger registered on the computer<br />
rather than be handled by this dialog box.<br />

            Hello,
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for providing a detailed information on your issue. I appreciate the step-by-step troubleshooting and the pains you took to resolve your issue. However, there are a few more steps that we can try to diagnose the root cause of your issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem may occur if the temporary folder of windows update has been corrupted. We can refer to the following steps to rename this folder.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Open a <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows-vista/open-a-command-prompt-window" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">command prompt
</span></a></strong>and type: net stop wuauserv&nbsp; </li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click Start, click Run, type:&nbsp; %windir% and press Enter. </li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the opened folder, rename the SoftwareDistribution folder to SoftwareDistribution.old.
</li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Open a <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows-vista/open-a-command-prompt-window" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">command prompt
</span></a></strong>and type: net start wuauserv&nbsp; </li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Try to install .NET Framework again.</li></ol>
<p>If .NET Framework 4.0 can‚Äôt be installed, please attempt to uninstall .NET Framework 3.5 first and then reinstall the .NET Framework.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also please try reset Windows Update components manually, please refer to the link below:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058/en-us</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If issue persists, I &nbsp;would suggest you to perform clean boot and disable security software temporarily and then try to install
</span><strong>Microsoft .net framework 4</strong><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Perform</strong><span> <strong>Clean Boot</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong><span>: Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Disable anti-virus</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software"><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:&nbsp;<em>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have
 to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
<p>After performing both steps try to install <strong>Microsoft .net framework 4 </strong>
again and see if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are getting this error "0x80070643" then you might follow the steps provided in the following article.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">.NET Framework update installation error: "0x80070643" or "0x643"</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this would help. <span>If issue still persists post </span>back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Disable ctrl &#43; mouse scroll zoom feature in Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to disable ctrl + mouse scroll zoom feature in Windows 10 Pro? It serves me no good but quite annoying when it occurs unwantedly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has MS hardcoded this feature into windows in a way that is not possible to turn it off all together for good?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is a desktop with Windows 10 Pro 64bit installed. This behaviour happens in some programs but not in all: Windows Explorer, other Internet browsers, some MS application such as Wordpad and Paint 3D. It does not happen in some others application
 such as Weather, Calculator, Adobe Photoshop, etc..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I am having the same problem, Ramin, and I don't know how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I wanted to add, it is worse than you think: the reason this bug occurs (among possibly others) is that, "hilariously", the way MS has implemented the scroll-zoom functionality is that,<strong> if the window is scrolling</strong> (including purely out
 of momentum), <em>subsequently </em>hitting CTRL <strong>switches </strong>the functionality from scroll to zoom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course this is a nonsense implementation: the proper behavior is that CTRL should have to be depressed
<em>when the scroll action is initiated</em>, because only then can the OS know the user is intentionally initiating a zoom action, not a scroll action, that happens to coincide with "CTRL" being depressed later, for another command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on, MS!</p>

<p>I have Windows 10.</p>
<p>I go to Settings, Personalization, Screen Saver Settings</p>
<p>When I use the drop down menu I found where I can select "photos" and then find my photos - so I figured that out</p>
<p>Now, when my photos scroll on the screen when the screen saver is activated, after a couple minutes it suddenly goes black (the screen saver disappears)...not sure how to make the screen saver remain active indefinately.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these 4 methods which could help you solve your Windows 8.1 connectivity issues. The majority of them seem to be driver based, but some issues are solved by simply disabling all connections and re-enabling them. Whatever your issue is, it is our sincere
 hope that any one of these methods has helped resolve it.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method #1: Disable ‚ÄòSelective Suspend‚Äô</strong></p>
<p><em>Selective suspend</em> is a way of saving power. If a hardware device is left idling for long enough, the computer automatically reduces the power sent to that device which results in the device essentially ‚Äòhibernating‚Äô. Disabling this option allows
 full power to be sent to the device at all times, but remember that it can negatively affect your battery life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem you may be experiencing in Windows 8.1 is that the drivers are failing to execute the command that wakes your Wi-Fi receiver from selective suspension, thereby causing limited connectivity issues. Disabling it should therefore provide you with
 a much more stable connection.</p>
<p>How to disable selective suspend on your Windows 8</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1. Swipe from the right edge of the screen to bring up Windows 8.1 Charms<br />
Step 2. Select ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô<br />
Step 3. Select ‚ÄòControl Panel‚Äô<br />
Step 4. Select ‚ÄòHardware and Sound‚Äô<br />
Step 5. Select ‚ÄòPower Options‚Äô<br />
Step 6. On your selected power plans, select ‚ÄòChange Plan Settings‚Äô<br />
Step 7. Select ‚ÄòAdvanced Power Settings‚Äô<br />
Step 8. Expand ‚ÄòUSB settings‚Äô<br />
Step 9. Expand ‚ÄòUSB selective suspend setting‚Äô<br />
Step 10. Disable selective suspend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That should help. You may also want to tweak your wireless router settings to use a single channel too as other devices have had Wi-Fi issues resolved through this simple method (In other words, turn off Wireless ‚ÄòN‚Äô on your router). Unfortunately you‚Äôll
 need to contact the router manufacturer or consult the router user manual to find out how you do this as it varies from one router to the next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method #2: Driver re-installation.</strong></p>
<p>Another way around the issue of poor or limited Wi-Fi connectivity is to simply uninstall the new drivers that come with Windows 8.1 and reinstall the old drivers you once had before the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to Re-install old drivers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: Download the old Surface Pro driver from here and save file to desktop.<br />
Step 2. Bring up Charms by swiping from the right edge of the screen<br />
Step 3. Select the ‚ÄòSettings Charm‚Äô<br />
Step 4. Select ‚ÄòControl Panel‚Äô<br />
Step 5. Select ‚ÄòHardware and Sound‚Äô<br />
Step 6. Under ‚ÄòDevices and Printers‚Äô, select ‚ÄòDevice Manager‚Äô.<br />
Step 7. Expand ‚ÄòNetwork adapters‚Äô and right click where it says ‚ÄòMarvell AVASTAR Wireless-N Network Controller‚Äô<br />
Step 8. Select ‚ÄòUninstall driver‚Äô and reboot.<br />
Step 9. Go back into device manager and you‚Äôll see the wireless adapter being listed as a ‚Äòproblematic device‚Äô with a yellow exclamation mark on it.<br />
Step 10. Select the problematic device and then select ‚Äòaction‚Äô from the device manager menu bar. Choose ‚ÄòAdd Legacy Hardware‚Äô from the dropdown menu.<br />
Step 11. The ‚ÄòAdd Hardware Wizard‚Äô will take you through the steps and it will ask you how you want to install the driver. It usually says ‚ÄòHow do you want to search for driver software‚Äô. Select ‚ÄòBrowse my computer for driver software‚Äô. Navigate to your desktop
 and select the driver you downloaded and installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method #3 ‚Äì Re-enabling your wireless adapter.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue being witnessed is that during the installation of Windows 8.1, the network adapter is being somehow disabled and not being re-enabled. This could well be linked to selective suspend, but re-enabling it is easy enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to re-enable the network adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1. Bring up Windows 8.1 charms by swiping from the right edge of your screen.<br />
Step 2. Select ‚ÄòControl Panel‚Äô<br />
Step 3. Select ‚ÄòNetwork and Internet‚Äô<br />
Step 4. Select ‚ÄòNetwork and Sharing Center‚Äô<br />
Step 5. Select ‚ÄòChange adapter settings‚Äô<br />
Step 6. Double tap on your Wi-Fi connection and select ‚ÄòEnable‚Äô.</p>
<p>If this does not work, you‚Äôll probably need to uninstall and re-install the drivers as highlighted in
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method #4 ‚Äì Flight Mode</strong></p>
<p>This issue is not affecting every single Surface Pro user so sometimes, your limited connectivity can be fixed by simply disabling all connections and re-enabling them again. You do this by putting your device in ‚Äòflight mode‚Äô and disabling flight mode once
 again to see if that helps. As simple as it is, it could solve the issue you have and get you back online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1 ‚Äì Bring up Windows 8.1 Charms<br />
Step 2 ‚Äì Select ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô<br />
Step 3 ‚Äì At the bottom you‚Äôll see signal bars for your wireless connections. Select those.<br />
Step 4 ‚Äì This will bring up your wireless networks menu showing other networks your Surface can detect. Sweep the flight mode bar to the right to activate it.<br />
Step 5 ‚Äì Wait 30 seconds and disable flight mode by swiping in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.</p>

 rotate the display but this is a new issue. I haven;t been able to find any information online.

<p>OMG - I am such an idiot! This is my dear sister-in-law's laptop and I was trying to help her over the phone. I ended going to her house and the problem wasn't a problem - she had somehow managed to zoom her browser window to 10% and so the only thing squished
 were web pages, everything else was fine. I showed how to use the zoom capability in Edge and everything was fine. I am so sorry to have bothered anyone with this. She made it sound like her entire display had shrunk down and I was totally baffled. Once I
 saw her laptop, I knew instantly what had happened. Duh!</p>

<h2>            Low Disk Space - How to free up hard drive space on your Laptop or PC</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Intermediate
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br /><p><span><strong>How do I free up disk space on my laptop. My hard drive is nearly out of free space. I keep getting a low disk space warning. This Wiki article is just the ticket for those of you who love your Windows XP computer or anyone who wants to free
 up space on their hard drive.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It‚Äôs still not uncommon to find XP based computers that have a 128GB or smaller hard drive installed, I‚Äôll show you a number of things do to help reclaim some of that lost disk space. Even users with a larger hard drive can benefit by reducing your
 Anti-Virus scan times.</span></p>
<br /><b>Details</b><br /><p><strong><span><span>Backup your Windows XP disk drive:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Before you start it is strongly recommended that you create an Image Backup of your Windows disk drive. You can use the backup to recover files you unintentionally deleted or even the entire Windows XP operating system should anything go wrong.
 You will need an external USB hard disk drive (Typical sizes run from 500GB to 1TB, my preference is a model that has an external AC power supply, which are harder to find but less chance of overloading your USB ports power capability).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>If you are not already using Image Backup software, there are a number of software vendors; I‚Äôve listed 4 well-known companies:</span></span></strong></p>

Description of the Disk Cleanup Tool in Windows XP: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310312</a></p>
<p>Note: Always start out by choosing the less aggressive options.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Next take a look at CCleaner: </strong></span><span><a href="http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Use this tool to remove Internet history info, cookies (see more about cookies below), temp files, auto complete and other junk. There are four options located on CCleaner‚Äôs left side of the user interface, the only one you will be using the ‚ÄòCleaner‚Äô
 option. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><strong>Warning:</strong></span><span> Refrain from using the ‚ÄòRegistry‚Äô tab as cleaning the Windows registry will not gain you any disk space and could result in creating more problems that it fixes. Remember don‚Äôt say I didn‚Äôt
 warn you!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Notes:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>1) When CCleaner is first installed most if not all the options are checked which is far too aggressive. So I recommend unchecking all the items listed in ‚ÄòApplications‚Äô tab with the exception of Firefox or Google Chrome (if you installed either or
 both of these browsers). In the 'Windows' tab selectively place a check mark for only those options that are of some value in increasing the amount of free space on your PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As an example I only place check marks in the following boxes:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Windows Tab:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>Internet Explorer - Temporary Internet Files and Cookies</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>System - Empty Recycle Bin, Temporary Files, Memory Dumps (should normally be no dump files unless your PC crashes a lot, in which case you have other problems to worry about) and Windows Log Files.</span></span></p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2d0ea666-feea-4e47-98df-72a8bddd1768" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong>Applications Tab:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>FireFox and or Chrome - Internet Cache, Internet History. Cookies, Download History,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>Internet - Sun Java.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>Multimedia - Adobe Flash Player.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ecacb726-4eca-43a4-bc21-ab9937ae8848" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2) <strong>DO NOT</strong> use the Registry Cleaner option, may cause potential problems.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3) The 'Analyze' button allows you preview (without actually deleting) where and how much hard drive space you will get back. After clicking on the ‚ÄòAnalyze‚Äô button CCleaner will display a categorized list of files to be deleted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bdf723e3-ce6f-4c65-84f9-14addacd669b" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You will note that after I installed Firefox and browsed various sits on the Internet for only a couple of hours Firefox has stored a lot of files. Imagine how much space could be used if you used Firefox daily over a period of months or years.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Cookies:</strong> </span></p>
<p><span>You would be surprised to see how much space is taken up by cookie files. A cookie file is only 1KB in size but each cookie uses one cluster on your hard disk, so if you have a default cluster size of 4KB then one cookie actually uses 4KB (4096 Bytes)
 on your hard disk. I recently replaced one of my computers and after only 4 months of use, almost 10MB of disk space was gobbled up. Cookies are stored on a user by user account basis so if you have more than one user account on your computer the space consumed
 by cookies can add up quickly. Cookies are located here: C:\Documents and Settings\UserAccountName\Cookies</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note: </strong>If you visit web sites that automatically recognizes you, then deleting the files in the cookie folder will require that you once again log on to that web site in order for the site to store a new cookie on your PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>My Documents Folder:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>(Named ‚ÄòDocuments‚Äô for Vista and Windows 7 users)</span></p>
<p><span>You would be surprised just how much stuff accumulates in this folder over time. The PC I use for every day to write articles, tips and to store other notes now has over 3.5GB of files located here. Just how much you really need and how much is older
 less often accessed information obviously will vary from user to user but I‚Äôll bet you could easily archive about 50% of these files to a DVD or external USB drive and free up 1.5GB of space or more, especially if there is more than one person who has an account
 on your PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>My Pictures Folder:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Potentially another space waster, I even surprised myself as I had more than 30GB of pictures, mostly in .jpg and .png file formats. If you like to save pictures from various web sites, vacations, selfies, Etc. that for one reason or another appeal
 to you it‚Äôs time to take a look at what is really of any value and what can be archived (stored on CD /DVD media) or deleted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>My Music:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Plug in headphones and listen to music while you are typing away. Nothing wrong with that, just take a look at what you really like to listen to and those that you listened to once and never again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note: </strong>As a reminder, each active account has its own My Documents, My Pictures and My Music folder. So review each users account (with their permission) for additional space savings.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>System Restore Points:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>You can also free up more disk space by reducing the number of 'System Restore' points:</span></p>
<p><span>Select Start/Control Panel/System, then in the System Properties window click on the System Restore tab.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Next select the drive letter where Windows is installed (usually C:).</span></p>
<p><span>Then click on the ‚ÄòSettings‚Ä¶‚Äô button.</span></p>
<p><span>Now in the Drive Settings window move the Disk space usage slider to the left to reduce the amount of drive space System Restore points will use.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What is a reasonable % to allocate, the default setting of 12% (of available disk space) or about 18GB on my 160GB hard drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65d54d8a-8be1-4bd9-8c4d-4debe455c659" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Reducing the ‚ÄòDisk space to use‚Äô down to 5% will free up about 10GB of space. It‚Äôs generally assumed that restore points more than a two weeks old are of little or no value. If that space you currently have allocated is set to the default value of
 12% reducing the size to about 5% will not only free up about 10GB of drive space but it will also remove a large number of the older restore points that are wasting space.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong>Hibernation:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If you don‚Äôt use this feature very often or not at all, then check to see if it has been disabled, as a hibernation file size is about the same size as the amount of ram/memory installed in your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>How to disable Hibernation and delete hiberfil.sys file (If you have it enabled):</strong></span></p>
<p><span>1) Open the Control Panel as follows: Click Start / Control Panel / double click on ‚ÄòPower Options‚Äô / click on the ‚ÄòHibernate‚Äô tab.</span></p>
<p><span>2) Remove the check mark from the 'Enable hibernation' box, and then click Apply.</span></p>
<p><span>3) In most cases the hibernation file (hiberfil.sys) is automatically deleted, if not then restart your computer and hiberfil.sys should be deleted.</span></p>
<p><span>4) If you change your mind in the future, you can always enable hibernation, simply go back to the Hibernate tab as described in step #2 and check the box 'Enable hibernation'.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong>Reduce the size of the Internet Explorer Disk Cache:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>1) Open Internet Explorer and click on the ‚ÄòTools‚Äô option in the Menu bar.</span></p>
<p><span>2) At the bottom of the drop down list select ‚ÄòInternet Options‚Äô.</span></p>
<p><span>3) In the ‚ÄòGeneral‚Äô tab, click on the Browser history ‚ÄòSettings‚Äô button.</span></p>
<p><span>4) In the ‚ÄòTemporary Internet Files and History Settings‚Äô box decrease the amount of space down to at least the ‚ÄòRecommended‚Äô amount. Then click the ‚ÄòOK‚Äô button.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: If you want to see how many files have accumulated over time, click on the ‚ÄòView files‚Äô button.</span></p>
<p><span>5) Click ‚ÄòOK‚Äô to close the Internet Options window and save your changes.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Each user account has their own storage space, so review each users account (with their permission) for additional space savings.</span></p>

</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong>Windows XP Service Pack 3:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If you have installed Windows XP Service Pack 3, look for an odd folder name which is located here</span></p>
<p><span>C:\WINDOWS\SoftwareDistribution\Download\cf8ec753e88561d..........\</span></p>
<p><span>Note: the apparent random set of letters and numbers may vary from my example, and there may be a large number of these folders, but whatever the name is, it will be more than 600MB in size and can be safely deleted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong>C:\WINDOWS\SoftwareDistribution\Download folder:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may see a number of folders or files located in here in addition to the SP3 folder mentioned above. Windows Update uses this folder so after you have installed all the updates currently available (including the final set of updates released
 on April 8</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span>, 2014) from Microsoft the files and sub-folders contained in the download folder can be deleted (Note: do not delete the ‚ÄòDownload‚Äô folder, just the contents in this folder). Keep an eye on this folder as it
 can grow in size very quickly depending how you use your computer. It‚Äôs not uncommon to see anywhere from 200MB on up to 3 or 4GB of files located here. For example using a Windows XP SP3 CD to do a fresh (Clean Install) of Windows XP and just downloading
 and installing all the Windows Updates available since SP3 was released resulted in more than 500MB of folders and files.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce320ab4-36f1-401b-a838-d84ef651d0d2" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong>Deleting the $NtUninstallKBxxxxxx$ folders:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Remove the files used to uninstall updates to Windows. These folders and associated files in these folders are safe to remove, however once deleted you will no longer be able to un-install a patch or update that was associated with the deleted folder/files.
 I would keep the most recent set of folders (last 3 months just in case you need to un-install a recent update) and just delete the older updates.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have run Windows Update on a regular basis or the updates were automatically downloaded and installed, then any of these folders dated May of 2014 or later are most likely Microsoft Office updates as the last set of updates for the Windows XP
 operating system were released in April of 2014 which was </span><strong><span><span>Windows XP‚Äôs end of service life.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As a safety net I burned all these folders to a CD before deleting them, just copy back what you need if you plan to uninstall an update. Use the KB number which is part of the folder name to identify what the update is.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>These files are located in the C:\Windows folder and have folder names like $NtUninstallKBXXXXXX$.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>They are hidden folders so enable viewing of hidden files (Tools / Folder Options / View tab) in Windows Explorer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03acb7b9-cfa3-45f8-8774-bb1303ac6d20" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In Windows Explorer click on the ‚ÄòName‚Äô column to sort the folders and files which will group all the $NUninstallKBXXXXXX$ folders together.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">Warning:</span></strong> One folder you should not delete is:
<strong>$hf_mig$</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fb96f223-065f-40f9-a7fc-e41d1d34731a" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22a282ec-a1d6-4963-ac53-3ec37ecc5a8f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Click on the first $NUninstallKBXXXXXX$ folder which is located at the top of the list, scroll down to the last folder in the list, press and hold the ‚ÄòShift‚Äô key down&nbsp;then click on the last folder in the list. Now right click and select the ‚ÄòDelete‚Äô
 option, click ‚ÄòYes‚Äô to confirm that you want to delete these folders.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>How much drive space do I really get back by deleting the $NtUninstallKBxxxxxx$ folders:</strong>
</span></p>
<p><span>About 1.2GigaBytes and if you include the updates that have been installed since April of 2007 but before installing Service Pack 3 you could save as much or more then 2GB. The exact amount of space reclaimed will vary from PC to PC depending on what
 applications are installed on your PC. For example, if you have one or more MS Office versions (2002, 2003, 2007 or 2010) installed, the number and size of the updates that have been installed on your PC will increase.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Finally:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1) As a reminder the sale of Windows XP licenses to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs, HP, Dell, Etc.) stopped on June 30th, 2008. That means your XP computer‚Äôs hard disk drive is more than 6 years old and more likely at least 7 or 8 years
 old. If you have not replaced the hard drive that originally came with your computer that drive is by now it is nearing the end of its life expectancy. Should your drive fail, after you replace the failed drive with a new drive, your only means of recovering
 XP and all your applications, data files (Document, Music, Photos, Etc.) would be the Image Backup you created. It‚Äôs a good idea to create Image Backups on a regular basis.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>2) Windows XP end of service life was April 8</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span>, 2014. This means no more ‚ÄúWindows Updates‚Äù will be available after April 8</span><sup><span>th</span></sup><span>. However if you have a recent version of Microsoft
 Office (Office 2007 or Office 2010) installed then Office Updates will still be available.</span></span></p>

    <title>windows 7 corrupt color picker - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ellepixal  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 7 corrupt color picker</h2>
                    The white on my MS color picker is now turquoise.
<div>So all of my &nbsp;window backgrounds are turquoise and won't change with any theme.</div>
<div>If I pick another color the window background is still turquoise.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would like to update colorpicker.mx but don't know where or how or which site to trust for the download.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows defender quick scan says there is no virus. I'm running a full scan now.</div>
<div>I can't think of any malicious sites I could have been on.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I restored my computer to an earlier time when the colors were correct but didn't work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>~Ruth</div>

<p>I tried all that you suggested and it is still turquoise.</p>
<p>I can't remember if I changed anything in feb. I do know when I choose the white with the color picker just for an instant the color corrects to white then reverts back to turquoise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Acer Aspire 5551</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you. do you work with remote access?</p>
