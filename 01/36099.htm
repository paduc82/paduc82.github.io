<h2>            I still need help to figure this problem out, I have this computer for the last 5 months and Dell won&#39;t help &#33; It destroys the reference points very time I use the deframentation and disk check in window or Sevice Mechanic 9 from iolo.</h2>
                    
<p><span><br />
This is whats happening ,and I am trying to find out why? with out going threw this again, so I am using this letter to explain the situation.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't heard from you, &nbsp;and I am still having troubles with this computer. I did receive the Window 7 program, and &nbsp;it did straighten out some
 things, but I lost my DVD drive all the way. It works somewhat, but it won't play when you hit open. That is the only choice you have if you go in to My &nbsp;Computer and click on D:\ drive. It will eject on eject and on play it will eject too, and it will make
 some noises, and it will spit out Spindle test failed 0147,00f:133c, 0f00:023c, 0f00:0432, 2300:0124 error codes all day when I run 32 bit diagnostic from F12 or F8.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the site even, and updated the DVD driver , and the Bios like Dell said too on the site, but I lost my drive all together. I should of left
 it alone, but as a result &nbsp;now I can't get it to work at all. The computer won't recognize it , at least that is what it says when you get a code, but in My Computer it shows that its theirs, and I went into setup, and look at the Slave/Master drives they
 were on. I know am stump; because nothing I have done has work for this situation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As for the original problem it's still there ,but better in some respects, but still not in others. I can tell you as long as I don't use Service Mechanic 9. As far
 as their defragment, or hard drive error check it will let me back up, and make changes to the setting, but if I use Service Mechanic 9, and use their defragment, and hard drive check. It still knocks it &nbsp;out , and destroys the reference points every time.
 I have written the iolo &nbsp;company about this, but they say that it's compatible for Windows 7, and I need to check their data base, but there is nothing there on this matter. I have even talk to Microsoft on the Answer site, but no go their ideas don't work
 either. I do know though that Register Repair Pro doesn't work either. It will show all the errors ,but only fixes a small portion of the errors and that's it. I have written them multiple times , and they tell me that it's not set up for 64 bit, and as soon
 as their engineers come up with a fixes they will let me know. I just need some answers so if you please get back to me it will be great. Thank you!</span></p>

            sorry about not getting back to you sooner <br />
did you do an up date from vista to win 7?<br />
you mention 32 bit and 64 bit what system are you running?<br />
the dvd could be a driver issue <br />
type&nbsp;device manager in the search box go to view hidden are there any red x'S or yellow ? 's if there is these could sources of your problems<br />
while in device manager click dvd and uninstall the driver don't worry when you restart the driver will automatically reinstall..........<br />
<br />
<br />
next perform a clean boot:<br />
<br />
Step 1: Perform a clean boot
<strong>Note</strong> If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer
 unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.
<ol>
<li>Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights. </li><li>Click <strong>Start</strong>
<div>&nbsp;type <span>msconfig.exe</span> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<strong>Continue</strong>. </li><li>On the <strong>General</strong> tab, click <strong>Selective Startup</strong>, and then click to clear the
<strong>Load startup items</strong> check box. (The <strong>Use Original Boot.ini</strong> check box is unavailable.)
</li><li>On the <strong>Services </strong>tab, click to select the <strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>Disable all</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points.
 Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.
</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>, and then click <strong>Restart</strong>. </li></ol>
<div>after restarting go to start up tab and start by checking the first box and restarting if the computer starts and runs properly got to the next an so on then go to the services tab check the box to hide all microsoft services and do the same let me know
 if this helps good luck</div>

            <p>‚ÄãHi,<br />
<br />
<span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community!<br />
You've reached the right forum for your question. <br />
<br />
<br />
You can sort by date in Photo Gallery in Vista:<br />
a.Open Windows Photo Gallery</span></p>
<div>b. In the Navigation pane, under Date Taken, do any of the following:</div>
<div>To see all of the pictures taken within a specific year, click the year in the Navigation pane.</div>
<div>To narrow your selection down to the pictures taken within a particular month, click the year, and then click a month.</div>
<div>To narrow your selection down to pictures taken on a certain date, click the month, and then click a date.</div>
<div><br />
If you want to search in Windows Explorer. you can use the search box in the upper right hand corner of Windows Explorer.
<br />
By typing in the box you can find pictures by their name or contents. You can also search by date or by using other criteria<br />
by selecting "more". <br />
<div>You can sort by date created. It's not a column in explorer by default but you can add it.</div>
<div>a. Open explorer and open the Pictures folder you described.</div>
<div>b. Right click on one of the columns (name, date modified, etc...) and select "more..."</div>
<div>c. Click on "Date Created"</div>
<div>That should add the "Date Created" column to explorer and you can now sort that way.</div>
<div><span>Please reply with the results. I would be glad to assist you further.

            The microphone you are using is not very good for speech recognition. Very often these webcam microphones pick up by the background noise or internal noise from within the computer which distort your voice. This will make it difficult to impossible to
 use WSR, windows speech recognition. Purchase a good USB headset microphone and you'll be pleasantly surprised at how good WSR is.

    <title>Windows 8.1 cannot connect to Bluetooth and USB devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nguyenhans  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 cannot connect to Bluetooth and USB devices</h2>
                    <p>I'm using an ASUS PU500CA with Windows 8.1. My laptop was working perfectly but suddenly these annoying errors appear:</p>
<p>+ Windows cannot connect to my <strong>Sculpt Touch Mouse.</strong> I still see the mouse in the "Devices and Printers" but &nbsp;its status is not connected. I have tried to remove the mouse from the "Devices and Printer" &nbsp;but no use, the mouse is not removed,
 just the status change to removing device and then nothing happens. Occasionally, this method is useful, the mouse is remove and when I reconnect the mouse, it work perfectly , but if I restart the laptop, all go wrong again.</p>
<p>+ Windows cannot detect any<strong> USB device or SD card</strong> plugged in. The most weird thing is this happens together with the Bluetooth problem, if I solve the Bluetooth problems by the method above, it can detect the USB devices normally. This happens
 only with the USB ports and SD card slot, the audio port still works well.</p>
<p>+ <strong>The Control panel</strong> is often freeze, especially the "Device manager" and the "Devices and Printer". When I tried to reinstall the bluetooth drivers from the "Device manager" or remove the device from "Devices and Printers", it often freezes,
 I can neither cancel the process I have opened nor close the control panel unless I use the Task manager or restart the system. It seems like the system is preventing me from solving the problems. The same thing happens when I use the Troubleshooting Hardwares
 and Devices, sometime it returns No problems, sometime it runs forever and sometime I can open it.</p>
<p>+ The last problem is I cannot turn off the laptop. When I hit "Shut down" or "Restart", the shut down screen appears and the dots in the centers circle. After a few minute, the BSOD appears with "Power state failure". Most time, I have to press the power
 button some seconds to completely turn the system off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything I found on the Internet but all are useless. I have even reset Windows 8.1 but these errors appear after a few days. I guess it may be because of some recently update or conflict of drivers but I can't tell exactly which one causes
 this.</p>

            <p>Hi Nguyen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>These issues might occur due to corrupt or incompatible chipset driver installed on the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any error message/code (or an exclamation mark for the device icon) for the device driver under Device Manager?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that Asus has released latest driver updates for Bluetooth and BIOS. Download and install the latest Bluetooth driver and the BIOS update from the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asus.com/Commercial_Notebook/ASUSPRO_ESSENTIAL_PU500CA/#support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.asus.com/Commercial_Notebook/ASUSPRO_ESSENTIAL_PU500CA/#support</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have to click on<strong> Driver and tool </strong>option on the webpage and then choose
<strong>Windows 8.1</strong> from the drop down menu. </p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Modifying BIOS (Basic input output system)/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any
 problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, check if the changing the power saving setting under Power Management for the Bluetooth Adapter fixes the issue. Follow the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows+X</strong> keys and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Locate the <strong>Bluetooth adapter</strong> and expand the driver icon.</li><li>Right Click on the Bluetooth driver and click on <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Navigate <strong>to Power Management</strong> tab and uncheck the option that says ‚Äú<strong>Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power</strong>‚Äù.</li><li>Click on <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>Check if that fixes the issue with the Bluetooth device. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For further reference, you can download and install the latest available chipset driver (available for Windows 8) from the
<a href="http://www.asus.com/Commercial_Notebook/ASUSPRO_ESSENTIAL_PU500CA/#support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Asus website</a> in Windows 8 compatibility mode. Right Click on the setup file that you have downloaded and click on
<strong>Properties</strong>. Go to <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab and check the box that says ‚Äú<strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode for</strong>‚Äù. Choose
<strong>Windows 8</strong> from the drop down menu and click on <strong>OK</strong>. Double Click on the setup file and follow the onscreen instructions to install the chipset driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know about the status of this issue. </p>

<p>Hi Nguyen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>These issues might occur due to corrupt or incompatible chipset driver installed on the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any error message/code (or an exclamation mark for the device icon) for the device driver under Device Manager?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that Asus has released latest driver updates for Bluetooth and BIOS. Download and install the latest Bluetooth driver and the BIOS update from the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asus.com/Commercial_Notebook/ASUSPRO_ESSENTIAL_PU500CA/#support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.asus.com/Commercial_Notebook/ASUSPRO_ESSENTIAL_PU500CA/#support</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have to click on<strong> Driver and tool </strong>option on the webpage and then choose
<strong>Windows 8.1</strong> from the drop down menu. </p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: Modifying BIOS (Basic input output system)/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any
 problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, check if the changing the power saving setting under Power Management for the Bluetooth Adapter fixes the issue. Follow the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows+X</strong> keys and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Locate the <strong>Bluetooth adapter</strong> and expand the driver icon.</li><li>Right Click on the Bluetooth driver and click on <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Navigate <strong>to Power Management</strong> tab and uncheck the option that says ‚Äú<strong>Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power</strong>‚Äù.</li><li>Click on <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>Check if that fixes the issue with the Bluetooth device. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For further reference, you can download and install the latest available chipset driver (available for Windows 8) from the
<a href="http://www.asus.com/Commercial_Notebook/ASUSPRO_ESSENTIAL_PU500CA/#support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<strong>Windows 8</strong> from the drop down menu and click on <strong>OK</strong>. Double Click on the setup file and follow the onscreen instructions to install the chipset driver.

<p>Hi Pinaki Mohanty,</p>
<p>I have updated the bios and it seemed that all the problems are solved. I hope this will last long.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Size on disk&#34; and &#34;Size&#34; is considerably smaller than actual folder size in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having some size ambiguity on my windows 10. I have a folder in my C drive and when I right click on it and go to properties, it shows the Size and Size on Disk as 228MB. However, if I just keep my mouse cursor on folder, it displays some brief details,
 in which the size is 53GB. 53GB appears to be the correct size as all the subfolders add up to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a system folder and there are no hidden files in it. I am using windows 10 version 1803 (April 2018 update). Any help is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            This is a bug introduced due to 1803 upgrade where folder subtotal size is not matching with its master folder.
<br />
<br />We will have to wait for the fix from Microsoft which will sooner be coming.

            Hi kumarDB, version 1803 introduced a bug into Explorer, it has the inability to report spare space on hard drives, it has the inability to correctly calculate the correct size of a folder with sub-folders and a few other mis-calculations
<br />
<br />Microsoft say they are aware of this issue and will hopefully release a patch sooner rather than later . . .

<h3> frank__45  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Mouse &#40;LED&#41; - Middle Click Delay</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am a CAD and CAM user at work and have bought a premium Keyboard and Mouse setup from microsoft. It took a some tinkering to make the middle button work with the softwares we use (by removing intellipoint). But there is an unworkable delay when pressing the
 middle button (wheel) that renders it unusable.<br />
<br />
I have been looking over the internet and found that this a common problem to the range of MS mouse (Autocad, CAD, Adobe suite users forums, etc), though there seems to be no fix yet, most of them went back to there old mouses. The last windows update installed
 the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center 2.0 which was no help, the delay is still present and it didn't offer the lateral button to be used as Mouse button 4 &amp; 5. I removed it since it interfered with X-Mouse that I use as a temporary fix (Button 4 as middle
 click).<br />
<br />
I have tried going through the support system in french, got stuck at 90% of the process (the actual part where you send your request). The english web site gave a phone number and ended up as a phone call which indicated me to go back to the web site.<br />
<br />
What are my options? Is there any acceptable fix existing? Is Microsoft working on a solution? Can I be refunded or can the product be replaced with a similar one that does not feature such problems? Or is the only solutions is buying another mouse from a competitor?<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />

            I can reproduce this issue easily on every Wireless Mouse 5000 I've used.&nbsp;The issue does not&nbsp;have anything to do with the synchronization of the mouse. Everything functions perfectly except for the middle mouse button. My guess is the driver implements
 some kind of software debouncing for the middle button. However, it really makes the middle button unusable without any configuration.

<h2>            How can I save a full webpage as a .jpg image file&#63;</h2>
                    <div>Windows XP Pro Desktop - Windows Paint - Chrome Browser</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm trying to save a full webpage as an image so I can post it to message boards. As an alternative, saving the URL is fastest and easiest, but there's no guaranteed access at a future date. I want a permanent image I can access at any time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Screen captures work fine but I only get half the page along with my toolbar and taskbar (I just want the page contents, not my desktop). I have a third-party capture tool but it doesn't scroll the screen to capture the full page.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Using Chrome, I can use CONTROL &gt; A to select the full page, then I can right-click the highlited screen and select COPY - that's where I hit a wall. I can find no place to paste this as an image. I can paste it in Notepad as .txt, but I need the image
 - this will not do... and I cannot save this as .jpg or other image file as I'm locked into 'Website, Complete" or 'Website, HTML' as my only choices for file types. Eliminating CONTROL &gt; A from the above procedure produces the same results.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried saving to various folders (Documents, My Pictures, etc..) and get the same result. Whenever I try to open the file or folder, I find it's been broken down into about 30 individual files each being one component of the full page (Header, footer,
 etc..). I have no printer or fax so I can't utilize any screen functions related to those.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to select the full page (as an image, not text) and save it directly into MS Paint or just as a .jpg or other image file?</div>

            Hi, Tricky
<div><br />
<div>Your suggestion is what I meant by 'screen captures work fine'. Print Screen only captures the viewable portion of the screen (including the desktop), not the full webpage itself. It does a wonderful job of that, but I'd like to somehow capture the full
 webpage, saving it directly as a .jpg image or pasting it into Paint with the same results as you've outlined.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I see Google Chrome has 'Webpage &amp; WebCam Screenshot' that auto scrolls the page to capture full content. I may have to use that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I just had a dangerous thought. XP allows for screen rotation. I may play around with that as it would give me about three additional viewable inches of a webpage. After saving, I could rotate the screen back to normal and adjust the .jpg image when needed.
 That would solve my immediate problem, but many more of the webpages I browse are as long as a Buick and may prove impractical.</div>

            <p>Apologies, I hadn't appreciated that you wanted the whole of a <em>scrollable</em> web page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have heard of people using Snagit to capture web pages though I have no personal experience and therefore this post should not be taken as an endorsement in any way. It boasts capturing a scrolling window here...</p>

<div>Using only Windows XP, I have discovered how to copy a full webpage (including the hidden scrollable area). This does not save as .JPG or .PNG. This will save it as
<b>Webpage, Complete</b>, or <b>Webpage, HTML Only</b>. The irony is, I was aware of these file types earlier (see previous posts) and didn't recognize the names after saving to my Capture folder.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The only tricky part is selecting the correct area of the screen to right-select on. Right-Select on a spot that will pop up this window: (You may have to Right-Select several areas to get the correct one)&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 Repair and Re-Install....Help Please.</h2>
                    <p>Hey all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in a jam and need help. &nbsp;My laptop just suddenly stopped responding. &nbsp;Got the message that there was a problem with my hard drive and Windows was trying to repair it. &nbsp;I let it go thru its work and after a couple hours it still was unresponsive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried every repair and re-install option that Win10 has and nothing worked. &nbsp;So I am stuck now. &nbsp;I bought an SSD to install but before I do, I‚Äôd like to try and boot up with a thumb drive and see if I can repair it that way or re-install Win10 without
 losing all my stuff first and if it doesnt work, then I want to do a CLEAN install of Win10 on my new SSD and start over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need the media creation tool and a version of Win10 that is most appropriate for my situation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you all tell me what you think I should do, or your opinions of my situation? &nbsp;If you can provide me a link to download the stuff I need, I would really appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you all for your time and help.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Nalajr, you should try to repair Windows 10 first to see if your data is recoverable, if your hard drive is broken, this will not be possible and you will need to install Windows 10 on the new SSD . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />1. 
<br />Repair Windows:
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />Re-install Windows:
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>DaveM,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for your help and advice! &nbsp;I REALLY APPRECIATE IT!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried a couple of those options but only after letting Windows try and ‚Äúrepair‚Äù the disc for a coupke of hours each time. &nbsp;Neither worked. &nbsp;I have not tried to do what you suggested and was looking for a way to get to SAFE MODE to see if that woukd
 work, but never was able to find a way to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I‚Äôm going to work on your advice and try the options you suggest. &nbsp;Hopefully I can at least get it to load and let me retrieve my data that i wasnt able to back up in time. &nbsp;If not, I‚Äôll just do the next thing and load WIN10 Clean and fresh and start rebuilding
 from scratch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will report back tomorrow with the results. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Have a good weekend!!</p>

            Which version of Windows 10 is installed on the clients?
<br />Which version of Small Basic is it? I noticed the latest version is 1.2.
<br />
<br />I recommend you post this issue on the dedicated Small Basic forum on TechNet, experts there might be able to provide some answers as to what might be causing this problem:

    <title>Windows 10 Settings Won&#39;t Stay - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulenator  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Settings Won&#39;t Stay</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a computer made and set up just to run music&nbsp;&amp; music videos at my bar. The DJs use OTSAV-DJ 1.9 program to run the music &amp; vids. Also, I personally installed&nbsp;a Creative Blaster zx soundcard as well. The OTSDJ program needs a second soundcard to
 be able to "cue" or listen to a song just in the headphones separate of the audience music. This is essential.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is..... I set up all the settings for both&nbsp;soundcards, computer&nbsp;monitor and&nbsp;TV outputs, I can restart the computer several times and everything works fine.&nbsp; I shutdown the computer at night when we close&nbsp;BUT when the day-shift comes in&nbsp;the
 next&nbsp;day,&nbsp;and the computer&nbsp;is turned on, the settings have changed.&nbsp; Very frustrating!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have deleted all the apps that Windows 10 would allow me to delete. The internet to this computer has been disconnected. I read about a program in Win.10 that will automatically adjust computer settings if ....lets-say, one of the speaker outputs
 from the soundcard gets unplugged the computer will automatically compensate&nbsp;and change the settings. I don't know if this is what's happening because nothing is being unplugged or mistakenly turned off overnight. All outlets have consistent power. I appreciate
 your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

 me a yes or no option, but it will not let me choose either of them, I have to close the program thought the task administrator. Can anyone help?

            Hi Christopher.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Have you tried uninstalling from Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features?  What happens exactly?
<br />
<br />You can also try the uninstaller which may be bundled with the game in C:\Programs Files.  
<br />
<br />If that fails try reinstalling the game over itself to see if it will then properly uninstall.
<br />
<br />If that fails you can try Revo Uninstaller to see if it forces it to work.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows 10 - Sign in Email Address is Invalid</h2>
                    <p>So, trying to deal with this for a customer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He upgraded from W7 HP to W10. All working fine with a local account, no password. Then was using the Windows Store to try and install some apps, and he was prompted to sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He entered his Live ID [hisemailaddress]@<strong>live.co</strong><strong>.uk</strong>, but managed to mistype it as [hisemailaddress]@<strong>live.k</strong> instead. This seems to have set his W10 load to attempt to sign in on start to an email address
 which is invalid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You turn the laptop on, and get to the Windows 10 sign-in screen with his Username above, and then [hisemailaddress]@<strong>live.k</strong> underneath, and no matter which of his passwords you try and use to sign in, none of them work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried safe-mode, attempted to roll back to W7, but it still asks me to sign in with this account, and my google-fu seems to have failed me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts before I factory restore it?</p>

<p>How do you propose I do that? I can't log in normally because the email address is wrong. If I restart to the recovery options, the moment I try and restore, or try anything else it prompts me to log in... with the wrong email address.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 File Explorer not responding.</h2>
                    <p>I believe it started when I tried to right click my files and back them up on my hard drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows file explorer really slow and doesn't respond and I have to close it. And when closes, it looks like the taskbar crashed and start up again. Do you think I have a problem with Windows?&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<div>
<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command 3 times restarting the PC after each time to completely fix everything that it's able to.
<br />
<br />
If not, then run the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/26512-dism-fixing-component-store-corruption-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p>Restart the PC afterwards, and try the <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command again.<br />
<br />

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.
<br />
<br />
If still not, then you can use the steps in the TIP box in the <strong>OPTION THREE</strong> section&nbsp;to manually replace the files that SFC could not fix.

    <title>Update created registry problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> what available  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update created registry problems</h2>
                    After Windows 7 automatic update on 3/14/2018, I received an error message that Windows was unable to load my profile. I tried restarting the computer multiple times, once with a pause of a couple of minutes after turning it off. Eventually, I restored
 the computer to the restore point before the update. It now works again. I have turned off automatic updates to avoid a repeat of the problem, but don't want to leave updates off indefinitely.
