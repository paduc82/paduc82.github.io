<h2>            Connection status unknown - can&#39;t connect to Internet, Vista</h2>
                    Hi. My computer was working fine last night, but when I started it up today, I couldn't get online. When I hover the mouse over the network and sharing icon on the lower left side of the computer, it says, "Connection status unknown The dependency service
 or group failed to start". When I try to diagnose the problem, I can't because the Diagnostics Policy Service is not running. When I go to the Open Service Control Manager, access is denied.
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I keep getting warnings that my firewall is not enabled. When I try to enable it, I get a message that the Security Center can't turn it on.
<br />
<br />
I ran Avast and it found nothing wrong. I tried doing a system restore, but that didn't help. I tried going to "Connect to the Internet" via the Control Panel and Networking and was told that the wizard encountered an error and could not connect. I can't connect
 and I still can't enable a firewall. What should I do? Please help me.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Possibly an update caused the problem though it could have been something different.<br />
<br />
Try a System Restore back to a point before this happened. And immediately go in afterwards into<br />
Control Panel - Windows Updates - upper left Settings and set it to Download and notify you instead
<br />
of Automatic. Leave that set until you are sure all is OK and then you can add them in one at a time<br />
to troubleshoot EXCEPT right click on and HIDE all driver updates.&nbsp;If after a day or two there are no
<br />
trouble causing updates then reset the Updates to automatic.<br />

<h3> ashbutorac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Player controls flicker or remain on-screen during a TV show or movie on netflix app</h2>
                    <p>For quite a few months now I have been having an issue with my Netflix app on my Microsoft Surface Pro 3. When watching a TV show or movie, about every 10 seconds the player controls pop up on the screen and then disappears. I have uninstalled and reinstalled
 the Netflix app. I have tried watching through a browser (I have attempted on Microsoft Edge, Chrome and Torch) and checked that those settings are correct and updated. My OS is up to date. I reviewed my graphics card on Intel's website and everything is good
 there. Finally I opened a chat with Netflix and they advised I need to update my touchpad drivers.</p>
<p><span>"If the player controls or progress bar flicker or remain on-screen when you try to watch Netflix on your Windows computer, it typically indicates that your computer's touchpad drivers are out of date. Please update these drivers before trying
 Netflix again. If you need assistance completing this update, consult your device manual or computer manufacturer."<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I normally do not have my detachable keyboard attached when watching Netflix. I also checked the settings for the mouse and touchpad just in case. All settings are correct and drivers up to date.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am at a loss what to do next. It makes Netflix unwatchable on my device.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This does not happen in the Hulu or Amazon video app either, just for reference.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi Ash,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We appreciate your initiative trying to troubleshoot the problem. The control pop ups might be due to a bug or a driver issue. However, the problem shows only with a certain app so it can also be an app issue specially if it happens even when the cover is
 detached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried to perform a <strong>two-button shutdown</strong>? If not, you can do this by
<span>pressing and holding the <strong>Volume-up</strong> button and the <strong>
Power </strong>button on your Surface at the same time for 15 seconds and then release both of them. The screen may flash the Surface logo, but remember to continue holding down the buttons for 15 seconds.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, we suggest you proceed with reinstalling the Surface cover driver. Here's how:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Select the search box in the taskbar, enter <strong>device manager</strong>, and select
<strong>Device Manager</strong> in the results.</li><li>Expand <strong>Keyboards</strong>.</li><li>Right-click <strong>Surface Type Cover Filter Device</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Uninstall</strong> &gt; <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Restart your Surface. It'll automatically download and install the Surface Cover driver the next time you connect to the Internet.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Give us an update, and let us know if you have any additional concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            Hi Charles:
<br />I would additionally suggest you take a peek at your startup boot items. They can be found by evoking the MSCONFIG task.
<br />Compare what is listed there with what you see under the resource consumption monitor. Which are the heavy consumers of CPU and memory? Can they be removed from pre-fetching?

    <title>Windows Aero is disabled every time I turn on or restart my computer. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skywalker993  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Aero is disabled every time I turn on or restart my computer.</h2>
                    This started happening a few days ago. Aero was working fine, then I restarted after installing a program and Aero was disabled. I ran the troubleshooter and it fixed the problem, telling me that Windows Desktop Manager had been disabled. I turned off
 my PC and thought everything was good until I turned it on again the next day... Aero worked for about 2 seconds then&nbsp;was off again. I checked WDM in Services, and it was reportedly enabled and running without error. So I ran the Aero troubleshooter again
 and got the same message about WDM and it fixed Aero. So I restarted my PC again... Aero was off again. This time I re-installed my ATI drivers (I have Radeon HD 4870) and checked Catalyst for any conflicting settings, and restarted: Aero was off. Then I uninstalled
 the program (EASEUS Partition Manager) that I had installed just before the issue came up, restarted WDM (Aero worked),&nbsp;and restarted: Aero was off. What's going on? Some RegEdit I need to add/remove? or some property of WDM I need to change for it to work
 properly? or some start-up process I need to block?<br />
<br />
I suppose a last-ditch effort would be to do&nbsp;a System Restore, but I've modified a lot of themes and programs since Aero started screwing up and it would take hours to re-install and re-adjust my system. I don't really want to do that. Right now it's just easier
 to spend 15 seconds running the troubleshooter every time I start Windows 7.

<p><span>Hi Skywalker,
</span></p>
<p><span>Since you have already ran the Aero troubleshooter and received the message stating WDM service is not running and restarting
 the service runs aero, I would suggest you to try to perform a clean boot on your computer to check if any third party applications is causing this issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>To perform a clean boot, follow the steps below:
<br />
1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
<br />
2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
5. Click OK.<br />
6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
7. After the computer starts, check the Aero.</span></p>
<p><span>If your issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot<span>&nbsp;
</span>then follow the steps mentioned in the following KB article to narrow down the exact source:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Also, see the section on how return your computer to a Normal startup mode by following the steps under ‚ÄúReset the computer to start as usual‚Äù.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Also run online virus scan. Access the link below and scan your computer for infection and remove it.<br />

    <title>Croatian keyboard layout is missing in Win10 installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ton‰çi‰álinardi‰á  say:</h3>
<h2>            Croatian keyboard layout is missing in Win10 installation</h2>
                    <p>I made Windows 10 64bit ISO file by tool downloaded from web page&nbsp; <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/hr-hr/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/hr-hr/software-download/windows10</a>&nbsp;and started&nbsp;clean installation. The problem is that Croatian keyboard layout is missing in the list of layouts.&nbsp;There are three combobox selections, 1st for language, 2nd&nbsp;for regional settings
 and there I can find Croatia, but in 3rd for keyboard layout there is not Croatian layout.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this mistake? Because that layout was there for all previous Win versions. What should I select instead of Croatian layout?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>I have the same problem. I did it exactly like Arul_D wrote, but I still cannot find the Croatian keyboard. If I select Croatian as default language then I have Croatian keyboard by default but if I want to have English as a default display language then
 I cannot find Croatian keyboard in Keyboards dropdown menu?<br />

            Yesterday I had the same problem, but choosing standard under keyboard layouts works exactly as Croatian. Meaning I get the same layout as Croatian keyboard with that option. Still it's puzzling why it doesn't say croatian instead standard.

<p>As usual, Microsoft is discriminating. On national level this time.</p>
<p>It is gone!</p>
<p>To get the Croatian layout working go to regional settings, set Croatia sa country, and than select STANDARD keyboard layout under English language.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 N Ultimate x 64 - Windows backup error 0x81000039</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have recently set up a wireless external hard drive on my wireless network.&nbsp; All of the other computers connected to the drive wirelessly through the network don't seem to have a problem backing up (they are running on Mac OS).&nbsp; Everytime I run Windows
 7 backup to my drive on the wireless network it gets to 25% during the "copying files to ...." stage and then I get the following error message:</p>
<p>Windows backup did not complete successfully.<br />
Check your backup.<br />
Windows Backup encountered an error when accessing the remote shared folder.<br />
Details: The specified network name is no longer available.<br />
Error code: 0x81000039.</p>
<p>I have already tried a suggested fix to change the NTLM authentication level:<br />
<br />
1. Click Start. Enter ‚Äúgpedit.msc‚Äù in the Start Search box.<br />
2. Locate to Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Security Options\<br />
3. In the right pane, double-click on ‚ÄúNetwork security: LAN Manager authentication level‚Äù.<br />
4. Change the level to ‚ÄúSend LM &amp; NTLM - use NTLMv2 session security if negotiated‚Äù.</p>
<p>However this DID NOT work.&nbsp; Also, none of the other computers are backing up while I'm trying to.&nbsp; Please help.</p>
<p>Des</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>The upgrade advisor says the system is good but I only get to 27% when it restarts and then hangs with a "Starting Windows" message.&nbsp;
<div>When I restart XP it says that this version of windows cannot be installed. Some drivers are out of date but I cannot seem to find new ones on Microsoft or intel websites, only third party pay sites.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Anyone else having this problem and any ideas how to fix it?&nbsp;</div>

            Try doing a custom install:<br />
<br />
Boot from the Windows 7 DVD<br />
Click Install Now<br />
Accept License Agreement<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)<br />
<br />
select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows 7 Click Next.<br />
<br />
You will receive the following warning:<br />
<br />
The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.<br />
<br />
(At all cost, do NOT click anything named Format or Delete or Partition. So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. Click OK<br />
<br />
Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.<br />
<br />
When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and drivers.<br />
<br />
You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers.<br />

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br /> 
<br />Right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Try restarting your modem, router and PC in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try updating the Network adapter driver from the PC's Support Downloads webpage.   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Try Rolling back and then Uninstalling the Network adapter driver in Device Manager.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose the Network adapter you're using, on Driver tab choose Roll back, restart PC.  If that doesn't help  ry Uninstall, restart to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />  You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected.
<br /> 
<br />If problems persist with the new version then you can roll it back and hide it with the Hide Updates tool to wait for it to mature more:   <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstall-windows-10-creators-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstal...</a>
<br />Hide Updates Tool:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>
<br />
<br />If it's too late to roll back you can reinstall the older version with media downloaded from here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Burn to DVD with Windows Image Burner or create bootable flash using Rufus setting it to UEFI for GPT for a UEFI BIOS or Legacy MBR for Legacy BIOS.  Then  following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can also buy a new inexpensive Wireless Nano USB adapter like this one to replace yours:   <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5380265/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o2&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=4219413564376256854&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />I'd also check at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates if there were WIndows Updates installed before this problem started.  You can uninstall them from the link there to see if the problem goes away.  If so you can hide the Updates using the same tool above.  
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />Download and Run windows 7 driver according to your architecture and run it in compatiablity mode.
<br />If that doesn't help, I am afraid you would have to downgrade to Windows 7.

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
As OEM HP is responsible for the proper operation of the printer and scanner&nbsp;and their supplied drivers.
<br />
Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums.
<br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />

<h3> ian118  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error&#58; &#34;Unable to connect to the server. Please retry a little later&#34; Samsung ML-3051N Laser printer not working in Windows 7.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Samsung ML-3051N Laser Printer cant use in Win 7.</p>
<p>The above printer worked well with Windows XP 32 bit.&nbsp; I now have a Windows 7 64 bit system.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I have updated the drivers at http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;p=Samsung%20ML-3051N%20Laser%20Printer&amp;v=Samsung&amp;uid=ML3051N&amp;l=en-US&amp;pf=3&amp;pi=7&amp;c=Printers%20%26%20Scanners&amp;sc=Laser%20Printers&amp;os=64-bit.<br />
<br />
When I double click on the resulting Samsung Printer icon on the Desktop I get the message "Unable to connect to the server. Please retry a little later" together with another message "Printer119 Internal application error" and "The diagnostic function of Samsung
 Dr. Printer has been upgraded.&nbsp; Click here to update the program automatically".<br />
<br />
When I do this, I get the message "the compressed (zipped) folder 'C:\users\ian\AppData\Local\temp\update.zip' is invalid" and I do not have any way of operating the printer.&nbsp; Strangely enough, during the driver installation I was able to print a test sheet.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

            Hi bjboudre ... let's first try removing your account and resetting the app.
<br />To do this go to Mail and click accounts.
<br />Go to your account and delete it.  Don't worry it won't delete emails etc.
<br />But make sure your contacts that didn't sync over to hotmail are created in hotmail first.
<br />Then go to start - settings - apps - Mail and Calendar - Advanced and Reset 
<br />Then reboot.
<br />Once you're logged back in go to Mail and readd your hotmail account.
<br />Wait about 20-30 minutes and see if things are synced.

            I have 4 different accounts connected to the Mail app...do I need to delete them all? Not a very graceful solution.

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Mail app. Perform these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search. 
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register ‚Äú$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml‚Äù -Verbose} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and see if the issue is resolved now. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span>The message (This device is currently in use. Close any programs or windows that might be using the device and then try again) is usually the result of an application, file, open document, music or video file or any other application which is in use
 (running from the USB flash drive) when you try to remove it by clicking on the Safely Remove Hardware icon in the notification area.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The error can also be caused if your anti-virus is actively monitoring/scanning the USB drive. Normally, when removing a flash drive from a USB port, Windows should stop all the read-write operations on the drive so that it can be safely removed. If
 not, the flash drive can be damaged or data may be lost or corrupted. However, if Windows determines a file is in use, then it may provide a message which indicates the volume cannot be stopped right now.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>So, before ejecting or disconnecting any mass storage device, make sure none of the above activities are performed on the mass storage device before ejecting.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Disconnecting a device</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Most USB devices can be removed and unplugged. When unplugging storage devices, such as USB flash drives, make sure that the computer has finished saving any information to the device before removing it. If the device has an activity light, wait for
 a few seconds after the light has finished flashing before unplugging it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you see the Safely Remove Hardware icon&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%25207%2fMain%2f2%2f9%2f29b00a99-7710-4268-9d2c-ca2781304967%2f29b00a99-7710-4268-9d2c-ca2781304967.jpg" />&nbsp;in the notification area on the right side
 of the taskbar, you can use this as an indication that devices have finished all operations in progress and are ready to be removed. Click the icon and you'll see a list of devices. Click the device that you want to remove. Windows will display a notification
 telling you it's safe to remove the device.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<div>I would also suggest you to perform a full system scan just to be safe.

            Hi BH.  I"m Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />Did you go to the Media Creation tool, create a bootable USB or download the ISO to the USB, move it back to the target PC to open the bootable media or click to Mount the ISO, right click Setup to Run as Admin?  Then you are getting an error that you cannot do this with a USB?  
<br />
<br />If so copy the files in the USB to a folder on your C drive, remove the flash stick, right click Setup to Run as Administrator.  
<br />
<br />If any problems see these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also boot the media to Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Wifi internet slower after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, so after I upgraded my hp laptop from Windows 8.1 to 10 the wifi internet has becomes much slower. &nbsp;I have tested on Edge, Firefox, and Chrome but in all of them pages load very slowly and videos buffer every couple of seconds for a long time.
 &nbsp;I have updated my laptop's driver but that only seemed to have helped for about 30 minutes and then went back to having slow internet again. &nbsp;Every other device in my house that is uses the wifi loads internet pages and videos as fast as it always had. &nbsp;Has
 anyone else ran into this same problem and found a solution yet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any assistance.</p>

            I am also having the same issue. I have lenovo Yoga 3 14 Laptop which is giving very low browsing speed after upgrading to Windows 10. Also, while playing online videos in youtube or in any other platform it keeps on buffering even though it is connected
 to a high speed wifi whereas another laptop running on windows 8.1 is perfectly fine with the same wifi connection at the same time at the same place.The smartphone that I use when connected to the same wifi is also not having any internet speed issue. The
 Yoga 3 14 &nbsp;laptop when earlier running on Win 8.1 was also not having any browsing/buffering issue. I updated all drivers from lenovo website , whatever update is available I updated but nothing helped. It all started after upgrading to Windows 10. I applied
 Method 1, Method 2 and Method 3 but all in vein.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Please ask you sender to resave the file "Save as" and select "MS Excel 97" as he probably has MS Office 2010.<br />
<br />
<br />
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

    <title>Windows 7 with Epson EPL 5800 Printer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 with Epson EPL 5800 Printer</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to Windows 7 but now my Epson EPL 5800 printer won't work properly. It adds in little characters at the end of each word or if I send the Test Page it prints with boxes around each sentence. I've obviously got the wrong driver, though
 there doesn't seem to be much of a selection. Can anyone suggest a solution (other than scrapping the printer!)?

<p>That's not a product created by Microsoft so you'll have to get support from the actual developer, not Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently someone is trying to make you think you have a Microsoft product by calling it "Windows Movie Maker", but the last actual version created by Microsoft was called "Movie Maker 2012". As you can tell from the name, that product was last updated
 in 2012 and was retired in 2017. So whatever you are seeing with dates after 2012 is obviously not the original version.</p>
