</p><p>Hi SalomonYaker:<br />
<br />
Further to MVP Bill Smithers' reply, you should be able to find the correct Drivers and Manual page for your Aspire 6200 machine at
<a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/drivers</a>.&nbsp; I don't know the exact model number of your Acer Aspire 6200, but a sample support page I found for the
<strong>Aspire 6920</strong> at <a href="https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/support-product/568?b=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/support-product/568?b=1</a> has a download link for a
<strong>User Guide</strong> with an entire section on using the built-in <strong>
Acer eRecovery Management software</strong> (as Bill Smithers noted, restart the computer and press the Alt + F10 keys when the Acer logo appears to access this software) for restoring your system to factory condition.&nbsp; The 32-bit and 64-bit Vista-compatible
 drivers for the Aspire 6920 on that support page all date back to 2008, so you'll likely have to go to the original manufacturer's site (e.g., Intel, ATI, Synaptics, etc.) to find the
<strong>latest Vista-compatible drivers</strong> for your network card, graphics card and other hardware components that will need to be installed after you restore your system to an earlier date.<br />
<br />
These threads from Acer Aspire users might also have some useful information.&nbsp; Before attempting a system restore please note the comments I made in those threads about a
<strong>known issue with Windows Update</strong> that can cause serious performance issues on affected Vista SP2 computers (see the VistaForums FAQ
<em><a href="https://www.vistax64.com/threads/how-to-fix-vista-sp2-checking-for-updates-hangs-and-slow-windows-updates.305124/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Fix Vista SP2 "Checking for Updates..." Hangs and Slow Windows Updates</a></em>), and symptoms

<p>
</p><p>If you reset your computer back to factory condition you will have to <strong>
restore all your personal files from a backup</strong>, <strong>remove all the outdated third-party software installed at the factory</strong> that is no longer supported (e.g., old trial versions of antivirus software like McAfee, Norton, etc.),
<strong>update all your hardware drivers</strong> and <strong>reinstall all necessary third-party software</strong>.&nbsp; Once you reinstall the SP1 and SP2 service packs for your operating system you will find that Windows Update will begin to hang on "<em>Checking

<h2>            MSN Food and Drink adding recipes to collectioms problems</h2>
                    <p>I have been adding recipes to the MSN Food &amp; Drink app on my surface pro and when I go to open them back up they show up in the "Collections" folder in a folder called "My Added Recipes" (which I did not create).&nbsp; I cannot figure out how to either save a
 recipe into a different folder I created in "Collections" or to move it from "My Added Recipes" to one of the folders I created.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This also causes a second problem for me when I try to pull them up in the app on my phone because only the folder increased show up on "Collections" there but the "My Added Recipes" folder does not appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?&nbsp; Is this user error or isn't here something wrong with the app?</p>

            <p>The article does not mention why all my recipes are going straight into the "My Added Recipes" collection. I am very frustrated with this because I spent a lot of time arranging my recipes into specific collections, but suddenly one day they all moved into
 a collection I did not create. Please come up with a solution to this that will allow me to move my recipes into the collections I originally made for them. Thank you.</p>

<p>I find it amazing that all of the responses from the Microsoft "engineers" assume that we are all idiots who do not know how to use the app. &nbsp;Have they even checked it to ensure it is working as intended (hint: it's not), &nbsp;then why not put in a call to the
 creator/designer of the app? </p>

 and not do anything with them.</p>

            <p>I Hope you were able to get your DLC installed, If not then what you want to do is go to " My Games &amp; Apps ". Go over to " COD: Black Ops II " and then press the Menu Button. Next select The first option and Go To Game Hub Under the Info tab go" See In Store ". Next Scroll all the way down Until You See "Add Ons for this game" and if you have previously purchased DLC you will find it here and it will say Owned</p>

<h2>            All that seem to be having Harddrive problems.</h2>
                    
<p><span>Last month my old hard drive seemed to fail. I could not re-boot, it was the blue screen of death everybody talks about. I</span><span><span>
</span><span>was able to slave my old hard drive. Then my new hard drive was able to run a check disk on the old hard drive which repaired the old hard drive. I still can‚Äôt figure out why. So questions to everyone that
 seems to be having what appears to be similar problems is. Were you using Microsoft One Care Safety Scanner? Were you using Microsoft Security Essentials? I have noticed Microsoft Moderators stating that reg cleaners can delete needed reg entries. Is it possible
 reg cleaners were used to cause these problems? Thanks to all the answers. I am just trying to figure out why so many people seem to be having hard drive problems. My problem was not a hard drive problem and I don‚Äôt want it to happen again.

<br />
<div>Did you fix it?</div>
<div><br />
<div>We had almost exactly the same issue and we have it fixed now; I could get you to copy my settings in the language bar/system settings.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I assume you have a Japanese/English keyboard with the Hiragana on it (also my [Japanese] spouse did not know that two of the button/s on this keyboard can auto switch between Hiragana/Katakana/Kanji and Romanji inputs; it makes things so much easier.</div>
<div>The Japanese-English (Logicool) MK320 keyboard cost me $33 from Amazon Japan.</div>

    <title>Stereo headset adapter and apple earbud problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Stereo headset adapter and apple earbud problem</h2>
                    
<p>Yeah I have an Xbox one stereo headset adapter and some apple EarPods and the audio of the stereo sounds great but according to my friends the microphone appears not to work or sends straight static over the adapter... But the mic on the EarPods work fine
 on other things like my laptop, iPad, and cell phone so I know that the mic works.</p>
<p>so is my adapter busted or are the EarPods not compatible &nbsp;or what?</p>
<p>has anyone else have this problem? if so did you fix it and how?</p>

<p>Tried mine. Everyone else only hears a loud screech from me using the EarPods, but they work fine with plenty of other products. They are supposed to be compatible, but they aren't. Personally, I think the headset adapter is faulty.

<p>It should be easy to updata the firmware for the buttens on the EarPods.... P.S. I still think it is the buttons on the EarPods (for like the volume buttons) based on the fack that that when I press one the mic works for a very small moment...</p>

            <p>Hi Walter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer this question to assist you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you mean when you say 'MY usb drives are 100 mb no matter the size I buy. How can I get the full size partition?'?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are referring to increase a partition size; Refer the steps below. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk Management is a built-in tool in Windows 10, which is able to shrink/extend/create/delete/format partition. With this tool, you should shrink partition to gain unallocated space and then extend the partition with unallocated space. You can enter Disk
 Management in Windows 10 by following ways:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1, Right click This PC&gt;Manage&gt;Disk Management<br />
2, Click start menu and type cmd to open command line and then input compmgmt.msc and then click Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But before you extend partition, you should know the Extend Volume is only available when there is unallocated space adjacent to the partition which you try to extend,
</p>
otherwise the button will gray out.
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Do keep us updated to assist you better. Thank you. </p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short is that my current microsoft account that I use to sign-in for my laptop is blocked by the Microsoft team because I was not able to provide enough information to reset the password. What is the next step I can do here to sign-in my laptop?
 How do I add a new user account or replace the old one without having to provide the password for the old one? If I reinstall Windows and delete all files can I create a new user account? Is there another option that is easier and without these great consequences?</p>
<p>

            Hi  Alfalfa3, if that account is blocked, there is little else you can other than re-install Windows 10 as you would be unable to create another account or Reset Windows without using those login credentials . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

<h2>            Problem with SideWinder X8, left button and scrolling not working</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I bought my SideWinder X8 mouse in Aug 2009. It works well until last week.<br />
The left button is&nbsp;NOT performing the "Click (default)". <br />
The left button is actually simulating the "Wheel right tilt".<br />
Whatever i assigned to the wheel right tilt will be performed by the left button.<br />
<br />
I'm already using the latest driver IPx86_1033_7.00.260.0 downloaded from the hardware website.<br />
Test in both Windows Vista x86 and also on a Windows 7 x86.<br />
Both still shows the same problem.<br />

                    I have attempted to play and view a 17.5 minute video using Windows Media Player on my Windows 7 OPS. &nbsp;For some unknown reason, it stops at 3.0 minutes in and displays the following options: &nbsp;Play Again, Got to Library, Play previous list. &nbsp;It will not
 allow me to move past that point, it just starts over again. &nbsp;Any suggestions you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this issue confined to a specific .wmv file? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span> </span></span></span>Open Sound by clicking the Start button and then clicking Control Panel.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span> </span></span></span>In the search box, type sound and then click Sound.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span> </span></span></span>On the Playback tab, click Speakers and then click Properties.<span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span> </span></span></span>Click the Enhancements tab and then select the Disable all enhancements check box.</p>

<h2>            320 GB MW3 Edition Xbox 360 Wireless Adapter No Longer Recognized</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had this mw3 xbox 360 for several years without problems. Today I couldn't connect to Live, and upon starting the network test I got a message telling me I needed to connect an Xbox 360 Wireless Adapter to my console. This console has a built in adapter,
 so I'm wondering if I need to get it repaired?</p>

<p>Actually, if you are paying for your subscription with a credit card, you can call up to have the credit card removed and they will generate you a token for your remaining time, as they have to cancel your subscription to remove the credit card. &nbsp;You could
 then use that token you receive on another gamertag if you so wish. &nbsp;If you used &nbsp;a prepaid card for your 12 months though, then no that cannot be transferred.</p>

<p>you cant transfer anything between profiles you can download everything purchased on that profile to your Xbox Hard Drive but &nbsp;as far as gold its made for one profile at a time unless you set up an Xbox live family account which is for 4 Xbox Live Profiles
 and you can send microsoft points and add gold to those profiles.</p>

<p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to verify, can you tell what exactly happens when trying to press <strong>
Alt + Tab</strong> on your PC? The <strong>Alt+ Tab</strong> shortcut command lets you browse through opened apps or program only. If you want a hotkey to show desktop immediately, you can try the
<strong>Windows key + M</strong>, to show the desktop only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best.</p>

</p><p>With an Aero Theme the Alt-Tab pops up something like this with a Desktop option:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>With a Classic Theme the Desktop option is missing:</p>

</p><p>When you followed your own advice and implemented the workaround did it resolve the issue on your system?</p>

In other words you tested that when using Classic mode and after that adjustment the Desktop option appeared in the Alt-Tab offerings, right?</p>

<p>Hello again, Jack. We have come to acknowledge that there was a confusion on our part regarding the nature of your inquiry. This feature to
<strong>Alt + Tab to Desktop </strong>is only available in Aero and Basic Theme, and is not available in Classic theme.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this clears out your inquiry regarding Alt + Tab to Desktop in Classic theme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need anything else.</p>

            You are using a third party hack to convert UUPs into ESD/ISO file. You need to contact the third party developer of Decrypter or forums where users utilize it for support.<br />

</span>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>We encountered issue in our DHCP server in Windows 2012. The scopes suddenly deactivated and reactivated in just more than 1 minute, based on the evenlog that we got. Then some scopes
 are just stay deactivated. Reason for our users not be able to connect to the network until we manually reactivated the affected scopes.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Event ID: 71, 73, 74, 75, 76, 106, 107, 108, 119, 120, 20221, 20223, 20237, 20239, 20315.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>For additional info, we have 2 dhcp server configured to Failover (Hot Standby mode).</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>My question is what would be the possible execution was done in our DHCP service that cause the issue?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please help, I need to know what exactly happened, cause I might accidentally&nbsp;hit something in our&nbsp;dhcp server&nbsp;that I need to explain.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you in advance.</span></span></p>
