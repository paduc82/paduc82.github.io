<h2>            Sound on SPDIF &#40;optical&#41; has suddenly disappeared&#33;</h2>
                    Hello!<br />
Motherboard: Asus P7P55D Pro. OS: Windows 7 Home Professional 64bit.<br />
Everything worked perfectly, but yesterday the sound has completely disappeared. I'm able to test DTS or DD - it works. Any other Windows sounds including WMA Pro, and any default Windows sounds and sound in games is absent. No signal to receiver.
<br />
I didn't change any settings since it was working, the default device - SPDIF. There are no conflicts and "The Device is working properly". I have the latest version of all drivers. The sound driver - VIA VT1828S and VT2020 Audio Driver V6.0.1.7300a for Windows
 32/64bit XP and 32/64bit Vista and 32/64bit Windows 7.<br />
And if I choose any other output - ear-phones or even through a video card - HDMI to TV - everything works except SPDIF.
<br />
I have even reinstalled Windows - still nothing. Is I see on the forums there are many users experience the same problem in Windows 7 through optical cable . The decision has not been found yet.<br />
Please help me!!!<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />
<br />
Andrew.

            Thank you again! It works! <br />
I have reinstalled BIOS and it helped. But now I have only PCM stereo sound coming out. Even in Full-HD movies (with DTS and DD sound) and in games. It just downmixes it to stereo, not 5.1. Installed K-Lite Codec Pack, but it didn't help. I successfully pass
 DTS and DD tests (but no sound in WMA Pro), it shows an appropriate icon on my amp and there is 5.1 sound. But all the other sounds are PCM 2.0. Could you advice me something to get 5.1 sound?<br />
Thank you!

 I had done 1 backup successfully and decided I needed to change what files to save. Help will be appreciated.<br />

<p>I contacted Lokesh regarding a tool to identify problem as described in:<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7performance/thread/0a088ba5-2149-4b49-bb82-4b17e06a420b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7performance/thread/0a088ba5-2149-4b49-bb82-4b17e06a420b</a></p>
<p>Using his tool, the Shredder application (a part of My WinLocker Suite) by EgisTec which came pre-installed on my recently purchased Acer Aspire MD5910 was identified as the problem.&nbsp; I uninstalled the Suite and everything now works fine. Many thanks to
 Lokesh.</p>

<h2>            Dell&#39;s DataSafe Local Backup problem... can&#39;t uninstall it.</h2>
                    
<p>I have seen several good posts regarding Dell's DataSafe Online, but none were able to help me with my problem. On this laptop, Dell's DataSafe Local Backup is running. It kept popping up messages asking to update and was annoying. I decided to uninstall
 it from the Control Panel since I don't use it anyway.&nbsp; It got to some point in the uninstall and just froze up.</p>
<p>The icon still shows up in the System Tray, and is still listed in the programs to uninstall in the Control Panel.&nbsp; I have spoken with Dell twice now, just to make sure what they are telling me is consistent and hopefully accurate. They said that the software
 cannot be uninstalled because it is needed in the event the system has to be restored to factory settings using the image that is on a separate partition.</p>
<p>It appears that the software is only partially uninstalled.&nbsp; They tell me that the only way to get the software back on the machine is to do a restore to factory settings.&nbsp; They said that I should have merely disabled the software in msconfig. The problem
 I have with that is that if they need the software to remain on the machine, then they should have the OS not display it as a removeable piece of software.</p>
<p>Now when the computer boots up to the Vista interface and desktop, there is an error message saying that it couldn't start DataSafe.&nbsp; Rather than restore this machine to as it was from the factory and have to backup all my files and reinstall all the other
 software, does anyone know of a way to simply remove the software?&nbsp; They have told me that by using the F8 key at bootup and selecting to repair the system, that the last option in the list is to restore to factory settings using DataSafe, and that even if
 the software has been partially uninstalled, that it should work.&nbsp; I would prefer just to remove the portion of the DataSafe software that is used from the desktop.&nbsp; Any ideas anyone?</p>

<h2>            Problem with unidentified Network after installing Bluesoleil 7 for a mini Bluetooth adapter Atlantis for desktop computer, which runs Windows 7 Pro 64 bit</h2>
                    I have purchased a mini Bluetooth adapter Atlantis for my desktop computer, which runs Windows 7 Pro 64 bit, and I have updated the Bluesoleil&nbsp; sw version 5 found in the pack to the version 7. But after the installation the network icon at the right bottom
 of the screen shows a red X and says there are two networks, one domestic, working, with Internet access, and one public, not working and unmodifiable. All works well, anyhow, bluetooth and Bluesoleil included. Is it a problem? Can I fix it? Thanks. Cavallin

            Hi,<br />
thanks for your kind answer.<br />
I cannot access Internet from the public network; I can do nothing. The Network and Sharing Center lists two networks, the one named Rete 2 (Network 2), perfectly working with Internet and LAN, the other named Unidentified Network and labeled with No access
 to network, unmodifiable (icon a bench).<br />
I already tried to run the Network Troubleshooter, but to no avail: when I select Other problems/Choose the network adapter to check (more or less, I do not know the exact correspondence in the English version of Windows7), it lists two connections: LAN 1 and
 LAND 2 (which is not true, I have a network adapter only) and says of the second that the ethernet cable is unplugged (where?).<br />
The problem did not exist before plugging in a front USB door of the PC the mini Bluetooth adapter Atlantis and installing BlueSoleil 7.<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
C. <br />

<h2>            HALO WARS 2</h2>
                    
<p>I just want to thank the Microsoft Executive that made the decision to make a sequel of my favorite game on the 360. In the same way, I want to ask Microsoft to NOT make this game compatible with mouse and keyboard, it will ruin the gameplay that I loved
 of the first one. I liked halo wars because I can play it on my couch with my controller. Cross platform must be with Xbox one controller, I know many will disagree but there are many PC RTS to play with mouse and this is the only console rts I like. If not
 possible then it should not be cross platform so we use Xbox one controller and windows users play with keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>*A. Not keyboad/mouse but cross platform features.</p>
<p>*B. Not cross platform but keyboard/mouse just on windows.</p>

<p>I hope they keep the same control scheme of the original Halo Wars, it wouldn't be so nice if you have to fight against someone with Keyboard and Mouse. I loved to sit on my couch with a controller, it's just not the same gameplay to have to be in a desktop.</p>

            For some strange reason Microsoft can't do a simple delete anything you don't want in Skype. Messed up another good service when the bought them. They can't leave well enough alone.<br />

    <title>Win 8.1 64 on AMD-&#34;A service installation section in this INF is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ekim_223l  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 8.1 64 on AMD-&#34;A service installation section in this INF is invalid.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>USB to Serial Converter. I have tried several different converters with the same results.&nbsp;My latest a XS8801 from US Convertors.<br />
And I am back to where I originally started: "A service installation section in this INF is invalid."
<br />
I cannot believe no one else has no idea what that means. The manufacturer of these devices say it is the DEVICE DRIVER, see FTDI. And of course FTDI says discuss with manufacturers. Meanwhile I cannot get the silly device to work on a Windows 8.1, 64 bit on
 a HP2000 Notebook with a AMD. There must a something I am missing, but what? I get the first part of the install- USB Serial Convertor to install no issues. Then the USB SERIAL PORT becomes the hassle. "A service installation section in this INF is invalid."
 Now must PORT count is up to 85 and still no positive results. Anybody have similar results? Found a work around?<br />
Thanks,<br />
Mike</p>

            The only thing that fixed the problem was by resetting the computer back to new
<br />
out of the box status (Windows 8.0).<br />
Whatever the problem is in Windows 8.1, <br />
it also happened on a fellow employees computer also using an AMD with 64 bit <br />
and Windows 8.1.<br />
Both were updated via the download method. <br />

<p>I used a third party app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Classic Shell 4.3.1 then pinned Edge to classic start menu. Once it was pinned to classic start, then right clicking Edge in the start menu gave options to:</p>
<p>- unpin from start</p>
<p>- unpin from classic start menu</p>
<p>- unpin from taskbar</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose all three :)</p>
<p>

<h2>            Severe issues on Dell Inspiron 15 7548 after KB4499167</h2>
                    <p>Hi. Wednesday evening, after a normal day of work with my laptop acting perfectly fine, it decided to install updated without my knowledge while I was out on a walk. When I got back, I went to my laptop to look up some info and it was off.. it would no longer
 boot at all. I click the power button, it seems that it's going to start for about 2 seconds, then it shuts off. Over and over and over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initially thought something was wrong with my motherboard, but testing shows it's fine. I've done all the testing with battery and power supply - that's not it either. I removed the 2 8-gig RAM cards and replaced it with one 4-gig and, when the computer
 is upside down with the cover off, I'm able to boot it up after pressing the power button anywhere from 6 to 8 tries. I've run full diagnostics and no hardware errors appears at all. The system checks out fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, pre-update.. life was good. Post-update.. I'm missing work, a weekend and now more work.. I'm kind of peeved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a full list of all drivers that this update touched so I can go back and try to roll them back one by one. I'd love to simply uninstall the update, but from what I can tell that involves rebooting which is not easily done on this system now at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really appreciate the help.</p>

            Hi, Mische7
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode to repair Windows.
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn‚Äôt applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

<p>Hi Kathleen. Thanks for writing back. Before I try this, can you tell me if you've seen others having this issue at all? It would help me to know that this isn't the only case you've seen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can attempt to follow your directions, but there is no way for me to boot this, or interrupt the boot process, in any predictable fashion. Honestly, I hit the button and it starts for about 2 seconds and dies. Every 8th or 9th time it will start but mostly,
 it just shuts itself down. No time to even use F12 or Dell's F1 ePSA testing tool.</p>

            Ok, I understand, then I recommend that you take your PC to a technician, because the other suggestion would be to clean the RAM memory but for that you have to uncover the computer. You could also reset the BIOS, removing the internal battery from the PC, for about 15 minutes

<p>excellent - I'm already in the guts of the laptop (taken the main battery out several times, removed the 2 8Gb RAM cards and have it running on an original 4Gb card now).. I'd updated BIOS after all this started but that made no difference so I can take
 out the BIOS battery next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I shut it down (I'm on the machine now since I was able to get it started this morning), remove the RAM and BIOS battery for a little while, any hot tips on what steps to take after I reinstall and restart?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're being very very helpful - I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Restore Points does eat up tremendous amount of your disk space and clearing it would indeed help free up some space. Aside from restore points, there are other invisible factors that can eat away your hard drive space like temporary and cached files.
 For us to better understand why you keep on getting error messages about your storage space being full, we would like to ask the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did you first encounter the issue?</li><li>Which Windows version and build is you device running? Type <strong>winver</strong> on the search bar, and then press
<strong>Enter </strong>to find out.</li><li>What specific error message or error code did you get?</li><li>Could you repost the screenshots again?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, we suggest you check the steps provided by <strong>Greg Carmack</strong> on this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/system-reserved-using-up-lots-of-space/3214ae34-9c90-4a37-8c5a-3cc46691724b">

<p>Hi, Thanks for the speedy reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I started getting the error messages 2 days ago. I don't understand why or how a 30GB drive has the system using 26.2GB</p>
<p>2. I am using Windows 10 version 1511, OS Build 10586.916</p>
<p>3. Since I cleared the restore points today the error messages have stopped and unfortunately I don't recall exactly what the error message was.</p>
<p>4. I'm having trouble posting the screenshots - it says the message is too big.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Hi, I do have the same issue. I'm in the process of cloning my HDD to a SSD, but when I run Acronis to do so, it gives a message stating that I need more storage space. Since my total storage used is 250GB, I assumed that a 480GB SSD would be enough. Then
 I did a clean install on the SSD and did retrieve all my files and folders from my backup, but it didn't work as I expected. Is there any other way to have this issue resolve without doing a clean install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for you help...&nbsp;<br />

            Hi Marusik, I still have the storage problem. I haven't had the nerve to do a clean install so I am limping along defragging and removing restore points. I continue to research on the net but no luck as yet. I think it is a Windows 10 feature.<br />

<h2>            Game Gets Stuck on Title Screen After A Button is Pressed</h2>
                    
<p>Has anyone else had this issue:</p>
<p>Put the game in, it starts up. It gets to the title screen with the smoke and the dragon/snake ring, with the words "Press A Button" but after you press the A button nothing happens. It just stays there....the longest I waited was an hour.</p>
<p>What was need to fix. I already uninstalled and re-installed .....and waited for the dang updates to load again.....</p>
<p>I have had the game for a month and this just happened recently.</p>

<h2>            Samsung SCX 4x16 printer on new Windows 10 network...workaround&#63;</h2>
                    <p>OK I have a custom built PC running XP with a hardwired Samsung laser printer; only worth keeping for the pc to drive the printer. I have two laptops one with a clean version of Windows 10 which will not print to the Samsung;&nbsp;although it 'sees ' it on the
 network it demands to have the driver which is not available on the Web.</p>
<p>The other laptop was&nbsp;recently upgraded to Windows 10 from Win7. It used to print ok from Windows 7 as long as the PC was switched on, but now it only prints a blank sheet of paper when I try to print from it on the laptop. Microsoft Support say its due to
 incompatible drivers (3hours wasted!). Does anyone know of a work-around apart from putting all print jobs into a shared folder and using the old PC??&nbsp;</p>
<p>grateful for any ideas before I buy a new printer!!!</p>

<p>Boa tarde senhores, estou com um problema muito parecido em meu Xbox !</p>
<p>No dia 13/03/2016 comprei o jogo the division pela live, comprei 2 cart√µes de 100R$ e comprei o jogo.</p>
<p>Baixei o jogo de um dia para o outro sem nenhuma interrup√ß√£o, comecei a jogar achei o jogo muito bom e tals.</p>
<p>Depois vi que alguns amigos tinham come√ßado a jogar tbm √© foi ai que notei o erro, vi que eu tinha 30 horas de jogo lvl 15 no jogo sem nenhuma conquista desbloqueada ! Pior ainda o progresso de jogo onde indica em qual porcentagem estamos do jogo informa
 que completei 0% do jogo !!! Como isso com mais de 1 dia de jogo ?!?!</p>
<p>J√° fiz in√∫meros procedimentos e contatos com a MS e nada solucionou meu problema !! Pior notei que esse bloqueio est√° para todos os jogos !! Travei na pontua√ß√£o de 1400 gpoints e n√£o saio disso mesmo tendo completado os requisitos de conquista ou trof√©u
 ! </p>
<p>J√° desliguei o Xbox direto no botao tirei todos os cabos e conectei novamente, j√° exclui a conta e cadastrei novamente, j√° limpei o Mac nas configura√ß√µes j√° desinstalei o jogo √© baixei de novo, ja apaguei o espa√ßo reservado para o game ! Se algu√©m puder
 me ajudar agrade√ßo pois estou travado !! </p>

<h2>            windows malfunctioned on my HP TouchSmart tm2</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was doing a complete wipe on my laptop (HP TouchSmart tm2), and it needed to reinstall windows 10, which I already had on it. While installing, it was unplugged, and died. Now when I turn it on, it looks like normal start up, but it then pops up a
 message saying, </p>
<p style="text-align: center">"Install Windows:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">The computer restarted unexpectedly or encountered an unexpected error. Windows installation camnnot proceed. To install Windows, click OK to restart the computer, and then restart the installation"</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I pressed OK, and it restarted the computer, then the same message popped up. It's an endles loop. I did some research, and I found other people had the same problem. They, when the alert came up, pressed shift + f10, then changed
 some settings. And it worked. But when I tried on my laptop, nothing happened when I pressed shift + f10. I don't know how to fix my problem. Please help me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The computer restarted unexpectedly or encountered an unexpected error" is most commonly caused by an interruption of the power supply such as power failure or pressing restart during the final stage of windows installation process. Since
<strong>Shift + F10</strong> isn't working, then we recommend the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Use a different keyboard and connect it to your laptop. Then, check if <strong>
Shift + F10</strong> works. </li><li>If it works, download and install a copy of Windows 10 using Media Creation Tool. Check this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326">
thread</a> posted by Andre Da Costa on <strong>How to Download Official Windows 10 ISO files Using Media Creation Tool or Directly Using your Web Browser.</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>After using alternative keyboard and still the issue persists. We suggest to contact the manufacturer of your laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>

<p>Are you sure the alternitive keyboard will work. What would the difference be. All of the keys are working as far as i can tell.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am just curious and would like to know because i do not have direct access to one.</p>

<p>The reason why we suggested to use different keyboard is to check if there's something blocking the
<strong>Shift + F10</strong> to work. Once it works, you will be able to continue reinstalling the Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned, that all of the keys of your laptop keyboard are working, we recommend to contact the manufacture of your laptop.

<h2>            When SHARING SCREEN on SKYPE, the other person sees BLACK SANDY RAIN....WHY&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;  HELP&#33;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>For days I've been trying to figure out WHY this happens. &nbsp;The person at the other end only sees what she calls "black sandy rain" and nothing else. &nbsp;I have a brand new Lenovo Ideapad 320. &nbsp;The camera works fine. &nbsp;The drivers are updated. &nbsp;So the problem
 must lie with Skype. &nbsp;As most of you know, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO TALK TO A SKYPE CUSTOMER SERVICE REP....IMPOSSIBLE. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on Windows 10 &nbsp;-- someone PLEASE HELP.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cannot open networked files in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> i p daily  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot open networked files in Windows 10</h2>
                    I have tried to create a network between two computers, one running "Windows 10 Pro" and the other running "Windows 10 Home."&nbsp; I can see the computers in the Windows Network folder on both machines, but when I double click on the Icon for the other machine
 that folder will not open - and visa-versa on the other machine.&nbsp; I just get the blue circular waiting icon and nothing else.&nbsp; I have also created a HomeGroup on both machines and under the Homegroup folder I can see the two machines.&nbsp; When I click on the
 icon for the other machine under the Homegroup folder the folders that I have shared when creating the HomeGroup all come up.&nbsp; Again, when I double click to open up any of the folders under the HomeGroup icon the folder will not open.&nbsp; I just get the blue
 circular waiting icon and nothing else.&nbsp; I was wondering if "Windows 10 Home" supports homegroups and has networking capabilities?

                    <p>I keep checking my multiplayer connection on Xbox and it keeps saying this. I have no idea how to fix this because it is annoying me very badly. It says on the main network slide that my NAT type is Open. But if I do multiplayer connection test it says it is strict, and I have to refresh my NAT. If it doesn‚Äôt help try alternative ports. But the thing is, port 3074 is required for multiplayer connection to Xbox Live. How am I surposed to fix this. Any help is appreciated, thank you.</p>

    <title>Notepad.exe held a lock on a file when open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephen792  say:</h3>
<h2>            Notepad.exe held a lock on a file when open</h2>
                    Our system experienced a file lock when using Notepad version 6.3 (build 9600) within Windows server 2012 R2.&nbsp;&nbsp;This occurred when having the file opened with Notepad by double clicking the file and not opening it through the command line forcing a file
 lock.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I am unable to reproduce this issue but can reproduce the issue it caused and this can only occur if the file that was opened using Notepad was locked.&nbsp; The issue we experienced stopped occurring as soon as the file that was opened by Notepad was closed.<br />
<br />
I was under the impression that Notepad will never lock a file when opening it.<br />
Is there an explanation as to why this would occur?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            External DVD Drive Disconnecting&#47;Reconnecting - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>As the title suggests, the issue that I'm having is with an external DVD drive. It stays connected just fine and Windows says it's working properly in the device manager. Right up until I insert a disc that is. Once I put a disc in the drive it constantly
 connects, disconnects, reconnects, etc. making the noise and everything. In device manager it switches between code 45 and 38, saying it's either not connected or the driver is already installed....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attempted updating and checking the registry to make sure windows recognizes it, I've updated/uninstalled/reinstalled drivers for the DVD player, I've updated my BIOS and chipset, I've updated the DVD player's firmware, I've updated Windows fully, and
 I've updated/checked/rechecked about anything that has been suggested so far on any forum that I've found. I've ruled out wiring/cables as an issue, I've ruled out a bad USB hub as an issue, I've ruled out the disc as an issue, etc. It's not the hardware.
 I've spent a few days now trying and retrying methods I've found and still have yet to be able to get my player to actually function as a DVD player (or discs, primarily trying to get a game installed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to use an LG GP65NB60 external DVD drive on a computer that was upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 10. It worked fine on Windows 8, but as soon as Windows 10 was installed, it stopped working. I hadn't really made a big issue about it until now,
 because I had assumed it would be fixed down the line and didn't really have a need for it at the time of upgrade....Apparently not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts anyone???</p>

<p>I actually already took this step. It's how I ruled out the drive simply being bad. It works just fine on a friends computer. It behaves the same way on both my computer and my friends computer, 2.0 or 3.0 port. The issue is only with something in the software
 of my computer. It is not a hardware issue.</p>

            Sorry, I should clarify. My friends computer has no problem with the drive. No matter if the USB port is 2.0 or 3.0. It functions normally on theirs (they have windows 10 as well but by default). On my computer it has the issue of not functioning when
 a disc is inserted, 2.0 or 3.0, same problem.

<p>That's the interesting thing. Every post I've seen has said to delete those, as they may be corrupted. I actually went to do so and I don't actually have them....I thought this may be a problem, but might also be preventing an issue as they cannot be corrupted.
 I have no clue how to create them properly if they are needed on the other hand.</p>

            Same result sadly. As soon as I put a disc into the drive it begins to disconnect and reconnect as before.
