<h2>            Windows 10 November 2017 Update</h2>
                    <p>The November 2017 Windows 10 update was installed on my laptop yesterday. I typically use a local user account to login to my laptop. After the update installation I am no longer able to login using that local user account. Windows attempts the login; but
 as it goes from me entering my password to bringing up the desktop screen, Windows bounces back to the login screen. I can login using my Microsoft account; but now my local user account has been hijacked and I am unable to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please explain what happened, and how I can recover my local user account login.</p>

<p>Hi Barbara,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue you are encountering may be caused by incorrect typing of commands or some other underlying issues like altered configuration settings and software incompatibility. It may also be an issue with a corrupted file. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hence, we would like to know more. Are you getting a specific error message? Can you post back a screenshot of the exact error message? Click
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">here</a></strong> and find an article on how to
 insert a screenshot in your post. Please make sure that no personal information can be seen on the screenshot.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile,&nbsp; kindly perform a System Restore. Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made. Please check
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Recovery options in Windows 10
</a></strong>and follow the steps on how to restore from a system restore point.</p>

<p>It happens immediately after I hit the "Enter" key after I type in my password. And there is no error message. Windows bounces back to the login screen within a fraction of a second. I can see the desktop screen for a fraction of a second before it bounces
 back to the login screen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Will a System Restore restore the registry files back to their previous configuration?"</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, System Restore will return your OS to the image snapshot that was taken when that particular restore point was created by you or by Windows periodic restore points.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>One stipulation</strong> however, you must have System Protection enabled on your device and keep good restore points manually.&nbsp; If you don't regularly create manual restore points, you will be limited to the restore points that Windows has created
 itself, often before Windows monthly updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>System Restore is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">turned off by default</span></strong> on computer devices.&nbsp; You must enable it long before any restore points are created.&nbsp; You must also allocate enough space for multiple points to be saved.&nbsp;
 Too little space allocated will erase older restore points as new ones are created...so give it some slack if you want multiple restore points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See the following HTG article for greater detail and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>how to configure System Restore</strong></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>One final caveat, System Restore is not a substitute for backing up your files.&nbsp; &nbsp;A periodic back up of your system's image should be stored to an external HDD , in case of hardware failure to your OS.&nbsp; Also important, System Restore is not perfect.&nbsp; It
 doesn't always complete successfully for people...especially with multiple partition confusion on a HDD resulting from multiple upgrades and installations of Windows.</p>

<p>You have 10 days to rollback from a previous <strong>V</strong><strong>ersion </strong>
of Windows (1607 to 1703 to 1709)<strong>, </strong>but not <strong>OS Build #</strong> changes that occur with monthly updates.&nbsp; Article about rollback

<h2>            Dormant Gamertags&#63;&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Ever wanted a Gamertag and you just can't get it? You check and it's just a silver account?<br />
<br />
So I've come to the forums today on a topic i'm sure most of you would be interested in hearing the answer too. As the title says, I'm interested in trying to find out what happens to a gamertag after it is left unused, dormant, and just overall dumped.<br />
<br />
With me I feel like Microsoft has thousands of Gamertags that are just sitting here dormant waiting for someone to come and use them again, could anyone shed some light on this topic?<br />
<br />

<p>A lot of gamertags are associated with Microsoft account services that have nothing to do with Xbox. &nbsp;Sometimes it's Games for Windows LIVE. &nbsp;Could be Windows 8. &nbsp;Windows Phone. &nbsp;Even a Hotmail account can get you a Gamertag if you make one. &nbsp;And people
 who formerly used Xbox might be using their Microsoft account for any of these other things.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Xbox once tried releasing a bunch of old gamertags that they determined were not being used, but the public immediately began snapping up those Gamertags and selling them. &nbsp;I don't think Xbox will be making that mistake again. &nbsp;At this time, the best thing
 you can do when you encounter a Gamertag you want, but is already in use... make up another one.</p>

<p>With the amount of unused &nbsp;gamertags that are out, it makes it difficult to find an interesting unique gamertag to yourself. There are plenty of gamertags that are lying dormant and unused.</p>
<p>Why let them sit there? What if Microsoft themselves sold these "Dormant" Gt's? Make profit on their end, whilst still giving us the consumers something we may want?</p>

<p>A lot of people keep accounts that belong to loved ones who have passed away. &nbsp;Kind of like a virtual Memorial. &nbsp;They can visit that account, read the bio, review game history.. it's like visiting their grave. &nbsp;It's very common with voicemail services.&nbsp;
 It gives them a sense of having a piece of that person still with them. &nbsp;Now, that might not be the case with the majority of (seemingly) inactive accounts. &nbsp;But imagine how someone would feel having their son's Gamertag ripped away from them and sold to a
 stranger simply because nobody was actually using it to play Xbox games. &nbsp;Not a fun scenario. &nbsp;And for those cases where that scenario does not apply, there are still other ways people can use a Microsoft Account that has a Gamertag without actually using
 it for gaming. &nbsp;Bottom line, Xbox isn't likely to open that can of worms.</p>

<p>It can't be that hard to make a unique gamertag. I've had a few fun names in the past. Finally finding one I prefer. As for gamertags that aren't being used anymore, I don't think there's much they can do unless set a rule where you have to be active on
 your account. If you're not active for say, idk, 3 years, than send an e-mail to that user and tell that person that their gametag is going to be deleted at some point if he/she doesn't show activity on it soon.

<p>It's worth noting that if you use your Microsoft Account with Windows 8 and play games from the Microsoft Store, then those games will show up on your Xbox gamertag. You can see Angry Birds: Star Wars on mine.</p>
<p>Games played via Games for Windows LIVE will also show on your gamertag, just as a game played on the 360 would do.</p>

There are a fair amount of GTs not being used anymore, it's a shame that they're not released but due to prior issues it won't happen. People now tend to spell things incorrectly to have a name that they want, I had to do it with my GT.

<p>Maybe if possible Microsoft could update Xbox Live so everyone had a unique account name/number/code and then gamertag could be like a display name so you could change it to what you like. Like in real life you have a social security number that is unique
 and then you have your name that doesn't have to be unique. Yeah you could be in a multiplayer game with two Johns. Confusing I know, but that's what happens in real life too. Seems like everywhere I go there is one Matt already so. Of course then MS couldn't
 charge for a gamertag change like they do now.</p>

            Thanks for answer in the msconfig I find "bluetooth service" but no't "bluetooth support service".<br />
I thought that was the reason of my problem 2.<br />
With the command promt it works, but my problem is no't resolved and in service.msc there is just "bluetooth service".<br />
If it's normal, I m sorry but my real problem is the number 2.<br />

            <p>I'm not certain, but I suspect problem 2 is due to the missing service from 1.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You could try an <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
sfc /scannow</a> scan to see if it finds and fixes anything, if you are lucky it may help (depends on what the problem actually is). But I think its more likely to be:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Have a look in regedit at the following key:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>is bthserv listed at all? (on my system its listed between BTHPORT and BTHUSB</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If its missing have a look at this page - <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/236709-services-restore-default-services-windows-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/236709-services-restore-default-services-windows-7-a.html</a>
<em>( there is a lot more info on this page as well, so read it all before trying )</em> and see if that helps to restore it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, Have a read of this <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/100010/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/100010/en-gb</a> for a bit of extra info, See if the key is in one of the other mentioned sets.</p>
<p><br />
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:&nbsp;</strong>These are registry files so its recommended as a minimum to
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/back-up-registry#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
export your registry</a> and back up your data first, or if possible make a full system backup before you try the change. Just in case things go wrong.<strong><br />

<p><br />
</p>
<p>1 Do you have a BIOS setting to turn bluetooth on or off? If so, check its set on.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2 As a test, You could also try a&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> 'cleanboot</a>' and see if BT functions under that. ( Remember to reset to normal booting after the test ).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3 If you look in Device Manager, is the BT device listed and shown as enabled?</p>

<h2>            XBOX EN ESPA&#38;&#35;209&#59;A LO EST&#38;&#35;193&#59; HACIENDO MUY MAL</h2>
                    
<p>Hola a tod@s, este mensaje es para la división de Xbox en Estados Unidos para que tenga conocimiento de lo que está sucediendo en España. Soy usuario de Xbox desde hace algo más de 5 años y lo que estoy viendo ahora es de dejadez total por parte de los responsables
 de la marca Xbox en España.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Desde la llegada de Xbox One al mercado español observo muchas tiendas en las que no existe la venta de la consola ni siquiera juegos (Alcampo y Carrefour por ejemplo), sólo veo consolas de Sony Playstation y alguna que otra Wii U. La mayoría de mis amigos
 tenemos la Xbox One, pero resulta difícil que incluso ellos encuentren stands de Xbox en muchas tiendas. En las navidades pasadas el panorama era desolador, sólo en dos establecimiento especializados tenían Xbox One (Mediamarkt y Game), el resto de establecimientos
 ni rastro de ellos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>En la prensa especializada todos los medios siempre abarcan noticias de Sony y de Nintendo, mientras que de Xbox sólo las noticias más destacadas y bastante escuetas y sin muchos detalles.</p>
<p>Me he intentando poner en contacto con Xbox España en varias ocasiones a través de Twitter y de Facebook y nunca han respondido ni un mísero mensaje, debe ser que andan tan ocupados haciendo mal su trabajo que ni tiempo tienen para responder a sus clientes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Existe un gran problema en España con el doblaje de juegos first party de Microsoft que se suponen que son el estandarte de la marca, básicamente es que no se ha doblado en los últimos lanzamiento ni un maldito juego. No se ha doblado Quantum Break, al cual
 decían de que era una experiencia única y que quedaba mejor con subtítulos, pero luego con sus dos santos **** lo traducen el español latino (español de México si no recuerdo mal), ¿Qué pasa es que para ellos la experiencia no es única? ¿Somos los españoles
 de ESPAÑA usuarios de segunda?</p>
<p>Otros juegos como Forza Horizon 3 y Recore tampoco han sido doblados, por lo que parece ser que tenemos que acostumbrarnos a que a partir de ahora ningún juego sea doblado porque los de Xbox España no hacen su trabajo. Me pregunto si Xbox les entrega dinero
 a Xbox España para que lo gasten en cosas como los doblajes y de ser así dónde está ese dinero o en qué lo están gastando.</p>
<p>Hace unos días se cofirmaba de que Gears of War 4 iba a llegar doblado y se ha recibido como una victoria ante la total seguridad de que no iba a ser así. Personalmente lo tengo claro si Microsoft va a dejar de doblar sus juegos first party a la localización
 de español de España esta va a ser la última consola que me compre de ellos porque tengo derecho a disfrutar de la misma experiencia que el resto de clientes de otros países. Es que ni tan si quiera bajáis el precio, se mantiene el mismo, y a pesar de no venir
 doblado ¿es que yo tengo que pagar el mismo precio por un juego que no ha venido doblado a mi idioma que el cliente que disfruta de un juego doblado a su idioma? ¿Es que tengo que costearle yo el doblaje a otros países? Parece ser que sí, porque el precio
 es exactamente lo mismo: en putos euros.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>En fin, por favor comprobad qué está sucediendo en España con todos estos temas y que tengáis claro de que queremos todos los juegos first party doblados o me pienso comprar todos los juegos cuando cuesten 10 euros en G2A.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saludos cordiales.</p>

<p>Soy Usuario de Xbox desde que salió, y la política que están llevando aquí en España es terrible para sus usuarios españoles, yo lo siento mucho y me duele pasarme a la competencia, pero desde que me enteré de que el recore no llegaba a nuestro idioma, decidí
 vender la consola y pasarme a &nbsp;la ps4 que por lo menos en esa compañía si trae sus títulos perfectamente en Español de España.
</p>
<p>Como tu bien dices compañero, tienen la poca vergüenza de ponernos el mismo precio que en otros países... por aí no paso, ya basta de sacarnos el dinero de nuestros humildes bolsillos.</p>

<p>La política que están llevando no me ha gustado nada y para colmo la discriminación a sus usuarios españoles, es una falta de respeto que traduzcan casi todos los idiomas del mundo menos el Español de España... yo sigo creyendo en la igualdad de condiciones
 y si pago por un producto que sea en igualdad de condiciones, es mi opinión, la confianza que tenía en Xbox ellos mismos la han tirado por el retrete. Una consola es para jugar, y si en sus juegos me tengo que forzar por el idioma.... malo... yo busco desconectar
 y distraerme fácilmente y sin complicaciones y que menos que te lo faciliten con el idioma. Sé que hay muchos juegos que solo están subtitulados pero también lo están para otros países, y por eso voy a repetir lo de la igualdad de condiciones, si quieren que
 page por el mismo producto. En ps4 no voy a tener ese problema y sí, voy a dar mi dinero a otra compañía con mucho gusto ya que voy a tener sus exclusivos en mi idioma, soy un jugador exigente y no me conformo con la *** que me den. Un saludo</p>

<p>Bienvenidos al club, a mi hace años que me pasa. Los videojuegos no salen nunca ni en texto ni en voces en mi idioma.</p>
<p>Yo creo que Microsoft ha tirado la toalla en España. Las cifras de vendas deben ser pesimas y seguramente hay mas hispanoablantes al otro lado del charco que tienen la XBOX ONE que no en Espña, con lo cual, se pasan al español neutro ya que allí deben tener
 más mercado. Empresarialmente es comprensible, aunque ***. Tal vez sea la tumba de XBOX en España.</p>

<p>Con todo respeto como ya lo habían comentado pero, se me hace también muy infantil que solo porque no este en su idioma se cambiarán de plataforma, vamos, los "hipanohablantes" han soportando ya por algún tiempo los doblajes de España, se me hace justo que
 ya lo tengan en su respectivo idioma, si en dado caso es el "neutro" como lo consideran, se me hace mucho mejor.</p>

<p>Lo de infantil me parece un poco excesivo, no creo que sea de infantil que exijas algo que estas pagando con tu dinero ¿no?. En la Xbox 360 estaba contentísimo, y tenia todas las consolas, pero ahora me es imposible tenerlas todas y debo conformarme con
 una sola, asique mi nivel de exigencia creo que es razonable.</p>

<p>Creo que los españoles compartimos con latinamérica un lenguaje que a diferencia de lo que parecen pensar todos por éste hilo... yo creo que nos hace más grandes.</p>
<p>Yo soy catalán... mi castellano no es el mismo que el de un andaluz, y lo sigo sintiendo como propio, también procuro sentir como propio el español de todos los paises hispanohablantes. ¿En qué mundo vivimos si pensamos que la diversidad es negativa?</p>
<p>Tendríamos que estar contentos de compartir algo tan vinculante como el lenguaje... y tal y como están las cosas en Xbox España, es evidente que muchos desarrollos no van a venir localizados, cuanto antes asumamos nuestro peso específico, tanto mejor.</p>

<p>Hola, Stewie:</p>
<p>Te contesto a tu mensaje con mi opinion y te digo y te explico en que esta basada y que deberias hacer para ser leido:</p>
<p>De antemano dejadme disculparme si hay faltas y faltan comas pues los teclados aqui son diferentes (no hagais coñas que si, todos tienen las mismas letras).</p>
<p>1- Vivi en España toda mi vida practicamente y llevo ya mas de dos años viviendo en Estados Unidos, si Scarfy se acuerda y hace memoria, nos conocimos hace algunos años cuando le di el "martillo" de moderador. Todo esto sea dicho porque asumo que algo de
 "vision" tendre de este asunto en particular</p>
<p>2- Si de verdad quieres ser leido, y es mi humilde recomendacion, publica el mensaje, en ingles (no usees google translator) en el foro oficial de Xbox US.</p>
<p>España, desde el comiendo de la "guerra de consolas" ha sido territorio de Sony y un poquito de Nintendo, con tanto purista de los juegos, Nintendo se ha retirado un poco de el ambito "adulto" (solo hay que ver el volumen de juego "serios" que sacan) por
 lo que cuando Microsoft saco Xbox, pocos fuimos lo que dimos el salto.</p>
<p>Micosoft sabe eso, dicho en palabras de ejecutivos de MS a los cuales obviamente, no mencionare, "España es Teritorio Comanche" (mucho antes de ese programa de teritorio comanche, no, no le debe ese nombre) en el cual Sony ha tenido siempre el liderazgo,
 es dificil que una persona de mas de 30 años y que no este en el mundillo de los juegos cuando vaya a comprar una consola para regalar, no llegue a la tienda en cuestion y diga : "quiero una play" sin saber que hay varias opciones...todo esto a lo largo de
 los años hace un mercado solido...</p>
<p>El dinero paga publicidad y localizacion, y no te olides, bueno, maybe no lo sabes, Microsoft Iberica NO es Microsoft, no es corporacion, es una subsidiaria y por lo tanto, no puede gastarse el dinero como le venga en gana en una cosa incierta como esta.</p>
<p>?Y entonces, que podemos hacer?: pues me alegra que me preguntes eso billy...lo primero tener en cuenta que España aunque sea nuestro pais y lo amemos, no es el mercado ideal para consolas, y aqui vamos a tocar un poco tus temas:</p>
<p>No es rentable doblarlo, España habla castellano, el resto de paises de habla hispana hablan Esañol, no es lo mismo!!!!! ,mexicanos, colombianos, salvadoreños, argentinos, etc etc etc prefieren escuchar el juego en Ingles que en
 castellano con nuestras frases y palabras las cuales no entienden, sin empargo, pese a que no la mayoria de ellos habla ingles, desde pequeños como no tienen una industria del doblaje tan buena como en españa, no doblan muchas peliculas y productos extranjeros
 por lo que estan acostumbrados.</p>
<p>Por ende, digamos que, doblan el juego solo por españa, dicho escueta y drasticamente, ademas, tenemos que reconocer que españa es muy muy muy muy propensa a la pirateria, no estoy diciendo que otros paises no, salvo que, si pese
 a que aqui, por ejemplo, hay pirateria, se persigue y comprar un juego, dada la situacion economica no es un gasto en absoluto... en españa los precios que son como aqui, no pueden compararse porque la situacion economica es diferente, por lo tanto, sumadas
 esas ciscunstancias tienes lo que pasa en españa y su mercado.</p>
<p>Yo tengo fe en que se solucionara un poco cuando dejen de sacar los juegos en formato fisico, que acabara pasando, yo aqui no voy a comprar a la tienda, yo los compro en el store de Xbox y los descargo inmediatamente, habra piratas
 que lo meteran en usb y modificaran la consola si, pero poco a poco se ira solucionando y poco a poco apareceran nuevas formas de pirateria...</p>
<p>Con todo este tocho, basicamente lo que te digo es:</p>
<p>Practica Ingles, españa es un "microclima" en cuanto a idiomas que flaco favor hace a su pueblo.</p>
<p>No se va a solucionar por lo pronto y lo que te explico arriba te da una informacion a grandez rasgos del porque... y faltaria mas pero escribir asi es una mi..rda.</p>
<p>Compra tus juegos online y no en formato fisico, si tienes gold espera a los Saves y promo packs (ahoras mazo) y asegurate de que en la descripcion viene que la versioan soporta español, y recuerda lo que te puse mas arriba sobre
 el idioma.</p>
<p>Cualquier duda sientete libre de contactarme o mandar mensaje!</p>

    <title>Using Bluetooth Speaker causes Youtube, iTunes to freeze&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kylekriley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Bluetooth Speaker causes Youtube, iTunes to freeze&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I am currently experiencing a problem involving Bluetooth with my windows operating system: any time I pair with a Bluetooth speaker (any Bluetooth speaker) YouTube videos freeze and will not restart regardless of web browser (so please don't suggest a browser
 issue); the exact same thing happens with iTunes (not an internet issue). If I switch between my computer speakers and Bluetooth, YouTube videos actually start and stop depending on which playback device I am using. Restarting the computer does not help, nor
 does uninstalling and reinstalling the devices, nor does turning Bluetooth on and off again. The drivers for all of my devices are up to date, as is my windows operating system. Windows troubleshooter has been unable to identify any fixes. It looks like the
 problems may have started after the most recent adobe flash player update on January 9, 2018 but I have trouble imagining why this would affect my iTunes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how I might begin to troubleshoot this issue?<br />
</p>

<p>Hi Kyle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the freezing issue only occur when using a Bluetooth speaker, there might be corrupted system files running in your computer system. We recommend that you run the System File Checker tool to scan and repair missing or corrupted system files in your
 computer. For your reference, check this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how to run the System
 File Checker.</p>

<p>Hi Boyd Hunter CA, CFP,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Windows Forum.</p>
<p>I suggest you to check the Experience Index, which should be more than 3.2 for the computer to enable to Aero feature.
<br />
<br />
You may right click on <strong>Taskbar</strong> &gt;&gt; <strong>Properties</strong> &gt;&gt;<strong> Taskbar buttons</strong> and set it to
<strong>Always combine, hide labels</strong>.</p>
<p>Thumbnail toolbars are a great addition to the Windows 7 taskbar landscape. Thumbnail and live preview functionality has been greatly enriched in Windows 7.</p>
<p>I also suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below to Temporarily preview the desktop using Aero Peek:<br />
1)&nbsp;Press the Windows logo key&nbsp; +Spacebar to temporarily preview the desktop. To restore the desktop, release the Windows logo key&nbsp; +Spacebar.<br />
2)&nbsp;To minimize open windows so that they remain minimized, click the Show desktop button, or press the Windows logo key&nbsp; +D. To restore the open windows, click the Show desktop button again or press the Windows logo key&nbsp; +D again.</p>
<p>For more information, visit the link mentioned below:<br />

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 pen 2016 not working</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone offer help with this???</p>
<p>Pen has had multiple issues on and off since I got my Pro 3 in December. &nbsp;First issue was bluetooth wasn't detecting pen...somehow that resolved itself. Pen did start re-connecting but pen was erratic on screen and would get stuck on an icon...the next day
 pen stopped writing showing cursor altogether. Although pen click opens One Note the tip doesn't seem to work at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've already tried...</p>
<ul>
<li>replacing 4A battery.</li><li>Restarting/updating Windows</li><li>Re-calibrating pen (but this would not work since tip is not recognized by screen)</li><li>Re-calibrated touch screen (which seems to be working fine).</li><li>Also tried re-starting w/vol up and power hold for 15 sec (which didn't seem to do anything).</li></ul>

<div>you can go there with everything and test. Or perhaps a friend or family member,</div>
<div>etc. has a pen you can test on your tablet and vice versa. The pen does NOT have</div>

<h2>            Unable to install .net frame work updates getting error 80072ee2</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: .NET framework and Acer 4741</p>
<p>hi</p>
<p>i'm running windows 7 x64 on acer 4741 home premium. problem is, i just cant install .net frame work updates. i've checked most of the posts on this topic&nbsp;but havent found one that speaks to my situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my problem is, the preinstalled .net files do not show up in "programs and features" and most of the solutions offered for&nbsp;similar problems here, always ends up&nbsp;with....go to control panel &gt; programes and features &gt; select .net file &gt; hit delete and do a
 repaire instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i found these preinstalled framewoks by going to&nbsp; c\windows\microsoft.net and inside the folder....among others.... i found two framewok folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) framework</p>
<p>--the folder was just simply named framework and inside it were:</p>
<p>v1.0.3705</p>
<p>v1.1.4322</p>
<p>v2.0.50727</p>
<p>v3</p>
<p>v3.5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) framework64</p>
<p>-- v2.0.50727</p>
<p>v3.0</p>
<p>v3.5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my fraustration is that i have two programs that i cant install because they both request for framework4 to be installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any help will be much appreciated thanx.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skype to pop up</h2>
                    <p>The older version of Skype (for Mac) would pop in front of other applications upon receiving an incoming call. I do not see an option in Preferences to allow this now, and so I am not responding fast enough to answer the calls by navigating and opening the
 application before they go away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

                    Help!!&nbsp; I updated my OS to Windows 10.&nbsp; At first I liked it, then my touchpad mouse quit working.&nbsp; I did a refresh to fix the problem.&nbsp; Mouse works now, but I've realized that I can no longer use the software I need for my business.&nbsp; I've also lost my
 Office and Adobe CS4.&nbsp; The revert option is not available in Recovery.&nbsp; Everything seems to still be in the computer, how do I get it all back???

<h2>            Event ID 1000 - Computer usually stops responding</h2>
                    I get a lot of errors such as this:<br />
<br />
<span>
<span>
<p>Faulting application svchost.exe, version 6.0.6001.18000, time stamp 0x47918b89, faulting module ntdll.dll, version 6.0.6002.18005, time stamp 0x49e03821, exception code 0xc0000374, fault offset 0x000afaf8, process id 0xd24, application start time 0x01caaf4f075d3c75<br />
<br />
It is not always svchost, but that is the most often seen error.&nbsp; How do I start finding out what is wrong?&nbsp; vista problem solver always says update windows, but all updates are installed (verified using Belarc).&nbsp; Is it possible that one of the updates installed
 incorrectly?</p>

            Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. When exactly do you get all these errors?<br />
2. Which is the edition of Vista installed on the computer?<br />
3. What is the size of RAM installed on the computer?<br />
<br />
This problem may occur if the computer experiences a low-memory condition. When the computer experiences a low-memory condition, memory corruption may occur in the private heap of a dynamic link library (.dll) file. These random heap corruptions may cause programs
 to crash. <br />
Memory corruption may occur when you run memory-intensive programs on a computer that has the Intel Physical Addressing Extensions (PAE) specification enabled. PAE enables a computer to support more than 4 gigabytes (GB) of installed memory.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To work around this problem, turn off the PAE specification. You must either remove the /PAE switch or include the /NOPAE switch in the Boot.ini file.<br />
To edit boot.ini file, follow the steps mentioned in this link: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms791569.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms791569.aspx</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Editing boot.ini file incorrectly may result in system startup failure.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<p>Minutes renew on the anniversary date and time that you signed up for the subscription. Renewals bill 3 days prior to the release of the new minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ex. If you signed up on April 4, 2019 at ~1:00pm: The renewal will initially attempt to bill you for the next month on May 1, 2019 at ~1:00pm. The old minutes would expire, if any are left, and the new minutes would be released on May 4, 2019 at ~1:00pm.
 This is how it will work every month, as long as the subscription is active.</p>

    <title>Installing Windows Live Mail on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eco_904  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing Windows Live Mail on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>We recently purchased a new Lenovo desktop computer with Windows 10. &nbsp;We are attempting to install Windows Live Mail account (that we used on our old PC) &nbsp;to the new computer. &nbsp;Copying the same general Live information over from the old PC &nbsp;- username, password,
 pop inbound and outbound specifications. &nbsp; We continue to get an error message that the username and password are invalid. &nbsp; This is despite the fact that Windows Live Mail is still working when we access the old PC - so we know that info is correct. &nbsp;I have
 tried uninstalling Live Mail - reinstalling, disabling Macafee and windows firewalls - still with no luck. &nbsp; The email account is with ATT/Yahoo. &nbsp;Can anyone help try to pinpoint what I should try next or what I may be doing wrong? &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi BubblyNuke3d,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for bringing this up to our attention. I would like to clarify a few things to better assist here. How do you have the console positioned and is it in a well ventilated area? Does the noise get louder if&nbsp; you use the console on certain games or apps?Also,
 by any chance have you attempted to reset the internal power supply to see if after it still makes the noise? If no try this:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">To reset the internal power supply, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Unplug the power cord from the console. </li></ol>
<ol>
<li>
Wait 10 seconds.</li><li>
Plug the cord back into the console, and then press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button
<span>
</span>on the front of the console.</li></ol>
<p>If that doesn't help we<span> s</span><span><span>uggest (if it hasn't already been done) a reset of the console
</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span>ince
</span></span><span><span>the problem might be on the actual OS of the console so we would suggest a

 Factory Reset</span></span></span></a><span><span>(while keeping games and apps)
</span></span><span><span>Before resetting your console make sure of the following:&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><span>There is a stable network connection.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>The information for all profiles is known (email and passwords)</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ul>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>Once the setup is complete it will ask if we want to keep settings or manual setup
 let's do </span></span><span><span>manual setup</span></span><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>Does that help the whining noise you hear coming from the console? Give it a shot and let us know.&nbsp;</p>

            In addition to Leslie D's excellent advice try (just to rule it out) plugging the Xbox directly into the wall and not using your surge protector (if you are using one)? Or try a different outlet? I had this issue once and it was a poorly made power strip.&nbsp;

            <p>It is possible that when you run clean up , you also connect to internet and visiting some website or some application still download webpages , in that case it could not remove them. Try to disconnect from internet or not browse any webpage when it clean
 up and see result.</p>
<p>You also could remove them from Delete option in internet explorer. Also it is possible that you clean them but visit webpage and new offline files come in later.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>There is no way to disable the blue recording light. It's a security feature to prevent you being on camera without you knowing it.</p>

    <title>Wifi Card suddenly not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamegan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wifi Card suddenly not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I unplugged my HP Pavilion 23 All-In-One Desktop to move it someplace else, and when I plugged it back in, the Wifi Card was not registering any networks, despite the desktop being directly next to a router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went into Device Manager, only to find the Wifi Card isn't even registered, as if it suddenly disappeared. Nothing changed the PC, as I only unplugged it to move it someplace else. Any answers will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Solution 1:</p>
<p>It tells me to plug in an Ethernet cable, yet I have no Ethernet cable to plug in. Alongside this, I want to connect to Wifi, not Ethernet.</p>
<p>Solution 2:</p>
<p>The Wifi Card doesn't even show up there, as I mentioned in the earlier post. I can't uninstall something that isn't there in the first place.</p>
<p>Solution 3:</p>
<p>I reset the network, and it did nothing, sadly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other solutions you have?<br />
