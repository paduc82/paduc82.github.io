<p>The only ones I know of are</p>
<p>Doom 3 BFG</p>
<p>Black Ops</p>
<p>Halo Anniversary</p>
<p>Crysis 2</p>

<p>Thanks guys, it is an active 3D one but i'm still in two minds. Sounds very headachey having shutters alternate on each eye at a rapid rate. have you tried the two out?</p>
<p>I've heard passive is better contrast wise but active gives a clearer sharper image</p>

<p>I have found that Active is OK and not to headache-y . I too worried about that but Passive Just seems naff compared to Active. If you are watching for the duration of the film its OK, but I wouldn't recommend much longer</p>

<p>I've had an active Samsung 3DTV for 2 years, I gotta say, if you're wanting one just for games, then I wouldn't bother mate. However, if you have Sky 3D / a 3D Blu-Ray player then it's great! It just seems to make games harder and makes you more dizzy than
 running around in circles in the dark playing Condemned.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 Pro boot installation hangs at initial splash screen. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8 Pro boot installation hangs at initial splash screen.</h2>
                    I bought the 64 bit Windows 8 Pro (norwegian) upgrade yesterday, but the installation refuses to start when booting from the DVD. When I boot from the DVD it hangs when it gets to the first splash screen (black with blue window and rotating progress thingy).
 I have tried many times now, and left it like that for two hours yesterday and nothing happened. I have tried burning it to a second DVD at minimum speed, and using a flash drive. It behaves the same way every time. There doesn't seem to be any activity. My
 guess is it's a BIOS compatibility problem.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have also tried updating my BIOS to the latest version (Version FH, from january 6 2012), and removing all USB devices apart from mouse and keyboard.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Booting from the Windows 7 DVD works fine. I am currently running a very fresh Windows 7 Home Premium install with no errors or problems.</div>

            <p>Try running the upgrade assistant to verify your system's compatability, and to see if there is a reason why your installation is not working.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The upgrade assistant can be found here: </p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, try to see if there are drivers that may need updating, check your manufacturer's website for any driver updates that may need to be addressed for Windows 8.
</p>
<p><br />
If you find anything of interest with the Upgrade Assistant, please share, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

            I did that. That's how I bought and downloaded the ISO. The only things it lists are that I need a new DVD-software, that Media Center isn't included with Pro, that my hardware doesn't support the secure boot function, and that MS Security Essentials is
 incompatible. Shouldn't matter, cause I want to clean install. Is secure boot support required to install from booting?
<div><br />
<div>Drivers shouldn't be an issue. I'm booting from the installation disc. It won't even initialize the installation. It should start even if there was no Windows 7 installed.</div>

            <p><strong>What you can do before attempting the upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You can do some pre-requisite tasks to ensure a smooth migration from Windows 7 to Windows 8. If you are using a name branded computer such as a Dell or HP, go to the manufacturers website for the model computer you are using and download the latest available
 drivers for that computer. Store them on a disc or USB thumb drive. Important drivers you should try to obtain include Network and Video Drivers. Its possible that they might just have Windows Vista or Windows 7 drivers, those will work with Windows 8.
</p>
<p>Other things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall any security software before attempting to upgrade. </li><li>Disable any encryption software you might have installed. </li><li>Disable/uninstall disk utility software such as DVD/CD burning utilities or third party defragment programs such as Perfect Disk.
</li><li>Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications). </li><li>Disconnect any external devices before installing. </li><li>Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
- Click Start<br />
- Type: CMD<br />
- Right click CMD then click Run as administrator<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.
</li><li>Another thing you can do is disable Start items:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Click Start </li><li>Type: MSCONFIG. </li><li>Hit Enter on your keyboard </li><li>On the General tab, click Selective Startup. </li><li>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box. </li><li>Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.
</li><li>Click OK. </li><li>When you are prompted, click Restart. </li><li>After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Run the System File Checker utility.</strong></p>
<p>SFC/Scannow checks your Windows installation for errors and corrects them. This will help with ensuring that a smooth upgrade occurs.
</p>
<p>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click ‘Run as Administrator’<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow</p>
<p>This will check for any integrity violations</p>
<p>Restart your system</p>

            <p>Same question here.</p>
<p>Upgrading to Win8 pro from win7 64bits Ultimate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my configuration:</p>
<p>Asrock A75 Pro4 M<br />
AMD A8 3870K<br />
8 GB DDR3 1600 MHz Ram<br />
AMD Radeon HD 6670<br />
C: OCZ Agility 3 60 GB (OS disk)<br />
D: Seagate ST500DM002 500GB HDD (Data)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's what I found with Google:</p>
<p>- almost always 64 bits versions. (might have to do with CPU's/ mother boards)<br />
- some people fixed the problem by disabling legacy USB in BIOS and disabling the cardreader (either in device manager or manually disconnect from mother board)<br />
- or, as is suggested here: uninstall unnecessary application. disable non-essential startup items and services using msconfig. (there is no confirmation of the effectiveness of this solution, though)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm really anxious to find out<br />
- whether the solutions suggested here is viable and<br />
- why 64 bits upgrades fails more often than 32 bits upgrades<br />
</p>

            I had same issue. &nbsp;Tried to &nbsp;install Windows 8 Pro from my DVD drive attached to SATA internal port, at initial splash screen it would just hang for a long time and not continue. To remedy the problem, I booted from a USB DVD drive, and then I was able
 to boot off the DVD and continue installation of Windows 8. &nbsp; I had this problem on both an Asus and a Gigabyte motherboard based computers. &nbsp;Booting off a USB dvd drive solved the problem on both computers.

            I found the same things via google. I tried disabling all legacy USB in the BIOS, but it didn't work. I don't have a card reader. Win 7 device manager, services (or any other Win 7 driver related issue) shouldn't matter as the problem is simply initializinging
 the installation from the DVD.
<div><br />
<div>I don't have a USB DVD drive to test with, but using a USB flash drive gave the exact same result as with the internal DVD. It still hangs at the splash screen.</div>

            <p>I fixed my problem. Because I din't feel much for trial and error iterations, I tried all possible solutions at once and with succes:</p>
<ul>
<li>update bios (although my bios firmware&nbsp;was new enough)</li><li>disable legacy USB en USB 3.0 in BIOS</li><li>disable non-microsoft services and startups</li><li>remove the DVD from the drive&nbsp;before the first reboot starts.</li></ul>
<p>The whole upgrading process only took 25 minutes.</p>

            I have tried every remedy people have said worked for them to get the upgrade to install, but after a week it still can not get past the first restart. I guess I will stick with Win 7.

<br />
I'm using windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit with English selected as my system language and Danish and Greek as alternative system languages.<br />
<br />
Running the upgrade assistant checks the system, downloads everything (extremely slowly as it's only a couple of gigabytes and I have a very fast fibernet connection.), verifies the download and then tells me that I need to uninstall MS Security Essentials.<br />
<br />
Uninstalling MS Security essentials as told, then disabling everything but microsoft processes in the startup, rebooting and running the install windows 8 program and choosing to keep my files and settings then makes the installer tell me I'd need to download
 my language packs again and then it switches to the local language (Danish) for the rest of the install.<br />
<br />
If I couldn't also read that language, I'd have been very confused about the next step. Fortunately, that's not an issue for me (but kindly stop using IP based language selection in your products instead of respecting the language chosen by the user...)<br />
<br />
Anyway, it then starts the install process, reboots the pc and then shows a splash screen with some percentages counting up from 25 to 100% in about 20 seconds.<br />
<br />
After that another reboot and a rotating animation thing for about 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
After that nothing.<br />
<br />
Just the logo screen and silence. None of my drives are running at this point. There's just the logo screen.<br />
<br />
I tried waiting for a couple of hours but there's still nothing going on. After 7 hours I switched off the power and was treated to the windows 8 boot screen again, then the installer reverted to windows 7 and I was told that windows 8 couldn't be installed.<br />
<br />
I had removed all non-essential programs from my system with Revo Uninstaller and the control panel before I even started.<br />
<br />
(I consider my games and my steam library very essential programs though so I haven't touched those or my saved games from them.)<br />
<br />
I have also run Ccleaner to remove temporary files before running the installer and of course like I explained, done a clean boot without any antivirus software.<br />
<br />
I even tried unplugging one of my USB mice, my headphone amplifier and my web camera.<br />
<br />
And still, the installation stops at the same place.<br />
<br />
This is starting to aggravate me a bit :)<br />
<br />
After about 6 tries, I'm finally calling it quits unless you guys come up with an actual solution. I guess I'll stick with windows 7 for now.<br />

<p>After lots on trying different things I have finally managed to fix this issue. I had to go to the Realtek Audio Device Manager in the Control Panel, select Device Advanced Settings, select the Make internal and external devices playback two different audio
 streams simultaneously. How that setting got changed I have no idea but at least I know now in case it happens again. Thanks for your help though - it was very much appreciated.</p>

                    this is starting to get very annoying tot he point of wanting to go back to windows 7, i have a 500 gb main hdd, dont have a single problem with it, but when it comes to accessing my 300 gb g drive or 320 gb h drive&nbsp; or any usb keys i might have i get&nbsp;
 access denied and i am the aministrator. ive changed permissions to everyone, it dont seem to matter what i do im denied access.&nbsp; eventually after a few days or some small updates i can have access back. but seriously what is up with windows 10. Is it manditory
 to have to sign up for a microsoft account and sync everything or what.

 o</span><span><span>pen the Printer troubleshooter access the link below and follow the steps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Printer-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Printer-troubleshooter</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may download the latest printer drivers for Windows 7 and save it to the desktop. Access the link below to download the drivers for your<span>CanonIp

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Once you have downloaded the driver, try installing the printer as a network printer and check if it helps. To install the printer as a network

<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click<span><span>Add
 a printer</span></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In the Add Printer wizard, click<span><span>Add
 a network, wireless or Bluetooth printer</span></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In the list of available printers,
 select the one you want to use, and then click<span><span>Next</span></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If prompted, install the printer
 driver on your computer by clicking<span><span>Install driver</span></span>.<span>&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Complete the additional steps in
 the wizard, and then click<span><span>Finish</span></span>.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Check if you can print a test page after installing it as a network printer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Login Screen Color</h2>
                    <p>I'm having trouble with color customization on Windows 10. &nbsp;For some reason as of a few moments of posting this question, my computer's login screen color has defaulted itself to that basic blue color I never set for it. &nbsp;It used to be the dark grey color
 I have on my account colors and all. &nbsp;Did this have something to do with a recent update I wasn't informed about or what? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Honestly I find things like this frustrating, so any information provided is appreciated. &nbsp;Thank you.</p>

            Thank you for your assistance. &nbsp;I was actually able to rectify the situation by selecting a new color and saving that.<br />
Thank you anyways. &nbsp;Sorry, kind of a pointless question. &nbsp;I wrote this at 3am and I wasn't thinking everything through.

            Hello. Microsoft recommends the following alternatives to homegroup: 
<br />
<br />OneDrive for file storage and file sharing between PC's
<br />
<br />The Share functionality to share folders and printers without using the cloud.
<br />
<br />Using Microsoft Accounts to share data between apps that support syncing (e.g. Mail app).

            Hey RHK.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you want to express your opinion on this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems. 
<br />
<br />Homegroup has been removed in the latest version.   Here is what is working to correct File Sharing problems caused by Version 1803:   
<br />
<br />Go over these steps to make sure File Sharing is set up correctly:  <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sharing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sha...</a>
<br />
<br />There are Changes to file sharing over a network in Windows 10:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4092694/windows-10-changes-to-file-sharing-over-a-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/409269...</a>
<br />
<br />To troubleshoot  sharing problems:

<br />
<br />This is the latest fix that's working for Version 1803 breaking networks.  Please try it and report back:   
<br />
<br />- shut all computer and network gear down then start again. 
<br />- Try browsing to some of the computers manually, press Windows key + R, type: \\computername, hit Enter
<br />- Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />1. Start the "Function Discovery Provider Host" and "Function Discovery Resource Publication" services, and then set them to Automatic (Delayed Start).
<br />2. When you open Explorer Network, enable network discovery when you are prompted.
<br />
<br />If not then start over and set it up again:  <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sharing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sha...</a>
<br />
<br />If it still fails go over these troubleshooting steps:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/troubleshooting-windows-file-sharing-818241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/troubleshooting-window...</a>

<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Network sharing is changed on Windows now as HomeGroup is removed on V1803 or later. 
<br />
<br />Here are the alternatives atm:

<br />Hope this helps! 
<br />
<br />P.S.: If you still want to use HomeGroup, you need to downgrade to V1709.

            You took away HomeGroup. &nbsp; How the do we share files in a workgroup without giving permissions to everyone? I have three computers and can not share anything. You took away the ability to restrict anyone that hasn't login to my network from accessing my
 data.&nbsp; You haven't update my OS,, you have screwed it.

    <title>Is it possible to start up Windows 10 without any keyboard or mouse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopher pike  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to start up Windows 10 without any keyboard or mouse inputs&#63;</h2>
                    I am severely disabled, completely paralyzed from the neck down. I cannot use a mouse or keyboard and am 100% dependent on speech recognition to control my computer.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to set up the startup process in Windows 10 so that it will go from startup to my profile without requiring any mouse or keyboard input? Currently, during startup up, my computer, pauses at a picturesque screensaver. There, it requires a mouse
 click, then a password to continue with the startup. Since I'm not yet at my profile, speech recognition (Dragon and Windows Speech) is not active – so I'm stuck.<br />
<br />
There is only one profile on the computer and no password set for it. The password required is the password for my email account. This email account has since been removed from the profile in hopes of resolving the situation. But, curiously the password is
 still required to open the profile.<br />
<br />
Any help in resolving the situation is deeply appreciated. Thanks in advance.

            Hi Christopher,
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-in Options 
<br />Choose to sign in with a local account 
<br />(in newer versions of Windows 10, this might be on the Your Info Settings Page) 
<br />Enter your old password and leave the new password box blank 
<br />Close the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type netplwiz and hit Enter 
<br />In the resulting dialog, uncheck the option 'Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer box' 
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />That's It!

            I installed W10 the day it came out and had nothing but problems with the AMD driver updates,In the beginning I kept getting green screens on videos/movies because the version they kept sending me wasnt working or installed correct so I went to the Beta
 version 15.6 for awhile because the 15.7.1 didnt work right,then as they got the kinks worked out and more patches sent out I went to Beta 15.9 I think it was,both those Beta versions worked good for me,but I eventually wanted the 15.7.1 WHQL version,and I
 finally got it to work properly and then they sent me the automatic update through W10 and it gave me another Beta version 15.8 (15.201.1151-150821a-184724E) now Im stuck on it,I uninstalled it and tried to get 15.7.1 back,no luck,I tried to get Radeon Crimson
 beta version 15.11.1...I cant even find it on their site haha Ive done so many uninstalls and system restores Its ridiculous,I keep reading how Its the only 2 left ( 15.7.1 ) for Legacy cards and the Crimson beta " as is " one and I cant

            <p>Hello Jimmy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some drivers that need new definitions compatible with Windows 10. Till the time they are unavailable you can install the&nbsp;programs compatible with previous versions of operating system in compatibility mode. If you can access the executable (.exe)
 file for the game, I would suggest you to follow the below provided steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 1:</span></strong></em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> Download and save the driver on the desktop.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 2:</span></strong></em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> Install the&nbsp;driver in compatibility mode.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Right click on the .exe file, and click on <strong><span>Properties</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Go to the <strong><span>Compatibility</span></strong> tab.</span></li><li><span>Check the box for <strong><span>Run this program in compatibility mode for:</span></strong></span></li><li><span>Select <strong><span>Windows 8 </span></strong><span><em>(or any other compatible OS)</em></span>&nbsp;in the list of Operating systems.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong><span>OK</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Double-click the&nbsp;executable file to install the&nbsp;driver and follow the onscreen instructions.</span></li><li><span>Reboot your computer.</span></li></ul>

            Boot in Safe Mode to troubleshoot and fix a black screen problem
<br />In the case that there isn't a problem with your external devices, there could be a number of other reasons, and you can boot your computer in Safe Mode to try to fix the problem.
<br />
<br />You can get your computer to boot in Safe Mode in a number of ways, but in this case, you can do the following:
<br />
<br />1-Start your PC.
<br />
<br />2-At the sign-in screen, hold the Shift key down, click the Power button on the bottom-right, and select Restart.
<br />
<br />If you cannot see anything on the screen because of a black screen, then start your PC, as the blue Windows logo appears, press the power button and reboot again. Repeat these steps three times until you trigger Windows 10 automatic repair. Follow the on-screen directions and launch the advanced options menu.
<br />
<br />3-Once you're the advanced startup menu, click Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />
<br />4-  Click Advanced options.
<br />
<br />
<br />5-Click Startup Settings.
<br />
<br />
<br />6-  Click the Restart button.
<br />
<br />
<br />7- On the Startup settings, press 5 or F5 to enter in Safe Mode with Networking.
<br />
<br />
<br />Once your computer is in Safe Mode, you can try the following troubleshooting steps:
<br />
<br />
<br />How to reinstall your video driver
<br />
<br />Another issue that can cause your computer to experience a black screen is a buggy graphics driver update, which you might have received through the Windows 10 update. Other times there isn't a problem with the update, but the video driver may have got corrupted causing to malfunction and display a black screen.
<br />
<br />If the video driver isn't working correctly, you can uninstall it in Safe Mode, and then let the operating system reinstall the driver automatically upon restart.
<br />
<br />1-Use the Windows key + X to open the power user menu and select Device Manager.
<br />
<br />2-Expand Display Adapters.
<br />
<br />3-Right-click the adapter and select Uninstall.
<br />
<br />Quick Tip: You can also select Delete the driver software for this device option to remove the driver from your computer. Sometimes, this is recommended, but if the operating system can't find the driver online, you'll need to download the correct driver for your video adapter from your PC manufacturer's website.
<br />
<br />
<br />4-Click OK to confirm.
<br />
<br />
<br />5-Restart your computer to complete the task.
<br />
<br />
<br />Once your computer restarts, Windows 10 should automatically reinstall the video adapter driver and hopefully, the black screen will disappear.
<br />
<br />If you're getting a black screen on a device that you upgraded from a previous version of Windows, you may need to download updated video driver from your PC manufacturer's support website to fix the problem.
<br />
<br />This article can help with the steps to solve your black screen problem in the first step

<p>That code means it's a region issue. In order to download region locked games, your account region has to match your physical location. &nbsp;The only way to fix it would be to either migrate your account region to Spain or create a new account with Spain as
 the region. </p>

<p>I sort of want to change my region to gain access to my free game, but before i do i have some questions.</p>
<p>1. Microsoft mention how you can lose a lot of downloaded items, i have tons of DLC, downloaded games, arcade games, and other things, most of them uninstalled due to no space n the harddrive, exactly how much of this will i lose? or was that part directed
 mostly towards music and movies?</p>
<p>2. I assume my dashboard and advertisements will change to the Spanish language, but what about my games? &nbsp;will they all switch to Spanish when turned on?</p>
<p>3. Can I switch back to the English region after downloading my free game with gold with no issues or difficulties?</p>
<p>Thanks for any responses!</p>

<p>1. It's really hard to tell exactly how much. Although any other games that are region locked will no longer redownload for you unless you went back to the UK anyway.
</p>
<p>2. You can change the language of your dashboard to english and it should show almost everything in English. I'm not 100% sure about the games though. Since you purchased the english version, they may still remain English
</p>
<p>3. You can only migrate your account once every 3 months. So you won't be able to quickly switch between regions.</p>

Hi janet,</p>
<p>1. Did you make any changes prior to the issue?<br />
2. Have you installed CA anti-virus program on your computer?</p>
<p>We found that the Common event manager is part of the CA software package. We recommend you to try to uninstall and reinstall the program to fix this error.<br />

            Hi CaiCai1701,
<br />
<br />I'm Nathan, a fellow Microsoft customer and expert user here to help.
<br />
<br />I would suggest using the troubleshooter to see if this can find and fix any problems with the Microsoft Store app:
<br />- Open Settings
<br />- Select Update &amp; Security
<br />- Select Troubleshoot (left-hand side)
<br />- Select Windows Store Apps (under the 'Find and fix other problems' heading)
<br />- Select Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Please let me know how this goes so I can advise further. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan       
        </p>

<p>It didn't work. It says:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can try exploring other options that might be helpful.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked if the laptop needed some updates but everything is already updated, so it can't be that. I am just thinking that the store is not functioning?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi CaiCai1701,
<br />
<br />That's no problem at all. 
<br />
<br />Thanks for trying and letting me know. 
<br />
<br />You might want to try the below Windows/system repairs:
<br />- Open Command Prompt as administrator (search for it within the Windows start menu &gt; right-click &gt; run as administrator) 
<br />- Enter: sfc /scannow
<br />- Once the scan finishes, enter: dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />- Once the scan finishes, reboot
<br />- Once rebooted, login and check if you can access the store
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Store app. Perform these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search. 
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Store app, it should work fine now. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

    <title>WildTangent Games App has stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            WildTangent Games App has stopped working</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; I know this question has been asked before, but I can't find an answer that helps me solve my problem.&nbsp; For the past couple of days, I am getting the following message when I try to launch WildTangent games:&nbsp; "WildTangent Games app has stopped working.&nbsp;
 A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.&nbsp; Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available."</p>
<p>I have uninstalled Wild Tangent and all the games that were loaded on my laptop.&nbsp; I then reinstalled Wild Tangent.&nbsp; I'm still getting the same message and can't figure out what may have happened to cause this.&nbsp; I have had no issues in the past.</p>
<p>Any help in getting it up and running again would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            Found the solution:go to your updates and delete KB3132372. The correct update KB3133431 should load automatically.&nbsp; This has resolved the problem for me. Thanks to whoever posted this info.

=================================<br />
Change the&nbsp;Text Wrapping...<br />
<br />
In Word 2007...I go to...Format / Text Wrapping / Through...<br />
<br />
Then I can use the 4 way arrow to drag the photos anywhere <br />
I choose.<br />
<br />
If you want to drag the photos off the edge of the page...<br />
I don't know how to do that.

<h2>            Portal 2 crash during gameplay.</h2>
                    <p>I bought Portal 2 about 3 months ago on Steam. It had been working fine and I had played the campaign through.</p>
<p>I haven't played that game about month... and now it's not working correctly.</p>
<p>The game starts normally, I can choose a chapter to play and play a little while normally and fine... but then it just goes back to the Windows.</p>
<p>There is sometimes the error: "Portal2.exe has been stopped" and sometimes not.</p>
<p>And the Steam is just syncin Portal 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ps. I have Win 7</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is something you may need to ultimately take up with Steam support, however try right-clicking the game and verifying the integrity of its files. If that doesn't work, uninstall and reinstall the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ensure you have the latest video card drivers. If you are already on the latest video card drivers, uninstall and install a version or a few versions behind the latest to ensure it's not a latest driver only issue. If you have already experimented with the
 latest video card driver and many previous versions, please give the beta driver for your card a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all of the above do not work, please contact Steam support - <a href="https://support.steampowered.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.steampowered.com/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<p>Think of it as a trial version. Everything that is done via Xbox Live costs Microsoft to run those services. Since we're paying for a Gold Account, you're putting your portion of the money in for Microsoft that allows you to have all these nifty features.
 Some people only make Silver accounts for Zune, Netflix etc, but they pay themselves when they use the app.
