    <title>Windows 10 latest updates have totally messed my laptop &#38; printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> an old woman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 latest updates have totally messed my laptop &#38; printer up&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>What the heck? &nbsp;<br />
After the last 2 weeks of horrible laptop issues and printer issues I finally did a factory reinstall on my laptop and it worked - for awhile - until the last windows updates went in this morning and it went right back to the same issues!<br />
1st - I lost the scanning capability on my Epson WF-3640 - and this is a month old printer!</p>
<p>2nd - I began having wi-fi issues and then totally lost both printers in the house to this laptop.</p>
<p>Interesting - my husband runs 8.1 on his laptop and finds both printers and scanning capabilities without a problem.</p>
<p>I uninstalled printers, I reinstalled printers, I spoke with Epson, I spoke with Spectrum and they both are blaming Microsoft for a bat-crap crazy update that forces itself on my laptop.</p>
<p>I work from Home, I NEED complete capability on my laptop and printer and I can not afford to keep having downtime but I guess Microsoft doesn't care if I lose my job because on NON productivity.</p>
<p>If employers don't accept non productivity and crappy work then why do we consumers have to accept it from Microsoft!~</p>
<p>I want answers, not the same stupid run the trouble shooters that don't do a hill of beans.&nbsp; My cat can trouble shoot better than Microsoft and since she can't really do anything tech wise - you know how low my opinion is right now.</p>

<p>Laptop - HP Envy Intel</p>
<p>Printer - Have 2 - Want the one closest to this laptop - for the time being - Epson - 3640, have had about a month or so, worked perfectly fine until the last 2 weeks and a bunch of windows 10 updates came in</p>
<p>OS - 10 home</p>
<p>I have now, in the last 2 weeks installed, uninstalled and factory reinstalled the laptop once - have spoken with Epson who finally gave up, pointed me to Spectrum to verify internet router working and they said this isn't the 1st time someone called in
 the past month complaining about wireless and for most of them, they couldn't fix it either - said our service is fine, agreed the ip addresses were correct&nbsp;</p>
<p>did a factory reinstall on laptop Friday, printer &amp; scanning capability worked until this morning when another windows 10 update came in</p>
<p>For the love of God - if I could take this less than a year old laptop and convert it to windows 7 I would do it so fast it would make your head spin</p>
<p>printers both work fine, just dang fine on hubby's 8.1</p>
<p>I have never EVER had this much trouble with an OS and I have been using computer since before windows 95!&nbsp; Been using them longer than most poor souls at Microsoft have even been alive.<br />
Does nobody for pete's sake even bother to quality control check these stupid updates???&nbsp; I swear if I lose my job because of so much down time I am suing Microsoft!!!!<br />
I can see a couple of hours with an update but going on almost 3 weeks and I am tired of freaking messing with this issue!!!</p>

<p>You say you are an old woman.&nbsp; I am an OLD man going on 84.</p>
<p>I asked some questions.&nbsp; You did not answer all of them.</p>
<p>I have an Epson&nbsp; XP-620 and a XP-960.&nbsp; I have had to install the printer software a number of tines as my printers oar Wi-Fi connected to the 9 laptops, a tablet and my desktop.&nbsp; When there have been some updates I have had to reinstall the printer software
 again using the original disks.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I am an Insider reviewing builds that have not been released to the public.&nbsp; We try to catch things that need to be corrected before the frlease to the public.</p>
<p>The main problem we have found with the public is that they have garbage on their computers like 3rd party antivirus that has noy been completely cleaned off.</p>

<p>First of all, 84 is still young!<br />
<br />
Sorry but I have reached a frustration level that I have never been at with Microsoft before.<br />
</p>
<p>Yes, in reviewing your reply I have used both the disc and the Epson site to reinstall.&nbsp; I have followed their instructions and spent almost 6 hours with them, doing everything that they asked.<br />
</p>
<p>I try not to have crapware on my laptops but only what I need and is useful.<br />
</p>
<p>I have to have several things on there for work as I work from home.&nbsp; I am in the process of reinstalling them this weekend.&nbsp; I have other programs that I am not even touching reinstalling until I know I can get this up correctly.<br />
<br />
Truthfully, I would like to wipe mcafee off, permanently.<br />
</p>
<p>I would like for my network settings to stay at private and not magically switch to public.<br />
</p>
<p>I would like to install once and be done and good to go.&nbsp; I simply don't have the time to be in down mode.&nbsp; Kind of hard to explain to your employer when they are expecting things to go right.<br />
</p>
<p>I have had this laptop up with work stuff for nearly a year and it functioned beautifully unless there was a power failure in the area, in which case nothing was up &amp; running.&nbsp; Other than that, it has been as reliable as you would pretty much want except
 for a few earlier windows updates that gave me a couple of hours worth of fits and eventual restarts finally took care of that.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Those, I could deal with.&nbsp; I could live with that.<br />
</p>
<p>This however is so frustrating.<br />
</p>
<p>Right now I have the printer recognized by my network and it will print but the scan settings on the Epson scan utility do not find it.<br />
</p>
<p>Well, at least I have it half way there.&nbsp; That's better than I had during the past 2 weeks.<br />

<p>First; McAfee you need to go to McAffee site and get their uninstalling sofware to remove all the code from your computer.&nbsp; The extra code that is left when you uninstal in Programs and features does not get all the code removed.</p>
<p>Any other 3rd party things you may have to go to their site for their removable software.</p>
<p>If you printer is connected to Wi-Fi have you installed Epson Connect?&nbsp; This is the thong that connects the things for the computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If the printer is connected to a desktop make sure all of the software is also installed thre.</p>

<h2>            HID Compliant Touchscreen Driver missing from device manager</h2>
                    so recently i used some third party software to update drivers and after the update my touchscreen has stopped working. I've done a bios components test for the touchscreen and it passed both tests but even the pen and touch info states that no pen and

            This might be a bug introduced with the January cumulative update.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />(This is the update you want to uninstall KB4480116)
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />The update will try to install again, so use the following to block it:
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />I would also recommend you file a bug report; send me the short link so I can vote on it and bring it to the attention of the Windows engineers.

    <title>Windows 10 On-Screen Keyboard Function Keys - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mandrewable  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 On-Screen Keyboard Function Keys</h2>
                    <p>I have been using the on-screen keyboard lately as it has been very helpful for me. The only problem that I am having with it is that I need to use the "F" keys very often, but to use them I have to hit "Fn" followed by that F key. Is there a way to have
 the F keys always displayed on the on-screen keyboard? Because if there is I cannot find it for the life of me.</p>

<h2>            Windows Defender Won&#39;t Start &#40;Error 0x80073b01&#41;</h2>
                    When I try to open up the Windows Defender GUI I get an error saying:<br />
<br />
Microsoft Security Client:<br />
An error has occurred during initialization. If this problem continues, please contact your system administrator.<br />
Error code: 0x80073b01<br />
<br />
I read a post that said to run sfc /scannow as an administrator and did so. However, it failed saying:<br />
"Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation."<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? It appears that the Windows Defender Service and Windows Firewall Service are still running, I just can't access the Windows Defender interface.<br />

            I'm not entirely sure. I tried to install an update to Flash Player once and Windows Defender said it detected a threat and the computer would need to be restarted. It hasn't worked properly since then, although I can't guarantee that is what caused the
 problem.<br />

I'm having the exact same problem, except I clicked ask me later, and right after that WD started freaking out saying virus detected, and when I clicked that I would do nothing and then started saying restart to delete malware. Restarted and still have the
 error, also did a windows 7 image recovery to a week ago and the problem is still there.<br />

            <p>Hi An,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>I understand the inconvenience caused to your friend and I will definitely help you.</p>
<p>Based on the issue description, it appears that you are having problems with changing the home screen language.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Press WIN+R keys to launch RUN dialog box. Type <strong>regedit</strong> and press Enter. It'll open
<strong>Registry Editor</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Now go to following key:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SystemProtectedUserData</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Under "<strong>SystemProtectedUserData</strong>" key, you'll see a key with the name similar to
<strong>S-1-5-21-x-x-x-x</strong>. Under this key, navigate to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SystemProtectedUserData\S-1-5-21-x-x-x-x\AnyoneRead\LocaleInfo</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>4.</strong> The "<strong>LocaleInfo</strong>" key is the one which we require to change the lock screen date and time format. This key contains all the required information which was stored in INI file in Windows 8 testing builds.</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Click on "<strong>LocaleInfo</strong>" key and in right-side pane, you'll see various Strings such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calendar</li><li>Clock</li><li>GeographicRegion</li><li>Language</li><li>LocaleName</li><li>NativeDigits</li><li>SubstitutionMode</li><li>TimeFormat</li></ul>

<p><strong>6.</strong> We'll be playing with following Strings only:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language</li><li>LocaleName</li><li>TimeFormat</li></ul>
<p>You might need to take ownership of the Registry key before editing it. Please check
<p><strong>7.</strong> First let's talk about <strong>time format</strong>. If your Windows 8 lock screen shows time in
<strong>24-hour</strong> format, then the "<strong>TimeFormat</strong>" String in your Windows 8 Registry would be set to
<strong>HH:mm tt</strong>. Change it to <strong>hh:mm tt</strong> and it'll start showing the time in 12-hour format.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fmedia.askvg.com%2farticles%2fimages4%2f12_Hour_Time_Format_Windows_8_Lock_Screen.png" /></p>
<p>Same principle applies to 12-hour format. If your Windows 8 lock screen shows time in
<strong>12-hour</strong> format, then the "<strong>TimeFormat</strong>" String would be set to
<strong>hh:mm tt</strong> in your system. Change it to <strong>HH:mm tt</strong> and it'll start showing the time in 24-hour format.</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong> Now its turn of <strong>display language</strong>. If you want to show day name and date in a different language on lock screen, you can change values of
<strong>Language</strong> and <strong>LocaleName</strong> Strings to your desired language code.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to show the information in <strong>Hindi</strong> language, change values of
<strong>Language</strong> and <strong>LocaleName</strong> Strings to <strong>hi-IN</strong> and lock screen will start showing day name and date in Hindi language.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fmedia.askvg.com%2farticles%2fimages4%2fDate_Day_Name_Hindi_Windows_8_Lock_Screen.png" /></p>
<p>You can use any language code such as en-US for English, de-DE for German, fr-FR for French, ru-RU for Russian, etc.</p>
<p>Following are some screenshots of Windows 8 Lock Screen showing day name and date in different languages:</p>

<p><span>Hi Alfonso,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, you may try to boot the computer in safe mode and check if you can capture the print screen.</span></p>
<p><span>To boot in safe mode restart the computer and keep tapping F8 key, once you see safe mode with networking option select it and press enter.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are able to capture the print screen in safe mode, perform a clean boot and check if any third party application is causing this issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Perform a clean boot on a computer that is running Windows Vista:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
<br />
2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
5. Click OK.<br />
6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
7. After the computer starts try to capture the print screen.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If your issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot and then installing the updates, then follow the steps mentioned in the following KB article to narrow down the exact source and remove the program from the computer:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Also, see the section on how return your computer to a Normal startup mode by following the steps under “Reset the computer to start
 as usual”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also you may open event viewer and check if there are any other significant error messages/codes related to print screen and windows
 crashing. If you find any errors make a note of it and post it back.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link below for more details:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What information appears in event logs (Event Viewer)?</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the result.</span></p>

<p>Hey, I had the same problem and spoke to two different Microsoft advisers. But I managed to fix it myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the media feature pack but it didn't seem to do anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must have downloaded the wrong one,</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3145500/media-feature-pack-list-for-windows-n-editions&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pick your windows version which can be found in settings- system - about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And restart and it should work from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't make sue your windows is completely up to date and that you have another user on your device, I don't know if those things helped fix the problem i had but i did do them before it started working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p>Lets try to isolate the issue further. Please run your PC in safe mode to isolate the issue. If the problem doesn't appear in safe mode, then its safe to say that the issue is not with your basic device drivers. Here's a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for instructions on how to start your PC in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also check the Windows Error checking to be sure that the issue isn't with your HDD and SSD. Here's how you can use the tool:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start </strong>and on the Cortana search box, type <strong>This PC
</strong>and click the search result.</li><li><strong>Right-click</strong> on your SSD and click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Tools </strong>tab, under <strong>Error checking</strong>, click the
<strong>Check </strong>button to start the tool.</li><li>Let the tool run and reply to us if there are any errors found.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We look forward to your update.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 when it came available. However, since doing so, I have had a couple of issues with it.</p>
<p>1. My&nbsp;laptop does not shut down fully most of the time. The power button stays lit up and I have to force a close by holding the button down.</p>
<p>2. A few times the screen has closed (black/blank) and I can't wake it up again. I have to force a close as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, is there a fix to this or should I uninstall and reinstall Windows 10. If the latter is the solution, is this a simple process?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>George.</p>

            <p>Hello George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that you are facing issues with Windows not shutting down properly. Also, there are issues with power options in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possible scenarios under which such issues occur can be as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>One of your processes or services is not shutting down.</li><li>You have a faulty or incompatible device driver installed.</li><li>You have a faulty or incompatible program running.</li></ol>
<p>Before any further troubleshooting, I would suggest you to check the Power Option settings and check if it is set correct.</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click on Start Menu and choose <strong>Power options</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Choose what the power button does </strong>from the left pane.</li><li><strong>When I press the power button </strong>under <strong>Power Button settings
</strong>should be set to shut down from teh drop down menu.</li><li>Disable the option for <strong>Turn on fast startup (recommended)</strong> by unchecking the checkbox and then click on "<strong>Save Changes</strong>" button.</li></ul>
<p>However, if the above doesn't apply, follow the below methods in order to fix the issue with shutting down.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>Try to place the computer in a clean boot state and check if there are any third party applications to be causing the issue during shut down. Please follow below.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>1. To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called
<strong>Clean Boot</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow: <span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Disclaimer: A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may
 also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a
 clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings
 may prevent you from following these steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. To disable any 3<sup>rd</sup> party unwanted startup programs in Windows 8 and above, follow:
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/20119.how-to-enable-or-disable-startup-programs-in-windows-8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span>(Applies to Windows 10 as well)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2 : </strong>Reset Power options</p>
<p>in Windows.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Press Windows key + X from the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2. Choose <strong>Command prompt</strong> from the context menu.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">3. In the command prompt, type <strong>powercfg –restoredefaultschemes
</strong>and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">4. Exit command prompt.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong></p>
<p>Check the&nbsp;Device Manager to see if any devices have warnings. If any, download and install all pending updates and Windows drivers.</p>
<p><span><span><strong>Install and Update drivers in Windows 10</strong></span></span></p>

            <p>Hello Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, this did not fix my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Power button changes did not make a difference.</p>
<p>2. Method 1. I could not find how to logon as the administrator or even if this was possible.</p>
<p>3. Method 2. Command prompt "powercfg-restoredefaultschemes" came up with the result of "not recognised".</p>
<p>4. Method 3. According to my settings, my device is up to date but update history says "Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3081441) failed to install". Under "Update &amp; Security",
<strong>should I go to Recovery and start the "Reset this PC" option?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>OR<strong> is it possible to uninstall Windows 10 and revert back to 8.1 and maybe reinstall at a later date when these bugs are sorted out?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, George.</p>

    <title>Skype crashes on Video settings - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype crashes on Video settings</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed Skype 7.36, I discovered that every time I wanted to change my profile picture it would try to access my webcam and crash. The same thing would happen if I went in
<em>Options</em> and as soon as I clicked on <em>Video Settings</em> it would freeze and crash shortly after. I did notice before it freezes its showing IP camera when it should say Toshiba Webcam. It does not let me change it since it freezes right away.</p>

</p><p><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong></p>
<p>I updated my webcam drivers to the latest. Also updated my video card drivers. When I run my laptops webcam application it shows video fine.<strong>
</strong>No matter how I try to select another camera other than IP camera it freezes then crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to reset the cam source or even manually input the source somewhere so it shows my webcam by default?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Hours after posting this I ended up fixing my problem. I ended up manually changing the camera source in a config file that was in the roaming profile folder. I flipped the order so my webcam showed first when entering the video settings and not the ip cam.
 Skype stopped crashing after this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading your post yesterday, I did notice how ever some surveillance software that I use to use lingering on my system. Once I uninstalled that it removed the IP cam option completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will keep those VCam files for future uses.</p>

<h2>            Is there a way to set sound output to mono in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I have a set of speakers, but one of the speakers is broken, so at the moment if I listen to a stereo song I only get half of the music. Is there a way to set the sound output in Windows 7 to mono so I can listen to stereo songs through one speaker? I'd
 rather do this than buy a new set of speakers.

<p>Hi Jamsoup,</p>
<p>I would like to inform you that down sampling stereo sound to mono sound is not possible since stereo sound is a standardized sound setting.</p>
<p>Stereo speakers are designed to produce sound on both the speakers and there is not option to change the settings to use it as mono sound.</p>
<p>I would also suggest that you contact the speaker manufacturer or computer manufacturer for further assistance on this issue.</p>

    <title>Nvidia Gamma Settings Not Working In Games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> goden  say:</h3>
<h2>             Nvidia Gamma Settings Not Working In Games </h2>
                    My custom settings for gamma in the Nvidia control panel suddenly default when I enter a game.<br />
I don't know what else there is to say, I've tried pretty much everything I can think of.<br />
<br />
Other information:<br />
- I don't want to set the settings in each game, I just want to use the control panel<br />
- Monitor has no gamma settings<br />
- Windows 7 Gamma settings don't work in games either<br />
- I have tried multiple driver versions<br />
- Third Party color tools don't work<br />
<br />
It just always resets itself while playing a game.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
I have confirmed that my ATI card on a totally different computer has the same problems.

<br />
I would suggest trying a clean boot to see if the problem happens. If it doesn't happen when you are in a clean boot then you can use the steps in the article to narrow down the cause of the problem. A clean boot helps to eliminate software conflict.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            LG 32GK850F-B I recently purchased has a disc for installing display driver and O.S.D for the monitor. PLZ HELP&#33;</h2>
                    <p>There is a disc for my new $400+ monitor to install the appropriate display driver and on screen display. The disc in neither a game nor movie so it is unreadable by the disc drive of the Xbox One X. LG also has downloadable files on their website for the
 driver and osd specific to Windows 10 based systems,I think the Xbox One X is a Windows 10 product. I searched for apps for so long trying different things like file managers, download manager, several media player...everything under the sun I could think
 of to no avail. Is there anyway for the disc to be read so i can follow procedures to get optimal results? I purchased the monitor specifically for Xbox One X gaming. Is it possible to allow and "exe." to be run on 1 remote Xbox Console&amp;nbsp; on Microsofts
 end? I am racking my brain to max capacity. Is there any other way to apply the LG files applications through extraction on a Windows 10 P.C. onto a USB Harddrive? If you have any other ideas or info to help me I would be so appreciative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monitor has Freesync 2, is 1440p natively can effectively run 144hz.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You shouldn't need to install the driver, the model supports plug and play.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Settings you may need to adjust on your xbox however:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Go to <strong>System &gt; Settings &gt; Display &amp; Sound &gt; Video Output</strong> </li><li>Select <strong>refresh rate</strong> "120HZ" and you can select either "1080p and/or 1440p" output resolutions.&nbsp;<br />
</li></ul>
<p>Note: You may have to adjust your monitors setting from 144hz to 120hz if you see any cloudy effects on grey backgrounds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can always reach out to Xbox Support though to see if there are any options available.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for the help, I just want to make sure I get the best experience for my money that I can. Another quick question here. If I enable Ipv6 from my ISP will that give me increased bandwidth to possibly play at 120hz refresh rate with 1440p resolution?
 I am currently only able to achieve 120hz @ 1080p. When I had my computer hooked up to the monitor I could add custom resolutions, but it was stating 120hz @ 1440p is currently outside my bandwidth range. If its possible to get 120hz @ 1440p using Ipv6 it's
 something I want to look into.</p>
<p>Appreciate your help.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Hyperex,
<br />
<br />Windows Explorer is not gteat when it comes to working out where your hard drive space is being used . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility called Treesize. Using that tool, you will instantly see where this space is being used
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />
<br />Once you have worked out where this space is being used, please let me know so I can advise on what is safe to remove . . .
