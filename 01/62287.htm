<h2>            Device Not Recognised in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have a Vivitar Camera-Binocular. In Device Manager, Imaging Devices, it is recognised as a Dual Mode Camera. My problem is that the computer does not see it otherwise so that I can retrieve the images from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is frustrating; suggestions are appreciated.</p>

First step tried: ran troubleshooter in Windows 8.1, it didn't help. Message "Problem detected with Unknown
</span><span><span>USB </span>Device (Device Descriptor Request Failed) (Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43) A request for the USB device descriptor failed.)"<br />
<br />
The manufacturer's website offers no drivers or software. Email requests went unanswered many times, but finally provided a link to the program "</span><span><span>Vivitar Experience Image Manager</span>", but
 no other suggestions. Unable to find drivers elsewhere.<br />
<br />
The Camera-Binocular is a Vivitar CV-1025V.<br />
<br />
Never worked with Windows 8.1 or Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Set program "Vivitar Experience Image Manager" (offered by Vivitar as solution) to run compatibility mode as Windows XP, on Win8.1 pc.
</span><span>Vivitar CV-1025V </span><span><span>still not recognised
</span>or </span><span><span><span>seen as connected</span></span>.
</span><span>When I select 'get images' for 'VIV-CV-1025V' in 'Vivitar Image Manager', the message is 'No Camera found plugged in to the USB drive of your Computer. Please plug in Camera and try again.'<br />
<br />
On Dell Inspiron 1525 laptop running Windows XP, the pc sees the camera-binocular but only sees sees one photo and can't copy anything although there are now 12 pics. Many others (if any) were lost trying to get the unit working. The program "Vivitar Experience
 Image Manager" does not see the </span><span>Vivitar CV-1025V
</span><span>as connected.</span><span><br />

            <p>Thank you Sahil, for your expertise. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've previously tried and again followed all your suggestions, but still no connection to pc.<br />
</p>
<p>I am now getting responses from 'Vivitar', although so far, their suggestions have not worked, but maybe now there will be a resolution from Vivitar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you.</p>

    <title>Hacked Account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ridleyxd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hacked Account&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I got on to play on my Xbox a few days ago as I usually do, and when I logged in at the bottom it said, "RidleyXD was last signed in on another console." I forgot about it, since I had just been at my friend's house the other day. Later on when I looked
 at my messages, I had complaints from people about me doing stuff I would NEVER do. I make sure to follow the Xbox Live Policies and understand what happens if I disobey them. I then later received a message from the user&nbsp;
<strong>[GT Removed]</strong> which said "U MAD I GOT YOUR ACCOUNT BRO???" As you would imagine, I was furious. I tried to call Xbox Live Enforcement team, but it said they were unavailable at the time. I took every safety precaution, changed my password, prevented
 anyone else from other consoles logging on without the password, button code, etc. I'm a fairly new user and do not wish for my account to be taken over within the first few months of my on Xbox Live. Is there anyone I can turn to for help to make sure the
 problem is resolved?&nbsp;</p>



<p>(Sorry if this is the wrong section of the forums. Like I said, I'm a fairly new user to Xbox Live.)</p>

<p>If you feel that there may have been something done to your account while it was out of your control, you would need to call support and have them start an unauthorized access investigation. Otherwise it sounds like you've done everything else.</p>
<p>One other thing you may want to do, if you haven't already, click My Account at the top of this page, and go to Xbox 360 Profile Protection. If you click "Require Profile Download" it will remove your account from any console you were previously signed into
 and require that it be downloaded again in order to use it.</p>
<p>If you feel that the person that sent you that message is the person that compromised your account, you would need to file a complaint on them via the console in order for the enforcement team to investigate them and take action. If you need help on how
 to do that, read this - <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/26/t/19139.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi there Ridley,</p>
<p>You did the right thing by following the precautions.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Another thing you can do to help protect your account, especially if you use it on other consoles, is to download your tag to a USB drive. Then you only have to remember to grab the drive before you go.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hey RidleyXD, </p>
<p>What I would do in your situation, is go to account.live.com to check out your security proofs. You have recently changed your password and reset your trusted consoles (require profile download on every xbox) but what you should do is check to make sure
 whoever went onto your account didn't add his email as a secondary or back up email to reset the password with. If they did do this, you could be at risk of them changing the password again. So go to that website and check out your security info and make sure
 everything is yours. On that same website you can also setup two step authentication or verification which means you will use your Microsoft account and password to sign into Microsoft's websites but when you go to the xbox, the website will give you a random
 password to use with your Microsoft account. So if anyone does somehow figure out your password, it won't work on the xbox because you have the two step setup. You can set that up on account.live.com after clicking on security information.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 64GB--Unexplained Loss of Storage Space - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lsm1010  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 64GB--Unexplained Loss of Storage Space</h2>
                    <p>Hi--I have a 64GB first gen Surface Pro. I've really enjoyed it, but something is eating up all of my storage on the C: drive no matter what I do. To try and address this I have now deleted all but two programs and effectively have a glorified Chromebook
 but no matter how much space I clear up, something just eats whatever I free up. I now regularly go into Windows/Windows/SoftwareDistribution/Downloads and permanently delete all of these files but as soon as I do, they are back. I can't even install the latest
 Windows updates due to the lack of storage space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very frustrating and diminishes my experience with what I think is a great form factor, but it has to work correctly as I value function over form... Otherwise I would be an Apple fan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Little help?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

            <p>1. how did you "delete" programs? do you mean uninstall" </p>
<p>2. there are lots of utilities like https://windirstat.info/index.html (I have no personal experience with this or any of the utilities) that others use to determine what is taking up space. Proceed carefully when downloading from third party sties.

<p>I've downloaded the Office XP compatibility pack and try to install it, but after clicking "Yes" in the User Account Control dialogue asking whether I allow the program to make changes to my computer nothing happens. I've tried to run in compatibility modes
 for Win XP and Vista, but the same thing happens.</p>
<p>Grateful for any help on how to install this as I need to be able to open newer Office file formats.</p>

<h2>            Win8&#58; How to Change Scrollbar Color &#38; Other &#34;Advanced Appearance Settings&#34;</h2>
                    I've been told that "Advanced Appearance Settings" are no longer available as of Win8.&nbsp; Is there some way (anyway) to change the color of individual items in a window, such as the scrollbar color?&nbsp; My sight is not very good, but the High Contrast themes
 are completely useless to me (and don't help with the scrollbar anyway, even if I could use them).&nbsp; I have trouble finding the scrollbar sliders because they are too low contrast with the rest of the scrollbar.&nbsp; Is there some registry setting I can adjust
 to do this, or some other method?&nbsp;

<h2>            Intel management engine interface - Error code 10 - can i disable the device safely&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows 10 pro 1903 on a desktop pc. Since at least 1803 I have a problem with "Intel management engine interface" listed as a system device. The error reads:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This device cannot start. (Code 10)<br />
<br />
STATUS_DEVICE_POWER_FAILURE</p>
<p>
</p><p>Automatic Driver update does not work and I could not manually find a driver update compatible with my chipset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thinking of simply disabling Intel management engine interface. I found on the web that it serves for remote control purposes, so I don't need it, but would it be safe to just disable it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, I did not have the issue when I first installed windows 10 (2016), it appeared after some update, either 1709 or 1803 I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michele</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please see if this link&nbsp;helps you:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/turning-off-search-indexer-across-all-drives-and/e4ed1a1d-668f-4753-b308-992f03141f8a?auth=1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/turning-off-search-indexer-across-all-drives-and/e4ed1a1d-668f-4753-b308-992f03141f8a?auth=1</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also&nbsp;I have found&nbsp;an related&nbsp;article which title is "<strong><em>Turn Off and Disable Search Indexing Service in Windows XP</em></strong>"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Search indexing service scans through files and folders on the XP system and records information about them in index files in order to speed out the searching speed. For users with low end PC, slow computer, or seldom use XP’s built-in Windows search facility,
 it’s possible to disable and turn off search indexing to speed up system speed by freeing up CPU and memory which used to perform the indexing task, with the drawback of slower search speeds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Windows XP, it’s possible to turn off indexing of some or all hard disk drive (HDD) one by one or to disable indexing service altogether (which will turn off indexing on all drives). Searching is still possible after disabling of indexing, albeit more
 slowly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Turn off indexing on particular hard disk drive</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open up “My Computer”. Or open “Windows Explorer” and then expand <strong>Computer</strong> tree.</li><li>Right click on the hard drive to disable indexing (i.e (C:) drive letter).</li><li>Select Properties on the contextual menu.</li><li>Click on General tab if it’s not already selected.</li><li>Untick (unselect) the check box for <strong>Allow Indexing Service to index this disk for fast file searching</strong> option.</li><li>Click OK, and wait for the index removal process to complete, which may take a few minutes.</li><li>Repeat the steps for other hard drives if applicable.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Disable the Indexing Service in Windows XP</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open “Control Panel”, select “Administrator Tools”, and open <strong>Services</strong> applet. Alternatively, type
<strong>services.msc</strong> in the Rn text box from Start menu, and then hit Enter.</li><li>Scroll down and locate <strong>Indexing Service</strong> service, and then double click on it.</li><li>Click on <strong>Stop</strong> button to immediately stop the indexing service if the service status shows “Running.</li><li>Under the “Startup Type”, select <strong>Disabled</strong> to permanently disable the indexing service so that it won’t run again.</li><li>Click OK.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Cristin</p>

                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Both browsers installed on my Windows 7 machine suddenly just crashed while working. After which both browsers do not seem to even open.</div>
<div>The application event log has a dump as below:</div>
<div><br />
</div>

<div>I had tried running virus scanners, microsoft scanner, registry error detection tools but nothing seems to help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Most other applications such as readers, media players, game applications, etc seem to work.</div>
<div>Nothing was installed on the machine which could have corrupted these applications.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Tried running the SP 1 for Windows 7 assuming it would help sort this issue. But even that failed with error:</div>

<div>Looks like some problems with dll's. But I had cross checked sizes/dates of these dll's with another system and it seems to look alright.</div>

<div>Could you please guide to get this sorted.</div>

            Hi Shylesh
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your response.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Method 1:</div>
<div>The browser does not respond i.e after double clicking it just does not do anything. Does not even throw up an error. Earlier I had IE 8 and Mozilla. Both of them stopped working suddenly at the same time. I have now downloaded Google Chrome from another
 machine, installed and currently working through Chrome browser.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Method 2:</div>
<div>Does not work even through safemode with networking</div>
<div><br />
<div>Method 3:</div>
<div>I did run&nbsp;sfc /scannow. But it has ended with errors as below:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Beginning system scan. &nbsp;This process will take some time.</div>
<div>Beginning verification phase of system scan.</div>
<div>Verification 79% complete.</div>
<div>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.</div>
<div>Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For example</div>
<div>C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log</div>
<div><br />
<div>The CBS.log contains error as below:</div>

<div>I believe the faulting module in the first post is a C++ runtime library Dll that is faulting.</div>
<div>so any application that calls on C++ runtime files will likely hang..</div>

            Only other thing I can think of is maybe Java or Flash or some other plug-in tied to both Firefox and IE..
<div><br />
<div>Chrome has it all built into the chrome.exe so doesn't reference the plug-ins externally.</div>
<div>Just a thought.. (since you said chrome was working ok)</div>

<h2>            Lost my second screen. Something about a Trigger driver&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I have a HP laptop, and I run two external monitors (so one external monitor matches the laptop screen) and I use the other screen as the secondary screen. This set-up worked this morning. When I came home in the evening and turned on my computer,
 only one external screen worked. This is not a hardware issue. The issue seems to be with a driver called Trigger USB Graphics Family MCT USB3.0 External Graphics Device. Nothing changed from this morning to this evening, but I did see a dialogue box with
 something about this Trigger driver. I cannot uninstall the driver nor can I delete it from my machine. &nbsp;I'm using Windows 10. Can anyone help to get my second screen to work again?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Patti,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's good to know that you've identified the cause of the issue. However, we suggest that you coordinate with the device or driver manufacturer for additional assistance. They should be able to help you with removing the driver completely out of your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

 another shot and use the Linux machine until then.</p>

Many of these devices such as HP Stream came in a variety of colors with a full copy of Windows 8.1. Attractive qualities include an affordable price and a 11 or 13 inch display. Along with the HP Stream were a variety of 8 inch Tablet devices such as such as the Dell Venue Pro. With the introduction of Windows 10, migrating these devices to Windows 10 might prove difficult because of their low storage capacity, but it is possible to do so. One of the limitations of introductory devices such as the HP Stream or Dell Venue Pro, they come with limited amounts of disk space, sometimes 32 or 16 GB configurations. This makes it difficult to install Windows 10 the conventional way.

<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that Skype Pro is no longer available since 2014, this is why you cannot see any information regarding this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have Skype Pro and the recurring payment for it is active, the subscription will continue renewing on your account and you can still use it. However, if you wish to discontinue and have it refunded, I highly suggest to contact Skype's chat support.
 My tools here are limited and I do not have visibility on your account, therefore, it would not be possible for me to process your refund request.</p>

<h2>            Dragon Age Inquisition freezes after less than one minute playing</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm having an issue with DAI where the game freezes just after starting a game. I've tried the EA forums to no avail, this is the thread there:</p>
<p>http://answers.ea.com/t5/Dragon-Age-Inquisition/Xbox-One-Game-freezes-constantly/m-p/4024831#U4024831</p>
<p>They actually suggested asking the official Xbox Support so here I am.</p>
<p>I have no issues playing Destiny, Titanfall, Chariot or Need for Speed Rivals. Only Destiny is on a BD, the rest including DAI are digital downloads.</p>
<p>I've already tried the power cycle option (powering off by holding the off button 10s) and it doesn't solve the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>The last hint from the EA forums is to reset the console to factory defaults, but I'm worried about losing progress related to the other games...</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Having a similar issue, game freezes after the load screen. I have uninstalled and reinstalled and still have the issue... and it is listed in the EA forums as well.

<p>Petey, I think your problem should be solved by doing the powercycle as they said in the EA thread.</p>
<p>In my case that doesn't solve it :(</p>
<p>I've tried also changing the location to see if it helped. It didn't.</p>
<p>I've noticed that once the game freezes, after a while the console resets itself, green start screen included.</p>
<p>I'm at a loss... I think I only have the reset option left. Will I lose something?</p>

<p>I finally reset the console to factory defaults yesterday.</p>
<p>Then I downloaded the 44 Gb again and continued with my last savegame.</p>
<p>I could play a bit longer this time, had the first encounter where they tell you to use the tactical view.</p>
<p>And then it froze again.</p>
<p>I did a power cycle, tried again...froze again.</p>
<p>I honestly don't know what else I can do to make this work :(</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I'm having this same problem!! I've been looking forward to this game for so many months, and now that I have it, its downright unplayable!</p>
<p>At first I was noticing it bugging during the tutorial at the beginning of the game, and then it froze while doing a save... had to close out of the game. Now, today, it won't get past the start up screen before an immediate crippling freeze!</p>
<p>I've tried closing out of the game and unplugging the xbox to reset it, and also tried going into settings and clearing out the memory clutter for blue ray, both as prescribed by one forum... no use. finally tried uninstalling and reinstalling- and it won't
 get past 2% with reinstalling and freezes there. Worse than ever. Now I can't even get it back on my xbox. How could Dragon Age release such a messed up game?? HELP!</p>

<p>I think i solved the problem with dragon age inquisition freeze bug. Unfortunately what i have done was go into system settings and find drgon age. Delete it,then take disc 2 and let the xbox download the update first. After, disc 2 is download, take disc
 1 and download the 7gb content. This worked for me,so i hope this is helpful.</p>

<p>So I was having this same issue. After putting in 14 hours of game time the game started freezing on me after about 1 or 2 minutes. After hard restart multiple times, clearing MAC adress in Network settings and restarting failed to work I decided instead
 of selecting Continue on the main menu to Load a second to last save. That worked.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Sign in to Xbox &#40;Beta&#41; App</h2>
                    <p>Not sure if anyone else has this issue yet. I've already purchased the Xbox Game Pass for PC, and went to install the Xbox (Beta) app. After installing, I seen that I wasn't auto logged in, so I went to click the sign-in button. However, when I click this
 button... nothing happens. I seem to still be able to install/play games through the Microsoft Store and my account logged in there, but I can't do anything within the Xbox (Beta) app. I understand it's a Beta, I'm just wondering if I'm losing out on anything
 by not accessing games through there? Is there something else I'm missing to be able to sign in there? Should I notify someone? If so, how (as the Give Feedback button doesn't work either?</p>

            That's strange. I would check for any updates for the app and possibly try a uninstall/reinstall of the app. I'd also possibly try the app on different devices, like on the PC and on your phone, if you can. If not, contact Support and see if there is anything
 more you can do on your end. I've had issues with the Xbox app in the past and it was just a matter of waiting it out and eventually, it worked. Sometimes it may be a problem on their end.&nbsp;

<p>I solved this for myself, though I'm not sure if everyone will have the same issue as me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went through so many different things, but in the end I tried something simple... I reinstalled the original Xbox App for Win 10. After doing this I seen that I was getting a very particular sign in error (that appear nowhere in the new Xbox (Beta) app).
 It was giving me a 0x406 error. I googled it, and that lead me to this app on the Microsoft store:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-identity-provider/9wzdncrd1hkw?rtc=1&amp;SilentAuth=1&amp;wa=wsignin1.0&amp;activetab=pivot%3Aoverviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox
 Identity Provider App</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing that, everything was fixed. Now I'm trying to figure out how to see achievements in the new Xbox (beta) app...</p>

            The answer did absolutely no good.&nbsp; I am having the same problem.&nbsp; I was able to transfer pictures and videos before but can't transfer them now.&nbsp; I know how to do it.&nbsp; Just like the question said, suddenly I am not able to transfer anything anymore.&nbsp;
 Something has happened to the Windows Media player.

            If you want more help, you'll have to be a bit more specific than "did absolutely no good."<br />
<br />
What version of Windows do you have, including service pack?<br />
What is the name and version of your antivirus application, and is it current?<br />
What other security software is installed?<br />
What happened to your computer before it stopped working (power surge/failure, malware infestation, use of registry cleaner, installed new version of iTunes, etc.)?<br />
What happens when you connect your iPhone to your computer?<br />
Does the iPhone appear in iTunes?&nbsp; If not, see this (but I'd hold off on installing iTunes if you don't already have version 11) --&gt;
