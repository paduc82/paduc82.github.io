    <title>Windows 10 HomeGroup Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shukujo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 HomeGroup Issues</h2>
                    <p>So, exactly how many people need to post separately about the same issue before the folks at Microsoft get wise to the fact that this isn't a case of user ineptitude - it's a GLITCH. My PC is no longer a part of the HomeGroup it was before I upgraded to
 Windows 10, but when I go to the HomeGroup link from the bottom left corner of the Network &amp; Sharing Center, the only option I am given is to "Join" the HomeGroup. And what happens when the computer that was supposed to be the one that generated the original
 password tries to "jin" the network it generated? As one would have to expect, it gets stuck trying to verify the HomeGroup password. Yup, it just hangs there, trying to verify the password of a network MY OWN computer generated BEFORE I switched to Windows
 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A **** TON of other people are being given all sorts of weird answers on this forum regarding how to remedy this problem, but it appears to me the ONLY folks who can fix this problem are the ones who created it, or maybe a better way to put it is they just
 overlooked this particular paradox when they were making Win 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and before anyone suggest I go to c:\windows\localservice\appdata\roaming\networkprofiles, delete that folder, then start a new HomeGroup, I already tried that. That folder claims it's in use, so it can't be deleted. Which makes sense when you think
 about it - Windows 10 THINKS the HomeGroup my PC originally generated is still in use by, well, my PC. It just doesn't recognize my PC in its fancy new 10 dress.</p>

            <p>Hi Clark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend you to check whether the Network discovery is enabled in Homegroup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps.</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Open <strong>Control Panel </strong>by right click on <strong>
Start</strong> Button.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Click on <strong>Network and Sharing center </strong>and select
<strong>HomeGroup</strong> option at the bottom of the left panel.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Select <strong>Change advanced sharing settings... </strong>
option and select <strong>Private (current profile)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Select the option <strong>Turn on network discovery </strong>
and <strong>check</strong> the option<strong> Turn on automatic setup of network </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; connected-</strong><strong>devices</strong> under <strong>Network discovery</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>5. </strong>Click on <strong>Save changes</strong> and check if the issue is resolved, if not
<strong>restart</strong> the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps.
</span><span><span>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</span></span><span>&nbsp;

    <title>Modded controllers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mustangguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Modded controllers</h2>
                    
<p>I was wondering why people that use illegal controllers are not getting banned. Tonight I played with
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>,&nbsp; on mw3. All of them had a hack one way or another including modded controllers. I was then told that you Microsoft will not do anything and if you did he will just make another name and one of which even admited using a hack,
 which I alrdy knew. So this brings me to this point. If you MS will not stop this action then I will join them and pay 150 dollars for the latest modded controller with the illegal hacks. Now the responds I will get 1. no name and shame responce to this I
 belive there should be and its freedom of speech. 2 there are no hacks out. my responce there is. I told everyone that there were hacks out for black ops long time ago no1 belived me til I posted a pic of it over the net and it was taken down. 3 you as a company
 ms needs to listen to the people who pays your bills.</p>

<p>buying a modded controller could get you yourself banned, i myself have a modded controller ( WHICH I USE ONLY IN PRIVATE MATCHES ) but you can use them in public matches, which is yes illegal but considering about 1/4 of the call of duty players use them,
 there is nothing they care about if one more person ( YOU ) are to get one more modded controller, your just hurting yourself and helping and encouraging the people who make them</p>

<p>You are saying you are willing to do the exact same thing that people are doing to irritate you? &nbsp;So far I don't understand the point of this. &nbsp;However, it apparently takes a while for them to detect a modded controller. &nbsp;They don't want to mistake someone's

<p>If the controller is altered in any way after it leaves the factory, it's considered to be modded. It does not matter if a third party company serves as the middleman.</p>

<p>I can't see how using a modded controller would be considered hacking, since there are anyway many "MS certified" 3rd party controllers on the market that have been altered from the original Xbox controller design to improve players gaming performance. So
 I'd expect it to be the game developers responsibility to create such controller logic that makes it fair to play the game with any controller.</p>

<p>- and with "controller logic" I mean the way the game itself handles controller input.</p>

    <title>Hard Disk inaccessible after Windows 10 Security Update failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kayote_8008  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hard Disk inaccessible after Windows 10 Security Update failure</h2>
                    <p>I have recently bought a second hand HP 360 Pro Spectre off ebay. Soon after, windows required and proceeded to download and update Windows 10 with security updates. Around 21% - 24% of update, the system crashed. From then on, it has become inaccessible.
 I posted this question yesterday on StackExchange's forum with pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1311693/windows10-crashes-to-blue-screen-after-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://superuser.com/questions/1311693/windows10-crashes-to-blue-screen-after-update</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then, I downloaded &amp; tried a Windows 10 bootable USB to try the repair options &amp; after all failed, a re-installation, however, it appears, the hard disk is simply inaccessible to all media, including the system itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What has happened to the hard drive? How can I retrieve the system or even do a new installation, if required, on it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Issue with behavior of Jabra Bluetooth Headset - Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dionysisf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with behavior of Jabra Bluetooth Headset - Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I just connected my new Bluetooth headphones (Jabra Revo) to my Windows 7 laptop (Dell Latitude E7440).</p>
<p>Everything is going just fine all controls working as expected etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is the following:</p>
<p>In Sound devices I see:</p>
<p>- In Playback tab two new devices: Bluetooth Headphones and Bluetooth Headset</p>
<p>- In Recording tab one new device: Bluetooth Microphone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also in Devices, if I click on the Jabra Revo I see two available Operations, "Listen to Music" and "Forward VoIP Call to Hands free"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I activate only "Listen to Music", Bluetooth Headphone is activated in sound devices, I can listen to Music in extremely good quality, I use headset to listen to VoIP Call but mic is not working (only microphone
 array)</p>
<p>If I activate only "Forward VoIP Call to Hands free", Bluetooth Headset is activated in sound devices also Bluetooth Microphone in Recording Tab, can use headphone to hear and talk on Skype call but the quality of
 sound for listening to music in terrible</p>
<p>If I activate both "Listen to Music" and "Forward VoIP Call to Hands free" Bluetooth Headphone remains activated only so no Headset nor&nbsp; Bluetooth microphone active or working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In essence every time I have to stop listening to music and perform for example a skype call (using headphone mic) I have to go in the window and disable "Listen to Music" and activate "Forward VoIP Call to hands
 free" which is very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried connecting the headsets to my other laptop (Lenovo Thinkpad with windows 8.1 installed). Two main differences identified:</p>
<p>1) After pairing, in sound tab, the devices identified are Headset Jabra Revo and Headphone Jabra Revo (instead of the general Bluetooth headphone and Bluetooth headset in windows 7)</p>
<p>2) Both are active so I can set Headset Revo as default Communication Device,Headphones Revo as default device and of course mic remains active. As a result I can listen to music with perfect quality, stop an initiate a skype call with mic working without
 needing to touch anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated BT drivers in Dell laptop, even copied the ones from Lenovo laptop but no improvement
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can make my Dell to behave like the Lenovo? Is this a hardware issue or Windows one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your help</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><span><span>Hi DionysisF, </span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Please answer these questions to get more clarity on this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Have you installed all pending Windows Updates and updated all device drivers accordingly?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Have you installed the latest software for Jabra Revo?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue might occur outdated driver or software and missing updates. Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>There is a difference in how the Jabra Revo Bluetooth headphones behave in Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. There might be some options which are not available with this headset when plugged in to Windows
 7. In such conditions you can either try to update the drivers or install the latest software associated with that device to check if that helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>If you need the same features that are available on Windows 8.1 computer in the Windows 7 computer then you may want to upgrade the Windows version.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Further, you may also contact the Jabra support:

            <p>Hello and thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I have the latest Windows updates installed. For the headphones there is no specific software installed.</p>
<p>Is there any other way that I can have the same behavior in Windows 7 since updating to Windows 8.1 is not an option for me unfortunately (specific drivers or fix to install?)</p>

<p>
</p><p>You must set the Bluetooth Headphones as Default Device and set the Bluetooth headset as default communication device in the playback devices. Then enable both services and you will have perfect sound quality for music, and when you receive a skype call
 the music will be halted and skype takes over.</p>

            Hi MinecraftLegend1
<br />
<br />In that case, you will need to download and create Windows 10 bootable installation media on a USB flash drive
<br />
<br />Then boot your PC from that flash drive and choose 'Repair this Computer'
<br />
<br />From the Recovery environment choose Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Run this command to change directory to your C Drive:
<br />
<br />cd C:\
<br />
<br />Then run this command (you wont be able to paste that, you will need to manually type the command, make sure to insert spaces after icals and before all forward slashes)
<br />
<br />icacls "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps" /q /c /t /reset       
        </p>

<h2>            Bugcode USB Blue Screen Error</h2>
                    My laptop crashes randomly and goes to blue screen. The debug says it is most likely an error with the usbhub.sys file.<br />
I don't have any usb devices plugged in and it still crashes. Occasionally after the laptop reboots a ballon opens saying "A connected USB device has malfunctioned" but I have none connected. Here are some more details.<br />
<br />
HP Envy Beats Edition<br />
14-1113tx<br />
i7 1.6Ghz<br />
4gb Ram<br />
ATI Mobility Radeon 5650<br />
Win 7<br />
<br />
Things I've tried so far,<br />
1) Complete wipe of computer to factor settings<br />
2) Update of usb drivers with device manager<br />
3) Sent to HP they said nothing was wrong with hardware and sent it back to me. They did a BIOS update.<br />

            <p>Hello iamanthony,</p>
<p>I just took a cursory look at the dump files for myself and found that I am getting symbol errors as well on them.</p>
<p>Since I can pull up other dumps just fine, the problem must be in the machine, the dump or the dump's creation.</p>
<p>One of the dumps was not like the others. It pointed to Symevent64x86 as the probable cause.</p>
<p>Now, here is the thing about Symantec:&nbsp; they have a filter driver which&nbsp;checks everything that is processed on the machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Symevent module is from 2009:</p>
<p>6: kd&gt; lmvm symevent64x86<br />
start&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; module name<br />
fffff880`047b7000 fffff880`047ed000&nbsp;&nbsp; SYMEVENT64x86 T (no symbols)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loaded symbol image file: SYMEVENT64x86.SYS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Image path: \??\C:\Windows\system32\Drivers\SYMEVENT64x86.SYS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Image name: SYMEVENT64x86.SYS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Timestamp:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thu Aug 13 17:28:21 2009 (4A849385)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I believe it would be worth our while to update this software.</p>
<p>If updating the driver does not work, we will probably be looking at removing it.</p>
<p>Please note that there may be some special steps to ensure that this driver is updated with the rest of the software.&nbsp; This information would be on their support site.</p>
<p>I would also like to attempt a cleanup of the pagefile:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Move the dump to another location on the hard disk.&lt;make sure that we move it and we do not copy it&gt;</span>
</li><li><span>Move the page file to another drive:</span>
</li><li><span>Click
<b>Start</b>.</span> </li><li><span>Right-Click
<b>Computer </b>and choose <b>properties</b>.</span>
</li><li><span>Click
<b>Advanced System Settings</b>.</span> 
</li><li><span>Go to the
<b>advanced tab </b>if it is not already there.</span>
</li><li><span>Click
<b>Settings </b>under <b>Performance</b>.</span>
</li><li><span>Click the
<b>Advanced </b>tab.</span> </li><li><span>Click
<b>"Change...." </b></span></li><li><span>Uncheck
<b>"Automatically manage paging file size for all drives."</b></span>
</li><li><span>Choose the drive where the page file currently is.</span>
</li><li><span>Choose
<b>"No paging file"</b> underneath and click <b>Set</b>.</span>
</li><li><span>Choose drive where you are moving the page file to from the drive list.</span>
</li><li><span>Choose
<b>System managed size </b>and click <b>Set</b>.</span>
</li><li><span>Click
<b>OK</b> and <b>OK</b> again. </span></li><li><span>Reboot.</span>
</li><li><span>Hopefully we will now get a good bluescreen dump.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>After all this has been done, we have one more task:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click start and type
<b>CMD</b></span> </li><li><span>Right click the command prompt above and choose
<b>"Run as administrator."</b></span> 
</li><li><span>At the prompt, type
<b>CHKDSK /r</b></span> </li><li><span>Let the chkdsk complete.</span>
</li><li><span>Close the command prompt.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>After this is done, we can watch for another blue screen and hopefully it will give us a good dump.</span></p>
<p>Let me know how it turns out and we will adjust our approach as more news comes to us.</p>
<p>I would also like to see what Auggy says on the dumps as he may have other steps that he wants to perform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Matthew_Ha</p>

<h2>            Precision Touchpad lacking middle button option&#63; how to enable one&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, recently got an Acer E11 laptop and according to Acer's help forums its up to Microsoft to determine how to do this as its a precision trackpad in this system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is there a hidden method to enable a middle button or something thats just not documented? &nbsp;or even some way to add in a script to fake a middle mouse button click in windows 8.1 with a precision trackpad?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p><strong>I got hit by some rogue AV and got rid of it but it did some damage I'm looking to fix. &nbsp;What happens when I boot up is that I get a message saying that there has been a critical error and Windows must restart in one minute. &nbsp;After one minute the
 computer just dies, it doesn't go through the shutdown sequence.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When I try to stop the shutdown with "shutdown /a" I get error 1115 (meaning that a shutdown is in progress). &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>I get this fatal error message when I try to start up in either normal mode or safe mode with networking. &nbsp;I looked in the error log &nbsp;in safe mode to find that the first error in the bootup process is that UMDF fails to load WUDFPf.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The next error is that rimmptsk and rimmsptsk cannot start because they are either disabled or have no services dependent on them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The third error is an error with DCOM (error 1726) failing to start netprofm.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The killer is a warning message saying that wininit.exe fails, with error 0x50006, to load service.exe with error -1073741819.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I was poking around in the DCOM configuration editor looking for a fix and one of the folders (the COM+ one) doesn't open with error 8007042C.</strong></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Virus might have damaged system files which cannot be fixed. Since the system restarts as soon as turn on your computer, I would suggest you to perform custom install of windows 7. Performing custom install will move all the files and folders on the installation
 drive to a folder named Windows.old. later you can recover files and folders from the same.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>

</p><p>If you're using <strong>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</strong>, a client/server protocol that automatically provides an Internet Protocol (IP) host with its IP address and other related configuration information such as the subnet mask and default

<p>
</p><p>Is this a desktop computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the screenshot, seems that there is no connection between your computer and the DHCP server (most of the time, the router).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some things to check:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if the ethernet cable connecting your computer and your router are properly connected. A light indicator on the computer's port/slot should light up. As well, as the light indicator on the router's port should also light up. If cables are connected
 properly but neither the router's port or the computer's are lighting up, try to change the ethernet cable.</li></ol>

<h2>            Original Xbox red and orange flashing lights</h2>
                    <p>I have an original xbox and just today it decided that it would no longer work. I want to fix it but I can't seem to find any information on what it means when the system attempts to boot twice and then seems to power on normally only has a flashing red and orange light on it. Nothing appears on the tv while this happens and I know its not that cords as I have test them with a different xbox. I would love to know how to fix this but at the very least I want to know what the flashing lights mean. Thanks!</p>

<br />
<p>One possible solution to this issue that&nbsp;I have found via Google&nbsp;is to make sure you have a default gateway configured in the network properties for your LAN adapter. Go to&nbsp;<strong>Start &gt; Run</strong> and type
<strong>cmd /k ipconfig</strong> and see if a default gateway is defined. If not go into the LAN adpater properties and temporairly configure a static IP, mask and default gateway address. The default gateway address should be your router's address.</p>

<p>Once Windows 7 indentifies your network you should be able to go in and change the network type.</p>

<p><span>Hi curtcook21,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. What is the make and model number of your laptop?</span></p>
<p><span>b. What happens when you click on the network type to change it?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Uninstall the network adapter and reinstall it. This should let you change the network type. If it doesn’t, I’d recommend setting
 up the network all over again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Disable User Account Control (UAC) and test.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>See if disable UAC helps you in changing the network type.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do I change the behavior of User Account Control by using the slider?</strong><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Uninstall and reinstall network adapter</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download the latest drivers for your network card by visiting either the laptop manufacturer’s website or the network card manufacturer’s
 website.</span></p>
<p><span>For driver updates, refer this link:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go
 to start, type device manager and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Locate
 your network adapter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-Click
 on it and select “Uninstall”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>This
 will remove the driver currently installed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 3:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Install the network card driver by double-clicking on the executable file. Test and see if this helps you in changing the network
 type.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: Set up the network again</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Start the configuration right from the scratch. That should take care of the problem.</span></p>

    <title>Uninstall Windows 8 or Install Nvidia Drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hawkeyegraduate  say:</h3>
<h2>            Uninstall Windows 8 or Install Nvidia Drivers</h2>
                    So I took the plunge and got Windows 8 Pro. &nbsp;Low and behold 6 hours later and the only feelings I have toward this OS are anger and frustration. &nbsp;The Nvidia GeForce GTX 660 Ti drivers will not install and the start menu is a pain. &nbsp;I could live with the
 completely useless Metro Start Menu if my month old graphics card could have its drivers installed properly, but after multiple attempts and hours of searching the Internet for an solution I still have gotten nowhere. &nbsp;Does anyone know how to get these Nvidia
 Drivers installed or a simple way to restore my machine back to Windows 7 where everything worked. &nbsp;I have a complete backup using the Windows Backup tool including a System Image. &nbsp;Details on my machine can be found below. &nbsp;If someone could help me get these
 drivers installed I would stick with Windows 8 but at this point reinstalling Windows 7 almost seems like the easier and simpler option.

            Hi
<div>Thanks for contacting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I find that you have Intel 3770 K, which happens to be 3rd generation Core i7 processor. Therefore, you need to first install the Intel display drivers and then proceed with the installation of nVidia drivers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unless you follow this procedure precisely, Windows detects only the Intel graphics processing engine of Core i7 processor and nVidia software too asks you to install the Intel driver first and then proceed with the nVidia installation.</div>

            Thank you for your response. &nbsp;I installed the Intel Display Drivers per your suggestion and this did not resolve the issue. &nbsp;Whenever I run the Nvidia Display Install Package it runs for a brief moment and then my entire machine crashes. &nbsp;When it crashes,
 it either displays the Blue Screen of Death (With a :( which is just kick while your Down) and says 'IQRL Not Less or Equal' or just goes black and the machine reboots. &nbsp;It then brings up a little thing that says 'Your PC ran into a problem' and then there
 is no record of anything from Nvidia being installed when I re-run the Nvidia Install Package.
<div><br />
<div>In the Device Manager Program under Display Adapters I have Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000 and Microsoft Basic Display Adapter (This is the 660 Ti)</div>
<div><br />
<div>This occurs on both the 310.90 and 310.70 Nvidia Driver Packages. &nbsp;Once again, if anyone knows a solution for this it would be appreciated. &nbsp;If not, I guess I will put in my Windows 7 install disc and wipe my drive and then go back to Windows 7.</div>

            <p>Interestingly, you can proceed with the driver update from the Device Manager itself, if you can't install the drivers through the application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Double click on the "Microsoft Basic Display Adapter"-&gt;go to Drivers tab-&gt;click Update driver. Choose look&nbsp;in internet for driver software. This will update the driver. If not, uninstall the 660 Ti&nbsp;driver(s)-&gt; restart the PC-&gt;reinstall/update the driver
 from device manager as mentioned above.</p>

            This did not work either, but I did get everything up and running by doing a clean install of Windows 8 and then reinstalling everything manually. &nbsp;It is frustrating that this was the method I finally had to use, but I now have Windows 8 Pro up and running
 with all my hardware also running smoothly. &nbsp;Thanks to everyone for your attempts to help me work through this issue.

            I am also having similar issues with ASUS GTX 660 Ti-OC. I have done multiple re-installs for refreshing &amp; resetting of Windows 8, both with internet turned off/on. But everytime I re-installed nVidia drivers, before &amp; after Windows Updates, never during,
 Windows 8 will fail to load.<br />
<br />
There are 3 lots of Microsoft Updates to date, and after each Update I was able re-start my PC perfectly. These are all excluding the Microsoft nVidia update. When there are no more Updates, I restart the PC again just to be sure before installing nVidia drivers.
 Every version of the drivers makes Windows 8 hang at the loading screen. Sometimes I can move my mouse around, sometimes it is just a blank and or flickering screen.<br />
<br />
So I tried installing nVidia drivers before any Windows Update (internet off), nVidia Drivers v306.23, v306.97, v310.70) worked fine. These are the first re-starts after installation. If I try to re-start a second time, or attempt to install v310.90, the blank
 screens comes back.<br />
<br />
Also note that v310.70 &amp; v310.90 seems to "crash" during installation. The screen would flicker and show my desktop. All I can see is the task bar, but none of the windows pop up when I click on the icons even though I can see them in the preview panes. Windows
 button does nothing, I can only move my mouse around, and closse the power-off / restart option.<br />

            I am not sure how you attempted to reinstall, but I did it by creating a installation flash drive and then booting up from that. &nbsp;I then wiped my drive that I was going to install Windows 8 on and then installed Windows 8 on the newly 'cleaned' drive.
 &nbsp;After the install finished, I installed all the drivers for the motherboard on ASUS's website listed under Windows 8 64bit and then installed the Nvidia Drivers before any Windows Updates. &nbsp;I had an Internet connection the entire time just for reference.
 &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>This is the method that got the Nvidia Drivers successfully installed on my machine.</div>

            I have not had any issues updating the Nvidia drivers after the initial pain of getting them installed. &nbsp;I am not sure if the recent drivers are more Windows 8 compatible, or if it's just a matter of getting them installed, but updating has not been an
 issue for me at least.

    <title>How to switch graphic card in Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barnihorv&#225;th  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to switch graphic card in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I have a hp g62 b-10eh with an Intel HD and an AMD Raedon graphic card. Using windows 7 if I clicked right click and pushed switchable graphic configurations I could easily switch between graphic cards. In windows 10 this got more complicated, I can only
 set which apps should use the AMD. I watch a lot of movies connecting my notebook to TV but hooking it up only works if my pc uses the raedon card all the time but AMD Catalyst literaly blocks movie players from using the AMD Raedon card thus connecting to
 TV is not possible.

<h2>            transferring  points between family members  </h2>
                    
<p>I can not transfer microsoft points between family members. I have been trying for the last 2 hours and have even called support and all they can tell me is wait. well this is not fair since I just bought 8000 points and that is over $100 and I can not even
 use them on other accounts. I believe that something should be done about this to make up for the trouble I have had to go through just to be told to wait. If i were to tell them that I am having technical problems and they would have to wait for money for
 my live account I am sure they would not let me get away with that why should I let them get away with it&nbsp;</p>

 tried the command prompt. But, both the suggested solutions could not solve the issue. Need help.
