<h2>            Cannot Boot Laptop due to possible Hard Drive Partition Missing or Errors</h2>
                    <p>This is my daughter's Toshiba Satellite C855-1GR laptop and before we begin please note she
<strong>does not</strong> have any recovery disks therefore I know our options are limited and don't need any lectures ;-) Hindsight is a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop originally came with Windows 7 Home Prem 64 bit but was upgraded to Windows 10 a while ago (I have copies of both Windows 7 and Windows 10 installation disks).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>She said that the other day automatic system updates were running and then the Toshiba Recovery Wizard appeared with a warning screen to make sure that all existing data was backup up (not sure how accurate that comment is).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards, the system would not boot properly with the following message is "Reboot and select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key". I have changed the boot sequence to start from the HDD first, tried boot from
 DVD first, etc and no joy. I looked in the Setup menu however in the Security Tab there is no "Secure Boot" option and in the Advanced Tab there is no "Boot mode" option.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have resigned to the fact that we may have to do a factory reset but cannot get to the option to perform this .. tried PF8, tried holding the "zero" key, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to use my other daughter's recovery disk for her Dell Laptop which runs on Windows 7 Home Prem which allows me to access the Advanced Options menu for System Restore, System Image Recovery, Startup Repair, Command Prompt, Go back to previous Build,
 etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I ran Startup Repair but gave that up after 2 days </li><li>System Restore says I "must specify which Windows Installation to restore, Restart computer etc." which I think would be OK if the laptop booted properly</li><li>System Image Recovery cannot find an image on my computer and asks that I insert a DVD with this which I don't have
<ul>
<li>Advanced Options suggests searching for an image on the Network which does exist, or<br />
</li><li>Install a driver ... I don't know which driver this refers to but have a copy of my Hard Drive driver which I have on a USB stick but a message appears "The specified location does not contain information about your hardware"</li></ul>
</li><li>Windows Memory Diagnostic cannot check for memory problems<br />
</li><li>The command prompt is for X: drive when I try to change to the C: drive it says "The device is not ready". I have also tried a factory reset from the Command Prompt using the command: rstrui.exe without success<br />
</li><li>Go back to previous Build message says "We ran into a problem and won't be able to take you back to the previous build. Try resetting your build instead"</li><li>Finally I have tried Reset this PC with the messages "The drive where Windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again" and "Unable to reset your PC. A required drive partition is missing"&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to reinstall Windows I can see Drive 0 unallocated Space 698.6GB but was told "Windows cannot be installed to this disk. This computer's hardware may not support booting to this disk. Ensure that the disk's controller is enabled in the Computers
 BIOS menu" which I resolved by updating the&nbsp;<span>Sata from AHCI to compatibility mode. When I now try to reinstall Windows to Drive 0 it says "We couldn't create a new partition or locate an existing one. For more information, see the Setup log files" ..
 I don't know where these log files are. &nbsp;</span> </p>
<p>
</p><p>So as you can see I have tried numerous attempts (and other not listed) but would welcome any others that anyone can think of.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said I am resigned to losing the data but would also appreciate any guidance on if it is possible to access or recreate the recovery partition in the Hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone anyone think that a new Hard Drive is required or whether you think the hard drive is still OK but if I should spend £43 on a Recovery USB from Toshiba?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My niece also has a Toshiba Satellite which is a different model L50-B-1DZ but has the same Hard drive ... would a copy of her recovery disks help access the hard drive or are the recovery disks unique to the serial on the Hard Drive?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance&nbsp; </p>

            <p>It seems at least possible that the hard drive has crashed, taking with it all of your programs and data as well as Windows.&nbsp; It sounds as if you have not made regular (any) backups, so if this is, in fact, the case, about all you will be able to do is buy
 a new hard drive and reinstall Windows using one of the installation disks you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the recovery disk you have and get back to the Command Prompt window that shows</p>
<p>
</p><p>X:\Sources&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type the following command and press Enter:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>bcdedit | find "osdevice"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>(the character before "find" is generally found all the way at the right end of the top row of letters on your keyboard)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What was the result?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now type the following commands shown in <strong>bold</strong> below between the lines of *****&amp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>You are correct she doe snot have any data back ups but fortunately nothing of any importance which if I could do a factory reset wouldn't be an issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. After entering bcdedit | find "osdevice" it says the specified command line is not valid. Run "bcedit /?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I have entered the unusual character properly. It was on the far left of the keyboard after pressing ALT GR

</p><p>*************************************************************************************</p>
<p>The rest of the command I originally gave you should have searched through the output from the bcdedit command to find just the line with "osdevice" in it (4th from the bottom in the sample above).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the results from the second command you used seem to confirm that there's a hardware problem with the hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This part</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On computer: MININT-9QCNML4</p>
<p>
</p><p>is no problem.&nbsp; That's just the name of your computer.&nbsp; It isn't significant in this context.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rest of what you reported, however, does not look good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This ...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Volume&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D &nbsp; Repair disc &nbsp; &nbsp; UDF&nbsp;&nbsp; DVD-ROM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 172MB &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Healthy</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>is the repair disc you used.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The other line, however, seems to describe something like an SD card reader.&nbsp; What it does not show is your hard drive.&nbsp; This is consistent with the message that you received -- "Reboot and select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot
 device and press a key" -- that is, the system is not finding any device from which it can start Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you were in the BIOS to set the boot order, was there anything there that suggested that the BIOS recognized your hard drive?&nbsp; Is there a hard drive test available in the Toshiba BIOS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's really difficult to find a hard drive diagnostic utility for Toshiba products.&nbsp; Because your system won't boot, you need a utility that runs from its own bootable CD rather than a Windows-based utility.&nbsp; The utility that I think has the best chance
 of working on your Toshiba laptop is Seagate SEATools for DOS.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/seatools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.seagate.com/support/downloads/seatools/</a>&nbsp; There is a guide for using the utility on the same page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The download from Seagate is an ISO file.&nbsp; If you have a working Windows 7 system, you should be able to just double-click the file and burn it to a CD using Windows 7 built-in utility.&nbsp; Otherwise, download (free) ImgBurn to create a bootable CD from the
 ISO file.&nbsp; <a href="http://imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After you've created that SeaTools CD, just put it in the CD drive and boot from it as you did with the system recovery disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the drive has failed, which seems likely, you can purchase a new drive from any number of online suppliers.&nbsp; Laptop drives are pretty standard, and you are not required to buy one from Toshiba (which, if they sell them at all, will be fairly expensive).&nbsp;
 You'll have to take the laptop apart to some degree in order to replace the drive.&nbsp; Some laptops are relatively easy; others are quite difficult and I've not researched yours to learn where it falls on that spectrum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If SEATools doesn't work on your laptop, or if all of the above seems too complex, take the laptop to an independent computer repair shop.&nbsp; Avoid chain stores, consumer electronics stores, office supply stores, and the like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

            <p>Thanks again LemP</p>
<p>
</p><p>yes it is a UK keyboard but I followed the rest of your advice and downloaded the SeaTools for DOS and burned a CD. It loaded OK in the laptop and recognised the Hitachi Hard Drive. However when I ran the "Short Test" after about 15 minutes there was no
 progress showing on the progress bar. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried the Acoustic Test and it said "The Drive Is Not Responding to commands. Check cables and drive power connection". I removed the hard drive, replaced the Lithium Battery, reinserted the Hard Drive and re ran the test .. same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this confirms the Hard Drive is a goner unless you have any other suggestions .. your help has been great (thank you).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I buy a replacement hard drive, will I then just have to load Windows or will the laptop automatically revert back to factory settings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>First thing after that will be to create a set of recovery disks .. assuming they will still be able to create with a new hard drive.</p>

</p><p>You can buy any 2.5" SATA drive as a replacement.&nbsp; The original apparently is a 750 GB 5200 rpm drive.&nbsp; You should get at least a 750 GB replacement if not a 1 TB.&nbsp; A 7200 rpm vs 5200 rpm drive may cost a slight bit more but should be somewhat more responsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, any of these would work, but because you're in the UK, you probably ought to search locally:</p>
<a href="http://www.drivesolutions.com/cgi/shop/drivestore.cgi?command=listitems&amp;kind=lthdsata&amp;pos=0&amp;type=group&amp;group=High%20Performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.drivesolutions.com/cgi/shop/drivestore.cgi?command=listitems&amp;kind=lthdsata&amp;pos=0&amp;type=group&amp;group=High%20Performance</a>
<p>
</p><p>You will have to load Windows manually (also known as a "clean install") using the Windows installation DVD that you have.&nbsp; You will also have go to the Toshiba web site (<a href="http://www.toshiba.co.uk/support/drivers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.toshiba.co.uk/support/drivers/</a>)
 and download all of the drivers.&nbsp; Save these on a CD or USB flash drive for installation after Windows is installed.</p>
<p>

            <p>From your earlier posts, it seems that you know how to set the boot order to boot from the DVD first and you were able to successfully boot from the SeaTools CD you created.&nbsp; Therefore, it sounds as if the Windows 7 install DVD is either corrupted or isn't
 what you think it is.&nbsp; Is it a genuine Microsoft Windows 7 installation DVD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create a Windows 7 sp1 installation disc by downloading the appropriate ISO file here:&nbsp;

            <p>Thank you again LemP for all your suggestions and help. I am delighted to tell you that we are back up and running!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 7 install disc was created from an ISO file I downloaded from Microsoft but also followed your advice to download another version from heidoc.net. For some reason when I downloaded the exe file and selected Windows 7 it would not let me proceed
 any further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I also had a Windows 10 install disc that was created from a ISO file downloaded from Microsoft and this worked which I though was strange. Also, interestingly I did not have to download any drivers ... even stranger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First action was to create a Recovery Disc!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully my experience and your support will help others if they find themselves in the same position.</p>

<p>Hello Angel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon opening my Windows Live Mail this morning I found that around 35 new emails from the past couple of days had appeared but nothing from today. I clicked on the send/receive tab and a sign in box appeared and after clicking on it a couple of times I receive
 some new emails from today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also had one email in my outbox from a couple of days ago which had not been sent and upon clicking the send button my Windows Live Mail closed down. I tried to reopen Windows Live Mail but I only received an error message with regards to attempting
 to send the email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then followed the steps that you advised for repairing the Windows Live Mail and then attempted to open it. This worked, albeit after clicking the login box about 4 times, but the email still won't send. I have deleted the email that I was trying to send,
 rewritten it and attempted to send it again but it is still sitting in the outbox. I have again clicked on the send/receive tab but all I get is the login box continually opening and an error message about attempting to send the email.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently building a Windows 10 LTSC 2019 reference image in a workgroup environment with multiple user accounts. I'd like to replicate the local
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">user</span> group policy applied to these local accounts so other devices with the same image and user accounts can receive the user policy I've applied to my reference machine. Is this possible?</p>

                    In file manager there is a arrow that has a drop down that shows previous locations I was wondeing what It does. Last night I checked and it was just a blank white box. Today everyone of them has something about a pc. Why would it change?(I clicked the
 drop down then pressed d which replaced the name then clicked out of it and then the pc thing started to show up) Should I be concerned?

            Hi Matthew
<br />
<br />Do you mean the button indicated in the image below?
<br />
<br />If so that just holds a temporary history of the folders you have looked at in Explorer in the current session.
<br />
<br />If you close file Explorer and open it again, that list will be clear . . .
<br />
<br />Its purpose is simply to provide a quick way to jump back to one of the folders you have already explored in the current File Explorer session. . .<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/811d7f50-5998-4724-9c5b-a966da625814?upload=true" />

            Hi Matthew, the arrow in the right, that is on the Address bar - is that correct?
<br />
<br />That is a long term memory of locations, that either been manually typed into that address bar or selected from that address bar
<br />
<br />That list will stay alive even after closing File Explorer and re-opening it . . .
<br />
<br />Think of that like the address bar in a web browser . . .
<br />
<br />May I ask what entries in that list concern you?<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/18eea225-f430-4510-8c05-130b97280ce6?upload=true" />

            Hi Matthew
<br />
<br />I regularly manually type addresses into that address bar and those items end up in that history list. I doubt you do that, so there must be some other action that adds items to that list
<br />
<br />Either say, it is nothing to worry about and cannot have an adverse effect on your PC
<br />
<br />If you want to delete that list, right click in the address bar and choose 'Delete History' . . .

            Hi Matthew,
<br />
<br />Rest assured, deleting the History will only remove the history, nothing else, and it will have absolutely no effect on the rest of the functioning of your PC !

<h2>            Microsoft Solitaire Collection Daily Challenges bug in Spider - June 25, 2019</h2>
                    <p>In the&nbsp;Microsoft Solitaire Collection Daily Challenges for June 25, 2019, there is a bug in Spider. Upon finishing the game successfully, the failure alert comes up. The "cancel" option (Rückgängig machen in my German version) ends the game, because obviously
 there's nothing to go back to. The OK option does the same. In other words, there's no way to win the game.</p>

<h2>            What is being done about the harmful Windows 10 updates received on 3-13-18&#63;</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader2">I have Windows 10 Home User desktop PC, Build 10.0.16299.248.
</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Late on the evening of 3-13-18, I received the updates shown below. Please note the updates dated 3-13-18:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/49445a8e-25bd-4e51-922c-905f2bd0710a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/49445a8e-25bd-4e51-922c-905f2bd0710a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2">After I restarted my PC on the morning of 3-14-18, I noticed that taskmgr.exe was not displaying. I restarted it with the same results. I restarted my PC and still Task Manager would not display. Next, I tried to run Windows Media
 Player. It was hanging with an hour glass so I couldn't close it by clicking the red "X." Then I noticed that "Notifications" would not come up, nor would left-clicking on the Windows icon on the left corner of the task bar do anything.
</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2">There may well have been more problems than these, I don't know. I called tech support which was no help. Next I posted here about these problems and one of the suggestions was to restore to a restore point prior to the time when
 these updates arrived. I did this successfully as shown below:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/375f8ca8-3644-4e34-84da-8efc15d206b7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/375f8ca8-3644-4e34-84da-8efc15d206b7?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">After this restore, all the problems I encountered earlier went away. Everything is running normally as far as I can tell.</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Since most of the updates refer to "Microsoft Office 2007..." and I have Microsoft Office 365, are these correct updates for my Office 365 programs?</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a943b51-ae5d-48c6-8b65-ccd2f3644dfb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a943b51-ae5d-48c6-8b65-ccd2f3644dfb?upload=true" /></a></p>

            Hi Tim.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There's a lot of turmoil with Windows Updates right now, with problematic Updates being withdrawn and updated while a half billion PC's are being rescanned constantly to sort each them all out.  So unless it's interfering with performance I'd give it a few weeks to sort itself out. 
<br />
<br />If it is interfering or you don't want to wait then there is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />You can try installing Updates manually from Microsoft Update catalog by searching for them here:   <a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=Windows%2010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search....</a>
<br />
<br />If Updates cause problems you can find out which one by checking at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History and uninstall them there.  
<br />
<br />You can block Windows Updates and Version Updates:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-unwanted-windows-updates-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-unwanted-wi...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also install this tool to tell you exactly your level of protection needed for the CPU threat that has lately caused some disruption, how it may affect performance, and what you can do about it:  <a href="https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm</a>
<br />
<br />You can get more control over Windows Updates with some new features in the last two versions at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update under Restart Options and set Active Hours when you don't' want to be bothered.
<br />
<br />As a last resort, you can set a Metered Connection or disable Windows Update service and only install the Version Updates twice a year when you are ready via the most stable method - which isn't Windows Update anyway, but by running it from Media Creation Tool or the media it creates:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  All previous Updates are rolled up in the Version Update.
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello, the DVD driver may have gone incompatible after the latest Windows 10update. Go to the laptop manufacturer website and find the latest DVD driver that supports your latest version of Windows 10, and go into Device Manager and look for the drivers automatically. 
<br />Hope this helps, and let me know for more questions!

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows Updates no longer works until you have service pack 3 installed. To overcome this problem you need to get to SP3 manually.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First it is recommended to get Internet Explorer back to IE6 if you have already updated it to a later version. Use Control Panel Add or Remove Programs to do this.</p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Verify your current service pack level...</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Hold down the Windows key (between Ctrl and Alt) and hit the Pause Break key</span>
</li><li><span>Examine what is listed in the System: section regarding your service pack level</span>
</li><li><span>Also, make a note of your processor type in the Computer: section (see later)</span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>If there is no service pack level designated, first you must download SP2 from...</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=28</font></a></span></p>
<p><span>...and then run the downloaded program to install SP2. You can ignore the text that says that it is for network installations and also ignore the text advising Windows/Microsoft Update if only updating one PC.</span></p>
<p><span>As an alternative to SP2 you could download SP1A (xpsp1a_en_x86.exe) from…</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://slug.ceca.utc.edu/ftp/pub/windows/patches/winxp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">http://slug.ceca.utc.edu/ftp/pub/windows/patches/winxp/</font></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>…which a fellow contributor <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5a8f0406-1930-485b-a7f1-796a68549081">
<span><font color="#0000ff">Daavee</font></span></a> found.</span></span><span> It is half the size of SP2 so should be quicker. However, as you can see, it is not a Microsoft web site.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Once you have done that, or if you were already at service pack 1, 1A or 2, you can install SP3, but before you do, read this article…</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950717</font></a></span></p>
<p><span>Install SP3 by downloading and running from...</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=24</font></a></span></p>
<p><span>…again, you can ignore the text that says that it is for network installations and also ignore the text advising Windows/Microsoft Update if only updating one PC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then try and get up to date with Windows Updates.</span></p>

You don't have to setup multiple accounts - it is just a good idea.</p>

            <blockquote>In the last 12 hours I have read so many blogs and forums. 1) Safe mode tried everyone... still brings the same log in screen I cannot switch user to administrator there is no switch user button. 2) been there done that 3) obviously
 my only answer will be to attach my terabyte drive do a complete backup. and do a full restore clearing my entire system and starting from scratch. 4) for the honest person who is only trying to get into a system that is there own, there should be an easier
 answer then all of that. 5) I need to obviously access the administrator account....... why cant I and why is there not an easy way to do that. Most laptops etc are preinstalled and do not arrive with a disk or an software engineer degree to go with it.......
 most of us are users and not power users and need the KISS theory (keep it simple stupid). 6) if I have to take the advise of the link that you provided , I guess I will have to download someone else solution to this issue. Microsoft should have the same download
 available for this type of issue, since it is apparently is very common. 7) so I guess I now search for something I really dont want to put on my system. all I can say is UGH. I dont not want a hackers result I dont want a **** result, I want a microsoft result
 to this problem.</blockquote>
<p><br />
1) If it wasn't enabled, I can see that.</p>
<p>2) Been there, done what?&nbsp; Oh - you must be referring to the link I gave.</p>
<p>3) Not true, but probably the only answer anyone here can give you.</p>
<p>4) There is, cannot post it here.&nbsp; As stated.</p>
<p>5) The laptops come pre-installed without disks because people don't ask for them.&nbsp; Usually people can, even after the fact, get them from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>6) It's not super-common.&nbsp; It happens, but usually only once to any given person.</p>
<p>7) There is no Microsoft result other than a repair installation really.&nbsp; The other solutions (Google search for Nordahl lost password and look for Petri's website) are 'hacks' but most just blank the password you have so you can get in.&nbsp; Many come including
 in recovery tools/bootable media like the Ultimate Boot CD for Windows.</p>
<p>Sorry I cannot be clearer.</p>

            With a used computer, the first thing to <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">always</span>
</em>do is restore the computer to factory condition. Refer to the netbook manual or Toshiba's tech support website to see how to restore your netbook to factory condition.

<p>No, I don't think it's a "bit late for that". But if you don't mind running with whatever the previous owner may have done - malware, dodgy websites, pr0n - that's your choice. The link you cited isn't particularly useful to you. Windows 7 Starter has the
 registry just like any other version of Windows since Win95.</p>
<p>Start&gt;Search box&gt;type: regedit</p>
<p>When regedit appears in Results above, right-click it and choose "Run as administrator". Supply the OK/password to UAC and the Registry Editor will open elevated. Now navigate to:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion</p>
<p>Here is a link about how to do this with pictures:</p>

<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Why do you need the Boot/BCD file?</span></p>

</span></span></span><span>What do you want to accomplish?</span></p>

<p>
<span>There are 3 party programs which can edit the BCD.</span></p>

<p>Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/513f5470-172a-4ad8-959e-bdc74358c611" title="SteffanArnnasson1">

<p>
</p><p>If I am reading your post correctly, it sounds like you are attempting to set up
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is-caller-identification-and-how-do-i-set-it-up?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype Caller ID</a>.</p>
<p>If that is the case, unfortunately Skype Caller ID can be set up using only a mobile number or a Skype Number:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.skype.com/go/callerid/?intcmp=CS-Upsell-FA1248-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>Caller identification</em></a><em> lets your friends, family and business contacts know you're calling them. When you have set up caller identification, your mobile number or
<a href="http://www.skype.com/go/onlinenumber/?intcmp=CS-Upsell-FA1248-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype Number</a> is displayed when you call mobiles and landlines from Skype.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If your land line telephone number can not receive SMS (text) messages, then it can not be used for Skype Caller ID, I'm afraid.
</p>

<h2>            Minecraft xbox one edition discount</h2>
                    
<p>Hi I notice about 1-2 months ago there was a discount on the minecraft xbox one edition for $5. I didn't have the money back then and when I went to go check today, it was back at regular price for $20. You can only get the discount if you owned the 360
 edition. Can you guys possibly do another limited time offer. And give a specific date when the discount will start and end. Thank you and hopefully you can make it happen</p>

            <p>Hey, funnybones498! As you can see on <a href="https://microsoftstudios.com/news/2014/09/05/minecraft-xbox-one-edition-the-big-f-a-q/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this announcement here</a>, the promotion started back in September of 2014 and ended in February of this year, one and a half years after the game was released. This promotion will not be reactivated, and you will need to purchase the game at full price if you would like the game.</p>
<p>As Smwutches said, you will want to keep an eye on <a href="http://majornelson.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">majornelson.com</a> for dates on promotions and when they will end. Thanks for understanding!</p>

</p><p>Today there are 3 "General Types" of RAID</p><p>
</p><p>Software, Hybrid (some hardware with software checks), and Hardware.<br />
<br />Personally, I think the Software and Hybrid are a waste of time and misleading when claims of reliability are usually made. In most cases, an effective backup plan is better than these. All too often the RAID software and/or Hybrid model actually cause a failure. Or what is supposed to protect the system in drive crashes and failures ends up being the cause of them. Hardware RAID is by far the best.<br />
Hardware RAID<br />
<a href="http://www.bestpricecomputers.co.uk/glossary/raid-controller.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bestpricecomputers.co.uk/glossary/raid-controller.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Hardware RAID is a physical hard drive controller that provides the drive interactions needed<br />
to perform a reliable redundant array.<br />
<br />
Intel RAID controllers<br />
<a href="http://www.intel.com/products/server/raid/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.intel.com/products/server/raid/index.htm</span></a><br />

<a href="http://www.adaptec.com/en-US/products/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.adaptec.com/en-US/products/</span></a></p><p>
</p><p>Many low-cost add-in hardware RAID controllers are really a Hybrid where some of the action<br />
is done by the hardware card and the rest (and often most important functions) are performed<br />
by the CPU of the system using software RAID.</p><p>

<h2>            My DVD&#47;CD-ROM drive isn&#39;t playing any DVD&#39;s</h2>
                    <p>I'll first mention my system's specifications:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Pro 1903, 64-bit (OS build: 18362.207)</p>
<p>Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3740QM CPU @ 2.70 GHz, 4.00GB RAM, 500GB HDD<br />
HP Elitebook 8470p (Yes I'm using a laptop, it's a used/second-hand one)</p>
<p>My&nbsp;DVD/CD-ROM drive is "hp DVDRAM GT80N". It has the DVD logo printed outside of it so it should play DVD's right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this is enough; if there are any more specifications you need to know, please don't hesitate to ask!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've rented two DVD's of movies for my viewing pleasure: Aquaman and Venom. Yet, when I insert those DVDs into my laptop, my system gets very slow, sometimes it gets too slow to recognise the DVD I've inserted. It sometimes recognises the Aquaman DVD but
 not the Venom one. Even if it recognises the Aquaman DVD, I can't play it. VLC media player either takes a long time (which seems like forever because it still doesn't play after like, half an hour) or it shows a 12-second video that doesn't play either. I
 can't play Venom because my laptop couldn't recognise the DVD at all. EDIT: There are sounds coming from the DVD drive when I insert my DVDs though, sometimes loud, sometimes soft, sometimes no sound (which may come back).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling the DVD/CD-ROM drive using Device Manager and then restarting my laptop to reinstall drivers, but that doesn't work. I thought it could be a region code issue, so I set my DVD drive (which had no region code to it before this) to Malaysia,
 where I am, so Region 3. My DVD's are for Region 3 as well. But that doesn't work too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried inserting an Audio CD from a textbook and it works well, I can play all the audio with clarity. Yet I couldn't play my DVD's. My laptop is the only device that could play DVD's. I have no separate DVD player. Someone please help me before I'm due
 to return my DVD's next week. Thank you so much in advance.</p>

            Hi Kishen
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. This is more likely to be a hardware issue or CD/DVD issue. Please check your CD/DVDs are not scratched and in good shape. 
<br />
<br />2. Try to clean your CD/DVD with a clean cloth to remove dirt etc. Also clean the lens of the CD/DVD drive.
<br />
<br />3. From Windows side, you should try following -
<br />
<br />A. Uninstall &amp; reinstall CD/DVD driver - Do it again though you have already done it.
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; View tab &gt; Show Hidden Devices &gt; Expand DVD/CD Drives &gt; Right click on entry below &gt; Uninstall Device &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />B. Review following Microsoft Help
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/314060/your-cd-or-dvd-drive-is-not-recognized-by-windows-or-other-programs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/314060...</a>

<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<p>My DVD's are in good shape, no scratches. Like new. I've cleaned the DVD and the lens of the CD/DVD drive too.</p>
<p>And I've uninstalled &amp; reinstalled the CD/DVD driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately everything's still the same; no changes, no improvements.<br />
EDIT: It seems that your link is about errors with the CD/DVD drive under "properties" when you right click the CD/DVD drive. I've clicked properties but it says "This device is working properly."</p>

            UPDATE: I've used a friend's laptop too see whether do the DVD's work for his laptop. The Venom DVD works well, but his laptop couldn't recognise Aquaman. Gosh I hope I didn't damage the Aquaman DVD from inserting and removing it too much from my laptop.
 I wanted to uninstall his CD/DVD drive driver and restart his laptop, but he was busy and had to take his laptop elsewhere.

<p>Anyone/anything else?<br />
<br />
I tried another friend's laptop, both DVD's work well thankfully.<br />
<br />
So my laptop only seems to best recognise both the Aquaman and Venom DVD's if I insert them after I shut my laptop down and turn it on again (not restarting it, but shutting it down and then turning it on again manually using the power button). Even then, my
 laptop has trouble playing it...my system gets very slow, sometimes file explorer crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really appreciate some further help...</p>

            Hi JASniper, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />It sounds like there may be a system file corruption after the update. You can use the System File Checker to see if it can repair anything:
<br />
<br />- Click Start and type cmd.
<br />- Right-click Command Prompt and run it as administrator.
<br />- Type sfc /scannow
<br />- Press Enter.
<br />
<br />Also try booting into Safe Mode to see if the problem goes away:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/...</a>
<br />
<br />If Safe Mode fixes the problem, then it's probably a background task or service causing the issue. In that case, try a clean boot:
<br />

<br />
<br />Let me know how you go! Thanks!

<h2>            Reusing a GT on my old corrupted account.</h2>
                    
<p>I had a gamertag MABUHAY KA,that I use to use but had problems with it and was told by a person at microsoft that the tag was corrupted.Somehow the windows live email account was some how reset to a previous email address and some also made login impossible
 evan with the password that was on account.Is there a way to have that name taken off that account so I can use it.I am not looking to get tag back which would be nice,but I was made a deal and took it so I am not looking for that.If there is anyway I could
 use the tag MABUHAY KA again I would be happy.</p>

<p>I can not access the account,cause it was some how corrupted at Microsofts end and my access was taken from me-not intentionaly.My questiuon is -is there a way someone on microsofts end that could delete or change gamertag name so I could use the name.Is
 there any process or steps that could be taken to do this.I know I would have to prove ownership somehow.</p>

<p>You could try calling support to see if they could, but that would be your only hope and I'm not sure they'll do it.</p>
