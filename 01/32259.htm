<h2>            Cortana does not recognize all german commands, opens BING search, English language works fine</h2>
                    <p>I'm facing the following issue with Cortana on my Windows 10 Pro (Upgraded from 8.1):</p>
<p>Cortana works fine with commands like creating appointments or reminders, but when asked to tell a joke "Erzähl einen Witz" or "Wie geht es Dir" (How are you), only a BING search in EDGE is executed.</p>
<p>Setting region and language to English / US, everything works fine, also "Tell me a joke".</p>
<p>Setting things back to german, many of the commands that should work, are not recognized and only a web search is executed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas, how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my settings:</p>

<h2>            This App can&#39;t&#47;won&#39;t run on you PC. Tried multiple web fixes to no avail</h2>
                    <p>Hello and greetings, I am having a really hard time with Windows&nbsp;10 since their latest two big content patches. Prior to that, my PC had been running perfectly since Windows 10 release and upgraded from windows 8.1 for free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've had to change nothing and added nothing to my Pc in that time&nbsp;other than Western Digital My book that I keep plugged in for backup reasons. I made that part of the system back in early 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, over the past few months, my PC will just stop responding to any kind of input in the Chrome browser or start up any kind of program. It usually happened&nbsp;while I am doing something in another program, typing something in word or working on some video
 editing or playing a game. When I alt-tab out to check something online and put the address in it just sits there. The Home button doesn't work, the back key, bookmarks nothing. I close Chrome and try to open it again and I get the Blue Windows error window
 of. The app cant runs on your PC. Please check with the manufacturer for an updated version. Or something similar to that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll alt-tab&nbsp;back into my program that is working fine and close it and try to reopen it, I'll get the error. Nothing works. Edge won't work, Firefox won't&nbsp;work. I can't open task manager, anything. The only thing that works is the start window and I can
 shut the PC down. However, Restart does not work. The screen will go black and it will just stay in a perpetual limbo of try to shut down and then restart, which due&nbsp;to the issue I am having is unable to do so.</p>
<p>Things I have tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Full in-depth virus, malware, rootkit detection. -Nothing.</p>
<p>2. I have system restored back to around February before the latest Content patch. -The error still pops up a couple days later.</p>
<p>3. I have system restored back to prior to the big update at the end of the 2017 year. - The error still popped up a couple days later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It had gotten to the point where I have to force shut off my PC at least 4 times a day and restart it, for me to do anything.</p>
<p>This past Wednesday, I wiped all of my hard drives to brand spanking new. I left nothing on them. I reinstalled windows 10 to basic. (Which of course was the latest patch that just came out over the past few months. I am on Windows Version: version 1803
 (OS Build 17134.112).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well anyway, all of my drivers for just my basic HID's were installed and my AV, Chrome and a handful of video games, oh and Office. The error just popped again. I was playing Tomb Raider on my right monitor and I had Chrome up on the left. I Alt-tabbed
 out to find out more about the area I was in, in the game, and the input would not take. It just blinked, the home button would not take. I closed Chrome and re-opened it and the error popped up; This app can't work on your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really at a loss as what to do now. The latest Windows 10 version has broken my PC after 5+years of perfect operation. I don't have any other Operating systems from previous versions and obviously, I can't backpedal&nbsp;to an earlier version of Windows 10.
 Can someone please tell me what I need to do? I can't be without my PC, it's how I pay the bills and right now I can't work on it without it telling me the same programs that have worked on this same Windows 10 PC for half a decade no longer works.</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Mereinid</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to verify, please tell us the make and model of your device, as well as the complete hardware specification. In the mean time, I would also like to suggest performing a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clean Boot</a></strong> and observe if you will still have the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the outcome.</p>

<p>Here is my system. I'll get back to you with the results of the Clean Boot. I have to fly to Washington for a few days. I'll be back mid-week, with luck.
</p>
<p>However, I have no idea when this error takes place. It's completely random. I freshly installed Windows 10 on Wednesday and it didn't do the first error popup until Saturday. So I could be in Clean Boot for a while. Thank you, Mark, for answering my reply
 and trying to help me out.</p>

<p>Hello Mark, sorry for the delay, I got held up in Washing for a bit longer than I had anticipated.</p>
<p>Anyway, I put my machine into clean boot mode about 9 pm&nbsp;Tuesday Night, after my PC had to be hard shut off because of the same error I have been getting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It happened four times on Tuesday&nbsp;throughout the day. I thought I had beat it when I used the clean boot as it ran great, (great meaning no messages saying "THis App can't run on your version of Windows please contact the Manufacturer&nbsp;for an updated...blah
 blah.) Well, the same message just popped up about 15mins ago, I was playing Skyrim Special Edition. I had been playing it since about 2 pm&nbsp;CST this afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then the game quits and puts me to the desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then tried to check my Gmail&nbsp;since I was kicked off the game and that's&nbsp;when I knew chrome wouldn't pull up, all I received was the word Blank on the Chrome tab. I X'ed off Chrome and tried to restart it and the blue banner message popped up after dimming
 my monitor telling me the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty clueless where to go now. There was absolutely nothing running on the PC other than Steam game console and Mod Organizer 2. (which is required to run a modded Skyrim Special Edition)</p>
<p>Other than that...OH Chrome was running as I had a Skyrim Game map pulled up on my secondary monitor. But nothing else. No Antivirus no windows defender...nothing!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean wiping the hard drives don't work. I really have no idea what to do about it. I have two other laptops in the house and they&nbsp;are not affected by this and never have been. I upgraded the two laptops at the same time I upgraded this desktop of mine,
 back when Windows 10 launched and it was free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to hear from you soon, thank you so much. I am going to go back to normal running mode since running in clean boot doesn't stop it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Matthew Elliott</p>

In addition to everything that has allready been mentioned you need to take into account that the problems could be related to heavy usage on the YouTube site itself.&nbsp; Doesn't matter how fast your computer or ISP is if YouTube's servers are being slowed by
 heavy traffic.&nbsp; Just a thought to consider.

            Hi Therayman,<br />
<br />
You can also click to start the video and then pause until the download bar gets all the way to the end. Then hit Play and it should play back smoothly.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to effectively assist you, kindly provide us the information we need below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are those the only update components you're having issues with?</li><li>Are you using any third-party antivirus programs?</li><li>If yes, have you tried disabling them and see if it helps?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Antivirus software can help you protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn’t disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you’re done. If you’re connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>

<p>We would suggest contacting the developer of those antivirus programs on how to disable them to isolate the issue further and see if it would make a difference. Since for most scenarios, third party antivirus programs can cause issues in downloading and
 installing your updates.</p>

            Turns out that since they are the free versions they are only on when I run a scan. Anti virus can't be the problem because I wasn't running them when i tried to install the updates.

<p>Even if the third party antivirus programs are free versions, they are still running in the background and is mostly the reason why some updates are not being downloaded and installed properly. And since they are free versions, you can try to uninstall them
 and then try to see if it helps just for us to isolate the issue further and you can choose to install them again if they are not the source of the issue.

<h2>            Microsoft&#39;s &#34;3rd World&#34; Call Center Tech Support is ABOMINABLE and Unacceptable.</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Tech support has become PATHETIC since this greedy company has move essentially ALL their support to the worthless contracted call centers in India and the Philippines. All those Morons know is what is printed out in their 3-ring answer binders
 and have no capabilities in actual diagnostic services. They also have no Conscience is F'ing up your computer or calling you back when they PROMISE or are scheduled too and MSFT could care less because they have no place for THEIR CUSTOMERS to file grievance
 complaints about the Horrific service from them!!&nbsp; Putting 2+2 together, it's no guess work to figure out that MSFT's new Indian CEO has shifted (not) SERVING their customers to 3rd World (in)capable India or the Phillipines!!<br />
<br />
When I buy a new computer, it's WON'T have Windows on it (probably buy a Mac reluctantly) and I'm presently building up a Intel NUC Mini system and it's NOT getting Windows either, I'll install Linus Ubuntu instead. I've been in IT (AS 400 Server systems) for
 32 years, a (formerly) staunch Microsoft customer and supporter with 400 shares of MSFT in my IRA which I will sell immediately. Microsoft, you've lost a Customer and a "Friend".<br />
<br />
Microsoft ... YOU are cutting your own throat with your Greed by screwing your own customers outsourcing NECESSARY support to the 3rd world morons you use INSTEAD of American employees. You have become Everything BAD about US Mega companies, Greed and Profit
 ahead of a conscience for your customers!. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My case # 1442686279 and the Indian Agents that said they would call back are Ahlora Rae (Tier 2) and Preetham T who swore repeatedly he would make sure I would get a scheduled call today, which never happened 3 hours ago ....... AGAIN for the 4th time!!<br />

            I am shocked that Microsoft values the tech support they offer their customers so little. They crashed my computer real bad and when 2 tech's in a row could not figure out how to fix it they both hung up on me. I think they're pressured to no spend too
 much time with one customer because they both hung up on me after about 2 hours. The third tech fixed the computer but Windows 10 got deleted in the process. He wanted me to pay for the software in order to reinstall it! That wasn't going to happen! We went
 back and forth for a while and then he told me I had to got to a Microsoft store and have the software installed. In the end that's what I did and they installed it without question. They also fixed a few other things tech support had screwed up. They suggested
 that moving forward I bring my lap top to the store. While they were professional about it , it was obvious they had concerns about tech support. I felt strongly about making a complaint about my ordeal. After an aggressive search to lo

<h2>            Lag problems&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Sometimes I get these random lag spikes on xbox live. It's been happening for about a month and it's very frustrating. It didn't happen a few months ago but now it's just a constant struggle to remain connected. Occasionally I will completely disconnect
 from xbox live... I don't think this should be happening. My ISP is road runner and I have a linksys wrt54g router. These are my speedtest results: http://www.speedtest.net/result/1382259714.png</p>
<p>Can anybody help me?</p>

<p>
</p><p>btw, CC states that the issue is one of not opening the application.&nbsp; Therein lies my concern.</p>

<p>If you weren't using CCleaner's Registry Cleaner component, there wouldn't be an issue.</p>

            <p><span>So I’m looking at my startup items and my scheduled tasks and I’m trying to understand what does what.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Anyway, I googled ‘provtool.exe’ and noticed that one of the search results is this&nbsp;Microsoft page.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Thinking I’ve hit pay-dirt, I start reading and I have the same question as Cyberden1, that being – what is provtool.exe and what does it do?<span>&nbsp;
</span>No offence PA Bear but if you don’t know just say so or better yet, don’t clog up the pipes with advice that wasn’t asked for.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I’m not passive-aggressive but as I read my own post – gosh, I can’t say this without sounding like the elitist I abhor.

<h2>            Does the DisplayPort on Surface surpport &#34;thunderbolt&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I believe the answer is no since I it does not mention ThunderBolt in the specs, but I want to make sure.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see that Belkin has&nbsp;a much anticipated Thunderbolt Express dock (<a href="http://www.belkin.com/us/Belkin-Thunderbolt-Express-Dock/p/P-F4U055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.belkin.com/us/Belkin-Thunderbolt-Express-Dock/p/P-F4U055</a>)&nbsp;that would be an ideal companion to
 the Surface Pro when setting it up in you home/work office.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, there are still USB 3.0 docking stations, but this seemed like it would be better for the higher bandwidth to the devices.</p>

            Hello MikeVWood,<br />
<br />
That's a great question. The Surface Pro does not have a Thunderbolt port as you can see in the tech specs you mentioned. You can use USB 3.0 for similar connections.<br />
<br />
Please check <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/Home?Language=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            I have done a few music vids for youtube where I have done this to a limited extent...your project sounds like it's a little more ambitious but - yes I think you should be able to get there. What kind of audio&nbsp;file are you working from?

            <p>A bit more info - I had a look back through one of my projects where I had used this kind of associated editing.</p>
<p>My method was to edit the audio file independently and then add the pictures to the edited files before joining the whole lot together. I created wav files in 'Audacity' (free audio editing software) and split the track into the four sections where I wanted
 images to start and finish. If close editing is required it's easier to be making the music track fit the pictures rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>Otherwise you just have to use the fine tuning of the image duration - the audio 'waveform' track might help a bit more with alignment but it's not that easy to read in MM - if you want me to expand on any of this let me know...R.</p>

                    <p>I've just updated to w10 Fall's Creator Update and when I check in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security</p>
<p>this shows...any solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also some windows store apps doesn't work, well kinda, They opened and just sit there.</p>
<p>I tried to UNINSTALL / RE-INSTALL the apps, it did not work. The thing is while the&nbsp;</p>
<p>WINDOWS STORE works when I try to install an app it FAILS! Click the install button, waited</p>
<p>and NOTHING HAPPENS. Unlike before if you try to install an app it will notify you if</p>
<p>the installation is successful, if unsuccessful you receive an error report. But this one</p>

            I'm not surprised you are having trouble with Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1709, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />
<br />You can try the following to see if you can get the Store and Windows Update working:
<br />
<br /> Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete try opening the Store again.
<br />
<br />Also check if the Store works in another user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: wsreset.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.
<br />
<br />Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + X.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows Key + X on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.
<br />
<br />2. Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver
<br />
<br />3. Now rename the SoftwareDistribution and Catroot2 folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />
<br />4. Now, let’s restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. Typethe following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                        net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />                        net start cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                        net start bits
<br />
<br />                        net start msiserver
<br />
<br />5. Type Exit in the Command Prompt to close it and then restart the computer. 
<br />

<h2>            Small blue circle with two arrows on every icon appeared recently. What is it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago I noticed all my desktop icons have a small blue circle on the lower right-hand corner, and there are two white arrows in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what it is signifying? I'm not using Norton Backup, as was a suggestion in an old Windows Vista thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attached a small screen grab to illustrate what I'm talking about.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you understand why you are seeing these blue circles on your desktop icons, please answer the questions below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are these shortcuts for local files?</li><li>Did you install a new software?</li><li>Do you have any virtual drives on the computer?</li><li>Are you enabling sync on your device?</li></ul>
<p>Please go through your programs and check for a virtual drive. It is most likely what is causing this to happen on your desktop shortcuts. The files seem to updating in your virtual drive software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this clarifies the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to ask us if you have other concerns.</p>

<h2>            Update error, internal HD unable to format, etc.</h2>
                    
<p>went to update Thursday Dec. 4, update failed, received this status code:&nbsp;</p>
<p>417F 0000 0080 0300 8007 0070</p>
<p>Console is a year and a half old, 4GB internal memory with an external harddrive plugged in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>a few weeks prior to the update error, the internal HD, after working fine for a year and a half, suddenly became unformatted and was unable to be formatted</p>
<p>the external drive has nearly 5GB free space and has room enough for the update, right? Could the fact that my internal drive is seemingly corrupted cause the update to fail?</p>
<p>need help, thanks</p>

            <p>Greetings Dracarys!</p>
<p>Just to clarify, are you referring the internal flash memory (4GB), as "the internal HD"? If so, I'm sorry, but if your console's internal flash memory shows as "Unformatted", then it has become inaccessible for use.</p>
<p>The only resolution is to send your console in for a repair. Here's how: <a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://myservice.xbox.com/</a></p>

<h2>            why do I hear sounds like door openning ding don&#63;</h2>
                    Periodically I hear sounds coming from my PC. Like a squeaking door opening and closing or a kind of ding dong sound&gt; I don't know what it is or what it means? Can someone please tell me.

            <p>Go to Control panel, Sound then click on the Sounds tab of the dialog that opens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Play each of the sounds in the Program events section by selecting each item in turn then clicking Test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description, I think you might mean sounds that are, by default, set up for the device connect &amp; disconnect events so you might want to scroll down to these to test them first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This procedure is a bit tedious but it will get you the answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then all you have to do is find out why the event is happening.&nbsp; Just for example, I have a USB connector that must be a bit of a loose fit for the external drive's USB&nbsp;plug so I do hear a ding dong if I move the laptop when it is connected&nbsp;into that USB
 socket &amp; then again a few moments later when it sorts itself out again.</p>

    <title>Accidentally Uninstalled Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sabarinath n p  say:</h3>
<h2>            Accidentally Uninstalled Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>A week ago, I bought a Lenovo IdeaPad Z510 laptop with pre-installed Windows 8.1. Recently, I tried to install Ubuntu and while doing so I accidentally installed Ubuntu by replacing Windows. That is, I formatted the entire hard disk and only Ubuntu is available
 now (No Windows or Lenovo drivers). Is there any way to get the working Windows back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought of this work around: I can take back up from my friend who also bought the exact same laptop and I can install that in my computer. But the problem is I don't have the product key and hence I don't know how to activate even if I restore using my
 friend's Windows backup. So, is there any way I can get the license keys? Note that, I bought the original licensed version of Windows and they din't provide any CD as it is pre-installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By making little research, I found that activation is linked with BIOS. See this link
<a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/windows-8-moves-to-bios-based-product-keys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.cnet.com/news/windows-8-moves-to-bios-based-product-keys/</a>.</p>
<p>If it is true, then is it possible for me to use the above work around to get back my Windows (licensed) and other drivers?</p>

            <p>You can perform a complete clean install of Windows 8.1, you are supposed to have your product key on a sticker on the bottom of your computer. The only option now is to buy a windows 8.1 CD from the Microsoft Store and install windows. You will have to
 install drivers after you install Windows at <a href="http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>When you click next you should see an option to "Repair your Computer", Click that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 3- You should see Advanced Repair options, Click that</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 4- Click Command Prompt</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 5- Type "<strong>diskpart</strong>" (all without quotation marks)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Type "<strong>list disks</strong>" &nbsp;(you should see your hard drive with the size in MB's)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Type "<strong>select disk</strong> __" &nbsp;(in the space type in your Hard Drive disk number listed in list disks) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(don't use __)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After you select the disk Type "<strong>clean</strong>"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>Restart</strong> after the process is done</p>

            I think recovery media will not work here as I have formatted the hard disk which deleted the recovery partition too. Hence, any recovery methods will not work. I need to just reinstall Windows 8.1 using some installation disk. So, can I make an "Installation
 Media" (not recovery media) from an another laptop with working Windows 8.1 ?

            <p>Hi Sabarinath, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To create media you need to use a PC running <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span>,
<span>Windows&nbsp;8</span>, or Windows&nbsp;7, and it must have the same architecture (32 or 64-bit) as the PC you want to install
<span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span> on. You'll also need your <span>
Windows&nbsp;8.1</span>&nbsp; product key. </p>

<p>================================<br />
Windows Media Player is not natively compatible <br />
with Apple QuickTime .mov files.</p>
<p>Some possibilities follow...good luck...<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
The 3ivx decoder components play back <br />
most MP4, M4A, 3GP, MOV and AVI files <br />
with MPEG-4 Video and MPEG-4 AAC Audio<br />
<br />
3ivx decoder<br />
<a href="http://www.3ivx.com/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.3ivx.com/download/</a><br />
(this should make Windows Media Player compatible <br />
with .mov files... I think this is a 30 day evaluation version)<br />
<br />
Also...the followng freeware players can play QuickTime .mov files.<br />
<br />
Apple QuickTime<br />

Media Player Classic<br />
<a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_media_player_classic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/download_media_player_classic/</a><br />

If you want to install a codec pack...one of the following <br />
may be worth a try:<br />

<a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_klite_codec_pack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/download_klite_codec_pack/</a><br />

<p>Windows media Player does not support .mov file format.<br />
Go to the web, google for a FREE video converter.<br />
Use the converter and change the .mov movie file to WMV.<br />
Play it again. Should work now.</p>

<h2>            Unlock Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Unlocking a computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just set up a new computer with Windows 10 and went through the whole startup process setting up internet access, configuring Office 365 for email, printer drivers, etc. and had restarted the computer once during that process without a problem and then
 turned it off for a while to go eat a meal. Upon return, when I restarted the computer, it went through a lengthy update process to bring Windows up to date with the latest updates and then presented me with a login screen. I had specifically avoided creating
 a password for log in because the computer is for an aging relative in a senior residence and only she would have access. When I saw it was requesting a password I was puzzled. I entered the password that I had created for her Microsoft account (this one)
 which is working, it was rejected. I then tried the only other one I had used which was for her email account and that did not work either. The user name was her email address and the instructions after my failed login attempt stated I should be using the
 password associated with the Microsoft account, which I had attempted numerous times, but it still did not work. I am now locked out of this computer, yet the password associated with MS works fine. What can I do?</p>

<h2>            Calendar on Windows 10 - How to get pop up reminders</h2>
                    <p>We have 2 new computers in our house with Windows 10.&nbsp; We can set a reminder in the calendar, but unless you actually have calendar open you don't see the reminder.&nbsp; If you are starting up the computer it sometimes shows on the start up screen but not always.&nbsp;
 We expected this calendar to continue to pop up - regardless of what program we were using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do anyone know how to get these to pop up or can you recommend an app that will do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
