            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />I would suggest you to follow these methods:  
<br />
<br />Method 1.
<br />Run the Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />  
<br />1.Download the ﻿Windows Update Troubleshooter, and then select Open or Save in the pop-up window:
<br /><a href="https://aka.ms/wudiag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/wudiag</a>
<br />
<br />Notes
<br />	• If the pop-up doesn’t come up, you might have a pop-up blocker on. If you’re using Microsoft Edge, instructions for disabling the pop-up blocker are here. For Internet Explorer, instructions are here. If you are using a different browser or separate pop-up blocker, check the website of the browser or blocker’s manufacturer.
<br />	• If you select Save, you need to go to the folder where the troubleshooter is downloaded to after the download is complete, and then double-click the latest wu.diagcab file to run the troubleshooter.
<br />	
<br />2.Select Next and follow the steps in the wizard to find and fix problems with Windows Update .
<br /> 
<br />Method 2.
<br />
<br />Download the most recent Servicing Stack Update (SSU)
<br />
<br />Determine whether you are using 32-bit or 64-bit Windows:
<br />	1. From Start, choose Settings.
<br />	2. Select System.
<br />	3. Click About.
<br />	4. Scroll down to System type.
<br />Download the version of the latest SSU (KB4456655) that matches your version of Windows from the Microsoft Update Catalog. 
<br />Restart your device and check for updates.
<br />Did this resolve the issue?
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 3.
<br />
<br />Download the most recent KB
<br />
<br />	1. Go to the Update history page. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/12387/windows-10-update-history?ocid=update_setting_client" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/12387/window...</a>
<br />	2. Find the most recent update KB for the version of Windows 10 you have – it’s usually at the top of the list – and either write the KB number down or copy it.
<br />	3. Go to the Microsoft Update site and search for the KB number. <a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Hom...</a>
<br />	4. Select the link for the download, and then choose Download. Select Save if you are prompted. 
<br />	5. When the download completes, select Open to start the update.
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 4.
<br />
<br />Fix Windows file corruption
<br />
<br />Important
<br />You need to run both the DISM and SFC commands shown below, not just one of them.
<br />	1. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, right click the Windows button, and then select Command Prompt (Admin). If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow or Yes.
<br />	2. Type the following command, and then press Enter.
<br />	DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />	Note It might take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.
<br />	3. Type the following command and press Enter.
<br />	sfc /scannow
<br />	Note It might take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.
<br />	4. Close the command prompt, and then run Windows Update again.
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Method 5.
<br />Perform an in-place upgrade
<br />
<br />Download the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool (MCT) <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/win...</a> and use it to perform an “in-place upgrade” of Windows 10. We have a video that can show you how if you aren’t sure. <a href="https://aka.ms/W10CleanInstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/W10CleanInstall</a>

            You do realize that Edge is store app... that is why i gave you these instructions.
<br />If you don't want to try them then run a repair upgrade.

    <title>Surface Pro 4 core m3 power supply - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> infracom2017  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 core m3  power supply</h2>
                    I have been told that the power brick for the i5/i7 models is not suitable for the core m3 model because&nbsp; the core m3 surface pro 4 needs a 15V power brick. But the power brick that was supplied by Microsoft with my core m3 surface pro 4 has the USB charging
 port like the i5/i7 and is rated at 12V. It charges my core m3 surface fine.&nbsp; Does the core m3 really need 15V and if so how come it charges OK from the 12V supply that was supplied with it?

            Thanks. It does not answer my question though which is should the m3 have a 12V or a 15V power brick? I simply want to know what the spec for the m3 charging device is. Yes the m3 it charges. Yes the USB port charges too. Why do Microsoft say the brick
 for the m3 does not have USB port? Is it simply because it is cheaper kit or is it a different voltage/current spec? Experience tells me that the 'if it seems to work it must be OK' approach is often asking for trouble.&nbsp;

            Btw, who told you that your charger is not suitable for your device? If the charger came with your Surface then nothing is wrong with using it. If you really want to hear it from them, contact support or go to a Microsoft Store.

 charger was not suitable for an m3 surface, and I want to know what the difference is (if anything other than lack of USB charging port) between an m3 charger and a i5/i7 charger.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">The reason I asked is that I wanted to buy a spare charger to take with me and leave the supplied one at home.&nbsp; I always like to have a charger spare for my laptop, tablet
 or phone. I could not see an m3 charger for sale on the online Microsoft store, but I have seen many chargers for i5/i7 surface for sale elsewhere, both third party and second user. The people selling these chargers usually say ‘not suitable for an m3’. I
 was told (I cannot remember by whom) that the m3 needed 15V not 12V hence my puzzlement. It seemed to me odd that Microsoft would say that they supply a different charger (without USB) for the m3 than for the i5/i7 unless there was a good reason, and voltage
 difference would seem like a good reason. It seemed even odder that they supplied me with what looks like the i5/i7 version (which states 12V on its label)
<span>&nbsp;</span>rather than the one their own publicity material says they supply. Support are not particularly helpful, there is no local Microsoft store, the online Microsoft store does not mention m3 chargers (or at least I cannot find them) so I appear to
 be stuck. Thanks for your reply anyway. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <p>I just bought (in Germany) a Surface Pro 4 M3 and I already own an i5 model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was quite upset to read that the two were supposed to have incompatible power supplies (respectively 15v and 12v).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But actually I compared the two now and they are exactly the same brick: 1625 model, 12v with extra USB power charger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is for me great news, but I am puzzled.</p>
<p>Could it be that the 1625 can safely work with both and this is what is bundled in Germany with both Surface models?</p>
<p>Any official information from Microsoft?</p>

<h2>            windows XP professional upgrade to windows 7 Ultimate - possible or not possible&#63;</h2>
                    I have windows XP professional at my PC at home - which version of windows 7 can I upgrade to? Can I upgrade windows XP professional (32 bit) to Windows 7 Ultimate (64 bit)?<br />
<br />
I ask this because I saw a list showing various versions of windows vista along with a list of windows 7 versions that each windows vista version can upgrade to, but I have not seen something similar for windows XP.

            Since you have to do a "custom" clean install to go from XP to Windows 7, you can use any version of Windows 7 upgrade.<br />
<br />
Edited to add - in a nutshell, yes you can use the upgrade media for Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit.&nbsp; Just remember that if you go with 64-bit that you need to boot from the disk and select "custom install" from there because the setup file cannot run in 32-bit
 OS.&nbsp; Also make sure that XP is still on your hard drive when you install from upgrade media, it will check to make sure you are eligible for the upgrade.

                    <span><span>Hello. <br />
                    <span><span>Hello. <br />
I want to watch TV with a TERRATEC CINERGY HTC USB XS HD tv-adaptor <br />
for a Vista Home Premium PC in Denmark where DVB-T signals are <br />
either MPEG2 or&nbsp; MPEG4 encoded.<br />
Only MPEG2 encoded TV-channels are identified and used in Windows Media Center.<br />
However using the (unreliable) Terratec-software provided with the USB-dongle <br />
only the MPEG4 encoded channels are identified.<br />
Is it possible to configure Windows media center to detect both MPEG2 and MPEG4 <br />
encoded channels?<br />

<p>Hi Torben,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</p>
<p>There are third party converters which helps you to configure Windows media center to detect both MPEG2 and MPEG4 encoded channels. You may use your preferred search engine to get it.<br />

<strong>THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE DISCLAIMER:</strong> Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
 Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.<br />

<p>Hi,<br />

Stage 1 : Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />

Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and<br />
the correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Prefetching is not necessary on an SSD due to the low access times. It'll increase your SSD's overall performance to disable it. By default, Windows 7 will disable Superfetch (different than Prefetch), ReadyBoost, as well as boot and application launch prefetching
 on SSDs with good random read, random write and flush performance. These technologies were all designed to improve performance on traditional HDDs, where random read performance could easily be a major bottleneck.&nbsp;<span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            <blockquote>&nbsp; Should it have a paging file? </blockquote>
- A lot of people suggest the Page File is redundant when a machine has a lot of RAM (8GB or more),<br />
but the Page File is still viable. My understanding is the PF is used by System Restore ( System Restore points are kept on the C:/ drive, however), and it is still used by some software and games.<br />
- If a software uses the Page File and you do not have one you will get an error to the effect
<br />
that there is not enough RAM.<br />
You can setup the Page File on your HDD instead of the SSD to reduce writes to the SSD.<br />
<br />
- Others may also argue that doing regular backups negates the need for System Restore.<br />
Personally - System Restore is your friend. Even with System Restore you may sometimes have<br />
to reinstall something, or redo some settings after the restore, but System Restore is more<br />
imediate than doing regular back-ups and can save time vs having to do a full backup restore.
<br />
<br />
I've been using a 2GB min and max for the Page File for a while now and it seems to work well.<br />

            Yes the problem still is existing for me as I have come over to my Dads place and tried to download my recording there. Still no luck. I was speaking to a chat person from Microsoft yesterday but i had to leave for work. He suggested downloading the Classic
 Skype, but he sent me a link in the chat but now I disconnected I cant locate it. If I downloaded that, would I still be able to see the recordings?

    <title>Uninstalling Skype. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> valhalla300  say:</h3>
<h2>            Uninstalling Skype.</h2>
                    Neither Skype nor Microsoft techs were able to solve the problem I was having for over a year, with not being able to uninstall Skype or being able to install a new version of Skype. In fact I was not able to install most things that are tied to the system
 more so than a stand alone simple application/program like an address book or virtual synthesizer etc. Java and Windows 7 updates, for example, would not install. The Microsoft techs spent a total, so far, of 45 hours on this and did not fix anything. They
 actually introduced new problems to my system. I found a debugging tool made my Microsoft, yesterday, that I downloaded and ran and it fixed the Skype problem instantly with a total time of about 5 minutes. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

<p>Hi SwellerSphinx65,</p>
<p>Welcome to XboxLIVE!</p>
<p>To apply your purchases to your Avatar from your Xbox360 console:</p>
<p>1. Go to your dashboard (if not there already press the center XBOX button on your controller and then press 'Y')</p>
<p>2. Go to the Social tab, and select your gamertag (avatar).</p>
<p>3. Select Customize Avatar.</p>
<p>From there you can change features (how the avatar looks) and change clothes.</p>
<p>I hope that helps, I'm doing this from memory as I don't have my xbox in front of me. :)</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>

<p>No, thats takes me to the clothes section, change my features, change my style, marketplace, awards, gamer picture, and choose new avatar. What I am talking about, in my download file are the 6 items I purchased online, like orange helmet, armor for jorge,
 etc.... How do I upload those items I got from xbox on my harddrive to my avator?</p>

<p>I guess my first question is, did you download these items from the Live Marketplace? If so, they should appear as items you can put on your avatar when you go into 'change my style'.</p>

<p>OK, not sure where you find them, but its a list of 106 items, when you play halo reach in matchmaking to play a game, if you dont have enough armor etc... A list pops up and says you dont have enough required items. Do you wish to go to that list. If you
 do, takes you to orange helmet, yellow, blue, jorge armor, number 6 armor, and more up to 106 items. So, I purchased these items for 19.95 plus tax. Thought they were armor upgrades that you could buy. Someone said, no these are just avatar items, that once
 you purchase are on downloaded onto your harddrive. So, once their on your harddrive, then what do you do with them?

<p>Hey there Sphinx! As mentioned here, once downloaded to the console, these items automatically show up in the Avatar Editor. If you don't see them there, try deleting the items from your Hard Drive, clearing the system cache, restarting the console, and
 then downloading them again from your Download History. Let us know if that works!

<p>Hey Sphinx. </p>
<p>It looks like what you posted in your latest post is a copy/paste from your download queue on XBOX.com, yes?</p>
<p>If that's the case, log into your account on your XBOX console, and it should start those downloads.
</p>
<p>To see if those downloads activate, press the center guide button on your xbox controller. &nbsp;Go left (I think it's 2 menus...) and you should see, "Active Downloads". &nbsp;</p>
<p>Press A</p>
<p>There should be a list of the items you added on XBOX.com.</p>
<p>If you'd like some extra help and that doesn't work, I would be happy to help you in an XBOX Live party chat.</p>

<p>That the problem,they arent there where you said using console, says they should be there, but their not. I dont see a place to deltete the list. So, I tried just downloading one, which took me to active downloads, but its not there. So, now what?</p>

<p>Avatar Items tend to be very small, so it probably completed downloading before it took you to Active Downloads.
</p>
<p>Do me a favor to see if it actually downloaded successfully: &nbsp;Boot up your XBOX to the dashboard. &nbsp;Go to the Settings Tab (far right). &nbsp;Select System. &nbsp;Select Storage. &nbsp;Select your Storage Device. Select Avatar Items. &nbsp;Look through the list of items that
 should be there. &nbsp;Are ANY of your purchases there?</p>
<p>IF YES, go back to your dashboard. &nbsp;Go to Settings again. &nbsp;Select Profile. &nbsp;Select Edit Profile. &nbsp;Select Avatar.</p>
<p>This will bring you to the avatar editor. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Select Change My Style. &nbsp;Select Dress-Up. &nbsp;Go through all of the outfits and see if you can find the Noble Six Armor item. &nbsp;If it is there, you can select it to change your avatar. &nbsp;Remember to Save &amp; Exit. &nbsp;Items such as the RC Warthog can be found under
 Props.</p>
<p>IF YOUR ITEMS WERE NOT ON YOUR STORAGE DEVICE, go to your dashboard. &nbsp;Go to Settings. &nbsp;Select Account. &nbsp;Select Download History. &nbsp;Go through the list until you find your past purchase. &nbsp;Select it. &nbsp;Choose Download Again. &nbsp;It should now be available in the
 Avatar Editor as described above. </p>
<p>Hopefully this helps solve your problem. &nbsp;:D</p>

<h2>            Titanfall won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t play on XBOX One after install.</h2>
                    
<p>I got my copy of Titanfall yesterday after work.&nbsp; I installed it.&nbsp; An update installed first.&nbsp; Install finished ok (it seemed.)&nbsp; When I run the game the splash screen comes up then the screen goes black and nothing else happens.&nbsp; I have to do a hard turnoff
 (Press the power button on the console) to even get back to the Home screen.&nbsp; I've tried nothing else so far.</p>

<p>Hey guys, I had this same problem today and turns out it was caused by my Internet going out while I was in the game. The game got really choppy for me, everything jumping around, game finished and I was disconnected from the server. &nbsp;Tried launching it
 again and just a black screen. &nbsp;Quit, tried again, black screen.</p>
<p>Since this game is completely online, maybe check your network? -&gt; look at the advanced network settings in the XOne for NAT status, check your router, try bypassing your router, etc. &nbsp;This game may be more finicky with the network than others since it obviously
 couldn't handle no connection in my case. &nbsp;Just a thought.</p>

<p>well I'm pretty sure that this forum is relevant to my questions or complaintsafter installation I'm unable to play the game because it requires online access and I do not have online access and this happened with another game as well for the Xbox 1 play
 either game on this council due to not having internet connection. what is the point on buying a new console if its not playable?</p>

<p>Chances are, you can't open any of your games now. Just spoken to support and this is how I fixed it:</p>
<p>1. Turn off your Xbox One.</p>
<p>2. Take out the plug from its socket for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>3. Reinsert the plug.</p>
<p>4. Turn on your console.</p>
<p>5. Disconnect from the internet.</p>
<p>- Now see if you can play any other game apart from titanfall.</p>
<p>If yes, now re-connect to the internet and try titanfall (the game wont open without the internet)</p>
<p>If no, call up support.</p>
<p>If titanfall now works, then yay.</p>
<p>If not, call up support.</p>

<p>Exact same problem here. I even had my X1 replaced, same problem with downloaded games. I opened up the Titanfall ports on my router and had my connection speed tested. No problems there. The fact that I'm having the same problem now on two different X1's
 maybe suggests there is a problem with downloaded games via Verizon FIOS (my ISP). I have re-installed countless times. All to no avail. I'm hesitant to buy the game disc, worrying that there will be other problems. Why oh why did I part with my trusted X360</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro Touch Screen Freeze</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having trouble with the touch screen on my Surface Pro. It locks up.</p>
<p>It happened one day and continued to happen now and then, or if I pass my hand over the screen, without any warning. Troubleshooting found no technical or software problems. Btw sorry for my English as I am from Croatia. :) anyway, looks like that digitizer&nbsp;broke
 somehow. No falling and flor-hitting happened, but could it be moisture in the air?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>{Moderator's Edit}</p>
<p>This question&nbsp;was split from&nbsp;a Surface Pro 2 thread.</p>

            <p>Hi Antonio,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to us.<br />
So you have tried a hard reset and the same issue still persists - that doesn't sound good.<br />
Since a hard reset didn't fix the problem, and you mention that there is a dead pixelated line across the screen, I highly recommend you contact our

                    <p>A while ago I downloaded some lecture notes. The program was converting the lecture notes of the professor as he was writing to a file similar to a script file like pdf. I noticed the name of the program was Windows Journal. How can I purchase a copy of

<p><span>Hi Abu,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 has a feature that enables your computer to become a hotspot. This helps users to extend their signal of wireless Internet connection to
 other devices. If it doesn’t work properly, you need to refresh the connection of the source (WiFi router). In this way, it could eliminate intermittent connectivity and will return your network status like when you started using the Internet. To resolve your
 concern, we suggest that you reset your TCP/IP or Internet Protocol to its default settings. To do this, follow the instructions below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Step #1:</span><span> Run the
<strong><span>Network troubleshooter</span></strong>. To diagnose your network configuration, perform the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open
<strong><span>Start menu</span></strong>, then click
<strong><span>Settings icon</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click
<strong><span>Network &amp; Internet</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. On the left pane, click
<strong><span>Status</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click
<strong><span>Network troubleshooter</span></strong> to diagnose and fix network problems.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 22.5pt">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Step #2</span><span>: Perform an Internet connection reset via Command Prompt.
 To reset your Internet connection, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press
<strong><span>Windows + R</span></strong> to open the
<strong><span>Run</span></strong> window.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Type
<strong><span>cmd</span></strong>, then press
<strong><span>Enter</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Type the following commands, then press
<strong><span>Enter</span></strong> after typing each commands below:</span></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 176, 80, 1)">netsh int ip reset resettcpip.txt
</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 176, 80, 1)">netsh winhttp reset proxy</span></em></p>

<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 176, 80, 1)">netsh winsock reset</span></em></p>
<p><span>4. Restart your PC to complete the process.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 22.5pt">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">Step #3</span><span>: We also suggest that you restart your router and wait
 for 15-30 seconds then turn it back again. Then, visit this link: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/instantanswers/c60dcfa3-c596-41d4-8c1a-b0d738e1d9fd/use-your-pc-as-a-mobile-hotspot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Sorry for very late reply . Hi, While setting up DHCP when i go to wifi options there is no known wifi cz i guess its because i am connected through cable ( ethernet ) to internet . and couldnt find these options in ethernet setting . so m still getting
 these problems . And there is one more thing that when i Follow the first soloution u told me , so after restarting the computer ( after following ur first solution )the hotspot works totally fine i.e there is no long delays when i turn it on like it turns
 on fastly and fine and also my device connects fastly to it too .<br />

<h2>            MW3....Seriously&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I like to start by personally thanking the creators of MW3 for making my decision to buy battlefield 3 that much easier.&nbsp; With the introduction of "Elite" and an additional fee per month...on top of the $60 bucks we already pay for Xbox Gold, I think it's
 time to tell MW3 to shove it!&nbsp; Yes we can play for free without it, but we all know by now what the "free" content usually involves...long story short you get what you pay for.&nbsp; I've heard rumors of between $5 and $8 a month for their fee that's at least another
 $60 a year....heck If I want to spend that I'll both battlefield 3 and skyrim, at least they don't charge me extra to play!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I'm not sure if anyone is a pissed about the issue as I am, but I'd like to hear other peoples takes on it!&nbsp; We gamers get screwed over quite regularly with increased game prices, monthly fee's and online subscriptions.</p>

<p>You don't have to pay for Elite. It doesn't affect Modern Warfare 3 in any way besides giving free map packs. It's an optional payment. It will work like Bungies "Bungie Pro" system except a bit more expanded(think of a combination of Halo Way Point + Bungie
 Pro + Battlefields VIP system)</p>
<p>So you're not being charged extra to play. It's an optional service. <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-21.gif" /></p>
<p>Nobody is getting screwed. You need to read the details of the program a bit more before you assume things.</p>

<h2>            After enabling OneDrive,  search box no longer works in file explorer</h2>
                    <p>I purchased and installed Microsoft 365 last week.&nbsp; I connected to OneDrive at that time.&nbsp; I rebooted my pc after the install.&nbsp; Now, when I open File Explorer and use the Search field to find an item, it always says "No items match your search".</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I have a folder called recipes.&nbsp; When I search that folder for the word sugar, it says no items match your search.&nbsp; Yet the word sugar is in multiple notepad and word documents in this folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How do I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />The search index only includes your selected locations. These locations can be filtered for what file types, file properties, and file contents you want yo be indexed. Here are the steps that you can follow to rebuild search index in Windows 10:
<br />
<br />	1. Open the Control Panel (icons view), click/tap on the Indexing Options icon, and close the Control Panel.
<br />	2. Click/tap on the Advanced button.
<br />	3. In the Index Settings tab, click/tap on the Rebuild button under Troubleshooting.
<br />	4. Click/tap on OK to confirm.
<br />	5. Indexing will now be in progress.
<br />	6. When indexing has completed, click/tap on Close.
<br />
<br />
<br />Hope the information provided is useful. If the issue persists, reply here and we will be glad to help you.
<br />
<br />Angel.
