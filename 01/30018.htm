            <p><span>Hi Charles,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. I’ll try my best to assist you with this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To assist you better, I would like to ask few questions regarding this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1) What is the make and model of your laptop?</span></p>
<p><span>2) What exactly happens when you try to connect the Nokia 113 phone with your Windows 8.1 laptop? Do you get any error message/code? If yes, what is the exact error that you get?</span></p>
<p><span>3) Which Windows Operating System was installed on this computer before, when you were able to connect the phone with it?</span></p>
<p><span>4) Do you have the latest version of Nokia Suite software installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>5) Do you have any third party security program installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>6) What are the troubleshooting steps that you have already tried on the computer for this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Windows Compatibility Center shows that there is no information regarding the compatibility of the Nokia 113 Smartphone device with the Windows 8.1 Operating System. You may find the details from this link:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Type=Hardware&amp;Name=Nokia+113+Smartphone&amp;ModelOrVersion=&amp;Vendor=Nokia&amp;Locale=1033%2C2057%2C3081%2C4105%2C16393&amp;LastSearchTerm=nokia%2B113%2Bsmartphone&amp;BreadcrumbPath=noki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia
 113 Smartphone Compatibility with Windows 8.1</a></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, let us try installing the latest version of the Nokia Suite from the Nokia website and check if that resolves the issue. The Nokia Suite provides all the required drivers and applications for the phone to connect with the Windows
 based laptops. You may download it from this link:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span><a href="http://nds1.nokia.com/files/support/global/phones/software/Nokia_Suite_webinstaller_ALL.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Nokia Suite - Download and Support</a></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While installing this software on your Windows 8.1 computer, if you come across any compatibility issues, then try installing it in the Windows 8 or Windows 7 Compatibility Mode and check if that resolves the issue. To install any drivers/apps
 in the compatibility mode, you may refer to this article: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><em>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</em></strong></a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once after you install this software on the laptop, try connecting the phone and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Hope this resolves the issue. Please get back to us with the result and all the relevant information regarding this issue.</span>

            <p><span>Hi Charles,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your reply. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We are glad to know that you were able to successfully install the Nokia Suite and after which you were able to connect the phone with the computer via Bluetooth. However, I understand that when you transferred the photos from the phone to the laptop,
 it came up as .NBU files which you are unable to open. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The .NBU files backup files created by Nokia Suite or Nokia PC Suite. It contains a backup of the cell phone data and may include contacts, calendars, text messages, and other user data; used for restoring data to the same phone or transferring data
 to another phone.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To know on how to restore your photos from the .NBU files, you may contact the Nokia Support from the link given below:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this is helpful. If you need any further assistance with Windows Operating System, please post your query on Microsoft Community Forums and we’ll be glad to assist you with it.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows Update returns error code 643 and code 80070BC9</h2>
                    Hi, I've tried to install a new version of AVG Antivirus 9.0 on my Windows 7 x64, but the install returned an error: AVG 9.0 installation failed. Error message is MSVC Redistributable installation failed?<br />
<br />
I then tried to use Windows Update, I have 3 updates that won't install, an update for MS XML Core services 4.0 SP2(KB973688) an update for Win7 x64 (KB976098) and a securityupdate for MS XML Core service (KB954430), but update returns the errors I wrote in
 the headline.<br />
<br />
I then&nbsp;tried to reinstall Visual C++, but without success, it returned an error saying "Error 1935. An error occured during the installation of assambly 'Microsoft.VC90.ATL,version="9.0.30729.1",publicKeyToken="1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b" (don't know if you need the
 rest...)<br />
<br />
I'm pretty convinced that these errors are connected with eachother but I can't figure out what is going wrong.<br />
<br />
I've deleted the temp-folder in Windows, users/xxx/temp and users/xxx/temp/AppData/Local/Temp and I've scanned with Malwarebytes Anti-malware and Avast antivirus but found nothing.<br />
<br />
My computer is a Lenovo T61 and I use a danish edition of Win7&nbsp;x64.&nbsp;I hope you can help me.

            Hi Mia Jensen,<br />
<br />
Thank you for visiting Windows 7 forum.<br />
<br />
<br />
When installing updates using Windows update or Microsoft Update you may<br />
receive Error 0x643 or 0x80070643 (23 Oct-09)<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982</a>
<br />
<br />
=====================<br />
<br />
Step #1 =&gt; Before doing anything else, write down what .NET Framework<br />
versions are currently installed:<br />
<br />
How to determine which versions of the .NET Framework are installed and<br />
whether service packs have been applied<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785</a>
<br />
<br />
Step #2 =&gt; Now see Resolution Method 2 in...<br />
<br />
When you try to install an update for the .NET Framework 1.0, 1.1, 2.0, 3.0,<br />
or 3.5, you may receive Windows Update error code "0x643" or Windows<br />
Installer error code "1603" (ignore the title, if need be)<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923100</a>
<br />
<br />
After running the appropriate/needed tool, (re)install all .NET Framework<br />
versions (but only the ones you wrote down in #1 above) manually using the<br />
download links on the page then run Windows Update manually to install<br />
security updates for same.<br />
<br />
NB: If you remove .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 using the tool, reinstalling .NET<br />
Framework 3.5 will also install .Net Framework 2.0 SP2 and 3.0 SP2; then<br />
Windows Update will offer .NET Framework 3.5 SP1.<br />
<br />
<strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> =&gt; If you remove .NET Framework 3.5 SP1, reinstall your .NET<br />
Framework versions in the following order:<br />
<br />
1. .Net Framework 3.5, then...<br />
2. .Net Framework 1.1, then...<br />
3. .Net Framework 1.1 SP1<br />
<br />
NB: KB923100 references this page:<br />

Framework Cleanup Tool.<br />
<br />
Step #3 =&gt; Check-in at Windows Update and install any critical security<br />
updates offered.<br />

<br />If that does not work, try installing the latest rollup update for Windows 8.1 manually;

<p>There is 3702MB allocated in Virtual PC (~4GB) for the windows 7 x86 install.</p>
<p>So windows should recognize 4GB of RAM, correct?</p>
<p>But only 2GB are recognized.</p>

    <title>InstantGo and Alarm application - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pavaruth pengcharoen  say:</h3>
<h2>            InstantGo and Alarm application</h2>
                    <p>On the Microsoft's webpage explaining the alarm application, it stated clearly that PC without InstantGo will show a warning message saying "Notifications will only show if the PC is awake," however, the PC that I am using is Surface Pro 3, which I thought
 should have InstantGo, but when I created new alarm, the warning message presents at the top. It makes me a bit worried since I use the application to wake me up in the morning, but it sometimes doesn't do its job. So here are my questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Does your SP3 alarm application show the warning message (too)?</p>
<p>2. SP3 has instant go, right? Correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
<p>3. How worried should I be for having the warning message shown like that?</p>
<p>4. Any setting configuration should I consider applying to my SP3 for it to actually wake me up in the morning?</p>

<h2>            Wireless Adapter unrecognized after Every Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>Every time I update manually or have updates installed automatically, my wireless N adapter is disabled on reboot. I am using an ASUS 802.11n Wireless LAN card, and it is listed as compatible with Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>It is not disabled the normal way, my computer does not recognize it at all. It does not appear in the network setting nor&nbsp;in the device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Subsequent reboots (it may take anywhere from 2 to 10 reboots) eventually fix the problem. On occasion, the problem is resolved when windows forces me to re-register.</p>

                    I have Windows 7 32bit. This problem just showed up about one week ago. I have been running Win7 for a month and a half. When&nbsp; start the computer&nbsp;and the computer finishes booting, the desktop has a small error&nbsp;window open with a message in the box saying:
 The properties for this item are not available. I don't know where to start to find the problem. In the upper left corner of the box it does say Desktop. I&nbsp;tried booting to safe mode and the error message is not there. I have some text from the my path and
 I have a picture of the box captured by using snipping tool. I can't get any information on the box by right or left clicking it. What should I try next to to stop this box from appearing? If I click ok the box goes away and as far as I can tell everything
 is fine. Also, I did a sfc /scannow and the report was all file accounted for.

<p>- Download the Dell Dell Wireless 1x1 WLAN 802.11b/g/n (2.4GHz), Bluetooth v4.0+HS Driver (Link:
<a href="http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/DriverDetails/Product/inspiron-17r-se-7720?driverId=WTD28&amp;osCode=W764&amp;fileId=2969488887" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>- Execute the file. It will extract to c:\dell\drivers\WTD28. <strong>Then an error/warning occurs and the execution is aborted.</strong></p>
<p>- Open the Windows device manager. Find the missing WLAN component with the yellow exclamation mark (here name as "Network Controller")</p>
<p>- Update its driver manually and use c:\dell\drivers\WTD28 as driver path. It will automatically install and start working.</p>

<h2>            Extra RAM not working in HP elitebook 8540w</h2>
                    <p>Hello, &nbsp;I wanted to upgrade my elitebook with some extra RAM of 4 gb. I went to the computer store and they put the RAM in directly just to make sure that it would work. Unfortunately it didn't, we tried multiple kinds of RAM, but no result. I've got two
 open slots, when we put the RAM in one slot, the laptop did not pick it up en stated that I still have 4 gb of memory. And when put in the other slot, my screen tripled. So that did not work either. The guy at the store, pretty young fellow I have to say with
 that, hadn't seen this happen before and did not know how to solve it. So, does any of you might have any idea?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a technical student and I need to run heavy programs like Rino and Solidworks. Who both freeze whenever I'm working too fast or do a sort of large action. My laptop is now 5 years old so I wanted to buy a new one. But last week I had it cleaned and checked.
 Out of the results came that my laptop is in fine condition and with a new SSD and some extra RAM it will work like new. So that's why I want to have more RAM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the attached image you can see my PC specifics. I could tell, according to the PC clerk, if the system accepted the new RAM when looking at the performance tab, in the task manager (also in the attached image).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0761b38-d0e0-49cc-8279-f910f141b7fc" /></p>

            <p>Obviously, your system "knows" it has 4G.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The correct memory for this computer can be found at:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/compatible-upgrade-for/HP-Compaq/elitebook-8540w-mobile-workstation-(dual-core-processors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/compatible-upgrade-for/HP-Compaq/elitebook-8540w-mobile-workstation-(dual-core-processors</a>)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Crucial is but one brand among many.&nbsp; What you need is <em><strong>DDR3 1600, CL11, 1.35V
</strong></em>memory.&nbsp; Clerks tend to ignore the CL11 requirement.&nbsp; If you install even one piece of non-CL11, it will slow performance of the entire system. It is also better to have a matched pair -- meaning 2-2's (what you have now) or 2-4's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the use you described, I would have upgraded to more than 4G total.&nbsp; Your system can use up to 8G.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 2 memory slots in your computer.&nbsp; Right now it has 2 pieces of 2g.&nbsp; Consider asking the store that sold you the "upgrade" to remove and replace at least one of those 2G pieces with a 4G.</p>

            <p>You have not provided the link!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Your Resource Monitor image clearly demonstrates the problem I had in mind. Your system is holding on to Standby memory and not releasing it to
<strong>Free</strong> memory. You can force release by restarting your computer but often this is not very convenient. Another way to force the release of Standby memory is available using RAM Map (freeware from Microsoft):<br />
</span></span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/ff700229.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/ff700229.aspx</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Download and install, and create a shortcut on your Desktop to RAMMap and / or pin to your Taskbar. When you sense the system is becoming unresponsive use Ctrl+Shift+Esc to access Task
 Manager. Click the Performance tab and the <strong>Resource Monitor</strong> button. Click the Memory tab and check whether Free is near to Zero or is Zero. If it is, open RAMMap, click Empty on the Menu bar and Empty Standby list. This action instantly restores
 Free memory.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The procedure using RAMMap is an effective workaround but the true solution lies in discovering the source of the problem. Knowing the source you may be able to resolve the problem by
 contacting the provider of the software and / or updating the software. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The solution lies in identifying the software that is accessing numerous files, either to check for malware or to index to facilitate Windows Search. If you discover which files are being
 unnecessarily accessed you can exclude them from routine scans. The first image below illustrates the problem. The second image identifies the folders/ files. In the example Microsoft Security Essentials has been scanning my G drive, which I have since excluded
 from future scans.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Investigating what makes up the Standby figure may not be easy. How I found out what was the cause on this computer was achieved by following the procedure detailed below.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Open RAMMap when your Standby figure is too high and click the File Summary tab. Click the
<strong>Standby</strong> column header to sort the figures as in the image below to determine the
<strong>really large</strong> files held in Standby, see the image below. If you click the
<strong>Path</strong> header you can sort and see what partitions are being accessed. It is important to remember that these files have been accessed since the computer was booted. You then ask yourself what programme might have accessed the file and did it
 really need to? Programmes having scheduled scans are good potential candidates.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In my case I found a very large download of Windows 7 that I had used for a Repair Install I had not removed after use. I also found a large number of files on a non-system partition
 relating to back up copies created by Windows BackUp. I decided to see if these were being regularly scanned by Microsoft Security Essentials and excluded them from scans. You should also check whether you are Indexing more than you need as this will increase
 the impact of running Windows Search.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span>Adding RAM may be the long term best solution.</span>

</p><p>RAMMap really is a handy program to have. However, you are referring to images, but I cannot find them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, I had my computer cleaned at Staples so all unnecessary software, startup programms, malware etc. was removed. Wouldn't have that solve the 'solution'?

</p><p>I went back to the store and showed the clerk the type of RAM you advised. So he got that and put it in, but still no result. In the image below you can see the specs and a picture of the RAM that was put in. However, when we put the new RAM in the other
 slot, the computer showed a capacity of 8 gb, so it seemed to work. But when the computer was starting up it look way to long and after the start up it was slower than a snail in quicksand. I do not know if that is a common problem when putting in new RAM?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Registration Key for Visual Studio 2008 C&#43;&#43; Express Edition</h2>
                    <p>I cannot find out how to register this legacy product. I need it to fix some old programs. It has installed perfectly and works, I just need to register it before my 28 days are up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The instructions on microsoft's own site at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms246592%28v=vs.90%29.aspx says:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On the <span>Help</span> menu, click <span>Register Product</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the <span>Register now</span> link to get your free key to unlock your Express Edition.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Sign in to Passport and then fill out the online registration form.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <span>Thank you for registering</span> page, copy the key.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In your Express Edition, paste the key in the <span>Registration Key</span> text box and then click
<span>Complete Registration</span>.</p>
<span>Complete Registration</span>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>All very well, but pressing the Register now button in item 2 just takes me to the new VS screen with no discernable way to request a free key. I am logged in with my Microsoft ID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to write to MS Support, but for that it seems I need a support contract, or to pay for the priviledge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help? Does anyone know how I can get a regstration key? Thanks.</p>

    <title>CD-RW not recognizing blank CDs. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jojee  say:</h3>
<h2>            CD-RW not recognizing blank CDs.</h2>
                    I can't burn CDs because my CD-RW (ASUS CRW-5232A4)&nbsp;is not recognizing blank CDs. It didn't have any problems until yesterday.&nbsp;I sent a few video files to the CD-RW so that they could be wirtten on to a CD as I always do: right click the file(s), send
 to -&gt; CD-RW Drive. The files were copied. Then I clicked 'Write these files to CD' and the CD Writing Wizard started but when I hit next after entering the CD name, a message popped up:
<p>"<em><strong>Insert a writable disc to continue.<br />
</strong><br />
There is no disc in the drive.<br />
<br />
Please insert a writable CD into drive G:\.</em>"<br />
<br />
I tried three different CDs - different brands -&nbsp;but the same message appeared. It's still reading data from CDs though.<br />
I had installed 'Total Video Converter' a few days ago&nbsp;which installed its own burner - 'Media Burner' - with it. I tried burning a CD with this burner and it worked. But this is not how I want it to be done. I have uninstalled 'Total Video Converter' and 'Media
 Burner' but I still get the same message.<br />
I tried uninstalling the CD-RW Drive and then reinstalling it but that didn't solve the problem either. The properties of the CD-RW Drive&nbsp;show that recording is enabled. Could installing this third-party burner have resulted in the problem?<br />
<br />
I would really appreciate some help!</p>

            Even though you un-install it, it can still leave entries in the registry.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although I don't recall the exact location in the registry, if you do an internet search for low and high filters in the CDROM registry it might solve your issue.

            <p>Hi Michelle,</p>
<p>I was unable to&nbsp;try any of the other fixes. After I ran through step one and attempted to reboot, my computer rejected changes with following error message "Failure configuring Windows updates. Reverting changes. Do not turn off your computer". I am unsure
 how to make changes to my computer because of message two and am having issues because of the first message I received about low memory.</p>

            I tried rebooting in safe mode. I still got the same error message of &nbsp;"Failure configuring Windows updates. Reverting changes. Do not turn off your computer". That reverting process takes quite some time.&nbsp; Unsure what to try next.

<h3> olaru emil  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD Critical_Process_Died</h2>
                    <p>Hello! As the subject says I encounter problems with Blue Screens of Death pretty often. I did a lot of research on the internet and I was thinking there is a problem with my hard-disk but I was not sure. I tried few times to do some clean installation of
 W10. It was looking like it works but after few weeks the problem appeared again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran chkdsk /f /r it didn't show any problem at all 0 bad sectors etc. , I tried to run sfc /scannow but it said&nbsp; "Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation." and after few hours of surfing on internet I found this post https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed step-by-step all the information from the post above and I was struggling with a loop of BSOD with error message DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION. I found a way to reset the driver verifier and now I hope that I will finally get the help I need
 to solve this problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is I know a thing or two about computers and troubleshoot them but it started to get annoying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the Minidump files, msinfo32 and computer specification (I think you can find them in msinfo32 too but I will post them here too just to be sure :D )</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MVaBaYHbqHhfLaOrtPEMLD4_z49D8IEv</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what to write about my PC here are some basic information just let me know if you need more:</p>
<p>
</p><p>CPU Intel I7 7700K</p>
<p>GPU Nvidia Geforce 1060 GTX 6GB</p>
<p>RAM 16Gb </p>
<p>Hard-disk I don't remember the manufacturer is a hard of 1TB</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 1: I just took 30 min ago a new Blue Screen but I don't have any log if you can come with suggestion how to take a log or something that can help about last blue screen and upload here just let me know.
</p>
<p>Edit 2: I managed to get the info that @CaptLunchables asked.</p>
<p>Edit 3: When I try to use sfc /scannow command in CMD it give me the error "Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation."</p>
<p>This is what it says in CBS file: </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why you're encountering the "Critical_Process_Died" error. It can be that there is an issue with the system files of Windows 10. This may also be the reason why you're unable to run the System File Checker (SFC) tool. It is also
 possible that one of the computer's driver is failing. You can access the <strong>
Device Manager</strong> and check if one of the drivers has a yellow exclamation mark. An outdated BIOS can also be the cause of the blue screen error. Because of these factors, we need to have at least three dump files for us to exactly know what is causing
 the issue. If you already have three dump files, kindly upload them to OneDrive and share the files here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While we wait for the dump files, we suggest that you follow the steps <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/14238/windows-10-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> to know how you can resolve blue screen errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

                    <p>Hello Community; my system is Windows 8.1 Pro, with IE 10. &nbsp;It has been doing file history back up Ok on my passport drive (E) up until 7/1/2015.&nbsp;&nbsp; I noticed that it has not been backing up yesterday.&nbsp; When I checked my settings for file history backup,
 this is what I found:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back up your personal files on this PC to the name of my drive (E:), disconnected</p>
<p>Your files could not be backed up because the drive is disconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I tried I cannot get the drive to be connected to do any work.&nbsp; I ran Microsoft device troubleshooting and repair, and it says that I am having a USB Driver problem that is not totally corrected, and I am to note that windows automatic update is not
 configured to update drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dear Community, can you help me with my problem, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I configure windows auto update to update drivers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I go ahead and update the drivers now?</p>

<h2>            In-game frames per second drastically dropped after Windows update</h2>
                    <p>I updated Windows 10 on both my laptop and desktop computers&nbsp;yesterday (21st of July 2016) and have noticed that most games run at half the frame rate they used to run at. This is most definitely a Windows issue, as my desktop has an AMD Radeon HD 7700 Series
 graphics card and my laptop has an nVidia GTX 960M. At first I assumed that the graphics drivers failed to update and forced usage of the integrated graphics, but that is false, as after manual update no change is present.</p>
<p>What may be the cause of this?</p>

            <p>For some reason the update history does not show the update at all, even though it definitely took place on both machines.</p>
<p>I seem to have narrowed it down to being Realtek HD Audio getting installed and taking up 15% of my CPU on my desktop, and eventually even more in games. I used the default Microsoft audio driver before, as I have experienced many issues with Realtek's own
 drivers. I will reply later, once I get my laptop back, if this is true.</p>

    <title>How cue a music choice in a play list without playing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How cue a music choice in a play list without playing immediately&#63;__</h2>
                    
<p>So I have a play list. Want to click on the song I want to play THEN hit ctrl p to play it.</p>
<p>Right now the only way to select and play is to double click the new song and it plays immediately.</p>
<p>Is there some way to get media player to cue a song rather than play it immediately?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a song is playing and I hit ctrl s to stop it then click a new song and hit ctrl p, it plays the old cued song.</p>
<p>I want to be able to cue the song then play it with Ctrl P</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>John</p>

<p>No... because it plays sit immediately. I want to be able to cue it as the next song without playing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
Clicking&nbsp; <strong>Play next</strong> won't start playback if there are already songs in the active playlist.<br />
