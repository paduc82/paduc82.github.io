<h2>            Windows Store connection problem</h2>
                    <p>Windows Store will not connect keep getting time out error.<br />
</p>
<p>I have tried the LAN settings and wsrest.exe</p>
<p>One interesting thing I have found is that if I take my laptop<span>&nbsp;
</span>and connect to another WIFI I can connect to the store but it stops once I get home however all my other apps can connect to the internet. Just the Windows apps store, So I have a Netgear N600 WNDR3400 router at home.</p>
<span>I also have to tell you that the store did work when I got my laptop and I even got it to work once I found the store could connect at work when I got back but sadly it stopped a few minutes
<span>I also have to tell you that the store did work when I got my laptop and I even got it to work once I found the store could connect at work when I got back but sadly it stopped a few minutes

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today after I got home the store connected without doing any thing, any what does your suggestion do will it delete any of my other programs?</p>
<p>I also noticed that the WsService was stopped also after I opened ITunes I had to change IPV6 setting for ITunes to air play well soon after that the WSService stopped again but this time the store kept connecting.</p>
<p>This is strange, this is why Microsoft needs to do a better JOB of making these things work every time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Dipak</p>

    <title>how to permanently prevent Windows 10 Home Edition &#40;windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            how to permanently prevent Windows 10 Home Edition &#40;windows update&#41; from installing bad drivers</h2>
                    <p>I continually need to revert my display driver back to the version that allows me to use my HDMI-connected monitor after Windows Update forces this driver update. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far as I can tell, the only option is to do one of 2 things</p>
<p>1) Disable windows updates all together (which will prevent all security updates from being installed)&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Allow windows update to install and break the working driver, then run backout procedures to reinstall proper drivers (must physically disable windows update for however long you are comfortable going without getting security updates. &nbsp;If you do not disable
 then the bad driver will be automatically installed on reboot rendering your HDMI port useless)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to tell windows update not to update this specific driver? &nbsp;This workaround is becoming not only a tremendous time sink, but also a serious security vulnerability as well.</p>

            <p>for those with this Windows 10 problem, this is how I "fix" the bad driver that windows update installs automatically in "Windows 10" on my HP Envy Laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>before proceeding, be sure to shut off "Windows Update", else windows will run the device driver update again on reboot. &nbsp;To shut off auto-updates I believe you can
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/metered-internet-connections-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
make your wireless connection a metered one</a>. &nbsp;That should prevent or at least delay the auto-updates from blowing away the working display drivers once you get them installed. &nbsp;If that doesnt work, find another way to turn off windows updates then proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) run display driver uninstall to completely remove all display-related registry keys and services previously installed on machine (i downloaded "DDU v15.4.1.0.exe" copyright by "Igor Pavlov" and ran this without restarting)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) download drivers made for your original version of windows. &nbsp;(I needed two installer packages for my 64-bit version. &nbsp;They are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;(a) "Intel® Turbo Boost Technology&nbsp;Driver" v 1.2.0.1002</p>
<p>&nbsp;(b) ATI catalyst control center</p>
<p>Because I have an HP laptop, I downloaded both of my drivers using HP's download driver area:<br />
<a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers</a></p>
<p>Note that you will need to search drivers using the original version of windows you had on the machine you are running the installation on. &nbsp;(for me it was Windows 7)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) unzip installer packages</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) do this for all driver installers: &nbsp;right click on unzipped driver exe and select "properties" -&gt; "Compatibility"&nbsp;</p>
<p>4a) select "Run this program in compatibility mode"</p>
<p>4b) select whatever the original version of windows you had - for me it is "Windows 7"</p>
<p>4c) do this for all driver installers (i had two (2a) and (2b))</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) navigate to start menu and type "CMD"</p>
<p>5a) right click "Command Prompt" and choose "run as administrator"</p>
<p>5b) type "cd &lt;path of driver installer1&gt;</p>
<p>5c) type &lt;name of installer&gt;.exe</p>
<p>5d) do step 5 for remaining installers. &nbsp;(for me it was (2a) and (2b) in that order for my monitor to function properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>once ATI Catalyst control center for version 7 of windows was installed for me, my monitor started to function appropriately once again. &nbsp;Goodluck!</p>

            <p>My issue was not fixed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem that I am looking for a resolution to is that I need a way to prevent "windows update" running on the Windows 10 OS from automatically installing the display driver titled: "driver update for AMD Mobility Radeon HD 5000 Series".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to disable this driver update from taking place while continuting to receive microsoft security updates through "windows update"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated above, each time this auto-install takes place, I need to shut windows update off and revert the update which opens up a security vulnerability on my machine (because i am forced to turn off "windows update"). &nbsp;How can I continue to receive security
 updates through "windows update" while also preventing the bad drivers from auto-installing?</p>

</p><p>For&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 10 Professional</span> users, t<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">he best solution I was able to find is as follows:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Press Win+R to open the run dialog box and type in gpedit.msc</p>

</li><li>
<p>Under "Options" click the "Show..." button. Put the Hardware ID of the device you don't want updates for under the Value column. Click OK on both windows, and then restart the computer.</p>
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">The hardware ID can be found in Device Manager. Choose the device you want (such as your Display Adapter or Audio device) and double click to open properties. Click on the details tab. From the dropdown, choose
 "Hardware Ids". It may list a few IDs there. It seems any one of them will work.</p>

<p>By reset, I am going to assume you mean re-install cleanly, so here is the procedure I follow on my clients' computers:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
Fully backup your&nbsp;DATA.</li><li>
Use Windows Easy Transfer (built-in) to create a&nbsp;transfer file.&nbsp; Works almost always and reproduces all your settings, backgrounds and most data.</li><li>
Use your hard drive manufacturer’s drive tester software to ensure you are working with a good hard drive.&nbsp; If yours is a laptop with a hard drive 5 years or more, just replace the hard drive.</li><li>
This is likely to take an elapsed time of around 12 hours.</li><li>
First go to your computer’s OEM support site and find and download the drivers for your computer and store them on a USB stick.</li><li>
Do not do any formatting or partitioning.</li><li>
If you made a set of disks for recovery or an image copy&nbsp;at the time your computer was new.&nbsp; This is the time you need them.</li><li>
Start your computer on the first of the disks as instructed and in an hour or so, your computer will look exactly as it did then.</li><li>
If you do not have that set of disks. You will need a legal reusable&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Product&nbsp;Key.&nbsp; You will need a Windows 7 install disk. The win7 disk must match the edition of your product key, and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows
 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.&nbsp; Hopefully, the disk you use will be labeled SP1 (Service Pack 1), because that will save you an additional 4 hours or so.</li><li>
Place the Windows 7 install disk in the disk reader and start your computer.</li><li>
Once the install process is started, choose CUSTOM.&nbsp; Ignore the check box about drivers, unless you can not proceed further.</li><li>
When you get to the place where it asks you where to put the installation, click Advanced and delete all partitions.</li><li>
When the installer asks about Windows update, choose Ask me later</li><li>
Do NOT install any programs, none</li><li>
Hopefully, you started with a Win7 install disk that was SP1 (Service Pack 1). If not, run Windows Update until you get to the point that SP1 has installed itself as part of this procedure.&nbsp; It entails multiple Windows Update passes and restarts&nbsp;which you keep
 updating until you get there.</li><li>
Once Windows 7 SP1 is installed, install the following:</li><li>

Open Windows Update, change Windows Update setting to Never check for updates</li><li>
Do not install anything else at this point – NOTHING</li><li>
Start&nbsp;the update process.&nbsp; It is likely to include about 200. It will take some time.</li><li>
Once you have a list of updates, you need to prevent certain specific updates from being installed to prevent Windows 10 from taking over.</li><li>
Click once on each Update that is NOT labeled SECURITY and check the date of issue on the right.&nbsp; If that date is after January 1, 2015, Right-click on it and hide.</li><li>
Click install updates and wait for it to finish.&nbsp; Restart when asked to do so.</li><li>
After re-start is complete and you see a desktop, start Task manager – Right-click on task bar. Look at the % at the bottom.&nbsp; Do NOT attempt to use the computer for any purpose until you see that % fall to and stay at 10% or less.&nbsp; Windows Update is still working
 and has a lot of work to do.</li><li>
Keep running Windows Update again and again till it offers no new ones.</li><li>
Start Internet Explorer, click the gear (upper right)&nbsp;in IE11 and select Compatibility settings and enter&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft.com</strong>&nbsp;in the list</li><li>
Start Windows Update and click the link to include updates for other Microsoft software.</li><li>
Run Windows Update again and again until you are satisfied you have all the updates you want.</li><li>
After the install is complete, check Device Manager. Type&nbsp;<strong>device</strong>&nbsp;in the text box above the start globe when you click it and choose Device manager
 from the list&nbsp;to find out if Win7 was able to supply the drivers you need.&nbsp; You should get drivers only from the maker of your computer or Intel.&nbsp; Its best to get all the drivers at this point.&nbsp; Win7 install may have installed all of them or nearly. Do NOT
 use any of those driver download sites.&nbsp; They are all bogus, have bad drivers, and install malware.</li><li>
Install your Microsoft Office software and then run Windows Update again and again till no more are proposed.</li><li>
Defragment your drive.&nbsp; Type&nbsp;<strong>defragment</strong>&nbsp;in the text box above the start globe when you click it once.&nbsp; Choose the Defragmentation link.&nbsp; Wait till
 it completes all passes..</li><li>
Next, you will need to take steps to prevent Windows 10 from taking over.&nbsp; First step is to change the Windows Update setting to NEVER.</li><li>
Re-install your programs</li><li>
Use Windows Easy Transfer and fill in missing data from your backup</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<strong><em>New install tip:</em></strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and&nbsp;<strong><em>before</em></strong>&nbsp;any
 (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive, you will have a precise duplicate of your system as it was at this point.&nbsp; You can
 restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time, and you will have saved yourself all the time you put in this time.</p>

<h2>            &#39;Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0&#39; provider is not registered on the local machine in Windows 7</h2>
                    Hi, I've looked up the issue and it's based on the fact that there's no 64-bit version of Jet.<br />
However, my problem comes not from working with VB or IIS or whatever else that uses this particular DB.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to run NCLEX-RN4000 on the new machine, and it's a standalone app (there's an .exe and bunch of htmls in folders). I'm assuming the program was created using VB or something similar that used this OLEDB. I'm just wondering is there absolutely no
 hope to get it working? Or is it possible to edit something in the registry? or specify a startup parameter through a shortcut?<br />
<br />
I know my computer has the msjet40.dll, it's just in a directory that the program is not used to looking at, I assume.<br />
Any info would be useful.

            <p>Very disappointing with windows 10. Simple thing like file explorer refresh, it becomes issue that users that have to deal with! It should be resolved before it was released, right?&nbsp; It is already windows 10. Yet, as always for win OS, a lot of problems
 for every version. When will win OS become stable system?!</p>

<p>
</p><p>There is no such system and there never will be. That is just how software development is - you can always do it better and so they are patching. Nowadays even your car, TV and other things is being patched (my vacuum cleaner got update recently).</p>

</p><p>However I agree with you that such simple things as explorer refresh could have been found during testing.</p>

<p>Very disappointing with windows 10. Simple thing like file explorer refresh, it becomes issue that users that have to deal with! It should be resolved before it was released, right?&nbsp; It is already windows 10. Yet, as always for win OS, a lot of problems
 for every version. When will win OS become stable system?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want OS that does not require applying endless patches, doing searches in google to resolve OS bugs, editing&nbsp; registry, running cmd ...... Give me a break!</p>

<p>Agree!&nbsp; I keep looking everday for the solution, none.&nbsp; I rename files, typically pictures and when you have 200 to 300 to work on I waste quite a lot of time refinding and reentering.&nbsp; :(</p>

<h2>            Win 10 issues with notepad</h2>
                    <p>Notepad tabs changing to black background. I have not figured out cause. See Attachment.</p>
<p>I am using Win 10 Home, version 1607, build 14393.479.</p>

            <p>The last software changes before I noticed the issue were : </p>
<p>Security Update for Adobe Flash Player for Windows 10 Version 1607 (for x64-based Systems) (KB3202790)</p>
<p>Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB3199986)</p>
<p>Feature update to Windows 10, version 1607.</p>
<p>
</p><p>on 12/09/16 installed on second attempt, first one failed</p>
<p>Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB3201845)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other programs having similar issues are WordPad, System Information, Task Manager, Adobe Acrobat DC Reader.</p>
<p>See attachment.&nbsp; Paint has none of the issues<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/60c55463-d977-410a-842c-72c974030b31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/60c55463-d977-410a-842c-72c974030b31" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Tabs, dropdowns, have black on black when window in focus. Above in system information, when I click with mouse I see OS Name Microsoft Windows 10 Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In notepad, when window not in focus, in tabs, can see black background. Upon mousing over to see drop downs, sometimes can see dropdowns correctly. If I mouse over, the dropdown box changes to black. If I click on one in column of black, I can get the dropdown
 list to appear correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paint has none of these issues. </p>
<p>Yesterday it happened again as I was working on this note.</p>
<p>Rebooting fixes everything.</p>

            <p>This looks like a display driver problem.&nbsp; Perhaps your display driver has become corrupted or is not fully compatible with the latest Windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to your computer maker's website or display card maker's website and download then install the latest driver.&nbsp;
<em>Simply trying to update a driver in Device manager will not achieve anything if the problem is corruption rather than compatibility whilst installing the latest driver will cope with both potential causes.</em></p>

            <p>The problem still exists.&nbsp; It looks like it is using some background in drop downs, text boxes, etc.</p>
<p>I will use my findings with system information.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c9fe81d-316b-41e2-ab1e-7082f8ee1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c9fe81d-316b-41e2-ab1e-7082f8ee1f91" /></a></p>
<p>Notice background is same in System Summary and in Display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In below pic, notice impact of making window narrower ... background same but text slides.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2d29ec3d-9cde-4238-9536-0f1656f628b6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2d29ec3d-9cde-4238-9536-0f1656f628b6" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first looked at system information for Display, it displays correctly, when I click on Adapter Type, Description or RAM, background changes. If I scroll fields off window and back they correct.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue in NotePad now has similar background.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Rebooting, as always fixes issue until it arises again.</p>
<p>I have not figured exactly when it happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some experimenting with themes. When issue with Notepad occurs, I can use High Contrast #1 or High Contrast #2, and everything in Notepad and other affected works as expected. High Contrast Black is a little different. For example Edit &gt; Paste is white
 text, when mouse over text goes black but box selecting entire Paste selection goes light teal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Themes High Contrast White, Windows 10, Windows, and Flowers all have similar issues to original problem.</p>

    <title>Final Fantasy XI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stupidslinky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Final Fantasy XI</h2>
                    
<p>After doing much reading it seems I am plagued by the same thing countless people over the past few years are. Getting a new 360 and transferring everything over, I decided I'd give FFXI another shot since its been a long while since I last played; only
 to find out it no longer works, and there is no way to re-download anything.</p>
<p>Trying to start the game gives me " The game couldn't start. Try downloading this game again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For more help, visit
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/support&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.xbox.com/support"</a> </p>
<p>Nothing in the market to download, and nothing in the system memory regarding PoL, FFXI, or even 'unknown game' . And as I said this is apparently a rather common problem and yet Microsoft has done nothing over the years to offer assistance or fix&nbsp;(unless
 I'm mistaken). So far, after countless reading, the only proposed solution I've found is to completely reformat the hdd of the 360 and you can reinstall the game after that. To me that solution is a bit extreme.</p>
<p><strong>Question is:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Has anyone or has MS&nbsp;come across a surefire way to get this game working that doesn't involve a reformat.</strong>
<span>And if not, shame on you MS for ignoring this issue for so long.. adding&nbsp;yet another&nbsp;reason to why I'm really starting to dislike Microsoft and the Xbox consoles.</span></p>
<span>And if not, shame on you MS for ignoring this issue for so long.. adding&nbsp;yet another&nbsp;reason to why I'm really starting to dislike Microsoft and the Xbox consoles.</span></p>
<p>I considered hooking the hdd (I'm referring to the 360slim hard drive by the way) up to my laptop via 2.5 sata to usb 3.0 cable and deleting the hidden game files myself. Win8 picked up on the cable, and the status for the cable said it was connected to
 "mass storage device" but other than that it wouldn't pick up on the hard drive itself. I could hear and feel movement from the hdd so I know power was getting to it but beyond that I don't know.</p>

<p>Anyway, sorry for the long post I just wanted to make sure to get as much information out as I could to avoid pointless/repetitive replies :)</p>

<p>Sorry I can't help with the issue, but just FYI, Xbox hard drives are not meant to be hooked up to a PC and the files are not meant to be seen on the PC. Doing so is actually a violation of the terms of service and can put you at risk for being banned.</p>

<p>Thank you for the spectacularly helpful reply.....</p>
<p>Anyway..</p>
<p>I figured as much but at this point I don't really care. Because MS and Xbox have become so disasterific (yes some improvements over the years but fix one thing 5 more get messed up along with everything else that's still a problem but I wont go there) the
 majority of the time my xbox just gets used for streaming music/movies from pc to tv. So a banhammer on my 7 or so year old account would just give me that motivation to go Sony. A CHANCE of being banned turning to an actual ban for fixing something MS chooses
 to ignore, that would actually be quite funny to me.</p>
<p>But back to the question at hand. Any one else out there have any helpful input on the topic or suggestions to try?</p>

<p>This happened to me also, again from transferring data from my old 360 to a new one, but when I clicked Play Disc a second time (so after the "unable to play disc message", PlayOnline came up with its usual message of "exiting incorrectly can corrupt data"
 etc... So I took the opportunity to select "Reinstall Play online Software", and now it's working again.

<p>I've read about that happening, as well as a few ways of trying to make it happen (ie quitting before the first error message pops up causing a load error that makes it recognize the corrupt data). But unfortunately for me no matter how many times I try
 to start the game, how I do it, or if I'm connected to live or not; I still can't get anything else to happen. Guess I'm just the unlucky one :(</p>

<p>
</p><p>I got a new gaming PC recently and it has been constantly getting crashes.</p>
<p>When playing a few intensive games, such as Batman Arkham Knight or Ark Survival evolved, I have been getting a red screen of death with no text.</p>
<p>When playing other games, such as elite dangerous I have been getting blue screen errors.</p>
<p>My pic has crashed about 4 times in the last 2 hours and it is really starting to annoy me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have received numerous errors including:</p>
<p>system service exception</p>
<p>Irql not less or equal</p>
<p>Driver irql not less or equal</p>
<p>and did at some point a few weeks back receive an error relating to memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ran chkdisks and sfc.exe /scannow. The scan said it repaired some corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me, before I put a hole through this monitor.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 update delteted all signs of wifi - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 update delteted all signs of wifi</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC updated to windows 10 whilst I was at work through the wireless internet (didn't ask it too and it did it automatically but that's another point entirely) . However when it had finished all wireless capability had gone. I restored to windows 8.1 straight
 away but it is still not there. &nbsp;I believe it deleted the wireless as the work wifi is CISCO and has a VPN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it is this problem&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3084164 However there is no troubleshooter for 8.1. Will the command prompt work on 8.1??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help,</p>
<p>

<h2>            &#91;NEWS&#93; Nuove immagini per FIFA 12</h2>
                    
<p>EA ha rilasciato tre immagini di <strong>FIFA 12</strong> che ritraggono in azione Mats Hummels, uno dei difensori più ambiti del momento nonchè uno dei principali artefici della vittoria del Borussia Dortmund in Bundesliga. In aggiunta è stata anche rilasciata
 un'immagine di Rooney tratta da una partita tra Manchester United ed Arsenal che avevamo già visto tra gli scan emersi dall'Official Playstation Magazine. Restando in attesa dei primi video di gioco di
<strong>FIFA 12</strong> vi lasciamo alle immagini in questione. </p>

<p>Le tre nuove immagini di <strong>FIFA 12</strong> che sono apparse sul web mostrano modelli definiti e luci vivide e convincenti. Difficilmente avremo questa resa nel gioco vero e proprio ma il fulcro del nuovo capitolo della serie non è l'estetica fine
 a se stessa. Ciò che più colpisce è infatti l'impact engine che affida la gestione delle collisioni a un complesso motore fisico.</p>

<p><span>Hi stiucsib86,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting to the Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure you'll have to a clean install if that's not the way you trying.<br />
Depending on hardware, you may need to install a driver for the hard drive to be recognized.<br />
<br />
If this is a computer you built, you may want to check the paperwork that came with the device, or check the manufacturers website, for information regarding device drive installation.<br />
<br />
If this is a Pre-built OEM computer, you may have a disc that came with it with the drivers for the hard drive.<br />
<br />
Please let us know if this helps.<br />

                    I &nbsp;created a folder on my desktop and copied image files from my SD card into the newly created folder on my desktop. This folder has apparently disappeared without trace as I was using it and I cannot find it anywhere on my laptop. &nbsp;I did not at any stage

    <title>Windows 8 and joining a domain - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> haim123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 and joining a domain</h2>
                    <p>So I just got a windows 8 machine and want to join the company's domain.&nbsp; But I now learned that I need Windows 8 pro.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I spend the money on an upgrade to Windows 8 pro or does 8.1 have the necessary capability to join a domain?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, do I have to pay for an upgrade to windows 8.1?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Windows DVD Player won&#39;t open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sidaleaf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows DVD Player won&#39;t open</h2>
                    After installing Windows 10 I was given Windows DVD Player as I'd previously purchased Windows Media Center (no longer available). The DVD player worked fine for one night; since then when I click on the icon it won't open. After paying $100 for Media
 Center last year I'm aggrieved to be without a DVD player, especially as the one time it worked, it was rather good.

<p>BT used to use Yahoo but BTYahoo got hacked in 2013 and their thread (URL to follow) about it is still the largest thread on BT's forum, with nearly 1000 posts. But again that shouldn't have caused the above message to appear&nbsp; in place of th "Hmmm" message,

<h2>            Alternately errors&#58; 800704CD and 80072751</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hello. I changed the password for the account live on the site. When I try to log into my profile on the console, an error 80072751. Password and data are correct. The site authentication is correct.</span></p>
<p><span>I delete account tag on the console, clear your cache, and I try to download the profile of the service live.<br />
Now an error 800704CD. If you can enter the password again produces an error: 80072751. And so alternately.<br />
Similar posts were - but no comments as to be.<br />
Help! I am ill and sit at home, boring, can not play :(</span></p>

<p>Thanks for the support message.</p>
<p>If the Microsoft account email and password are working on Xbox.com but not on the console, it sounds like you have TSV enabled. &nbsp;To fix the problem, please go to
<a href="http://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.microsoft.com/</a> &gt;&gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt;&gt; More security settings &gt;&gt; If you're prompted to the "Help us protect your account" screen, follow those instructions &gt;&gt; Once you're on the "Security
 Settings" page scroll down to "Two-step verification and disable that. &nbsp;Once you do that, try to sign in again on your console. &nbsp;If that doesn't work, restart the console and try again.</p>
<p>Please let us know how that goes.</p>

<p>I know this is an old thread, but maybe this will help someone else. &nbsp;I had almost identical problems. &nbsp;What fixed my problem was to switch from a wired connection to my router to a wireless connection. &nbsp;Someone else more intelligent about connectivity can
 explain better why this fixed it. &nbsp;Might be worth a try for someone else. &nbsp;Go from wired to wireless or vise versa and try downloading again.</p>

            This is one of the known issues with the update as Recovery partition should be hidden and is accidentally assigned a drive letter. 
<br />Right-click Start&gt;Command Prompt(admin) 
<br />Type in the following: 
<br />diskpart 
<br />list volume 
<br />select volume 3 
<br />Replace 3 with the number of the volume which is assigned a drive letter. (In hundreds of MBs) 
<br />remove letter="F" 
<br />
<br />Don't worry, removing a drive letter would not cause any harm to your device.

            It has been happening with new update that new drive is getting uncovered. You can do following to hide it and there will no harm anywhere.
<br />
<br />Type diskpart in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) &gt; Right click on Diskpart and run as Administrator
<br />Give following command and Enter: 
<br />select volume f
<br />Give following command and Enter: 
<br />remove letter=f

            Hi GeorgeZinn,
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with possible resolution to the issue you are reporting.
<br />
<br />This the result of update 1803 and is a recovery partition that is supposed to be hidden.  The way to resolve this is by removing the mapping. 
<br />
<br />Remove the drive letter (we will assume for an example system is reporting drive D is full)
<br />1.	Hit Windows key + R together to go into Run
<br />2.	Type in the following: diskpart 
<br />3.	Type “list volume” (no quotes)
<br />4.	Select “volume F” (volume corresponding to the drive letter that is being reported as full)
<br />5.	Remove letter=F (corresponding to the drive letter that is being reported as full)
<br />
<br />You can also accomplish this by 
<br />1.	Hit Windows key + R together to go into Run
<br />2.	Type in the following: diskmgmt.msc 
<br />3.	You will see a graphical display of all your partitions and drives.
<br />4.	Select and right click on the partition that is being reported as full
<br />5.	Select Change Drive Letter and Paths
<br />6.	Click on Remove
<br />7.	Click Yes to confirm
<br />8.	Click Yes at the warning
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.       
        </p>

            Hi George, this is a known bug in the 1803 Update,
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />list volume
<br />
<br />Note down the letter associated with that new drive
<br />
<br />Run these commands one at a time and hit Enter (replace X with the correct drive letter)
<br />
<br />select volume X
<br />
<br />remove letter=X
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and restart your PC
