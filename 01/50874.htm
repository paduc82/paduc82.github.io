<h2>            Error code 0x80070057 when trying to play Halo wars 2. Tried everything i know to do</h2>
                    <p>Hi, Recently i have been trying to play Halo Wars 2. But when i launch it i get the error code 0x8070057. Now, i'm not making this post before having tried everything i Know to do.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's a list of what I've tried so far:</p><p>1. Retry</p><p>2. Restart the xbox</p><p>3. Uninstall and reinstall (Which i ended up having a big problem with, will get to later)</p><p>4. turn off the xbox, unplug everything, wait 30 seconds, plug back in, turn on</p><p>5. Reset the xbox without deleting my games</p><p><br /></p><p>None of these have worked. (Note all other games are working fine). Now back to the uninstalling and reinstalling, It wouldn't uninstall. I would hit uninstall, it would disappear, wouldn't give me the space back, i took out the disc and put it back in, and it said it was installed. I'm at a loss and am ready to just never play it again. Can someone please tell me what to do. Is it the disc/game? Is it my console? Is it Microsoft?&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks in adva

    <title>Return &#40;Enter&#41; Key intermittently stops working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> snowgoergirl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Return &#40;Enter&#41; Key intermittently stops working</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 and am using Chrome as my browser. My enter key works fine for a while but after about 8-10 hours, it stops working (the number keypad enter key won't work either).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution I've found so far is to restart/shutdown Windows. &nbsp;This is true across all programs - email accounts (gmail, Outlook), Word, Excel, and message boxes just like this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've googled a lot and can't find the answer. I tried a different keyboard and the problem remains, so it isn't my keyboards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated to Windows 10 on this computer in July 2016. The problem with the enter key did not crop up until June 2017. I've had two Windows 10 updates since June. I'm using the most recent version of Chrome and my keyboard driver is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has some ideas or had the same issue, I would appreciate your help!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Karen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why you are having a keyboard issue is a faulty driver.&nbsp; We suggest running the
<strong>Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter</strong>. This automated troubleshooter will try to identify and then resolve the issues that it finds. Kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On the <strong>Search</strong> box, type <strong>troubleshooting</strong> and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Under<strong> Hardware and Sound</strong>, click on<strong> Configure a device</strong>.</li><li>The Hardware Troubleshooter will open. You can set it to fix the detected problems automatically or select and opt to fix only the one’s you want.</li><li>Click on<strong> Next </strong>to run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter. Once the scan is completed, it will present you with a report.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try to uninstall and reinstall your keyboard driver in the <strong>
Device Manager</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any other questions.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestions. I took my computer to the professionals when the problem worsened - none of the keys worked and right after I had started up Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pros were not able to duplicate the problem over a 24-hour period. However, they did run diagnostics, optimize Windows, update Windows, reinstall drivers, remove a single malware file, etc. They were clueless and could find no rationale for the cause
 of the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I brought the computer home, all seemed to be in perfect working order until I started up a program I use all the time. The keyboard immediately stopped functioning. I quit the program and the keyboard started functioning again. I ran the program again,
 and yep, the keyboard was totally "locked up." As soon as I stopped the program, the keyboard was behaving properly again. It didn't matter what keyboard I used. I restarted the computer a few times and every time I started up this little problem, the keyboard
 would stop responding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I have no idea why the problem was intermittent at first and only the two enter keys were affected. &nbsp;I am self-employed and depend on this program for efficiency and accuracy. The program is called Shorthand. It is a text expansion program and
 saves me a lot of typing. Unfortunately, it's not saving me anything now. It's very frustrating, but I have contacted the company to find out if they have any insight to what is going on. The program has worked perfectly for me for nearly 10 years and for
 several years on this particular computer, so it's a real puzzle. All I can think is that there is something new in the Windows 10 operating system that is interfering with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestions. I will post any solutions I get from pcshorthand.com.</p>

</p><p>Calls to mobiles and landlines and sending SMS are the paid features in Skype. If you are trying to call a mobile number or a landline number using your Skype, that will require Skype credits or a subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your standard Skype to Skype calling and&nbsp;instant messaging&nbsp;are free. If you are being asked for credits, check if you are calling or messaging&nbsp;a mobile number by right-clicking on your contact and selecting view profile, if you see a phone icon then that

                    Hi everyone, thanks for reading.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if deleting stuff from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE -&gt; SOFTWARE part of the registry can damage your computer - if it is software that you have installed. For example google chrome.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

</p><p>I click on Forgot Password for Skype. It tells me that I have to sign in with my MS account. When I do, it tells me that it needs to send me a code. When I enter that code, my MS account password needs to be changed, not Skype. I did that 3 times and am
 running out of passwords that I will remember, but Skype is still not changed and I can't get into it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solutions talk about clicking on Reset Password and then selecting the appropriate radio button. There are no radio buttons. The problem also is that each screen says Microsoft and NONE of them say Skype so you really don't know what you are changing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone post instructions on how to change the Skype password with wording and screens that are actually displayed during the process?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, Sheri</p>

<p>Hi SheriCerny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings from Skype!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We apologized for the inconvenience that this issue had caused you. Based on what you have posted, it seems that the password reset flow pertains to your Microsoft account and not on your old Skype user name. So if you want to reset your old Skype account,
 please refer to the below steps:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to Skype website using your Skype old user name and click on Forgot password button and you will be redirected to this page:</li></ol>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f2d5a868-7c0f-4ef7-aeb9-6196d6e8c1fe?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f2d5a868-7c0f-4ef7-aeb9-6196d6e8c1fe?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>2. Click on NEXT and you will be redirected to our verification page. Choose your preferred method on where our system can send you the security code. See below screen shot:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2ee42f3-e179-431d-bf1f-7eb5a54a7d37?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2ee42f3-e179-431d-bf1f-7eb5a54a7d37?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>3. Enter the security code that you have received.</p>
<p>4. After entering the code, you will be redirected to a page where you will be asked to reset your Skype password for your old Skype account.</p>
<p>5. Once done, sign in to Skype website or Skype application using your old Skype user name and new Skype password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**If incase you don't have any access to your security details, kindly choose " I don't have any of these" and you will be asked to answer our account recovery form. Once you are done answering it, kindly wait 24 - 48 hours for an update coming from our
 recovery team via email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reply!</p>

    <title>Keyboard freezes every startup, Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga w&#47;Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kennethlavoie iii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard freezes every startup, Lenovo Thinkpad Yoga w&#47;Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga, 4 years old. Great little device but maddening problem.</p>
<p>It is a 2-in-1 and I 've disabled "tablet mode" etc.</p>
<p>I use it for ONE THING ONLY. To hook up to TV and watch videos. I boot up, and all is well. But 90% of the time when I open a video, as soon as I do, the cursor and keyboard freeze. I can still manipulate via the touchscreen.</p>
<p>Other times it's moving the mouse for the first time that freezes it. I have to shut down, restart then all is well. It's like it's PROGRAMMED to do this ONE every OTHER log in session, but no more than once. I've even watched a video,
 shut that one down, then opened a 2d and that's when it freezes. So no rhyme or reason. Freezes basically when it's given ANY input whatsoever, with the first 5 input events (mousepad touch, screen move, file opening, etc.) then once rebooted, it generally
 won't do it again during the NEW reboot.</p>
<p>RESTARTING DOES NOT SOLVE. IT STAYS FROZEN. I literally have to hold the power button until everything goes dead, then restart.

<h2>            Edge Browser won&#39;t install</h2>
                    I installed Windows 10 on my computer several months ago. A few weeks ago Edge stopped opening. When I clicked on edge I got a busy circle and then nothing. I thought Edge might be corrupted so I uninstalled and then attempted to reinstall from MS store.
 I can get the try Edge screen but when I try to download nothing happens. I am at a loss, any ideas?

            This link thanks me for downloading edge but I still do not show Edge as an app in my computer. Under install instructions it says NA. To uninstall I went to This PC: uninstall or change a program. If Edge is still in my PC I have no way to access it.

            <p>Hi Kathy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How exactly did you uninstall Microsoft edge?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try switching the current Microsoft Account to a local account and then back to a Microsoft account. This will not affect your personal files and settings. To proceed with this method, follow the steps below:</p>
<p><span><span>1. Press Windows key + I to open settings.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click Accounts &gt; Your email and accounts </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Click "sign in with a local account instead" and follow the screen instructions to create the local account.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Once you are signed in through a local account, repeat steps 1 and 2 and click "sign in with a Microsoft account instead".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Enter your Microsoft account credentials during the setup.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us know the result. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need a copy of an owners manual (users manual) for my Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 300V2.0...None of the Microsoft sites seem to offer any, but I'm sure there's a copy so I can learn what all the keys do on my keyboard.&nbsp; Any help will be appreciated

<h2>            App failure after running windows update kb3124200</h2>
                    <p>Prior to 12/29 update, I was able to use application with no issues (Recipe Keeper Pro).&nbsp; Since the Windows update of 12/29, the application fails to launch and the eventlog says:&nbsp;
</p>
<p><span>Activation of app TudorspanLimited.RecipeKeeper_mnckez06wj9wa!App failed with error: No applicable app licenses found. See the Microsoft-Windows-TWinUI/Operational
 log for additional information.</span></p>
<p>The above mentioned application log has an error saying:&nbsp; The tile cache has suffered a CRC failure for this entry's data region.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No other information is available.&nbsp; After searching online, I see there are a few different issues reported with the above update.&nbsp; Should I uninstall the update?&nbsp; How do I get my application to run?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1&#58; How do I bold, italicize, and underline text as I did - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tony 97446  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1&#58; How do I bold, italicize, and underline text as I did with Windows XP</h2>
                    <p>FYI:&nbsp; I got the answer to the below question and, for the convenience of anyone with this same problem, I have edited this post to include that answer below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ORIGINAL QUESTION:</strong>&nbsp; With Windows XP, I could press CTRL and B to
<strong>bold</strong>, CTRL and I to <em>italicize</em>, CTRL and U to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
underline</span>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I can't do that with Windows 8.1.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can someone tell me how to do this with the key board?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ANSWER:&nbsp; </strong>I didn't know that with Windows 8.1, you have to create "compatibility" between the computer and the web pages you are using.&nbsp; It is done like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the web page&nbsp;with which&nbsp;you are having problems.</li><li>Select the "Tools" icon.&nbsp; (On my computer, it is the gear icon in the upper right hand corner of the screen but can also be accessed with Alt + X.)</li><li>Select "Compatibility View Settings".</li><li>The name of the web site you are currently viewing&nbsp;should be&nbsp;listed under "Add this website:".</li><li>Click "Add", then "Close".</li><li>You're done.&nbsp; You should now be able to do not only bold, italics, and underline, but you should see additional tabs and pull down menus&nbsp;to which&nbsp;you didn't have access before ... or at least I did&nbsp;after I&nbsp;was taught this trick by a very helpful person.&nbsp;</li></ol>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Network Connections is empty</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from windows 8.1 to windows 10 and my network connections are gone - therefore I can't access the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device manager shows both my AC 7260 in my laptop and the Cisco AE6000 AC wifi adapter USB network stick as being installed and driver working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw some mention of registry problems in previous versions of windows that caused similar problems - i did verify that the GUIDs were on four separate lines in the registry ClassManagers but have not found any Config entry to reset in Networks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS recommended i roll back Windows but I cannot as it reports the windows 8.1 files were removed.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how I can fix this?</p>

            <p>I'm having the exact same problem with the upgrade of my HP G2 17 ZBook. Almost a brand new notebook late 2014.
</p>
<p>Before I started the upgrade from W8.1 to W10 I did a full Windows Update and a HP Support Assistant with several restarts. Wired and Wifi were working flawlessly (Intel Ethernet l217-LM and Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260). No exclamation marks in Device
 Manager or red flags in the Event Viewer.<br />
After the upgrade there are no Network Connections (Just an Airplane mode Button) to be seen. The Control Panel-&gt;Network and Internet-&gt;Network Connections shows absolutely nothing at all: 'This folder is empty'.</p>
<p>I have no clue what the problem is or how I can solve it. In W10 Event Viewer there is nothing to suggest that there are any major network issues. I have rolled back to W8.1 and everything is working as before. Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>I Solved it by rolling back to 8.1 and then remove the Cisco and FortiClient VPN software. This was also mentiod in another post. I have reinstalled W10 and everything is working as advertised now. Maybe Microsoft should pick up this issue in their compatibility
 check software.</p>

There is a known issue at the moment regarding the Cisco VPN compatibility check when installing via those options.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I downloaded an iso from msdn subscriptions and installed it from within w8.1. The 'Get Windows 10' app, only suggested to remove the 'HP Security Manager', which I did ofcourse. I also used the option to check for updates during the installation (615MB!).</p>

            Thanks. Understood. For the moment, installing via ISO or USB will not catch the incompatability, which is known.

            <p>Why is there no sensible reply from Microsoft. How on earth can one download a new driver without access to the internet? How can I connect with an ethernet cable without and adaptor? How can I connect to another pc to use as an access point without the
 relevant cables - it does not work through the USB.</p>
<p>i have tried the manual reset through Cmd prompt as suggested by some answers but that does not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My laptop is brand new. i bought it the day before Windows 10 was released.</p>
<p>And please answer this question. if I roll back to Windows 8.1 can I go back to Windows 10 once Microsoft has sorted the problem.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>First, I am sorry you are experiencing issues with your network connections. If you don't mind a few details would be helpful to determine the actual issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) What is your device (make and model)?</p>
<p>2) What is the current driver and date? (right-click on the windows icon and select device manager&gt;network adapters. From here right-click on the adapter and select properties&gt;Driver)</p>
<p>3) What is the Hardware ID (same as before, but select the Details tab and from the dropdown select Hardware Ids)</p>
<p>4) How did you install Win10? (ISO, USB, upgrade notification, etc.)</p>
<p>5) Do you have any VPNs or third-party firewalls or AV programs installed? If yes, which ones?</p>
<p>6) What are the exact symptoms? (e.g. limited connectivity, no network connections, missing drivers, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To answer your question regarding roll back, yes you can&nbsp;go back to&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;10. Assuming you want the free upgrade, the answer is still yes as long as it is&nbsp;within the promotional period (until July 29, 2016).

            <p>HI Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>1)The Device is an &nbsp;Acer Aspire Switch 10E SW3-013 (which is a model listed on Acer's website as one which Microsoft will support the upgrade to)</p>
<p>2) Realtek 3008.8.401.2015 Driver date 15/05/2015 &nbsp; &nbsp; Realtek RTL8723BS Wireless Lan802</p>
<p>3) SD\VID_024c&amp;PID_0623</p>
<p>4) I installed it over my wi-fi network which was working when it was running Windows 8.1</p>
<p>5) I have AVG 2015.0.6125 which I installed on the notebook after removing the provided trial McAffee as I already have a 3 user licence for my AVG. It does have a firewall .</p>
<p>6) There is no wifi at all - no neighbouring pcs or macs are visible and absolutely no wifi networks - I have 3 routers in the house and two are on separate ADSL lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run the troubleshooter it asks me to install a driver for my network adaptor . It says "Windows could not detect a properly installed network adapter. if you have a network adapter, you will need to reinstall the driver"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried copying drivers from the Acer website on to a USB flash drive and transferring it to the notebook but cannot get them to work. I also tried the reg del solution that has been posted but that did not work. i was about to try the reg edit solution
 when I saw your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only bought the notebook for my son to use at school (high school) and bought it 10 days ago, the day before Windows 10 was rolled out with the promise that I could upgrade to Windows 10. I had wanted to get it all set up for him before he starts the new
 term. There is no real data on it apart from the AVG and the setting up of email so am happy to roll back to the previous version or to reset.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Assuming you installed AVG before upgrading, I suspect this is causing problems with the netsetup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, let's check for dni_dne.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click on the windows icon (lower left) and select Command Prompt (admin). From here enter the following script:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>netcfg -s n</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the output report, do you see dni_dne listed? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, we can either run the reg delete or the troubleshooter (both listed below). If you are not sure, run it. If it is not present, the problem will remain.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Reg Delete: </strong></p>
<div>reg delete HKCR\CLSID\{988248f3-a1ad-49bf-9170-676cbbc36ba3} /f</div>
<div>netcfg -v -u dni_dne</div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Troubleshooter: </strong><span><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_cssemerg68309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://aka.ms/diag_cssemerg68309</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If all else fails, we can try a rollback to the previous system&gt;remove AVG and then upgrade to 10. After upgrading, we can look to re-install AVG.

    <title>Spontaneous Freezes Since June 14th Windows Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mdelbranson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spontaneous Freezes Since June 14th Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>Hello and thanks in advance for any help or advice offered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the June 14th Windows Update successfully installed, my laptop has been spontaneously freezing. I have no performance issues before the freezes occur, and it can happen within a few minutes to a few hours after booting the computer. No error messages
 are displayed. &nbsp;The computer simply halts completely, with the mouse and keyboard becoming unresponsive, audio stops, and though the screen continues to display, it ceases to update apparently as the clock in the toolbar stops progressing. &nbsp;The issue does
 not appear to be associated with any specific application, as it has occurred while streaming video in Chrome, navigating the gui in Steam, programming java in Eclipse, chatting in Discord, etc. After the computer freezes, it does not appear to ever recover
 on its own, as I've left it in the frozen state for about 12 hours with no changes in the condition. The only way out of the frozen state is to turn off the computer and reboot, after which the computer performs marvelously until the next spontaneous freeze
 occurs. No memory dump information is generated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The updates that installed on June 14th were KB4022725, KB4023307, KB4022730, KB4022405, and KB890830.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus far, I have the attempted the following:</p>
<p>1. Updating Drivers. Windows could not find new drivers for any devices. Manufacturer's website does not indicate any new drivers available. Successfully installed new graphics driver through NVidia's Experience support application.</p>
<p>2. Memory Check. Successfully completed using mdsched.exe.</p>
<p>3. Reset Virtual Memory. Set the custom size of the paging file with the recommended size as the minimum and 1.5 times the system RAM as the maximum. Deleted all files in the Temp folder.</p>
<p>4. Disk Check. Performed successful error check on all drives.</p>
<p>5. System File Check. &nbsp;Successfully completed system file check from the command prompt while running as administrator.</p>
<p>6. Power Settings. Set the option for turning off the hard drive to never occur.</p>
<p>7. Virus scan. No threats found using Avast virus protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of these actions have been successful in fixing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my system specs:</p>
<p>https://www.dropbox.com/s/diti0ishixdzgiu/sysinfo.txt?dl=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the issue might be something related to having the OS installed on the solid state drive since my other systems without solid state drives appear to be fine, but I'm not really proficient in diagnosing things like this. &nbsp;Please let me know if there
 is any other information I can provide that would be useful in identifying the problem.</p>
<p>

<p>I believe I've corrected the issue. &nbsp;The freezing appears to have been the result of an outdated BIOS version, and the account creation failures exposed while troubleshooting appears to have been a separate issue caused by some conflict with a background
 process. I'm uncertain which background process was causing the issue. Trying to track it down was rather tedious, so just to be safe, I went ahead and wiped my drives and performed a clean install of the operating system. I've experienced no more freezes
 since installing the BIOS update, and newly created accounts function normally since reinstalling the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's helpful at all to others, the BIOS version I had while experiencing the freezes since the June 14th Windows Update was Insyde F.23 dated 13 October 2016, and the new BIOS version that appears to have fixed the issue is Insyde F.36 dated 7 April 2017.</p>

            Hello Elizabeth,<br />
<br />
From what i see on the Quickbooks site, only version 2007 up have full support for Vista.&nbsp; From version 2005 and before you had to use compatibility mode to work properly.&nbsp; So you can either try compatibility mode to see if that works.<br />
<br />
Right click on the Quickbooks executable, select properties.&nbsp; There click on the Compatibility tab.&nbsp; Use the drop down box to select XP SP2 or XP SP3.&nbsp; Use the check box and select Run as Admin as well.&nbsp; Click okay.&nbsp; Now try to run Quickbooks.&nbsp; If that doesnt
 work then Quickbooks 2002 is not compatible and can only be run in XP Mode or purchase a updated version of the product.<br />
<br />

    <title>secondary usb enhanced controller fails after reboot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alex casals  say:</h3>
<h2>            secondary usb enhanced controller fails after reboot</h2>
                    I am using Windows 7 SP 1 Home premium.<br />
<br />
I have activated automatic updates, and my system is up to date.<br />
<br />
I week ago, I started to get problems with one of the standard enhanced usb controllers. My system has two of them. When I look to devices manager, I can see one of the controllers is ok, and the oher has a problem. If I unistall the controllem with the problem,
 and then look for new hardware, the controller installs flawlessly, and everything works ok.<br />
But, in the next boot (both warm and cold boot), I get the problem again: one standard usb controller is installed, but the other one is not.<br />
<br />
I've tried to uninstall all the usb drivers, and to install them again, including "hidden" drivers (what I see activating "view hidden devices")<br />
<br />
I've unistalled and reinstalled SP 1. And yes, I have installed the fix from KB2529073<br />
<br />
I have installed usb enhanced drivers from my vendor, and besides they show a different name in hardware devices list, the files usbehci.sys, usbhub.sys and usbport.sys are exactly equals to the files provided by microsoft.
<br />
<br />
These are the files from my usb enhanced controller:<br />
usbehci.sys ver 6.1.7601.17586<br />
usbhub.sys ver 6.1.7600.16385<br />
usbport.sys ver 6.1.7601.17514<br />
<br />
Usbhub.sys isn't updated to sp1. Is it ok?. If not, how can I update it?<br />
<br />
I again have to remark than when I uninstall the controller, and I force the sistem to look for new hardware, the controller installs and works ok. It is just after reboot that I see the controller again badly installed, and it happens only with the secondary
 usb enhanced controller, not with both.<br />
<br />
Saludos,<br />

<p><span>Perform the following troubleshooting methods:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method: 1</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refer the following link and install the updates for the USB controller and check how it works.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2529073" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Binary files in some USB drivers are not updated after you install
 Windows 7 SP1 or Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1</a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Method: 2</span></b></p>
<p><span>If that doesn’t work, then run the hardware troubleshooter and check for the exact issue.</span></p>
<p><span>View the following link to run the hardware troubleshooter.</span></p>

            Hi Sathish,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your quick answer.<br />
<br />
As I stated above, I had installed the fix suggested in Method 1. (KB2529073) with no results.<br />
<br />
An again, I've used before method 2. And yes, it works until the next boot. Troubleshooter reports an usb enhanced controller badly installed, and reinstalls it. Afther that, the system works well.
<br />
This is the troubleshooter report. It is in Spanish language, but I think you can see the picture:<br />

            I answer myself because I have found a solution:<br />
<br />
I followed some instructions from <a href="http://www.wretch.cc/blog/taichungtom/21567627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>:<br />
<br />
1: Delete this file mpfilt.sys in&nbsp;\Windows\syswow64\drivers &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then restart the computer.<br />
<br />
2: Run&nbsp;&nbsp;the regedit . and then go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\currentcontrolset\services\mpfilt , then delete the "mpfilt" folder.<br />
<br />
3<span>:</span> Look for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{36FC9E60-C465-11CF-8056-444553540000}&nbsp;&nbsp;delete the value "Lowerfilters<br />
<br />
After reboot, drivers are newly installed, properly by now.<br />
<br />

            <p>I also had problems with drivers of usb controllers (intel P41 chipset): after rebooting they were "failed", and I have to reinstall it mannually. So, Alex Casals' method was effective.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Persistent &#34;Not Responding&#34; issue</h2>
                    For some time now I have been experiencing "Not Responding" problems. Sites open, but immediately freeze, or work for a short time before seizing up, &amp; I get a&nbsp;"**** (enter website name) is not responding" box, with a "refresh page" button. When I click
 on this,&nbsp;I then get another box with a green loading bar, stating "Windows is searching for a solution". This takes a few moments, to a minute, then the site reopens, &amp; if I am lucky, it will work, but&nbsp;often not, &amp; sometimes&nbsp;this happens repeatedly. It can
 be any site, You Tube, FB, Hotmail, or any other site I try to access. Typical of this was when I try to access my Hotmail/Outlook. It opens, then freezes, "live.com is not responding"..."Windows is searching for a solution", site opens, works for a few moments,
 then freezes again, "live.com is not responding"..."Windows is searching for a solution", site opens, immediately freezes, "live.com is not responding"..."Windows is searching for a solution"...&

<h2>            How to remove multiboot screen &#40;&#38; duplicate win 8&#41;</h2>
                    Hi, I installed the downloaded win 8 from within an xp running as a dual boot (no, not a good plan). &nbsp;The old multiboot screen still loads, with options for: win 8 1 (new install), win 8 2 (free trial RTM - doesn't seem to be counting down the days anymore)
 and earlier version of windows (but the xp seems to have been erased). &nbsp;If possible I would like to fix this by doing a clean install of win 8 wiping out everything else - possible? &nbsp;Complication: when I downloaded the update I downloaded Windows8-Setup.exe,
 whereas I would actually have liked to download an iso image to burn to a disc - can I still do the latter at this stage (would seem to make solving my problem somewhat easier - otherwise looks like I'll have to re-install win xp from scratch, then upgrade
 again, ouch). &nbsp;Thanks muchly for any help.

            <p>1) Download and install EasyBCD.<br />
2) Use EasyBCD ‘Edit Boot Menu’ option to change the ‘Default’ OS to the version of Windows 8 you wish to remove and remove that version of Windows 8 from the boot menu. Change the Timeout Option from 30 seconds to ‘Skip the boot menu’.<br />
3) Verify that you can boot to Windows 8</p>
