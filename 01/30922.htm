            Hi Maureen,<br />
<br />
<br />
According to <strong>Marilyn--</strong>, "<em>the Windows Update error code <strong>
8024A000</strong> means <strong>WU E AU NOSERVICE</strong>. This is translated as AU was unable to service incoming AU calls.</em>"<br />
<br />
You may check her answer <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-update/windows-update-error-code-8024a000/562845f3-78d5-42a0-bed5-e3fd39f01df7">here</a></strong> in resolving this kind
 of error code. I know it's on Windows 8.1 but it's okay with Windows 7 too.<br />
<br />
Let me know how it goes.<br />
<br />
<br />

    <title>Snap Feature Sometimes Freezes When Snapping To Left-Hand Side - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ninjaxue  say:</h3>
<h2>            Snap Feature Sometimes Freezes When Snapping To Left-Hand Side</h2>
                    <p>Not a particularly pressing issue, but I noticed a curious quirk with my Windows Snap Feature. &nbsp;About a third of the time when I snap a Windows Explorer window (i.e. Documents or similar folders) to the left-hand side of the screen, it will become very thin
 (approximately the size of the Navigation Pane) and flicker rapidly until I try to click on it, after which it freezes. From here, I am still able to click X to close the window (though it does not give off the typical "highlight" to show that my cursor is
 hovering over it), which will close all other open Windows Explorer windows and make the Start Menu disappear for a few seconds before reappearing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will occur whether I Snap via click-and-drag or Windows key + left arrow, again only when attempting to snap to the left-hand side, occurring about a third of the time. For some reason, snapping to the right side is completely impervious to this error.
 This issue does not occur when I snap Chrome windows, which I do very often, and I have not snapped other types of windows enough times to draw a conclusion on those. From a little experimentation, I have also concluded that waiting until all thumbnails have
 completely loaded before attempting to snap makes no difference. I also have Snap Assist turned off, so once I snap a window it will not automatically show me other windows which are available to snap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, this isn't really a pressing matter; easily avoidable by just snapping my Explorer windows on the right. I'm just curious as to why this would be happening, and if there is anything I can do to fix it. Thank you.</p>

<h3> j_chen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Instability&#58;  Restart Causing Problems After Updates</h2>
                    <p>For the last 2 months, I have been struggling with Windows 10 on my HP DV6 laptop.&nbsp; We had a few incidents where the laptop would just freeze upon booting up.&nbsp; To resolve the issue, I've booted via USB --&gt; Advanced Options:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Startup repair - FAILED</p>
<p>2) System restore - FAILED</p>
<p>3) System reset (keep files and don't keep files) - FAILED</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) <span>Follow the steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a) Type “cmd” without quotes in the search box.</span></p>
<p><span>b) On the left pane, right click on the “cmd” option and select “Run as Administrator”.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Type ‘sfc /scannow’ without quotes and hit enter.&nbsp; -- FAILED<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>5) Bootrec and BCD Rebuild - FAILED</span></p>
<p><span>The only option was to start from scratch and re-install Windows.&nbsp; This worked; however, as updates began to flow through, we are finding that doing a Restart (automatically after certain updates or by the user via the windows icon) would
 once again cause this endless boot loop that could only be fixed by wiping everything and re-installing windows.&nbsp; Shut down and Sleep do not seem to cause issues.&nbsp; I have spent so much time reinstalling everything only to have restarts take the machine down
 again.&nbsp; Does anyone have any guidance on how to fix this issue?</span></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi J Chen.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Follow this specific Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI. 
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.  
<br />
<br />
<br />Immediately after  install save a System Image backup and make sure System Restore is enabled on C with 5-15% disk space apportioned so you can go back at any time:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>
<br />
<br />Then take your time following the Setup steps to make it a Diagnostic install.  After each Updates, Program, and Settings install or change take plenty of time to observe performance changes and be prepared to roll back via System Restore to isolate exactly what is causing the problem.  
<br />
<br />As it progresses without failure update the System Image and continue to refresh your Restore Points.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> You can also turn off Windows Updates by setting a Metered Connection to have a break or keep them installing when you want and not pushing themselves:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            "Clean" command specifically clears the partition table better than just deleting all partitions, but more therapeutically it clears the boot sector of all code that can remain and interfere.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since last night, I tried the clean install process several times and it continued to fail.&nbsp; Windows would install and the updates would come through.&nbsp; However, upon restart (caused by the update process), the laptop would ultimately black screen and freeze.&nbsp;
 The end result was always a corrupted install that could not be recovered.&nbsp; So I started going down the road of seeing if fast startup was causing issues with my restarts.&nbsp; I attempted to disable it upon clean install to see if it would help with the restart
 issue but it didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a break through this evening.&nbsp; This was the key article that seemed to get me over the hump.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4043292/windows-10-black-screen-when-restarts-after-windows-update-oem-factory</p>
<p>
</p><p>Immediately after the clean install and Windows was available. I ran the update described in the link above and restarted the laptop.&nbsp; The laptop restart was successful.&nbsp; I proceeded to install the rest of the updates and the restart was successful yet again.&nbsp;
 I am hoping the worst is behind me.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is indeed the root cause, it seems to makes sense, because my troubles began shortly after getting the April update when the version of Win 10 having this issue was released.&nbsp; I'm frustrated about having to spend so many hours trying to resolve an
 issue that was essentially pushed upon me via the updates, but I am hoping this might be helpful to others facing the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC Specs:</p>
<p>HP Pavillion dv6 Notebook</p>
<p>Processor&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2670QM CPU @ 2.20GHz, 2201 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 8 Logical Processor(s)<br />
</p>
<p>I'll post again if anything else arises in the next few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Justin</p>

            Justin, very glad you got that sorted out.  Nice work!
<br />
<br />I have a question though:  Are you sure you were using the very latest bootable media created by Media Creation Tool because it should have had that corrective Update for your issue in it and avoided the problem.  So the issue was caused in 1703 on some OEM PC's, but corrected in an Update that was included in 1709.  So were you using 1703 media only?  It should not have repeated the issue using 1709 or 1803 media.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The nightmare is actually continuing.&nbsp; In response to your question, I downloaded a fresh version of the media this AM so I believe I should have the latest.&nbsp; Although I am wondering now if the OEM fix actually resolved my issue.&nbsp; So here is what I am dealing
 with now.&nbsp; With this latest "successful" clean install, I noticed that I no longer had the ability to "Sleep" when clicking on Windows --&gt; Power.&nbsp; I also didn't have the option to even select Sleep in the Power Options.&nbsp; This was strange because I had Sleep
 available in all of my previous attempts.&nbsp; After doing some digging, people were saying that the Sleep feature is closely tied to the display adapter.&nbsp; My machine has AMD and Intel adapters and typically they are tied to AMD 7400 and INTEL HD 3000 drivers.&nbsp;
 However, I noticed that the INTEL display adapter was tied to a Microsoft Basic Display Driver.&nbsp; So I updated the driver letting the system do the recommended update and sure enough the INTEL driver was installed.&nbsp; However, upon restart everything froze and
 now nothing is recoverable again.&nbsp; I am starting to think I got lucky with this latest attempt and things progressed because the INTEL HD Driver did not install for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched online and it looks like many people are also having issues with the INTEL drivers and Windows 10.&nbsp; Any thoughts?&nbsp; Does this make sense to you? Did something happen with the April update to disrupt compatibility? Do you know of an alternate driver
 I can use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to the drawing board....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

            Update the Display driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like I have the latest BIOS and drivers for my PC.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Intel HD 3000 isn't compatible with Windows 10.&nbsp; I have had this driver for awhile but it never caused issues until the April Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-solve-intel-graphics-3000-driver-issue-in-windows-10/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the Microsoft Basic Display Driver right now and it looks like things are ok.&nbsp; I'm going to look into the trying the approach stated in the link above (Win 7/8 drivers).&nbsp; Anyway, it is looking like the issue all along was the display driver.&nbsp;
 I let you know how the Win 7/8 drivers work out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            It turns out that the 64-bit Win 7/8 Intel Driver is the Intel HD 3000 Driver so that will not work.

            Thank you for your answer. But I do understand signing on in order to use the account. But I don't understand why I have to sign on with the account in order to get my computer to load up for use. I don't use a user sign on to get the computer to get up
 to my desktop. But since I started the windows account I am required to sign in with my account password in order to get my computer to get up to the desktop. I am using windows 10.

<h2>            Skype 8.16.0.4 inaccurate status and auto-login failures</h2>
                    <p>1) A PC running the new Skype 8 is no longer sufficient to show an active status. It won't pickup the correct status until you actually try to make a call. That's not good for those that used Skype as an indicator to show whether a PC was running.<br />

2) The App Store version provides no icon in the quick view section next to the clock. Consequently, you're not made aware of missed calls/messages. Pinning respective icon to the Taskbar is of no help. This is an important omission that will force people to
 revert to Skype Desktop Version 8.15.0.4. Alas, this still doesn't solve the first issue.<br />

</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>A PC running the new Skype 8 is no longer sufficient to show an active status. It won't pickup the correct status until you actually try to make a call. That's not good for those that used Skype as an indicator to show whether a PC was

<p>
</p><p><strong>A: </strong>Please be advised that this the new behavior of the new Skype version 8.16. If you are not prioritizing the Skype app, your status will automatically change.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>The App Store version provides no icon in the quick view section next to the clock. Consequently, you're not made aware of missed calls/messages. Pinning respective icon to the Taskbar is of no help. This is an important omission that

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>A: </strong>To clarify, are you able to try the steps below: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>From your desktop, select the <strong>Start menu</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Settings </strong>and then <strong>System</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Notifications &amp; actions </strong>and scroll down to<strong> Get notifications from these senders.</strong></li><li>From there you can toggle Skype for Windows 10 notifications <strong>On</strong> or
<strong>Off</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>Additionally, Skype often seems to lose(?) it's auto-login capability. Something that didn't happen with Skype Classic 7.4.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A: </strong>This functionality is currently not available with the new Skype.

</p><p><strong>A: </strong>Please be advised that this the new behavior of the new Skype version 8.16. If you are not prioritizing the Skype app, your status will automatically change.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>The App Store version provides no icon in the quick view section next to the clock. Consequently, you're not made aware of missed calls/messages. Pinning respective icon to the Taskbar is of no help. This is an important omission that
 will force people to revert to Skype Desktop Version 8.15.0.4. Alas, this still doesn't solve the first issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>A: </strong>To clarify, are you able to try the steps below: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>From your desktop, select the <strong>Start menu</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Settings </strong>and then <strong>System</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Notifications &amp; actions </strong>and scroll down to<strong> Get notifications from these senders.</strong></li><li>From there you can toggle Skype for Windows 10 notifications <strong>On</strong> or
<strong>Off</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Q: </strong>Additionally, Skype often seems to lose(?) it's auto-login capability. Something that didn't happen with Skype Classic 7.4.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A: </strong>This functionality is currently not available with the new Skype.
</p>
<p>

Dear Marites P,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your response.<br />
<br />
The toggle you describe was already set to <strong>On</strong>.<br />
<br />
Other answers are equally disappointing. Skipping any additional installations would've been preferable, but when updates lead to a significantly poorer user experience, it's time to resort to alternatives.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            USB device driver software not installed properly</h2>
                    Im running on windows 7 and my USB device was working completely fine until it suddenly stopped working. It was plaugged in and i was accessing the folders on there when ti tried to open a file and it said it couldnt find it. I unplugged my USB and plugged
 it back in to try again, and my computer made that noise it does when you plug a USB in, but it wasnt showing up in 'My Computer' and i had no access to it whatsoever. I've googled and searched and tried different thing but none of it has worked. one of the
 things i tried was uninstalling the USB drive in device manager, but when i go to reinstall it it says 'device driver software not properly installed' and out of the 10 billion ways ive tried on this computer to fix it, none has worked. Not the trouble shooter,
 not update manager or anything. Any ideas?

            Hi Jolly, 
<br />
<br />Did you do a Reset, and choose the Remove Everythign option? The TPM actually clears if you do this. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/tpm/initialize-and-configure-ownership-of-the-tpm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/securi...</a>
<br />
<br />Clear the TPM as part of a complete reset of the computer: You might want to remove all files from the computer and completely reset it, for example, in preparation for a clean installation. To do this, we recommend that you use the Reset option in Settings. When you perform a reset and use the Remove everything option, it will clear the TPM as part of the reset. You might be prompted to press a key before the TPM can be cleared. For more information, see the “Reset this PC” section in Recovery options in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Let me know if this helps!

<p>I know what uefi/bios is. I know how to get there. I need to launch a efi shell to do various things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am i the only one who uses the efi shell to launch partition encryption compatible with uefi secure boot? (Encrypted boot partition + encrypted windows partition, but the dex/cex still get properly forwarded so it still has a hashcheck for secureboot and
 passes.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a pretty standard thing i think 95-98% of all users do. Otherwise they wouldnt give users efi shells on every other motherboard i have ever owned. (Including prebuilt dells/hps/etc)</p>

<p>Microsoft had stripped down the BIOS on these systems to have just the basics. &nbsp;You see, in the future - there will be no BIOS in computers and the operating system itself will control hardware functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not that many people actually get into the UEFI BIOS unless they absolutely have to, but I can say that if a person was attempting to run a different system in the machine other than Windows, you can do that. &nbsp;BUT! &nbsp;When it comes to UNIX and Linux; there
 is no keyboard or touchscreen driver (yet) for the all of the Surface laptop models to include the Laptop, Book 1, and Book 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the Surface Laptop which encountered a serious issue and it involved the BIOS. &nbsp;Right now, that machine will no longer run Windows but will run Linux (I have to attach a keyboard to it to use it). &nbsp;That is a reason for a warning on making changes
 because the latest Insider Build 'may' have sent a change to the BIOS which caused the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That machine is a $1,000 paperweight right now! &nbsp;The BIOS locks up whenever I try to run a Windows system onto it but will run Linux with no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just stay off of the BIOS unless you absolutely have to or "YOU" could end up with a $3,000 paperweight!</p>

<p>I dont think you know what an efi shell is. Who said anything about linux/unix? I dont think you know anything about UEFI, or this wouldnt have happened to you. UEFI is really simple, and here is how to fix your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, not joking go ahead and get a 8GB+ and another windows computer.</p>
<p>Get this tool called rufus</p>
<p>https://rufus.akeo.ie/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step1- go on working windows computer and get an .iso file out of media creation tool, follow prompts and get the iso. Dont "burn to usb" just get the large ~4GB file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step2- open rufus, select iso, find the ~4GB file you just got from media creation tool. Select under the dropdown menu "Partition scheme and target file system type" select "GPT partition scheme for UEFI"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dont touch the other settings, they are automatic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step3- hold pwr and volup to get to UEFI settings</p>
<p>go to secure boot control, disable this. [I can 1 on 1 get this working w/ secureboot on, but only if you want the help. It doesnt improve anything except physical security, as in the adversary has both knowledge of computers and physical contact w/ your
 surfacebook. If this is important I will help you.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step4- Insert usb, turn off surfacebook, then hold pwr + vol down</p>
<p>It should start windows setup. Do a custom install, delete all the partitions, and install there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Efi shells are important for mr robot level security as you can get things to run preboot in addition to the security layer of key exchange (cex/dex keys) between motherboard and OS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Probably the best way to do this is to use the "lmhosts" file to define these names as going nowhere.</p>
<ol>
<li>On the machine you called "my machine", start up any text editor such as "Notepad"</li><li>Navigate to and open the sample file:&nbsp; C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\Etc\lmhosts.sam</li><li>At the end of this file, add the following lines:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 127.0.0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mac01&nbsp; #PRE<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 127.0.0.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mac02&nbsp; #PRE<br />
</li><li>Save this file as the name "lmhosts" (no extension) in the same directory as the lmhosts.sam file above.<br />
Note that Notepad will probably add ".txt" to the end of the file name.&nbsp; If so, you need to rename this file with Explorer to eliminate the .txt extension.</li><li>Purge and Reload the name cache by bringing up a command prompt window (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "cmd") and enter the command:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; nbtstat -R<br />
(note it must be a capital 'R') </li><li>Now, your machine should not be able to access the machines 'mac01' and 'mac02' via UNC / NetBT.</li></ol>

<p>That depends a lot on the Firewall that you are using.&nbsp; Basically, you need to block UDP ports 136 and 137 and TCP ports 139 and 445 to/from the destination IP address (IP addresses of mac01 and mac02).&nbsp; Unfortunately if this is a network where the server
 devices get their IP address via DHCP, then they could have different IP addresses each time they are powered up making it nearly impossible to guarantee blocking them this way unless they are assigned fixed IP addresses.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the method I outlined should block access via device name (no matter which IP address they obtain) but will not block them if access is requested via IP address.</p>
<p>The more straightforward way (if you have XP Pro machines) is to disable Simple File Sharing on all your machines via policy and use regular access permissions to allow or deny access to these machines.&nbsp; Unfortunately access is controlled by User name and
 password rather than source Machine Name -- which is probably better because then, as administrator, you could access these machines if logged in as yourself whereas a normal user may not have access to these shares...</p>

<p>I have tried following, but not working, Even restart computer.&nbsp;Please check the lmhost.sam file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p># Copyright (c) 1993-1999 Microsoft Corp.<br />
#<br />
# This is a sample LMHOSTS file used by the Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.<br />
#<br />
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to computernames<br />
# (NetBIOS) names.&nbsp; Each entry should be kept on an individual line.<br />
# The IP address should be placed in the first column followed by the<br />
# corresponding computername. The address and the computername<br />
# should be separated by at least one space or tab. The "#" character<br />
# is generally used to denote the start of a comment (see the exceptions<br />
# below).<br />
#<br />
# This file is compatible with Microsoft LAN Manager 2.x TCP/IP lmhosts<br />
# files and offers the following extensions:<br />
#<br />
#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #PRE<br />
#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #DOM:&lt;domain&gt;<br />
#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #INCLUDE &lt;filename&gt;<br />
#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #BEGIN_ALTERNATE<br />
#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #END_ALTERNATE<br />
#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \0xnn (non-printing character support)<br />
#<br />
# Following any entry in the file with the characters "#PRE" will cause<br />
# the entry to be preloaded into the name cache. By default, entries are<br />
# not preloaded, but are parsed only after dynamic name resolution fails.<br />
#<br />
# Following an entry with the "#DOM:&lt;domain&gt;" tag will associate the<br />
# entry with the domain specified by &lt;domain&gt;. This affects how the<br />
# browser and logon services behave in TCP/IP environments. To preload<br />
# the host name associated with #DOM entry, it is necessary to also add a<br />
# #PRE to the line. The &lt;domain&gt; is always preloaded although it will not<br />
# be shown when the name cache is viewed.<br />
#<br />
# Specifying "#INCLUDE &lt;filename&gt;" will force the RFC NetBIOS (NBT)<br />
# software to seek the specified &lt;filename&gt; and parse it as if it were<br />
# local. &lt;filename&gt; is generally a UNC-based name, allowing a<br />
# centralized lmhosts file to be maintained on a server.<br />
# It is ALWAYS necessary to provide a mapping for the IP address of the<br />
# server prior to the #INCLUDE. This mapping must use the #PRE directive.<br />
# In addtion the share "public" in the example below must be in the<br />
# LanManServer list of "NullSessionShares" in order for client machines to<br />
# be able to read the lmhosts file successfully. This key is under<br />
# \machine\system\currentcontrolset\services\lanmanserver\parameters\nullsessionshares<br />
# in the registry. Simply add "public" to the list found there.<br />
#<br />
# The #BEGIN_ and #END_ALTERNATE keywords allow multiple #INCLUDE<br />
# statements to be grouped together. Any single successful include<br />
# will cause the group to succeed.<br />
#<br />
# Finally, non-printing characters can be embedded in mappings by<br />
# first surrounding the NetBIOS name in quotations, then using the<br />
# \0xnn notation to specify a hex value for a non-printing character.<br />
#<br />
# The following example illustrates all of these extensions:<br />
#<br />
# 102.54.94.97&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rhino&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #PRE #DOM:networking&nbsp; #net group's DC<br />
# 102.54.94.102&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "appname&nbsp; \0x14"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #special app server<br />
# 102.54.94.123&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; popular&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #PRE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #source server<br />
# 102.54.94.117&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; localsrv&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #PRE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; #needed for the include<br />
#<br />
# #BEGIN_ALTERNATE<br />
# #INCLUDE \\localsrv\public\lmhosts<br />
# #INCLUDE \\rhino\public\lmhosts<br />
# #END_ALTERNATE<br />
#<br />
# In the above example, the "appname" server contains a special<br />
# character in its name, the "popular" and "localsrv" server names are<br />
# preloaded, and the "rhino" server name is specified so it can be used<br />
# to later #INCLUDE a centrally maintained lmhosts file if the "localsrv"<br />
# system is unavailable.<br />
#<br />
# Note that the whole file is parsed including comments on each lookup,<br />
# so keeping the number of comments to a minimum will improve performance.<br />
# Therefore it is not advisable to simply add lmhosts file entries onto the<br />
# end of this file.</p>
<p>127.0.0.1 srvfs01 #PRE<br />
127.0.0.2 srvfs02 #PRE</p>

<p>Sorry, for some reason I didn't get an alert on your first response.</p>
<p>From your statement:</p>
<blockquote>"Please check the lmhost.sam file."</blockquote>
<p>I am assuming that what you posted is a file actually named "lmhost.sam".&nbsp; This is incorrect.&nbsp; After you modify the &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">sam</span> ple file "lmhost.sam", you must save it as simply "lmhost" without a .sam (or anything
 else) extension in the same directory.&nbsp; Note that the Notepad editor (and others) will add a .txt extension, in which case you must manually rename the file to get rid of the ".txt".</p>

<p>Sorry, a typo on my part.&nbsp; There should be an "s" at the end of the filename -- "lmhosts".<br />
The data you entered looks good.</p>
<p>If it is done right, you should be able to enter the following commands in a command window:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; nbtstat -R&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (must be capital R)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; nbtstat -c</p>

<h3> the senser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hyper-V Administrators Group is Missing</h2>
                    I have a problem with Hyper-V and the Windows Phone 8 SDK on a new Dell Inspiron Laptop.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Laptop came with Windows 8 Home Premium, which I upgraded to Windows 8 Pro with Media Center through the Add Additional Features option. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Once Windows 8 Pro with Media Center was installed and full patched through Windows Update I added Hyper-V and other features through the Add and Remove Features in the Control Panel.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I then checked the Local Users and Groups but the Hyper-V Administrators group is missing. &nbsp;I have two other Windows 8 PC's which I installed from the Windows Pro Upgrade path and they both have the Hyper-V Administrators group in them - even before the
 Hyper-V features were added to them.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This appears to be an issue with the upgrade from Home Premium to Pro with Media Center not creating the Hyper-V Administrators Group. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried reformatting and reinstalling numerous times and added things in different orders but the outcome is still the same. &nbsp;Unfortunately the Hyper-V Administrators Group is required in order to install and run the Windows Phone 8 SDK.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried to create the Hyper-V Administrators Group with a Powershell Script which I downloaded but it does not fool the Windows Phone 8 SDK installer which still fails as the correct Hyper-V Administrators Group is a BUILTIN Account but the one which
 the script creates is not.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone assist with this. &nbsp;Is there a way of being able to create the Hyper-V Administrators Group with the correct permissions so that I can get the Windows Phone 8 SDK installed and working with Visual Studio?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is clearly a bug with Windows 8 (Not the Windows Phone 8 SDK)</div>
                </div>

            I had the same problem with the Phone SDK saying it couldn't add the user to the group. However, I tried an app and it told me to check my BIOS. When I did that I discovered the installer hadn't completed and wanted a reboot. After the reboot still no
 group but the eumulator seems to be working fine...so far...

            Thanks for the reply, So are you able to get a basic app running on the emulator which you can run an debug?

            Have you resolved this? I have exactly the same issue, on an HP laptop. I am trying to uninstall Win8Pro to reinstall it, but that doesn't seem to be possible. Also, I did it in this order:<br />
Win 8 upgrade to Pro <br />
Install Visual Studio 2012 for Windows Phone 8<br />
--&gt; problem with hyper-v install ,<br />
--&gt; enabled in BIOS (AMD processor, so mem and vm)<br />
--&gt; could not enable in Windows Features <br />
--&gt; upgraded bios, restart<br />
Enabled Hyper-V in windows features<br />
On VS deploy on emulator, emulator warning shows up with 'You don't have permission',
<br />
Join hyper-v is checked, click 'retry' to run in elevated mode.<br />
Emulator starts, says 'windows os is starting...' but eventually fails.<br />
<br />

            <p>I have a temporary work around which allows the Windows 8 Phone Emulator to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I created the Hyper-V Administrators group using a script from here </p>

<p>The combination of what was in these articles got it running but there is still a bug here which needs to be fixed properly as far as I am concerned.</p>

            Thanks so much. That got me part of the way there. (I now simply get a failure to deploy rather than the Hyper-V admin error). I presume this is one of those things to fix by formatting the hard drive and starting over.&nbsp; Good luck to you, and many thanks
 for the great reply.<br />

            <p>I think I had the failure to deploy error the first time, as it seemed to take forever to start the emulator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that after I followed the instructions in the above links, I started Visual Studio with elevated permissions, opened and ran a simple project for Windows Phone, it then asked me prompted me that I did not have permissions to run the emulator and
 did I want to add permissions, I then clicked yes.&nbsp; Then closed VS and rebooted and it all worked ok from then on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also reinstalled/repaired the installation of the Windows Phone SDK at some point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you might want to try these things before the big reformat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope you get it working ok and glad I could be of assistance.</p>

<h2>            Cannot sign in to my computer</h2>
                    I have tried everything to sign in to my computer and I am using it in guest mode right now. I have checked everything and am using the correct password. I even changed the password on account.live and still won't work. All of the steps that I am reading
 in the threads require that you log in as ADMINISTRATOR. Obviously if you can't log in to your account, you can't log in as administrator!!! I don't understand how this happens that you just all of a sudden cannot log in. This has happened before. I am not
 a new user, not using a new account and not using a new computer, but for some reason every 8 months or so this happens and then I have to change passwords on all my apps on computer and phone to be able to get my mail etc... &nbsp;But now even though I have changed
 the password it still will not open, still saying password is no good. I am desperate!!! Someone please help me.

<h2>            Windows  7 shutdown problem as it stucks and error &#34;1 program needs to stop running&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I posted this question recently, and recieved a speedy reply. I did try the remedy, trying the "system file checker". Alas, it indicated no missing files or problems. O.K., the problem is: upon shutdown command, by me, it goes into that mode, but stops for
 a min. or so, with a dark screen, and gives me a message "1 program needs to stop running". &nbsp;Below that it says "explorer.exe." Then, is displays 2 boxes that say: &nbsp;"force shutdown, cancel". Then, in a few seconds, it does shut itself down, with out me doing
 anything. &nbsp;I am experiencing this also in my Dell desktop unit, but a different program, and it shuts down much more quickly. This is an HP/Compaq laptop, both are running Win. 7 Pro version. &nbsp;Any ideas guys or gals? Thanks much!!! &nbsp;Tom--(Pa.)</p>

<h2>            No control in windows, real nice</h2>
                    <p>My computer is acting up, no idea why, open task manager and for some unknown reasoning the most useless and dumbest features of windows are spiking in CPU, ie explorer, runtime broker, Cortana, windows search, windows backup, service host (many of them),
 CTF loader, explorer, feedback hub, LASS, system interrupts, service shell and many more are literally spiking in CPU, using over 25% CPU for no reason at all. I have teams, firefox and chrome and outlook opened that is it. I am sitting here for 20 mins now
 watching all these useless services spike in CPU for no legit and literally no reasoning at all. This is disgusting. I have no idea how you people can accept this. This is what windows is now? Chock full of crap that hogs all your resources for no reasoning
 at all? Oh wait it is, it has been and you are enjoy this, promoting this and praising windows for doing this but remember windows 10 and office 365, more productivity, more team work, Lies and slander there is no productivity at all in windows and it is ###
 that i am the only one who disagrees with farce.</p>

            <p>Hi Karen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your issue description, I understand that your computer is stuck on blue screen for more than 2 hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>What is the complete blue screen error message/code you are getting?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to remove all the external devices connected to the computer(except mouse and keyboard) and perform an Automatic repair using Windows 8 bootable DVD or USB drive and check if that helps.<br />
<br />
Follow these steps to perform Automatic repair<br />
<br />
a) Insert the installation DVD or USB and boot Windows 8 from it.<br />
<br />
b) In the ‘Windows setup’ page select the ‘language to install’, ‘Time and currency format’ and the ‘keyboard or input method’ and click on ‘next’.<br />
<br />
c) Click on ‘Repair your computer’ and select ‘Troubleshoot’. <br />
<br />
d) Click on ‘Advanced options’ and select ‘Automatic Repair’ and select the operating system.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may send us the dump files on skydrive.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer: </span><span><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></span></p>
