<p>This really depends a good deal on which web browser you are using.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Internet Explorer: </strong>&nbsp;drag the tab or favicon (icon just to the left of the URL address) to the taskbar and drop it</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Chrome: </strong>Go to menu (3 dots), choose More Tools &gt; Add to Desktop, then drag that desktop icon to the taskbar</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edge: </strong>not presently possible in most versions, but the fall update will add this ability (insider testers already have it)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>F</strong><strong>irefox: </strong>this one I'm not sure about, I don't use firefox much these days, but I don't think it's possible</p>

            I was just looking in the GFWL install folder and noticed&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic">
dotNETFx40 setup</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Win7 comes with <br />
.NET 3.5,&nbsp; so if&nbsp; GFWL has not installed&nbsp; .NET 4 already then do that manually.<br />
I uninstalled .NET3.5&nbsp; and manually updated to .NET 4 about a year ago. After installing .NET 4 there should be some Windows Updated for it as well.<br />
I currently have .NET4 Client and 'Extended' ( I think 'Extended' may have been one of the updates).<br />
I'm pretty sure that .NET4&nbsp; includes functions for all the earlier versions. I've had no problems with<br />
anything that uses the .NET framework since installing .NET4.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download: Microsoft .NET Framework 4 (Web Installer) - Microsoft Download Center - Download Details</a>
<br />
<br />
Maybe now that you have been able to install the older version you can uninstall that and
<br />
successfully install the new version. There will most likely still be some files or registry entries<br />
from the first install that may facilitate the new install - cross fingers....<br />
<br />
If you have not actually been able to set up or log in to the old XBOX account you may do better<br />
when reinstalling the newer GFWL client to start a whole new account with a new email address.<br />
If it's only the update that is breaking then it may be best to stick with the old account when reinstalling.<br />
<br />
This is why uninstalling the old and reinstalling the newer download is so often suggested.<br />
There have been some BAD DRM over the years, but GFWL&nbsp; surely takes the cake.<br />

    <title>Task Scheduler service won&#39;t start, properties are locked at - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davethorson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task Scheduler service won&#39;t start, properties are locked at Disabled.  Windows 10&#47;64 Home.</h2>
                    <p>Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't start Task Scheduler service.&nbsp; In Services its Startup Type is Disabled.&nbsp; If I right-click on Task Scheduler, the Start/Stop/Pause/Resume/Restart options are grey and can't be clicked.&nbsp; If I right-click and select Properties, all options on all tabs
 are grey and locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use Regedit to change Startup Type (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Schedule, Start) from 4 (Disabled) to 2 (Automatic), it gets reset to 4 about 20-30 seconds later.&nbsp; While Start is still set to 2, I can right-click in Services
 and the Start option is available.&nbsp; If I click it to start, I get this message:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Services<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Windows could not start the Task Scheduler service on Local Computer.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Error 1058: The service cannot be started, either because it is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to run the Task Scheduler program from Computer Management, I get this error message:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Task Scheduler Service on the target computer cannot be contacted.&nbsp; Please ensure the service is</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; running properly and then use the "Connect to Another Computer" action to retry the connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to run Task Scheduler from Cortana (type "Task Scheduler", click on Task Scheduler in the results list), I get this message:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Task Scheduler</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The remote computer was not found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is blocking Windows Update, Disk Defrag, the Security-SPP (Software Protection) service fails every 30 seconds because Task Schedule not running, and many other things that try to run at at given time or interval.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what magical process keeps changing Task Scheduler's startup type from 2 to 4, and why is access blocked to change its properties?&nbsp; Why does Task Scheduler think I'm trying to connect to a remote PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm logged in as Administrator.&nbsp; I'm using Windows 10/64 Home with BitDefender antivirus, have Windows Defender set to do periodic scans (they probably never happen either).&nbsp; Malware Bytes shows nothing.&nbsp; Also using SecureAPlus (a whitelisting program that
 warns if anything new tries to run on my PC).&nbsp; I used to use McAffee antivirus (installed by Dell) and think this problem may have started when I removed it and switched to Bitdefender&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I discovered this problem I had no Restore Points or image backups
 to recover from; it had been going on for too long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstalling Windows is not an option unless I know how to prevent this from happening in the future.&nbsp; I simple can't spend 2 weeks every quarter reinstalling my programs.&nbsp; I have run SFC /SCANNOW, and DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /RestoreHealth</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>--- UPDATE a few minutes later ---</p>
<p>I found some help at&nbsp;https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/d60649ba-983d-4516-9452-4de0faadd4e2/task-scheduler-services-logon-tab-grayed-out?forum=winserver8gen.&nbsp; Recommendation there from Dave Patrick (Microsoft Certified Professional
 and MVP) on Nov 9, 2017 was:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; You may need some elevated permissions. You could try;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; psexec -i -s cmd.exe<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; to run as the system account (nt authority)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;then;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; services.msc</p>
<p>This let me change startup type in Services for Task Manager to Automatic, and properties were accessible for change.&nbsp; I started Task Manager and it ran without errors.&nbsp; Half a minute later it was stopped, startup type set to Disabled.&nbsp; This is as close
 as I've ever been to solving this in the past half-year.&nbsp; Still not working.</p>

<p>Thanks, Frederik.&nbsp; This morning I worked through the page you recommended, and tried the steps to add a registry key.&nbsp; They create the Start key for the Task Scheduler and set its value to 2 (Automatic).&nbsp; That lets me change the value but within 30 seconds
 it gets changed back to 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While using the PSEXEC.exe program described above, I can unlock the properties of the Task Scheduler service in Services.msc.&nbsp; This lets me change startup type from Disabled to Automatic, and start the service, all within Properties.&nbsp; But within 30 seconds
 it's stopped and disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the few seconds I can get it to run I was able open Task Scheduler program and set up a task to run Notepad.exe every 10 minutes.&nbsp; By continually setting Task Scheduler service to Automatic and Starting it, I was able to Notepad.exe open one time.&nbsp;
 But once the service gets Disabled again, nothing runs the scheduled task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know if it's related or not, but most of my startup tasks don't run.&nbsp; I may have set them for a delayed startup using Win Utilities or Glary Utilities or Ashampoo Winoptimizer or Kerish Doctor.&nbsp; Don't know if one of those 4 messed up my system but
 I got back into each of them a few weeks ago and took everything off of any delayed startup list I could find.&nbsp; I also made sure none of these 4 utilty/startup manager programs starts up automatically.&nbsp; None do.&nbsp; But still the Task Manager problem persists
 and still most startup programs do not start with Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked through the event logs again.&nbsp; I see several error message pairs that say:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Task Scheduler service failed to load tasks at service startup. Additional Data: Error Value: 2147942402." and</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Task Scheduler service failed to launch tasks triggered by computer startup. Additional Data: Error Value: 2147942402."</p>
<p>These are new, and likely related to the task I scheduled to open Notepad every 10 minutes.&nbsp; The error message pairs are not 10 minutes apart, so I must be getting them every time I start Task Manager service for another 30 seconds.&nbsp; Unless the big number
 at the end is the phone number to call for help, nothing here to guide me to success.&nbsp; Several hits in Google say that number represents a File Not Found error, but no way to see what file isn't found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are also information messages that say:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; "The start type of the Task Scheduler service was changed from auto start to disabled."</p>
<p>but these give no clue I can understand as to what's changing the start type.&nbsp; "Details" section of the information message is below.&nbsp; The 16384 is the error message code I've seen before.&nbsp; The Guid value is for the Service Control Manager.&nbsp; Process ID 1320
 is the Services.exe program (same as Service Control Manager?).&nbsp; Thread ID 12760 is something I don't know how to see in Task Manager or other programs.&nbsp; I don't see a way to figure out what CAUSES the Service Control Manager to shut down Task Manager.</p>

            Thanks Frederik.&nbsp; I would have liked an answer but very much appreciate your thoughts and effort to help.&nbsp; This has been perplexing me as well, for many months now.&nbsp; I see a lot of people on the web with what seems to be the same issue, but it's not an
 easy thing to solve!

            I am trying to upgrade a friend's Dell Inspiron 1545 using the MS download site for Windows 10 and the installation downloads OK but it fails during installation. &nbsp;I have tried 4 times to make the installation work and each time the Update History reports
 that the installation failed and in one case it claims it was cancelled. &nbsp;I visited the Dell site and this model is not listed on their approved for installation of Windows 10 list. &nbsp;Dell goes on to say that if your model is not listed they do not recommend
 upgrading to Windows 10 as drivers will not be upgraded to be compatible with the new OS on these machines. &nbsp;Dell also states that help to install Windows 10 is available from Microsoft and has a link that gets you here. &nbsp;I am beginning to think that this
 upgrade will never be possible. &nbsp;Anyone had any success with this model?

<p>
</p><p>I have only just noticed this thread.&nbsp; I have been using Windows 10 successfully on my Dell Inspiron 1545 since early 2015 [starting with the Preview versions].&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>1&nbsp; Audio</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I do not have the hum but I think I know what you mean.</em>&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 installed an HD Audio driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a3aa945-14b2-42ff-8ad0-ed0432b1f6eb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a3aa945-14b2-42ff-8ad0-ed0432b1f6eb" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But I wanted IDT HD Audio Codec as I had always had in Windows 7.&nbsp; I managed to find &amp; install this driver.&nbsp; However, every few moments there was a&nbsp;splatter of noise from the computer.&nbsp; I&nbsp;rolled back&nbsp;that driver to the installed version and the splatters
 stopped.&nbsp; I think I had a splatter whilst others had a hum; in any case, rolling back the driver fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The HD Audio driver installed by Windows 10 works perfectly well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>2&nbsp; Display driver</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had&nbsp;used various driver versions over the past year but had to install a completely new one.&nbsp; It works well [no glitches, no system freezes].</p>

</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>4&nbsp; WiFi card 1397</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 installed a driver that works and has decent signal reception levels [unlike the driver Dell had installed when I first bought this computer].</p>

</p><p>This driver works well.</p>

</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>5&nbsp; That was all I had to play around with, the rest was fine already</strong></span></p>

<div>However, you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. If the original quality was **** then the future quality will be the same.&nbsp;</div>

<div>And BTW If you're converting from mp3 to wav format prior to burning then you won't be able to replace the frequencies that were lost when the original file was converted from wav to mp3. (Dependant on the bitrate).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>In other words, only burn fom the original wav files, or wav files converted from a loss-less format (such as Flac.........)&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            How to install previous windows 10 original</h2>
                    I was bought a laptop (Asus VivoBook S200e) 4 years ago with original windows 8 home os. Then I updated my os to Windows 10. I install your latest update on windows 10 about a week ago. But now my hard drive is damaged and I am replaced with a new hard
 drive in Asus service center. They ask me if they install original version they will give windows 8. I ask to install Windows 10 but they denied. I have no image file of that windows and no product key. Please help me to install original windows 10.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 7 Cannot resume from hibernate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> riskybiz &#59;-&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Cannot resume from hibernate</h2>
                    <p>I hibernated my Lenovo G770 laptop (H2O Insyde Bios, Windows 7) last night with a USB hard drive attached. On trying to resuming this morning I get the error:</p>
<p>Windows Boot Manager</p>
<p>Status: 0xc000000e</p>
<p>Info: The boot selection failed because a required device is inaccessible.</p>
<p>I suspect that this may be related to the USB hard drive, which is powered on and attached. I've tried to boot with/without the drive, also tried to boot the Windows recovery CD but none of them work and I cannot get into the bios (F2) to alter the boot
 order. When trying to enter the bios I just end up at the Windows Boot Manager, presumably because the system is trying to resume from hibernate all the time. If I press the space bar during boot then the only boot option shown is Windows 7, no option to drop
 the hibernated version and restart.</p>
<p>HELP, I need this machine for my work. Can you suggest what I might do next?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Riskybiz</p>

            OK. What I did to fix this issue was as follows;
<div><br />
<div>1. Remove the hard drive, as this was trying to resume from hibernate at each boot and blocking access to the bios, preventing the recovery disk from loading.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. &nbsp;Boot the Windows 7 recovery disk.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. Restart</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. &nbsp;Can now access the bios. (F2 at startup on this machine). &nbsp;Set bios to boot from optical drive i.e. Windows recovery disk.</div>
<div><br />
<div>5. &nbsp;Shutdown.</div>
<div><br />
<div>6. &nbsp;Refit the hard drive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>7. &nbsp;Boot into the Windows recovery environment.</div>
<div><br />
<div>8. &nbsp;Allow the recovery process to fix the startup issue it found.</div>
<div><br />
<div>9. &nbsp;Reboot. &nbsp;TA DA..... Windows desktop appears.</div>
<div><br />
<div>10. &nbsp;Relax again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this is helpful to someone in the future.</div>

<strong>Yes</strong> or type your password if prompted by the <strong>User</strong>
<strong>Account</strong> <strong>Control</strong> (<strong>UAC</strong>).</li><li>Type <strong>WSReset.exe</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Wait for the process to finish.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>The Windows Store should automatically launch once the process is done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the results.</p>

            Hi <strong>Jim</strong>, <br />
<br />
We have noticed that the post has been inactive for quite some time. We'd like to verify if you're also having the same issue with the original poster regarding getting the error code
<strong>(0x87AF001A)</strong> when updating apps. If so, kindly reply to this thread for further assistance.<br />
<br />
In addition, we'd like to know if you were able to troubleshoot the issue by resetting the
<strong>Windows Store</strong> as suggested by <strong>Devlin Sco</strong> in this thread on January 2, 2017.<br />
<br />
We'll be looking forward to your response.
        </p>

<p>&nbsp;You can not change the "bitness" of any version of Windows from 32-bit to 64-bit or vice-versa. The only way to get there is by doing a clean installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you don't lose your data, back it up to external media before beginning the clean installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you say, you don't have an external HD to backup files, let me point out that you've been playing with fire. Even for those not doing a clean installation,
<span><span>almost everyone should be backing up regularly. It is always possible that a hard drive crash, user error, nearby lightning strike, virus attack, even theft of the computer, can cause the loss of everything on your drive.
 As has often been said, it's not a matter of whether you will have such a problem, but when. So I strongly recommend that you buy an external drive.</span></span>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>Windows 7 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 7 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of
 RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things
 like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 7 64 bit is more secure too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit
 Windows 7.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem
 in Windows 7 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers. Also, if you decide to move to Windows 7 64 bit in the future, there is no upgrade path from 32 bit Windows, clean install only.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span>

            My fix for this when I found it on my lock screen personalization settings was "Resetting Windows" in the updates tab of all settings, and keeping my personal files. I had this issue before and the technicians didn't know how to fix it -- hope this helps_

    <title>cannot send email on iphone 4s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brandi326  say:</h3>
<h2>            cannot send email on iphone 4s</h2>
                    <p>I have had my Hotmail account set up on my iphone for a while and suddenly tonight I cannot send emails from my phone.&nbsp; When I try I receive a message that says "Cannot Send Mail, An error occurred while delivering this message."&nbsp; I have tried, restarting
 my phone, deleting the Hotmail account off of my phone and adding it back (with restart again) to no success.&nbsp; I have a separate email account on my phone and can send and receive emails just fine from it.&nbsp; I logged into my Hotmail account from my laptop and
 was able to use it without any difficulty.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi brandi326,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Welcome to Microsoft Community and I am happy to assist you in sending email messages once again. This is likely to happen when your account went out of sync with the device
 or when the mail server settings were not configured properly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You can easily resolve this through any of the following procedures:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Ensure that the mail server settings are properly configured:
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/send-receive-from-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0000ff">Send and receive Outlook.com email from an app</font></span></a></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Set the
<font><b>Mail days to sync </b>to a shorter timeframe since this will eliminate any bandwidth issues.</font></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Moving the emails from inbox to a temp folder. This is to determine if there are corrupted emails causing synchronization problems.</span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let us know if the above steps worked. If not, kindly verify the following for further investigation:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Does it also persist when another account is logged in to your phone?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Your phone's operating system version?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Affected
 email address<i><font> (Click the <b>You have a private reply to this message</b> link to post the account for privacy.)</font></i></span></span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">We look forward to your response.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
