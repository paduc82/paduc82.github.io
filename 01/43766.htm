<p><strong>Hi everyone..</strong></p>
<p><strong>I've just got myself a netbook that's pre-loaded with windows 7 starter. My PC is 64 bit windows vista ultimate. I've got an ADSL router thats connected to the PC with a network cable (yellow) - internet works fine.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I'm trying to connect my netbook to the router wirelessly, and the netbook's asking for a "network security key"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where exactly does one find this? I can't find anything named network security key in my router settings..</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks a lot!!</strong></p>

<p>The wireless security key <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">is</span>
</em>in your router settings. See below for how to set up a wireless network securely. It will also cover where you find these settings.</p>
<p><span>Have a computer connected to the router with an ethernet cable. Examples given are for a Linksys router. Refer to your router manual or the router mftr.'s website for default settings if you don't have a Linksys. Open a browser
 such as Internet Explorer or Firefox and in the addressbar type:<br />
<br />
http://192.168.1.1 [enter] (this is the router's default IP address, which varies from router to router so check your manual)<br />
<br />
This will bring you to&nbsp;router's login screen. The default username is left blank and the Linksys default password is "admin" without the quotes. Enter that information. You are now in the router's configuration utility. Your configuration utility may differ
 slightly from mine. The first thing to do is change the default password because *everyone* knows the default passwords for various routers.<br />
<br />
Click on the Administration link at the top of the page. Enter your new password.
 username blank and put in your new password to get back into the configuration utility.<br />
<br />
Now click on the Wireless link at the top of the page. Change the Wireless Network Name (SSID) from the default to something you will recognize. I suggest that my clients not use their family name as the SSID. For example, you might wish to name your wireless
 network "CastleAnthrax" or the like. ;-)<br />
<br />
Click the Save Settings and when you get the prompt that your changes were successful, click on the Wireless Security link which is right next to the Basic Wireless Settings link (where you changed your SSID). Most computers purchased within the last 4 years
 have wireless hardware that will support WPA2-Personal (also called WPA2-PSK). This is the encryption level you want. If your wireless hardware is older, use WPA. Do not use WEP as that is easily cracked within minutes. So go ahead and set the Security Mode
 to WPA2-Personal. Do that and enter a passphrase. For example, you might use the passphrase, "Here be dragons, beware you scurvy dogs!". The passphrase is what you will enter on any computers that are allowed to connect to the wireless network.
<br />
At this point, your router is configured and if the computer you were using to configure the router is normally going to connect wirelessly, disconnect the ethernet cable and the computer's wireless feature should see your new network. Enter the passphrase
 you created (exactly as you wrote it with all capitalization and punctuation) to join the network and start surfing.<br />

<h2>            How do I remove a previous owner&#39;s name&#63;</h2>
                    My brother bought a used computer from a shop. &nbsp;The previous owner's name is all over the computer, and I would like to remove it. &nbsp;They don't show up in accounts, but they do show up otherwise. &nbsp;Is there any method of completely removing the prior owner's
 name from the computer other than doing a factory reset? &nbsp;Getting my stuff off here into back up is not a feasible option for me, and I would lose way too much trying to get it saved.

            <p>Unfortunately there is no easy way to accomplish what you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always recommend a factory reset to anyone who buys a used computer. You never really know its condition unless you do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can remove most by creating an new user account (that is an new administrator account) and set it up the way you want and then delete the original account.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t switch users in Vista</h2>
                    I just got a brand spanking new computer with Vista pre-loaded. Everything was working fine until I created new user accounts for my boys. When I try to switch users, the screen goes black and finally shuts off (no signal message). Computer stays on, but
 no signal goes to monitor. I need to physically reboot the system to get back in. Any ideas?

            Hi <span>Rainer Duve,</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span>In addition to Anurag's suggestion, I would recommend to place the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue occurs in a clean boot state, to place the computer in a clean boot state, follow the steps below:</span><br />
&nbsp;
<ol>
<li><span>Click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong> , type
<span>msconfig</span> in the <strong><span>Start Search</span></strong> box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong><span>Continue</span></strong>.
</span></li><li><span>On the
<strong><span>General</span></strong> tab, click
<strong><span>Selective Startup</span></strong>.
</span></li><li><span>Under
<strong><span>Selective Startup</span></strong>, click to clear the
<strong><span>Load Startup Items</span></strong> check box.
</span></li><li><span>Click the
<strong><span>Services</span></strong> tab, click to select the
<strong><span>Hide All Microsoft Services</span></strong> check box, and then click
<strong><span>Disable All</span></strong>.
</span></li><li><span>Click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>. </span>
</li><li><span>When you are prompted, click
<strong><span>Restart</span></strong>.
</span></li><li><span>After the computer starts, start the game or program and check whether the problem is resolved.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><br />
<span>Once you restart the computer try switching the users and check if the issue re-appears.</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>If the issue does not occur after you place the computer in a clean boot state, try the steps below in the KB article:</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;<br />

Based on my experience and research, the duration for a Skype Meeting Broadcast is up to 4 hours. I understand that you may want to schedule a Skype Meeting Broadcasting longer than 4 hours. Given the situation, I suggest you submit feedback via the link below:<br />

            <p>Sarah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you find an answer to your question?&nbsp; I am now facing the same sort of thing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new 64-bit Windows&nbsp;10 system with Office 2010, and I need to purchase Visio Professional 2007 to enable me to reverse engineer databases, etc.&nbsp; I'm not finding anything that tells if these will be compatible or not.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any experience (positive or negative)&nbsp;you can provide would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>I don't know if this helps but I have Windows 10 - x64 (build 10.0.10586) and am running Visio 2003 (32).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The application runs fine EXCEPT when you close it. &nbsp;It crashes on close when you have opened a file (vsd).</p>
<p>
</p><p>it does not crash if you do NOT open a file. &nbsp;You don't have to edit the file or make changes. &nbsp;It will crash on close even if you merely open a file and then close the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried running it in compatibility mode for Win 7, Vista, XPsp3 and it still crashes each time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had no usability issues while the application is running and files open/save/close just fine. &nbsp;It is only an issue when the application closes.</p>

<h2>            Skype Store&#63;</h2>
                    Hey guys so what happend is my discord stopped working now it is. But when it wasnt i decided to uninstall some things for free space to see if that could help it took a while but i finally got my stuff back However when i try to install skype it just
 says skype for store and that i already have it but i dont. And tbh the skype on store is bad. So is there a way that this wont pop up or any site i can try to do? i'd be really happy if someone knew what was going on.

<p>Windows store works for Windows 8 and higher. We are referring to the Skype UWP version, that can be downloaded from the store as this version of Skype is only available for Windows 10 version 1607 and higher.</p>

<p>I got that once during Big sister fight. I finished her off, music returned to normal then started up again never had the problem since. I have this issue with other games... nothing you can do really, play through or restart the save.</p>

<p>First I had to deal with that and now the diaries are silent. I can see that they're playing when the face comes up, but no sound. Its been like this for the last ten diaries. Hoping it fixes itself soon since I really like hearing those.</p>

<p>Hey there, </p>
<p>My son is 8 and a half. All of the above. :) when he's not rock climbing, playing sports, or doing boy scouts, he gets an hour of game time. Loves Stampy and is looking for friends on Minecraft Xbox One edition. We are giving it a try after seeing how lonely
 he is in his little worlds lol. Our gamer tag is elcoryloco79 so if you see requests, that's who it is. Dad is currently remodeling the kitchen so no time to play. I don't know if the Lego Avenger/Marvel game allows for online gaming. We're working on the
 headset issue also. I didn't know upgrading from 360 to 1 would be such a chore. :) we're also in So Cal so I don't know if that will impact anyone's online time.

 We dont have a headset yet but he is always supervised. Our name is arabidgoat. Please feel free to add us, he would love some friends to play with! Mom and dad are only fun to play with for so long :)</p>

    <title>Multiple entries for Windows Boot Manager in UEFI BIOS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mcomp72  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple entries for Windows Boot Manager in UEFI BIOS</h2>
                    <p>Last week, my computer got infected with a virus that damaged the boot sector. &nbsp;I was able to fix it, and since then I have upgraded my C drive from a 500GB SSD to a 1TB SSD. &nbsp;I cloned the old drive to the new drive using Acronis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhere between the infection and the upgrade of the SSD, several issues developed. &nbsp;I have taken care of all of them now except one: I have multiple entries of Windows Boot Manager in my UEFI BIOS, and I can't figure out how to get rid of them. &nbsp;I actually
 don't know if I should even worry about getting rid of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some screen shots, so you can see the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, here is what shows up in my UEFI BIOS.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb884e9b-759c-49ed-81f0-a07dee4f7b9c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb884e9b-759c-49ed-81f0-a07dee4f7b9c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, here is what I get when I run "bcdedit /enum" as the Command Prompt. &nbsp;I am confused as to why the partition=G: under Windows Boot Manager, when Windows is installed on the C drive. &nbsp;Any ideas about that, and could that be part of the problem? &nbsp;I'm
 actually not even sure what the G: is. &nbsp;The G drive is usually a flash drive, but I don't believe I had a flash drive plugged in when I ran bcdedit.</p>

</p><p>Here's what I see when I run EasyBCD and look at the Detailed Setting.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if it's relevant, but:</p>
<p>- my C drive is formatted for GPT, not MBR.</p>
<p>- my UEFI BIOS is set at IDE, not AHCI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on this information, can anyone tell me what I can do to eliminate the extra entries? &nbsp;Or is it something I shouldn't even worry about? &nbsp;The computer seems to work okay, so should I even bother with fixing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help you can offer.</p>

            Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; After shutting down the computer overnight (which I don't normally do), this morning I discovered that all of the extra listings of Windows Boot Manager were gone.&nbsp; Perhaps turning off the power did something to the BIOS?&nbsp; I'm not
 sure, but am happy to report the problem is gone.

<p>With the automatic screen rotation turned on, the screen changes the orientation depending on how it is positioned using the device's gyrometer sensor. If this is the one causing your screen to rotate on its own, it needs to be turned off.

                    When playing back MKV files from other sources, it appears SSA and ASS files are detected (including track name), so they're parsed out of the MKV, but it appears the player has no support for these subtitle formats. Is playback on the roadmap? This feature
 would make it a drop-in replacement for MPC-HC for most users.

    <title>Media Center loses live TV signal when I click RECORD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jebrooks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media Center loses live TV signal when I click RECORD</h2>
                    In Windows 7 Home Premium, I am trying to get set up to&nbsp;record live OTA TV.&nbsp; I finally was able to get signal on some of my local stations(for some reason Media Center needs a much stronger signal than the software that came with my ATSC tuner).<br />
<br />
When I click the red Record button in the control bar, the screen goes blank and a few seconds later I get a "No Signal" error message.&nbsp; I can get the channel back by clicking the +/- channel buttons.&nbsp; The same thing appears to happen with scheduled recordings.<br />
<br />
Why does pushing "Record" cause MC to lose the signal, and how can I fix it?

            Hey jebrooks,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting in Microsoft answers!<br />
<br />
a. Were you able to record live TV before? <br />
b. Are you able to record from DVD using Media Center? <br />
c. What is the exact error message you get? <br />
<br />
Also, visit the manufacturer’s website and check for any updated network drivers and update the same to fix any network related issues.
<br />
<br />
The TV signals and programming that you can watch and record depend on the following:
<br />
<br />

<p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Problem:</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is a description of the issue going on. My son purchased Pay Day 2 via his Xbox console and downloaded the game to his Xbox 360 S 250gb hard drive. The download completed successfully. When trying to load the game a "System Update" is required.
 The download will initially start and fill the download line about 3-5% of the way. While maintaining the loading X for system update for about 20-30 seconds an error code message will pop up. The error code being referenced is "40A3-0000-80DO-0200-8007-045D.
 As we all know the error code represents that the Xbox cannot communicate with the hard drive.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Error Code #:</span></strong> 40A3-0000-80D0-0200-<strong>8007-045D</strong></p>

<p>Additionally, I have reset the modem. Restored Xbox 360 S, cleared the hard drive of all gaming information including System Cache, and Re-downloaded profiles. I have a Halo 4 edition Xbox and had my son download his profile to my Xbox, Download Pay Day
 2, and try the system update on mine. The exact same problem occurs.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">System Information:</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>Modem- </strong>Ubee modem from Brighthouse Networks. Acts as a modem/router. 40GB connection down, 20GB up. Lightning Cable connection.</p>
<p><strong>Systems-</strong> Xbox 360 S 250GB &amp; Xbox 360 Halo 4 Edition 300GB.</p>

<p>Please do not tell me the issue is with the router. I work in IT and have a lot of experience with routers &amp; modems. I can assure you that the router or connection is not the issue. I've tried Wireless and Hard lined. I am positive the issue is on Xbox side
 because there are thousands that are having the exact same issue since the last 360 update. Any positive and helpful information is welcomed to fix this problem. Thank you for your time!</p>

<p>Well since you work in the IT field I'm assuming it's safe to get semi-technical. &nbsp;There are several options.</p>
<ol>
<li>You're using aftermarket HDDs that aren't official. &nbsp;If your console didn't come equipped with a HDD and you bought one online--yes, even Amazon--then updates can be problematic. &nbsp;They do not use a standard FAT and the counterfeiters aren't really good
 at emulating whatever the call the new structure (sorry, the name eludes me at the moment). &nbsp;You said 300 GB Halo 4 Edition but stock that's 320... I'm assuming this is a typo so on to number 2.
</li><li>There's an IO issue at hand; possibly a defective SATA connection which would require servicing.
</li><li>You can manually download the update on your PC and put it on a CD or mass storage device and install it that way. &nbsp;Instructions here:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/system/system-updates-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/system/system-updates-info</a>
</li><li>The update fouled up and is stuck in the ROM. &nbsp;If you call 1-800-4MY-XBOX they can actually give you a set of commands that can be inputted from the controller that will rollback your console to the last update the system had. &nbsp;All data on the console will
 still be there but it will give you a fresh start as far as the OS is concerned. &nbsp;It's akin to the Windows 8.X "Refresh" ability.
</li><li>If this is a "Title Update" (essentially a revision patch) and not a "System Update" you can browse the storage screen to the Pay Day 2 directory and look for "Title Update" and delete that file. &nbsp;The next time you boot the game it will attempt to reacquire
 it. &nbsp;On rare occasions Title Updates get fouled up. It is highly recommended that you clear out the system cache (hit Y over the storage device) and power cycle the console after you delete any "Title Updates."
</li></ol>

<p>Yeah it was a 320gb. I bought it while I was in Afghanistan and haven't played it much so the GB actually eluded me :). I'm now in assumption that it is a title update that is causing the issue. However, deleting the title update did not fix the issue. So
 on my Xbox I deleted the entire game, since it was downloaded, and reinstalled it and it worked fine. I'm now in the process of doing the same on my son's xbox to see if that fixes the issue. I'll get back to you and let you know.</p>

<p>Now it is throwing a different code. 0x80090304, which I've seen before with SQL servers blocking connections to non authenticated users not apart of a specific user group. However, never with live. I'm looking at the DNS to see if they match for authentication
 purposes. Ok, so the DNS is fine and it reconnected to live now. </p>
<p>I'm reinstalling the game to see if the issue returns. I reverted the system update already and reinstalled the update. The game should take about an hour to download so I can get back to here upon it's completion and let you know if the issue still arises.
 I have also cleared all system cache and deleted all old items from the hard drive to clear up some space. There is currently 189 GB of free space.
</p>
<p>Also, another issue is started to come up. When I reverted the system update the system started and when to Xbox Home within less than a minute from power on to home. After the update and subsequently the last 5 restarts, it has taken anywhere from 3-5 minutes
 to go from power on to Xbox home. The lag is almost like something you would find with an overload of bandwidth on a system server. I will get back to this thread upon completion of the game download and let you know if it throws more codes.</p>

<p>Ah, well yes a damaged digital version of the game can create all types of errors. &nbsp;The 360's FAT has an ~1.97 file size restriction and was created before the big push to digital formats so it's inadequate to the task. &nbsp;Each digital game contains it's own
 folder with many chunks of game data and--from personal experience--it seems that a small hiccup during download can muddy the entire process. &nbsp;It'd work better using the BitTorrent protocol or at least some type of verification system in place to validate
 the chunks after they've been received but I digress...</p>
<hr />
<p>Free space doesn't really matter to be honest, the OS runs on a separate partition on the HDD as is it's swap file so speed shouldn't be effected by available storage space.</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm not sure what that code means on the Xbox... Windows Server yes... Xbox no clue, could be different.</p>
<hr />
<p>You're probably right with the assumption on the boot-up lag being overloaded bandwidth or spotty connectivity. &nbsp;Simple test would be to turn off the NIC/unplug the CAT5 and see if it boots up right quick. &nbsp;Remember a lot of servers also do maintenance during
 overnight hours since less people are on them. &nbsp;Xbox LIVE is a distributed network and your nearest server might just be cycling and it's going to one a greater distance away.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Photos app&#58; remote procedure call failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julianparish  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Photos app&#58; remote procedure call failure</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am currently unable to use the Windows 10 Photos app. Whenever I try to open an image file, I get a Remote Procedure Call failure message. I have tried SFC scan (all OK), DISM, uninstalling and reinstalling the Photos app (via Powershell) and System Restore,
 all to no avail.&nbsp; I have not used CCleaner at any time on this PC.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The only significant change I have made on the PC recently is to switch off the automatic notifications from the app (for e.g. new albums), which was irritating me. The option to enable/disable that notification has now disappeared from the list of apps
 in Settings - Notifications, I have tried updating the registry (using the tool on Supersite), but Photos simply does not appear in that list.
</p>
<p>Can anyone provide any help: either to reinstate the notification option for Photos, or to fix the underlying RPC problem? I would prefer to avoid completely reinstalling Windows. For now, I am using another image editor, but I would prefer to revert to
 the Photos app.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Julian.</p>

            I tried all those steps before contacting you. No use at all. I ended up reinstalling Windows - best part of a day wasted reinstalling all the apps, reconfiguring system etc. There appears to be a specific issue when you switch off notifications for the
 Photos app which caused this. Would be good for test engineers to try and replicate this.

<h2>            Samsung Q430 laptop touchpad cursor selection method</h2>
                    when moving the cursor it selects items I do not want if it pauses over it for even a millisecond, so I waste time deselecting windows I wasn't interested in.&nbsp; I prefer to double click the items I really want instead of this new method.&nbsp; Frustrated&nbsp; Thanks!

<div>Hi <strong>Dbqhockeyref</strong>,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. From when are you facing this issue?<br />
2. Any recent software/hardware changes on your computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:<br />
Try reducing the TouchPad sensitivity and check if the issue persists.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Click on the "Start" icon in the lower left corner of the screen. Select "Control Panel." Next select "Mouse" You can also left-click the touchpad while the cursor is anywhere on the desktop. From that screen, choose "Mouse Pointers."<br />
b. Select the "Buttons" tab at the top of the dialog box that opens. This shows the type of touchpad device installed on your laptop.<br />
c. Set the touchpad for right or left-handed use from this dialog box. You can adjust the double click speed of your computer as well. When you finish making any changes, click "Apply."<br />
d. Pick the "Device Settings" tab from the dialog box now. You can see the touchpad for your Vista machine highlighted on this screen. Select "Settings."<br />
e. Read the information provided in the next dialog box. It gives you options for tapping yourtouchpad, using the buttons, scrolling,pointer motion and sensitivity.<br />
f. Make any changes you want from the various topics. When you make a change, click "Apply." Click "OK" when you finish making all your changes.<br />
g. Do some work on your computer for a while. If the touchpad is still too sensitive, return to the "Mouse" menu and continue to adjust the settings until you get them just the way you want them.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> some systems have a Touchpad control program that runs in the Notification area - lower right near clock [system tray].</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:<br />
I'd suggest you check for Text Select and the Precision Select in Mouse properties.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</strong>a, Click Start<br />
b. Click control panel<br />
c. Click mouse<br />
d. In mouse properties, under Customize check if Text Select and the Precision Select are listed.<br />
e. Try to customize the selection according to your settings.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div><strong>If the issue persists then I suggest you to update the driver on your laptop and check if the issue persists.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To download the drivers for the laptop, I suggest you to follow this below link.</div>

<span>Hi <span>
lizziejames&nbsp; </span>,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft Vista Answers Forum!</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Put the Computer in Cleanboot in order to check if the issue is caused
 by any third party software.</span></p>
<p>
<span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot."
 A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts. This article describes how to troubleshoot problems in Windows 7 by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
<span>How to perform a clean boot procedure to determine whether background programs are interfering with a game or a program that you currently use:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/939671" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/939671</span></a>
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All. Click on Apply and then OK. When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></p>
<p>
<span>After issue is resolved, put the computer in Normal mode:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box.</span></p>
<p>
<span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the General Tab, select "NORMAL STARTUP". Click on Apply and then OK. When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> You can try to run a System File checker
 tool. This tool will fix the system files that are corrupted.</span></p>
<p><span>Steps to perform SFC scan:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click the Start button</span></p>
<p><span>2. From the Start Menu, Click All programs followed by Accessories</span></p>
<p><span>3. In the Accessories menu, Right Click on the Command Prompt option</span></p>
<p><span>4. From the drop down menu that appears, Click on the 'Run as administrator' option</span></p>
<p><span>5. If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled, you will be asked for authorization prior to the command prompt opening. You may simply
 need to press the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert the administrator password etc.</span></p>
<p><span>6. In the Command Prompt window, type: sfc /scannow and then press Enter</span></p>
<p><span>7. A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'</span></p>
<p><span>8. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></p>
<p><span>9. If any files require replacing SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Vista DVD for this process to continue</span></p>
<p><span>10. If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations"</span></p>
<p><span>11. After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.
</span></p>

<p>
<strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong><span> You can also try to create a new user account by following the link
 and check whether you can fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open User Accounts by clicking the
<strong>Start </strong>button, clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>
User Accounts and Family Safety</strong>, and then clicking <strong>User Accounts</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<strong>Manage another account</strong>. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p>
<span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<strong>Create a new </strong>account.</span></p>
<p>
<span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type the name you want to give the user account, click an account type, and then click Create Account.</span></p>
<p>
<span>After you create the profile, you can copy the files from the existing profile.</span></p>

            There is no direct way to do this, you would have to use a 3rd party app like Cyberlink Youcam:
