<h2>            Win 10 upgrade 1607 &#59; ASUS SABERTOOTH 990FX R2.0 &#59; AMD drivers issues &#59; Multiple monitors</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just some info on how I got around the crashes, BSOD, freezes, etc. after <strong>
Win 10 Anniversary Upgrade 1607</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After eight attempts at getting it on <em>and "keep files programs"</em>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>6x Updater attempts upgrade from 1511 -&gt;1607 and then crashes and restores -&gt; 1511 and crashes then rewinds -&gt; Original 10 then installs -&gt;1511 using various methods (including method 5 where I got MS Support Tech to do it for me using remote conn. !)</p>
<p>
</p><p>These all failed. I tried&nbsp;two different stub downloaders, downloading the KB direct from MS, downloading the ISO (which is default 1611), and finally I bit the bullet and made a USB installer while trying the last full install from Win 10 ISO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All these failed at the same point, "<strong>CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED</strong>", at 70% of the second reboot install sequence and NONE of them worked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 16.7.3 drivers had seemed stable under 1511, but I guess when the Upgrader -&gt; 1607 tried to reinstall the 16.7.3 after moving my files to .old the drivers weren't signed, it downloaded the latest driver, which was the exact same 16.7.3 driver and is
 unsigned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I think it then realised it could only restore my 1511 version which it dutifully did every time without problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">So, over to the USB and a <em>reformat and clean install</em></span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It failed. <strong>Twice.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I unplugged 2 of my monitors from the Gcard, leaving just the one&nbsp;on the HDMI port.</p>
<p>I unplugged EVERYTHING apart from my mouse (USB) and&nbsp;keyboard (USB) which I moved to the top USB ports next to the PS2 socket.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try again ... it worked ! No crash for over an hour.</p>
<p>I could not put on the AMD 990FX drivers, as the AMD site only gives one option 16.7.3 and that is an unsigned driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I installed the AMD 16.7.3 graphics card drivers. No crash for another hour!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Turned off Driver Signing checks</span>, installed the FX990 drivers (SATA/AHCI/USB) ... rebooted.</p>
<p>Crash after two minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver Signing Check back off, <strong>uninstall</strong> FX990 drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even after uninstalling the 16.7.3 FX990 drivers, BSOD after an hour, after ten minutes ... drove me mad for two days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I know that I should have motherboard drivers, but the <strong>ASUS site</strong> had nothing there.</p>
<p>Here we are a week later and they have released a <strong>new set of apps and a BIOS update
</strong>! First one in two years !</p>
<p>
</p><p>BIOS updated, using the BIOS flash utility:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy the CAP 2901 file to the USB root dir</p>
<p>Rename from SABERTOOTH-990FX-R20-ASUS-2901.CAP to 2901.CAP (failed the first time so chopped fname down)</p>
<p>Put USB in white outlined USB port on back of PC</p>
<p>Rebooted -&gt; BIOS -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Tools</p>
<p>Started BIOS updater 2</p>
<p>clicked root USB</p>
<p>clicked file</p>
<p>BIOS updated</p>
<p>Reboot</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were also new drivers for the USB3, Audio, LAN and SATA</p>
<p>
</p><p>This still left the problem of AMD not allowing me to get 16.7.2 FX990 drivers. There are plenty of archived grphics driver packages, but NONE of the motherboard chipset ! Crazy !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">SABERTOOTH install&nbsp;DVD </span>
has Catalyst 15 drivers for the SB (FX990) and it had the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
AMD USB filter drivers </span>I was missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything now seems OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has taken over half an hour to type, and the PC has been on for an hour and a half without crashes (fingers crossed!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now there is a new BIOS update and drivers for the motherboard, things might go well if people just uninstall their AMD graphics and motherboard drivers and only have one monitor and a mouse plugged in&nbsp;before they click "upgrade -&gt; 1607"</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is how mine went, at least there may be some useful info in there for others in a similar situation :¬)</p>

            <p>Sorry to read about your woes. I also experienced the same problems trying to go from Windows 10 1511 to 1607. I was running bios version 2901 with&nbsp; Windows 10 1511. The upgrade continuously failed until I downgraded the bios to version 2501. Four months
 later the computer is stable as a rock. I just went back to the ASUS support page and I am happy to say Bios version 2901 has disappeared. Check it out !

    <title>Can&#39;t disable touchpad or tap-to-click - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajm2k19  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t disable touchpad or tap-to-click</h2>
                    <p>The touchpad on my laptop is poorly placed. I tend to tap it with the lower part of my right thumb when I'm typing, resulting in some really frustrating deletions and other errors. Prior to the most recent update I fixed this problem by disabling the tap-to-click
 function and making it so I have to depress the touchpad to click. It was annoying, but less annoying than accidentally highlighing and deleting half the paper I'm writing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated my laptop last week and noticed that tap-to-click came back. When I went to change it back, I found that I disabling tap-to-click wasn't an option anymore. Moreover, the button to completely disable the touchpad doesn't work. I have it set to "low
 sensitivity," but I keep tapping stuff I don't mean to. It's driving me insane.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me I'm missing a setting somewhere. I just want to disable tap-to-click. Barring that, I want to disable the touchpad entirely and use a USB mouse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reference, I have a Lenovo Yoga 900-13ISK2 Signature and I'm running Windows 10 v.1709.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue more likely occurred due to the Windows 10 update that caused a compatibility issue on your touchpad driver. Since you've already performed some troubleshooting steps, we suggest that you check this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17417/windows-mouse-touchpad-keyboard-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> and see the section that says <strong>Hardware Troubleshooter Drivers.</strong> Kindly perform the steps given and let us know the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

            I am having the same experience. I used the device manager to "roll back" the Elan driver.&nbsp; I no longer have the ELAN option in my device manager as a result.&nbsp; I still have the same tap to click problem.&nbsp; Do I have a different tap to click device??? I
 tried the suggested fix but this did not help.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be appreciated.

                    <p>I attempted to turn on my Acer Laptop on where a Blue screen appeared saying: "Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info, and then we'll restart for you." The screen then goes blank, just before it does, a line
 pops up in small text saying: "If you'd like to know more, you can search online later for this error: DRIVER VIOLATION", the screen then appears to restart. Then opening ACER screen appears with a loading circle saying: "Preparing Automatic Repair". Then
 the blue screen pops up again and the process is repeated.</p>

http://support.microsoft.com/kb/191946</a>&nbsp; but if you search for *.wab that will give you the address book and it is probably corrupt.&nbsp; You can click on it and check if it will open or not.&nbsp; If not, then search for *~* and that will be the backup of the address
 book.&nbsp; Try renaming it to give it a wab file extension and if it opens when you click on it, then replace the bad one with it.&nbsp; Otherwise delete the old one and see if that fixes it.&nbsp; You might be best going to File | Identities and setting up a new Identity

<p><span>Hello Edwin,</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Dell 1525 system works but not with all the sim card by all operaters.
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here is what you need to Establish a Mobile Broadband Network Connection:
<br />
<br />
NOTE: Depending on your computer, you can use either a Mobile Broadband<br />
ExpressCard or Mini Card, but not both, to establish a Mobile Broadband network<br />
connection.<br />
<br />
To set up a Mobile Broadband network connection, you need:<br />
• A Mobile Broadband ExpressCard or Mini Card (depending on your computer’s configuration)<br />
<br />
NOTE: For instructions on using ExpressCards, see "Using ExpressCards" on<br />
page 59. Setting Up and Using Networks 71<br />
<br />
• An activated Mobile Broadband ExpressCard or activated Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) for your service provider<br />
<br />
• The Dell Mobile Broadband Card Utility (already installed on your computer if you purchased the card when you purchased your computer, or on the media that accompanied your card if purchased separately from your computer)<br />
<br />
If the utility is corrupted or deleted from your computer, see the DellMobile Broadband Card Utility user’s guide in Windows Help and Support (click Start , and then click Help and Support) or on the media that accompanied your card if you purchased it separately
 from your computer.</span><span><br />

<p>If you are comfortable using the Registy Editor, then look to see if this key exists:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Installer\InProgress</p>
<p>If that key is there then copy it to your desktop first then delete that key.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately Barb's reply was not helpful in this case. &nbsp;After the latest patch, folders can be seen but no content. &nbsp;This was working fine before the patch. &nbsp;The steps to turn streaming back on (which I have had to repeat after several patches in the past)
 did not resolve the issue this time.</p>

<h2>            Gear Head Optical 2.4 GHz Wireless Nano Mouse Problems on Windows 7 Home Premium</h2>
                    My Gear Head mouse is giving me problems. When I click, it double clicks and pulls up an extra page. Any suggestions on a fix to this?

<p>We need that&nbsp;Microsoft replace them.&nbsp;Money is not precisely abundant at this time.</p>
<p>I love the size, the color, the design is really comfortable, but mouse get freeze time to time and you need to remove and reinstall batteries to make it work.</p>

            I replace mine with a whole new mouse. My new mouse is a Logitech M185 Wireless Optical Mouse. Everyone says that Logitech is one of the most highly praised computer accessories brand to buy. I don't reccommend the Gear Head computer accessories to anyone.

    <title>Xbox 360 Family Timer - Setting from a PC - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox 360 Family Timer - Setting from a PC</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,<br />
I was wondering if it was possible to set the family timer of an Xbox 360 from a PC?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also, If the Xbox is set to allow 1 hours play a day, at what point does the timer reset, is it at midnight? Or is it always at the same time every day as when it was first set?</p>

<p>Thank in advance</p>

                </div>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>From what I can see, it's not possible to set from the PC</p>
<p>Also reading through the information on the family timer leads me to believe it would reset as soon as you hit a new day or week and not the time you set it as the purpose to limit the time the console can be used daily or weekly.</p>
<p>See the following link for more information on the family timer: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/security/how-to-set-family-timer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Mobile hotspot won&#39;t connect to iPhone</h2>
                    <p>I have recently updated my computer to Windows 10 and have been attempting to use the Mobile Hotspot function provided in it. I am able to create a name and password for it. Under the "Share my internet connection from" section, it says the name of my Ethernet,
 which is how I access the internet through my laptop. When I turn it on, I am able to find it on my iPhone's list of available WiFi networks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, once I choose to connect to the hotspot on my phone and enter the password, I am told there is "no internet connection." I have tried many things to fix this to no avail. How can I get my phone to connect to the Mobile Hotspot being shared by my
 laptop?</p>

            Hi Michael
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Uninstall your Antivirus utility such as McAfee, Norton - since it might be interfering with Mobile hot. 
<br />
<br />    Open Mobile hotspot settings (Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Mobile hotspot)
<br />    Turn on mobile hotspot
<br />    Under "Related Settings", click Change adapter options
<br />    Take note of which adapter is connected to the internet and which adapter is your mobile hotspot (typically named "Local Area Connection* [#]")
<br />    Right click the adapter that is connected to the internet and click Properties
<br />    Go to the Sharing tab
<br />    Uncheck "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection". If it is already unchecked, skip this step.
<br />    Click OK
<br />    Again, open Properties &gt; Sharing for the same adapter.
<br />    Check "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection"
<br />    (If you get a popup that says "Internet Connection Sharing is currently enabled...", click OK.)
<br />    Under "Home networking connection:", select the mobile hotspot adapter
<br />    Click OK
<br />
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network adapters
<br />Right click then uninstall all virtual adapters
<br />
<br />Open Start then type: regedit
<br />Right click Regedit then click Run as administrator
<br />Navigate to the following registry key:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WlanSvc\Parameters\HostedNetworkSettings\
<br />
<br />Delete the following key: 
<br />HostedNetworkSettings
<br />
<br />Restart then try again.
<br />
<br />Run the Network adapter troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Network adapters
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart to see if it works.
<br />
<br />If not, you can try updating both your Network adapter drivers or uninstall them.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand network adapters
<br />Right click your adapter, click uninstall
<br />
<br />Exit Device Manager then restart
<br />
<br />Windows 10 will re-detect them and reinstall them. 
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />Open a Command Prompt Window as Adminstrator
<br />
<br />Run these commands and hit Enter:
<br />(replace name and PW with the mobile HotSpot Name and Password from your screen capture)
<br />
<br />netsh wlan set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid=name key=pw
<br />
<br />netsh wlan start hostednetwork
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Network &amp; Internet - Wi-Fi - 'Change adapter options'
<br />
<br />Look for a new "Local Area Connection #..."
<br />(It should show "Microsoft Hosted Network Virtual Adapter" as the Adapter).
<br />
<br />Right-click this and select "Properties",
<br />
<br />Select the "Sharing Tab. Check "Allow other network Users to connect through this computer's Internet connection"

Well it sounds like it's time to start looking at data recovery options. Once you start hearing noises like that from hard drives it means it's about to **** out on you and you should back it up immediately. That type of noise makes me want to suggest that it has bad bearings and can't gain full rotational speed. Also if it clicks at all, it may be because the heads have gone bad as well. 



Sorry I couldn't help more. But do take it to a shop and get your data recovered.

            <p>&nbsp;The drive may well be failing, but don't give up yet.&nbsp; First take it to another PC and see if you can access it.&nbsp; If you can, copy what you need.&nbsp; If you can't access it from another computer, the best you can do is to contact WD and see if they can help.&nbsp;
 There are services that recover data from failed drives, but in most cases they're prohibitively expensive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a 1 TB Seagate drive to fail on me a few months ago, but was able to connect it to another PC and copy the data before having to reformat it.&nbsp; Once I reformatted it several times, it became usable again, but I know it's living on borrowed time.&nbsp;
 :-(&nbsp; These things do wear out from time to time.&nbsp; The disks rotate at 5400 to 7200 RPM and the access arms move in and out to access different sectors.&nbsp; Anything with moving parts eventually wears out unfortunately.&nbsp; Fortunately hard drives are much much cheaper
 than cars and houses in that regard!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

    <title>Aero broken by portrait mode on second monitor after November 13-14, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doc_kromm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Aero broken by portrait mode on second monitor after November 13-14, 2012 updates</h2>
                    <p>After the round of updates released on November 13, 2012&nbsp;and installed on November 14, Aero was broken on my PC. I searched these and other forums extensively, and tried all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Summoning "Personalize appearance and sounds" in every possible way. Aero wasn't even there.</span></li><li><span>Confirming that Aero was still present and accounted for at C:\Windows\Resources\Themes . It was.</span></li><li><span>Restarting the Desktop Window Manager Session Manager (UxSms) service both from services.msc and via net start/net stop at an elevated prompt. M</span><span>ade Aero flash to life until I clicked once anywhere at all.</span></li><li><span>Restarting the Themes service both from services.msc and via net start/net stop at an elevated prompt. No effect.</span></li><li><span>Running sfc /scannow from an elevated prompt. Found nothing amiss with any relevant components.</span></li><li><span>Running sfc /SCANFILE=c:\windows\system32\dwm.exe specifically. Reported that the DW Manager was fine.</span></li><li><span>Running the Microsoft Fix it wizard for Aero. Confirmed that UxSms isn't staying enabled (even though the Task Manager showed it running!). Couldn't reenable it.</spa
<p>Then I found this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie10_rp-windows_7/aero-breaks-while-putting-the-monitor-in-portrait/fe813f9b-023b-4fe1-a677-a97ec359960f">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie10_rp-windows_7/aero-breaks-while-putting-the-monitor-in-portrait/fe813f9b-023b-4fe1-a677-a97ec359960f</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the fact that I'm running Vista, not Win7, and despite the fact that I am not using IE10, this described the symptoms perfectly: Changing my second monitor orientation from portrait to landscape and restarting UxSms restored Aero and left everything
 stable. Switching the second monitor back to portrait instantly broke Aero again. The trouble is, that monitor needs to be in portrait mode for work-related reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Win7/IE10 thread suggested uninstalling KB2670838, but that is a Win7 update as far as I can tell. Any thoughts on how to find the equivalent Vista update?</p>Thanks!

            <p>Sorry to leave out details!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Brief Description of Problem:</strong> Please see subject line of original post, "Aero broken by portrait mode on second monitor after November 13-14, 2012 updates."</p>
<p><strong>Version&nbsp;&amp; SP:</strong>&nbsp;Windows Vista Home Premium, SP 2 (x64). Clean, not upgraded.</p>
<p><strong>Last Update Installed Prior to Problems:</strong> Uncertain which one did it, but it happened on November 14. The first in the sequence was KB2761451; the last,&nbsp;KB2727528.</p>
<p><strong>Error Codes:</strong> Only in Event Viewer, which&nbsp;has this to say:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>Faulting application Dwm.exe, version 6.0.6002.18005, time stamp 0x49e02696, faulting module ntdll.dll, version 6.0.6002.18541, time stamp 0x4ec3e855, exception code 0xc0000374, fault offset 0x00000000000acb17, process id 0x6cc, application start time 0x01cdc75c998e3e6f.</p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Steps Taken/Results:</strong> Many – please see original post.</p>
<p><strong>Happened Before:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Antivirus:</strong> McAfee AntiVirus Plus, up to date, and nothing else.</p>
<p><strong>Verbose Description:</strong> Please see original post.&nbsp;To summarize, I have one monitor in landscape and one in portrait on a GeForce 9800 GT. As of November 14, I cannot use Aero if the second monitor is in portrait mode. I can if it's in landscape
 mode, which isn't useful to me. Prior to that date, this setup worked flawlessly.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to Reproduce:</strong> Set second monitor to portrait. Setting it to landscape fixes it, but I need portrait (for work) and preferably Aero (because the basic theme is quite hard on my vision).</p>
<p><strong>Basic Description of System:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Vista Home Premium, SP 2 (x64) </li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Q9300</li><li><strong>GPU:</strong> GeForce 9800 GT</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong> 4GB</li><li><strong>HDD:</strong> Seagate 3500320N (500GB)</li><li><strong>Virus Scanner:</strong> McAfee Virus Scan 15.6.231</li></ul>
<p><strong>Software/Hardware Added/Changed/Removed:</strong> Nothing recent. Just Windows Update.</p>
<p><strong>Time Since Problem: </strong>Seven days, including today. It started on November 14, 2012.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks, and sorry to spam you with a whole lot of information that wasn't useful in my previous post!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed application (e.g., McAfee Total Protection) and
<em>when (exact date, preferably) does your current subscription expire?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Has&nbsp;any other McAfee application (e.g., McAfee Internet Security)&nbsp;<em>or a Norton application</em> EVER been installed on the computer
<em>since you bought it</em>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Did a McAfee free-trial (e.g., McAfee Security Center)&nbsp;<em>or a&nbsp;Norton free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em>when you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>McAfee (and Norton) applications are <em>notorious</em> for not upgrading (or uninstalling) cleanly. 3+ years of McAfee "leftovers" may be your troublemaker here. Personally, I'm very suprised that you haven't run into any problems before&nbsp;now (unless you
 only recently upgraded the McAfee application for the very first time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roll up your sleeves, cross your fingers &amp; try the following multi-step fix I've cooked-up just for your computer...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ACTIONS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>[You&nbsp;will want to print these instructions for offline reference.&nbsp;IMPORTANT&nbsp;=&gt; DON'T SKIP&nbsp;ANY STEP</strong>
<strong>&amp; perform all Steps in one (1), uninterrupted session!&nbsp;If a Step says to reboot,
<em>reboot!</em> ]</strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Right-click on the following link, select SAVE TARGET AS... &amp; download the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:
<a href="http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Uninstall&nbsp;<strong>McAfee Antivirus Plus</strong>&nbsp;via <strong>Start | Control Panel | Programs |</strong><strong> Programs and Features</strong>. Reboot if not prompted to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. <strong>IMPORTANT! =&gt; Make sure&nbsp;the Windows Firewall is enabled&nbsp;<em>immediately</em> after rebooting!</strong>&nbsp; [Should happen automatically but I want you to doublecheck.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NB: You're "working without a net" now: Don't to ANYTHING <em>else</em> online (e.g., browsing; reading email; chatting) until you've completed&nbsp;Step #7&nbsp;below!
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1 above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>. to&nbsp;run the utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Do a clean install of the current/latest version of&nbsp;<strong>McAfee&nbsp;Antivirus Plus</strong>&nbsp;(using the disc &amp;&nbsp;your Product ID, if need be)&nbsp;&amp; reboot. If you purchased your software directly from McAfee, go to
<a href="https://home.mcafee.com/Secure/Protected/Login.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://home.mcafee.com/Secure/Protected/Login.aspx</a> to log in and download your software. Reboot when you're finished, if not prompted to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Manually and repeatedly&nbsp;update the McAfee application&nbsp;until you get a "no more updates" or similar&nbsp;prompt - otherwise, just skip this step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Open Internet Explorer (<em>only!</em>) to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</a> [ignore any DOES NOT APPLY warnings as well as the APPLIES TO section] &amp; run the Fix It.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note=&gt; For optimal results, check the <strong>Delete personal settings</strong> option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9a. Open Internet Explorer&nbsp;(<em>only!</em>) to&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910336</a>&nbsp;[ignore the title &amp; Symptoms].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9b. <em><strong>IMPORTANT! =&gt; Dismiss/close the Windows Update troubleshooter pop-up!</strong></em> -&nbsp;then...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9c. Ignoring any "Not recommended" or similar warnings, run Fix It 50202 in DEFAULT
<em>and then AGGRESSIVE modes</em>.&nbsp;[1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Reboot one last time &amp; test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: There may be more work to do (e.g., rolling back a graphics driver update). We'll see. Good luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: Kudos on keeping Java &amp; Flash updated!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>===============================================================<br />
[1] Full Disclosure: Running the&nbsp;Fix It in AGGRESSIVE mode&nbsp;will delete your <strong>
Update History</strong> (if there&nbsp;were any) but <em>not</em> the list of <strong>
Installed Updates</strong> (if there&nbsp;are any).</p>

            <p>Thanks for the fix suggestions although they had no effect on this problem for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I did get a message during the fix that Microsoft Update had a problem and was fixed, but&nbsp;Aero did not re-enable after rebooting. Uninstalling/reinstalling/Uninstalling McAfee&nbsp;Free
 version also had no effect. Neither did updating Java from 6 to 7, nor updating Flash.</p>
<p>I had this problem until I rolled back the Nvidia drivers from November 2012, back to May.</p>
<p>These drivers both had the Aero disabling problem:</p>
<p>310.61-desktop-win8-win7-winvista-64bit-international-beta.exe</p>
<p>306.97-desktop-win8-win7-winvista-64bit-english-whql.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This did NOT have the problem:</p>
<p>296.10-desktop-win7-winvista-64bit-english-whql.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have filed a bug report with Nvidia with this info.&nbsp; Changing the monitor connected to my Nvidia GeForce 210's DVI connector, from Portrait (Left 90 degrees) to normal, did fix the problem.&nbsp; However, I prefer to have one of my two monitors in tall mode
 for reading web pages and other documents.&nbsp; My other HannsG monitor is in normal (landscape) mode, and is connected to the HDMI connector on the video card.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I may try the whole lengthy uninstall-reinstall procedure, but I lack the free time for it at the moment (Canadian here, no long weekend!). The problem arose the same night that Windows Update forced&nbsp;Nvidia's 306.97 driver&nbsp;onto my system, and people
 on Nvidia's forums are talking about the issue. I am reluctant to blame on Microsoft and McAfee what I think is Nvidia's booboo. I plan to see if 296.10 solves the problem, because if it does, that's fine . . . that driver was stable for me, and gave good
 performance, while 306.97 added nothing I care about.</p>

            <p>Thanks for all this. I've read and printed it, and I have to decide whether I can spare the time for it in the near future. My concern (as I outlined in my reply to c4dn) is that this solution&nbsp;appears to be coming at the problem through McAfee and/or IE,
 when the November 13-14 updates included an Nvidia driver that seems to have good odds of being the actual&nbsp;culprit. I rolled back to 306.23 but not all the way to 296.10 . . . which I'd like to try first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you noticed, I do generally try to keep things up to date: latest Windows updates, latest Flash, latest&nbsp;Java, latest McAfee, etc. My feeling is that this backfired on the Nvidia driver. If 296.10 solves the problem, then I'll stick with that for the time
 being (and switch AU to ask permission . . .). Either way, I'll report in!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for all the advice, PA Bear.</p>

            <p>Yes, I suspect an unwanted/unncessary&nbsp;driver update <em>may</em>&nbsp;have&nbsp;caused the&nbsp;problem&nbsp;but trust me: You wanna rid your computer of the 3+ years worth&nbsp;of McAfee "leftovers" before they scr3w up something else soon!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: If the driver update&nbsp;is&nbsp;your troublemaker, chances are Windows Update will soon install it again (and again and again,
<em>ad nauseum</em>) unless &amp; until&nbsp;you take certain preventative measures to stop it. [1]&nbsp; If my multi-step fix hadn't fix the problem, we would have touched on that next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>===========================================================<br />
[1] You can try to "hide" the driver update,&nbsp;you can change your Automatic Updates setting and/or you can configure your system such that
<em>no</em> driver updates are offered via Windows Update in the future&nbsp;- but as far as Automatic Updates is concerned, you've already Approved the install of that driver update.</p>

    <title>All Windows 10 Updates AND App Updates fail to download - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kadkat  say:</h3>
<h2>            All Windows 10 Updates AND App Updates fail to download</h2>
                    <p>I am about to pull my hair out! <br />
</p>
<p>I have not been able to auto-download any Windows 10 updates; including all apps (including one I just paid for and haven't been able to use), Windows Defender and Microsoft Office 2007. I was able to manually download the Cummalative Windows 10 v1607 Update
 from the download center and Windows Defender from the app itself. I cannot download any updates for my apps and I cannot download the DVD Player app I just bought and paid for from the app Store.</p>
<p>
I have tried many, many fixes from other members in the community that worked for them, but have been unsuccessful.<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>I finally gave up on Microsoft Office 2007 and uninstalled the entire Suite of programs. I only use Word anyway. I didn't want to have any security leaks because it can't download and install updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did get the error code 0x80246002 when the App Store DVD Player app failed to download.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the Windows DVD Player which I already had installed. It worked for a while, then all of a sudden it couldn't read the code and refused to work anymore. I finally uninstalled it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be much appreciated. Thank you.</p>

<p>e se continuar assim acho que vou passar a PSN também obrigado pessoal.</p>

<p>Acabei de ser banido também. Console original, jogos originais e acessorios 100% originais.
</p>
<p>Não usei conta mágica, não ofendi ninguém(quem me conhece na live sabe que não sou desse tipo).
</p>
<p>E assim como você, eu e um outro amigo nosso da LIVE, que inclusive tinha um console FAT modelo HALO importado, foi banido também.
</p>
<p>A microsoft Brasil não responde as argumentações e dizem que eu não possuo NENHUM tipo de restrição ou reclamação de outros usuários da LIVE, nem o porque dessa situação e se limita a dizer que não se responsabiliza por consoles que não são comprados no
 Brasil.</p>
<p>A minha LIVE é BR, assinei e não posso usar. </p>
<p>Deixo aqui registrado que vou entrar em contato com as revistas oficiais aqui do país, entrarei com uma ação no PROCOM (mesmo que não adiante nada) e vou formalizar uma reclamação junto a MICROSOFT americana.
