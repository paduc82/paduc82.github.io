<h2>            HELP&#33; Cant Purchase MS Points &#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey there.</p>
<p>I've been trying to purchase MS points for at least 3 weeks or so and i still get this same error: "<span>Your payment instrument could not be authorized. Please contact your provider, or try a different payment option."<br />
<br />
I've tried the following options:<br />
- Calling up my bank (My card is ok and i can make transactions on ANY other site)</span></p>
<p>- Calling MS Support (No help either they don't really know what to do)</p>
<p>- Changing my billing e-mail address to another one that's different from my LIVE ID</p>
<p>- Clearing the cache etc on my xbox</p>
<p>- Deleting and readding my card information</p>
<p>- Trying another card</p>
<p>- Using paypal instead of card payment</p>

<p>None of this works for me. It's really frustrating for me because i live in Singapore and i'm unable to buy ANY prepaid cards for xbox points here. The only method i can get it is through the XBOX site and now this issue is really getting on my nerves..
 Please do help me solve my problem</p>
<p>THANKS IN ADVANCE :D<br />
<br />
P.S. I want my Porsche expansion pack D:</p>

<p>Maybe your bank building has taken away the right for you to buy something or maybe you have entered your email address incorrectly, Or in another note go to the shop and buy MS points there using your card.</p>

<p>Also, (sorry for the double post) it may not be relevant, but was the billing contact email you changed to a Windows Live or Hotmail account, or was it something different like Gmail or Yahoo? It shouldn't matter but I personally had the exact same issue
 as you, tried all the same steps, and the only thing that fixed it was changing my billing contact email, and I used a new Windows Live email account. Like I said, may not be relevant but if you are in the same boat I was you are willing to try anything to
 fix this problem.</p>

<p>As for the e-mail issue i've tried using a gmail and another hotmail, both doesn't work.</p>
<p>The amazon card is the US edition card, i can only use the ASIA edition card (not even the japan ones) which is not being retailed over here in my country T.T</p>

<p>Well Kelvin Gaga, you have tried almost everything I can think of!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried purchasing the points through your xbox console? Also, have you tried deleting your Gamer Profile then Redownloading it? I am scraping the bottom of the barrel here but it is worth a shot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only other thing I can suggest is for you to call Xbox Customer support back and ask to be put through to level 2 technical support, and ask them to open an investigation as to why this is happening. The first people you speak to when you call Xbox Customer
 support are not trained in the more technical aspects of support, so there is a limit as to the assistance they can provide. Be sure to explain how frustrating the problem is, but stay calm and polite. Let them know if there is specific content you have been
 wanting to download and how disappointed you are that you have to miss out because of a bug in Microsoft's System. They should be able to help you out. I am truly sorry I can not assist you any further! I really do know how frustrating this problem is, and
 I hope you get it fixed soon.</p>

<h2>            Printer Connectivity Problem</h2>
                    <p>&lt;<em>Moved from Windows 7 | Network &amp; Internet</em>&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My default printer appears to have a problem with its IP address and nothing will print. Windows 10/Ricoh 7200. I'd appreciate any help to walk me through how to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run the troubleshooter, turned off &amp; on various components (PC, router, printer etc). Checked all the cables. Driver appears to be up to date. The troubleshooter says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Printer RICOH 7200 cannot be contacted over the network.</p>
<p>Your computer appears to be correctly configured, but the device or resource (192.168.1.101) is not responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking my printer's IP address on the printer's menu confirms its address is 192.168.001.101.</p>
<p>Checking my printer's properties through my PCs control panel, I've changed the printer's port from 169.254.67.132 (what the network was using) to 192.168.1.101 to match; hit apply ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>but when I try to send a test page to the printer nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both PC and printer were switched off for two weeks while I was out of the office. Everything worked fine until I returned and switched them back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What have I done wrong and what steps do I need to take to get everything properly connected again?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I don't have Windows 10, so I can't confirm things (you posted your question in the Windows 7 section of the forum), but this statement is mighty suspicious:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>Checking my printer's properties through my PCs control panel,</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>I've changed the printer's port from 169.254.67.132 (what the</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>network was using)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>An IP address that is of the form 169.254.x.y is an "APIPA" (<strong>A</strong>utomatic
<strong>P</strong>rivate <strong>IP</strong> <strong>A</strong>ddressing) address, which is what Windows "self-configures" on an IP interface when the interface is configured to use a DHCP-assigned address but no DHCP server is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You typically see an APIPA address on a wireless network adapter when there is a problem connecting to the router, usually because of a misconfigured wireless security password.&nbsp; It's surprising to see an APIPA address on a printer port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is your <strong>computer </strong>connected to the Internet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the <strong>printer </strong>connected using an Ethernet cable or wireless networking?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To what device is the printer connected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a router or are you using a direct wireless connection between your printer and your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the "Host Interface Menu" on the printer, is DHCP turned on (enabled) or is the 192.168.001.101 address configured as a static address?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure how you changed the printer port address, but I suggest removing the printers (right-click in Devices and Printers and "remove device") and then re-install it:&nbsp;

            Hi Carole:

My name is Ron.

Lets see what we can do together to get you out of your problem. I have not encountered, or heard of, this specific issue (yet). 

So, if you can identify the specific update, or group of updates that are causing this problem you can use the following article to uninstall them

https://www.howtogeek.com/235474/how-to-roll-back-builds-and-uninstall-updates-on-windows-10/

First I'd suggest doing a full image copy backup, just in case you do have even worse problems, you can restore to this almost good situation.

Second, if you can, I'd wait a day or two, to see if anyone else has this problem. Maybe they can find a different solution or workaround (other than uninstalling updates).

Third, I'd go over to the MS Answers forum: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/
It is very similar to this, with a larger pool of people asking questions and providing replies/answers and ask this question again. 

Good luck.       
        </p>

            Hello Carole, I'm Greg here to help you.

When Windows Updates cause problems you can roll one or more back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update&gt;Installed Updates.  

Another method is to use System Restore to a point before the bad Update(s):  http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943

Often a problem Update will work when it's reinstalled from Windows Update but if it continues to cause problems and you can isolate it you can hide it following https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930

Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Silverlight 5 broken for certain users&#47;profile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dave_e_s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Silverlight 5 broken for certain users&#47;profile</h2>
                    <p>Silverlight 5 works for an admin user or <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
new profile</span> user if I uninstall/reinstall it. But for an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
existing user</span>, Silverlight controls in Sharepoint don't install or work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the uninstall/reinstall will work if I can clear the Silverlight info/file out of the existing user's profile. Is there a certain .dll I can delete which will reset that user's Silverlight installation?
</p>
<p>If I delete the user's profile and have them login and Silverlight is installed correctly, the Sharepoint Silverlight controls work. I want to avoid having to recreate user profiles.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already tried the steps in http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2608523</p>
<p>The version I am trying to install is 5.0 x64</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description I understand that you are unable to uninstall or reinstall Microsoft Silverlight 5.0 on existing non-admin user accounts. However, it works
 on new user profiles.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What happens when you try to install/uninstall Silverlight on an existing user profile? Do you get any error message?</span></li><li><span>You mentioned that you followed Microsoft KB/2608523 article, were you able to Clean Silverlight successfully?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps in the article below to clean up the corrupted Microsoft Silverlight components and reinstall.</span></p>

            <p>1. as a non-admin, I believe Silverlight can be uninstalled using add/remove programs. Silverlight cannot be installed as a non-admin user.
</p>
<p>as a side-note - if I clear/delete the non-admin user profile then log back in as that non-admin and the profile gets recreated, the Silverlight components in Sharepoint work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I am able to completely uninstall Silverlight and reinstall using the steps in
<span>2608523</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It seems that something in the user's profile is not getting removed. I'd like to fix this problem without having to wipe a user's profile.
</span></p>

            <p>Apologies. In my last post I did not state the progress clearly. </p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"After I ran the fix, I clicked a link on a Sharepoint page that ran a Silverlight install wizard. After that was done, Silverlight controls in Sharepoint displayed properly."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This did fix the issue but this is only a solution if a user has local admin rights to the PC. Even if this is done, I would login to the same PC as a non-admin user and the Silverlight controls in Sharepoint will not display. The link to install Silverlight
 appears but the non-admin user is unable to install the newer Silverlight application.
</p>
<p>I am hoping there is some way to reset the non-admin's Silverlight experience. It seems the only way to do this is to delete the non-admins profile from the PC and have them login so the profile will recreate. Any ideas? Thanks so much.

This is a tutorial by Windows. <br />
It should be good particularly for your " adults with computer phobic ".<br />
<br />
It illustrate the use of a mouse with a video as well as a script tutorial:<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Weather app instantly crashing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gadgmeister  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Weather app instantly crashing</h2>
                    <p>So yesterday I installed W10 Pro as an in place upgrade on my quad core Pc, everything installed correctly and&nbsp;is working as it should except the Microsoft weather app ?? it simply opens its windows, presents a white&nbsp;page and shuts down ?? all other native
 apps are working correctly</p>
<p>
</p><p>IT HAS BEEN UPDATED FROM THE STORE WITHOUT ISSUES ( before I'm given that option by someone helpful )</p>
<p>
</p><p>but the same issue remains, it briefly opens and then closes... oddly the weather tile shown from the start button shows weather info so it is kind of working</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there a way to un install the weather app and re-install ?? or is this a known issue with perhaps another fix ??</p>
&nbsp;

            <p>I found software on my computer that was causing this bug. </p>
<p>The software that caused the bug happened to be a graphics tablet driver from Adesso Inc.&nbsp;I had the Cybertablet&nbsp;M14 found on this list:

<p>The bug was fixed when the driver is uninstalled from add/remove programs control panel.</p>

            <p>Yes it actually solved the issue ?? i have a Trust TB-4200 Scroll Tablet plugged into my Pc via USB, i found no Trust drivers so instead just un plugged the Tablet from the USB on my Pc, no restart needed, just tried the weather app and it worked perfectly
 ???&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Why a USB driver or device would stop an app opening is a mystery but it definitely was the issue, now i have weather or tablet but not both at the same time .... a first world issue me thinks and something i wont loose too much sleep over</p>

            <p>It is likely that the problem is being caused by inadequate access permission to the C:\Program Files\WindowsApps. Go to the directory and right click it and click in Properties, then check the security tab and give access permission to your user (set yourself
 as directory owner). This should solve the problem of any application within the WindowsApp directory that is crashing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably the problem is caused when different users install Windows or applications.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like to know if there was an update which installed prior to this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the added information, I suggest that you check if there are any updates for your PC. If so disconnect all external devices other than mouse and keyboard install the updates, reboot&nbsp; the system and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if an update got installed, I&nbsp;suggest that you perform System Restore and check if you will be able to revert back to the time when the said function was working. To learn how to perform restore, refer to the section&nbsp;<strong>Restore from a System Restore
 point </strong>provided in the link below</p>

            I believe no updates happen when i my windows hello is already working. By this time I thought my hello is working properly, at first boot(just recently opened my laptop) i still encounter the said problem, but when i try to make my laptop sleep or lock
 and I try to sign in again, windows hello is already working.

<p>
</p><p>As per the added information, I understand that you are unable to use Windows Hello to sign it at initial boot, but after&nbsp;the PC is put to sleep the feature works.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above is true, then I suggest that you&nbsp;place your PC in Clean Boot and check if disabling the startup services and apps rectifies the issue. This will help us know if there are any third party startup services or apps that might be causing the conflict.</p>

            Before i try to do this.<br />
<br />
I forgot to tell something i have recently repaired my laptop before this problem occurs, they said that they changed the mother board. And after that Lenovo service center actually fixed it. I try to determine if there is some updates to my drivers and this
 is the result I got. What do you think? maybe i can try to update my drivers including my 3d camera drivers or should I execute your suggestion. I'm really glad for your assistance vanessa.&nbsp;

            Actually, I still have the problem same with yours, I got tired looking for answer, maybe formatting the PC or resetting it will be least option. It actually work for me when opening after a sleep or lock.

<h2>            How to install windows 7 64-bit over windows 7 32-bit without the windows 7 64-bit disk&#63;</h2>
                    I bought windows 7 32-bit and installed it on to my computer until I&nbsp;realized&nbsp;it was 64-bit capable. I want to install windows 7 64-bit over my previous 32-bit but I didn't get a 64-bit disk with my 64-bit. Is there any possible way to change my computer
 to 64-bit?

            A 64 bit disk is needed to install 64 bit.<br />

<span>1) You'll need to use the correct bit install disk - 32 and 64bit come on a separate DVD.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>--If you bought the retail copy of Windows 7 you should have gotten both 32 and 64bit disks.

<span>3) Upgrading or simply switching between Windows 7 32/64 bit is not possible.</span></p>
<p>
<span>4) If you are moving to 64 bit make sure your computer can run 64 bit - you can use the Upgrade Advisor to check:</span></p>

<span>5) Make sure 32/64 bit drivers are available for your computer - check with the manufacturer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Custom Clean Install Steps</span><span> - 32 to 64 bit<br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>You can use an Upgrade or Full Windows 7 disk to do a custom clean install. This will remove all your programs, but you can save your files and settings to external storage before doing so. You will have
 to reinstall all your programs after installing Windows 7. Here are the steps: </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;<br />
1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor - it scans your PC for potential issues with your hardware, devices, and installed programs, recommends what to do before you upgrade, and whether you can install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.
<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor</span></a><span><br />
<br />
2. Backup all your files and settings to avoid losing docs, photos, and other information. Windows Easy Transfer is a free tool to copy files (not programs) from your PC, and then transfer them back after you install Windows 7. If you don't want to use Windows
 Easy Transfer, you can copy your files to a USB drive, or CD/DVD.<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer</span></a><span><br />
<br />
3. Insert the install disk, restart and boot from the DVD - if prompted to press any key... press a key on your keyboard.<br />
4. Click Install Now<br />
5. At the setup screen, click Custom (Advanced)<br />
6. Select a partition to install Windows on.<br />
7. Continue with install.<br />
8. After Windows 7 is installed you can use Windows Easy Transfer (or another backup method you used) to restore your files &amp; settings, and use your program installation disks to reinstall all your programs.<br />

    <title>Filename Truncate Bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rue 83  say:</h3>
<h2>            Filename Truncate Bug</h2>
                    <p>This has to be a bug, and I can't believe no-one else has posted about it.</p>
<p>I've tried searching to see if anyone has noticed this problem, but can't find anything, seems it's quite difficult to find the right search terms.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>When resizing a column in an explorer window, if the length of the filename exceeds the width of the column, an ellipsis is displayed showing that it has been truncated. This is normal expected behaviour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if less than 4 characters are truncated, the ellipsis is missing and the filename is just clipped.</p>
<p>This is highly annoying, very confusing and simply needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is true for every column type (filename, type, size, date modified, etc); and not only just regular explorer windows, but also any application that uses the explorer shell in its dialogue boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is everywhere, and I've also checked not only my PC at home but also four other PCs all running Windows 10. They all exhibit this bug. So it cannot be a conflict arising for certain software being installed or anything like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try opening an explorer window and see for yourself...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I also posted this on the windows feedback hub, but for some reason couldn't sign in, and therefore can't track the progress. And the ability to search the hub seems to have been removed.)</p>

<h2>            Skype seems to log in, but does not connect and there are no messages.</h2>
                    <p>My skype seems to log in, then acts as though it hasnt. Down the bottom is the word connecting, that just stays there. There are no previous messages, i cant send messages.&nbsp; As a last resort i installed something called skype lite,&nbsp; that works. Normally
 that connecting word is there, but it does connect.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Predictive text Windows 10 phone not working</h2>
                    <div>I'm having tons of issues with predictive text in W10 Mobile. I agree that WP 8.1's predictive text was amazing. It worked so flawlessly and predicted things I didn't think it would pick up on. After getting a new phone with W10 Mobile on it,&nbsp;predictive
 text is&nbsp;horrible. It can't even pick up basic words (like "aid")&nbsp;or common internet slang ("lol").</div>
<div>Also, while swiping with Word Flow, it no longer shows what word&nbsp;it's thinking about at the moment. Typing on a smartphone is not my favorite experience, but it's&nbsp;really painful&nbsp;now that Word Flow is much worse. I feel like it worked great on Windows 10
 Mobile at some point but that a recent update (perhaps the Anniversary Update) basically broke the whole feature for me.</div>

            Try going to Settings, locate keyboard, click your selected keyboard then disable it, and re-enable it again. Works for me.

<h2>            Mortal Kombat 9 Charakter-Fragen</h2>
                    
<p>Gre euch,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ich habe das Spiel erst vor 1, 2 Wochen mir hier in Deutschland holen knnen und beim Zocken versuche ich spezifische Stage,- und Secret-Fatalitys sowie Babylitys freizuschalten und ich bekomme es nicht hin. Es wre lieb, mir etwas genauer zu erklren, was
 ich zu tun habe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hier meine Fragen:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Bei Scorpion, Sub-Zero und ich glaub 2 anderen kann man einen 3. Fatality freischalten, doch mir wurde gesagt, dass man dazu einen "DLC" bentigt". &nbsp;Was ist also ein "DLC", wird das wirklich bentigt, wenn Ja, wie und wenn Nein, was muss stattdessen tun,
 um sie freizuschalten?</p>
<p>2. Ich probiere die Babylitys im Kampf-Modus beim '1vs1' andauernd aus, doch es will irgendwie nicht klappen :( . Was muss ich hierfr machen und gibt es andere Alternativen?</p>
<p>3. Im Krypt habe ich so gut wie alle Fatalitys und Sammelgegenstnde freigeschlatet, kann aber nicht zum Beispiel bei Scorpion seinen Alternativ-Kostm anwenden. Ich habe sogar in der MK9-Verpackung einen Code bekommen, mitdem ich den Classic-Costum bekommen
 htte / wrde, ... Ich bin nicht direkt zu dem anderen Schuppen gegangen. War das ein Fehler oder kann ich noch irgendwie etwas tun, um anderen sein ueres zu verndern?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vielen Dank im Voraus und entschuldigt, dass ich euch mit Fragen zubomb'.</p>

<p>zu 1 </p>
<p>Fr den dritten Fatality braucht man den DLC (Download Content) den es nicht in Deutschland gibt. Andere Mglichkeit ist der beiligende Code in der Verpackung der aber nur fr einen der Kmpfer ist.</p>
<p>zu 2</p>
<p>Babylity men in Sprungreichweite ausgefhrt werden da gibt es keine Alternative oder einen Trick.</p>
<p>zu 3</p>
<p>Diesen Code den du dabei gehabt hast musst du auch einlsen damit du das Alternative Kostm inklusive passenden Finisher benutzen kannst.</p>

<p>ok, mit dem DLC habe ich es verstanden und mit dem babality auch, es klappt sogar. :D doch ich habe den code ja eingelst und in dem neo-blabla geh ich dann auf scorpion und ich kann nicht sein alternativ-kostm anwenden. was kann ich da machen?</p>

<p>Wenn ich mich noch richtig erinnere, dann war das im Charaktermen auf Start oder Back drcken, dann kann man die Kostme auswhlen, wo dann auch das von Scorpion dabei sein mte, das schaltet sich nmlich nach Download sofort frei ohne das man in der Krypta
 irgendwas frei schaltet.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Download and Install</h2>
                    Original Title : Me again.<br />
<br />
I have asked for assistance with downloading Windows 10 to my computer which currently operates with Windows 7. I have received a reply intended to help. The reply tells me to select the current version of Windows on my computer from which I want to upgrade
 to Windows 10. &nbsp;When I simply select Windows 7 from the list as my current version, many times, I have repeatedly received a message regarding upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 8, Windows 10 is not mentioned. When will all of this run around get it together
 and actually tell me specifically how to upgrade from Windows 7 to <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 10.</span></strong> That is all I have ever asked for on numerous occasions but my question remains unanswered. I continue to be frustrated
 with the attempts to help that only serve to further erode my confidence in Microsoft. Is my question understood? This is only and specifically with regards to upgrade from Windows 7 straight to Windows 10 !&nbsp;

            <p>Hi, Judy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can change the text size</p>
<p>Control Panel &gt; Type Color Scheme</p>
<p>Select Personalize</p>
<p>Select Display (left index)</p>
<p>Under change only the text size, select Icon</p>
<p>You can also check the option for Bold</p>
<p>Remember to click apply when finished</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because Desktop wallpaper images have varying colors, it is easy for the font colors to be unreadable if they are on top of&nbsp;the same color&nbsp;as a wallpaper image. For instance a black font on top of a dark part of the background image or a white font on a
 white part of a background image.<br />
<br />
The Desktop icon fonts are dynamic and will show white on dark backgrounds and change to white with a black shadow effect on a light background.<br />

I'm Rey, a Community Expert willing to help the users.<br /><br />Yes, but we highly recommend using the power cable that came with your Surface because the time to charge with a USB-C cable can be very slow, depending on the power supply and cable youre using. <br /><br />Best Regards

<h2>            DVD drive showing up as a hidden device in the device manager</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a Dell Inspiron 15 laptop with a HL-DT-ST DVD+-RW_GU90N DVD/CD player. I was using it to play CD right this afternoon. But when i was to watch a movie on a DVD at night, it started to say that the location cannot be found. After a little look around
 online, i found my DVD drive ended up showing up as a hidden device in the device manager, also with the error message saying, "Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer. (Code 45)". I tried all the solution i can find online, but still
 no luck. I don't really want to change the reg keys unless i have to do so. So i'm just wondering does anybody know a better solution to this problem? Or let me know if you need more detail about my laptop before you can give me any suggestion. It's really
 frustrating now. </p>
<p>
Thank you all!</p>
