            <p>Hey there AdsorbenEye805.<br /><br />Sorry to hear about your troubles with Just Dance 2017. To start out, what type of storage device are you using to install the game? If you can, test a different storage device to see if there's any change.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 - USB 3.0 external HDD problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pavel adamek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 - USB 3.0 external HDD problem</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
I am the owner of &nbsp;Surface Pro 3 (running on Win 8.1). I have just purchased Kingston SSD to increase the storage capacity. I have the SATA to USB 3.0 adapter. However disc is not working properly, it is not either recognized by Windows at all or it is running
 at slow speed (USB 2) and keeps re-connecting. On my old laptop with Win 7 it works OK. I have also external USB3 WD MyPassport and it behaves in the same way.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
I read somewhere the Surface USB port doesn't have enough power to run external HDD, so I bought externally powered USB 3.0 HUB (I-tec). No improvement.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
It is difficult to describe the problem because it occurs randomly.</div>
<div>
- USB HUB is sometimes shown in Device Manager as Generic USB, sometime as SuperSpeed Generic USB (with Microsoft drivers). With Intel drivers it is sometimes recognized as USB 2 HUB, USB 3 HuB or both.</div>
<div>
- the disk itself is sometime mounted to USB3/SuperSpeed and works at full speed - this is very seldom and lasts only shortly - it disconnects after a while.</div>
<div>
- usually it is mounted to USB 2 (in Device manager) and works at the speed around 37 Mb/s</div>
<div>
- sometime it doesn't connect at all and windows shows the message "USB device not recognized"</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
I already tried:</div>
<div>
- to check if hdd works on another PC - OK</div>
<div>
- to connect the HDD directly to Surface USB port - same (not detected or as USB2)</div>
<div>
- to install WIN7 &nbsp;Intel drivers - the same problem</div>
<div>
- registry hack - didn't help</div>
<div>
- USB charging profile - not available on Surface</div>
<div>
<p>- BIOS check - Surface doesn't have BIOS</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
I am frustrated. I bought expensive SSD disc which is in the end slower than MyPassport. I have read all the related posts here but nothing worked for me.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
I will be grateful for every advise, suggestion.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>best regards</p>
<p>Pavel<br />

            <p>Hi Pavel</p>
<p>An external USB hard drive on my Surface Pro 3 would regularly disconnect and then there was no way to get it back except reboot. What fixed it was Devise Manager | USB and for each USB hub open and find Power Management tab. Uncheck 'let computer turn off
 device'. The drive no longer disconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't sound like all your problems, especially the USB2 speed. &nbsp;It may or may not help your case. &nbsp;It is all I can offer.</p>

                    <p>please put in some common sense features like update pause while gaming or else you may get a rant complaint like shown below in the immediate future thx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope gaming mode pauses all updates while gaming, microsoft you owe gamer's that consideration in the least because it was gamer's who fueled the progress of PC's especially on the graphics and hardware side and are a big reason other OS's are not
 spanking you good right now so get your **** together mmmkay put in some commonsense stuff and quit acting like aspies.</p>
<p>TYVM a sick of BS gamer either you are for us or against us pick and do it quick.<br />

            <p>Surely you must know that these are only community forums with no line to the MS Ivory Tower, and as an insider</p>
<p>I would expect that you are well aware that complaints to Monopoly$oft need to be made via the Feedback app,</p>
<p>or whatever other tool they provide insiders.</p>
<p>MS is not interested in 'common sense' . They are focused on consumer base dumbing Windows down,
</p>
<p>and marketing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe 'gaming mode' will have absolutely no connection with the reviled mandatory automatic update system.</p>
<p>Aside from some tweaking to better optimise cpu use Gaming Mode looks to be mostly another gimmick and marketing tool, and possibly something to further reduce PC gaming to a common denominator ( make PC more like consoles ),</p>
<p>but as an insider I expect you would already have the <em>Creators</em> update and would better know if there
</p>
<p>are any real benefits from Gaming Mode, than my speculation.</p>
<p>- While I am a gaming enthusiast, I don't have any illusion that gamers have had much impact on general computing. In fact PC gamers are only a small minority of gamers overall. Particularly those with high end gaming machines
</p>
<p>(the majority of PC gamers are women who play basic point and click games), which is one reason for so many console to PC ports.</p>
<p>Personally. I just wish MS, Steam, and the rest would stop fiddling around with stuff so much and let us get</p>
<p>on with our games. All I want it a stable OS and would prefer MS stop with the twice annually 'anniversary' BS.
</p>
<p>This will never happen of course, as this is part of their new marketing strategy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to the updates...</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have set Window updates&nbsp; <em>Active Hours</em> to correctly reflect the times I am using my machine, and have never</p>
<p>experienced a 'random' reboot.</p>
<p>You can also change the active time whenever you wish should your gaming routine change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The best protection against being interrupted while playing on line is to run Windows updates manually</p>
<p>(Single player - just disable internet).</p>
<p>Manual updating is also helpful for not having to wait for an update to finish installing when I want to shut my
</p>
<p>machine down, as I don't like to leave the machine until I know an update has not broken anything</p>
<p>(which they have not done... so far *knocks on wood*).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I sometimes create a new System Restore point before running Windows Updates (especially when Win10</p>
<p>has done one of it's mysterious <em>'Think I'll delete all restore points for my Human'</em> routine) .</p>
<p>When the anniversary update times roll around I go full Murphy's Law and clone my Windows to another HDD before doing the update as these can be particularly risky because they overwrite so much of Windows.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I like having a reliable easy fix in the event of these updates totally borking my Windows install.</p>
<p>Even though I've had no issues with the two previous anniversary updates, it will be a very long time before I&nbsp;</p>
<p>trust them. </p>
<p>
</p><p>.</p>

    <title>ISO image mounting problems under Windows 8 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> êºÒÉ  say:</h3>
<h2>            ISO image mounting problems under Windows 8 Pro</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I try to mount ISO with the inbuilt mounting of Windows 8 Pro it returns 'Couldn't mount &nbsp;file' 'Sorry there was a problem mounting the file' or 'The disc image file is corrupted'.</p>
<p>In some instances the file gets mounted nevertheless, but to discover it, I have to look at Computer where all drives are shown.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In either instances, whenever I drop an ISO, which contains audio from SACD or other media, in J River Media Center's 'Playing Now' field, it shows every single track of the disc image file and plays them nicely. So it does, even when burnt onto a DVD+R
 So, obviously, the ISOs are healthy and the problem should with Windows...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would be glad to hear from you on the matter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The file needs to be renamed to .exe on the Microsoft site.&nbsp; It's an executable, not an ISO
</p>
<p>(Visio 2013 64 bit English)</p>
</blockquote>
ok guys, I FOUND THE SOLUTION by accident.<br />
<br />
Here is how to fix the problem (at least it worked right away when i did it, so try it!)<br />
<br />
RIGHT-CLICK the image file in question (.IMG, .ISO, etc...) and choose a default program to open with. WIndows ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE the DEFAULT program to open image files. There is a unreported bug about Windows 8 explorer not being the default , therein
 not opening a valid, uncorrupted image file. &nbsp;YOU MUST set Windows Explorer as the default in order to mount image files as a virtual DVD drive in WIndows 8.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thats all, and I hope that this actually works for you. thanks! and if it works, please mark this as helpful to show your appreciation, since there is no kudos or thanks button. :D
</blockquote>
<p>Here what I did, eject SD card (you don't have to take it out of the computer).&nbsp; Try to mount again.&nbsp; I did this and it worked perfectly.</p>

            <p>Hi Timber71,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:
</b>Try performing SFC (System File Checker) scan on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:
</b>You may put your system in clean boot state (in normal mode) to troubleshoot the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in
<b>Step 7</b> in the above KB article.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 3:
</b>The issue could be related to drivers and could be resolved by updating the same. I‚Äôd suggest you to download and install the latest display drivers by visiting the manufacturer‚Äôs website. Download and install the latest Windows 7 compatible drivers and
 check if that fixes the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used Method 1 with no success.&nbsp; After reading the other response below, I skipped to Method 3 and re-installed AMD video drivers and that appears to have solved the problem.</p>

<h2>            How can i disable &#34;Windows update medic service&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I am suffering from windows update quite a lot and I am trying to disable windows update service all the time, but after each reboot it is running again as usual, so I wanted to disable windows medic service in order to prevent windows update service
 from coming to life over and over again, but whatever I try I get the message "access denied".&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that no windows user has full privileges over his windows, but could someone help me stop that service? I tried going into safe mode and some CMD commands I found, but none worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something else.. don't bother telling me that windows updates are vital to the smoothness of my machine or something like that. I know pretty well what they do and I don't want any of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Unable to remove debit card from account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kieranchilds_816  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to remove debit card from account</h2>
                    So recently I noticed that my cancelled gold subscription said that payment was due even though I cancelled a few days before, as there was no money available in my account it says i'm required to 'pay now' and shows no option to cancel the subscription.
 I tried removing my card to see if it would change anything and it just said I was unable to remove the card as it was in use even though I had cancelled the subscription. How do I remove my card without paying for the subscription. I've tried both online
 and on my xbox and nothing seems to works.

            You will most likely need to pay the past-due balance before you can remove the card from the account. You can do so

                    How can you prevent a Skype meeting from being forwarded to unintended attendees? Also, can you "mute" an attendee from the chat so that they are only able to read the chat and not send messages?

<p>Hi Andrea,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I put the two questions together to answer.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First, to prevent a Skype for business meeting from being forwarded&nbsp;to unintended attendees, it depends&nbsp;on how you invite people to join a Skype for Business meeting. If this meeting has a meeting link, anyone who knows
 this link can join from anywhere/any device. If a person join the meeting as a <strong>
Participant/Attendee</strong>, he/she can also invite anyone to this meeting via the button as below:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7327f6e5-9e3c-428a-b396-4af29efdb011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7327f6e5-9e3c-428a-b396-4af29efdb011" /></a></p>
<p>However, we can set options for online meetings and conference calls. For example, some people have to wait in the lobby until admitted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are setting up a large event or want to eliminate interruption, you can mute all attendees, disable meeting IM, or prevent them from using their webcam, by checking these boxes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable IM</li><li>Mute all attendees</li><li>Block attendees‚Äô video</li></ul>
<p>These settings apply only to attendees. As a presenter, you can always share audio in the meeting and video, if your account is enabled for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information, please refer to two articles below:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-options-for-online-meetings-and-conference-calls-dcd1ca39-0c1f-466c-9573-f04138fef5e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-options-for-online-meetings-and-conference-calls-dcd1ca39-0c1f-466c-9573-f04138fef5e2</a></strong></p>

<p>I believe that games stopped being added to that list in 2007, and then complete support was dropped in 2010 (as there was one more title added in 2010 which was Cars). Unfortunately it doesn't look like there will be anymore games added to the backwards
 incompatibility list. Sorry.</p>

<h3> xcyclonusx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do I need the game disc&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I understand that every game needs to be downloaded to the hard drive and I don't have a problem with that or the downloading wait time.&nbsp; But what's the point of it if I have to search for the game disk every time I want to play the blasted game?&nbsp; I bought
 the game, I DLed it to my hard drive, my external hard drive now that I paid for because my internal one was full, but now I have to find where my kids might have placed my game disk and hope they didn't damage it to the point of it not being readable just
 to play.&nbsp; Why can't you just make it possible for me to play from the hard drive any game I have already installed there.&nbsp; If it a matter of the cry-babys who didn't want the always one internet connection then reward those of us who do have an always on.&nbsp;
 The activation of the disk on the same Xbox can be easily confirmed and we can truly have our digital library of games available to us at anytime.&nbsp; As my family gets more and more XB1 games this is beginning to become a real point of contention with me.&nbsp; I
 already have my PC hooked to my television and it would only be a matter of putting my efforts of making it my media center over the XB1 to make a change in my house.</p>

<p>It's called Digital Rights Management (DRM)</p>
<p>What's from stopping you from giving the disc to a friend and letting them download the same game without paying for it?</p>
<p>Easy solution. Buy digital.</p>
<p>Xbox One's original policy would have allowed what you want but some cry babies with supposedly no internet connection couldn't check in every 24 hours.

<p>Hello "xI Cyclonus Ix" &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>Developers need to make money in order to survive.</p>
<p>Being able to install a game from a disc and play it from the HDD without any proof of ownership will make the developers lose money because that one disc can be passed around, making the initial purchase the only time that the dveloper made money.</p>
<p>Developers use the profits that they make towards their next project.</p>

<p>Holy hell you people I know about DRM and I fully support the idea when XB1 announced. &nbsp;For Christ sake this is MS they have been verifying software liscence against hardware for decades. &nbsp;Hence the reason I mentioned rewarding those of us that are always
 online. &nbsp;It would be a simple adjustment to verify the particular game disk against the hardware ID. &nbsp;This would make tradeing the games between friends impossible. &nbsp;And before you say people would find a way around it, those are the people who will find a
 way around anything MS puts up. &nbsp;MS sold the XB1 as more than a game console its now meant to be a media hub. &nbsp;That's what I want. &nbsp;What if MS required every Blu Ray that you wanted to play to be DLed to the HD and then required you to make sure the DVD was
 in the drive before your watched it. &nbsp;I have been with Xbox since the original. &nbsp;I don't own a PS and never intend to, but to be a true media center MS need to make it where anything we want is right there in the XB1. &nbsp;Game disks should not be the exception.
 Again so there is no misunderstanding I wanted the original DRM scenario. &nbsp;I don't loan or borrow game and it would have meant a drop in game prices over the long run. &nbsp;MS shouldn't have backed down to the PS troll who had no intention of ever buying an Xbox.
 SO don't preach to me about that. MS needs to move past the game disk requirement And no matter how careful you are repeated use will eventually damage the disks.</p>

    <title>Offline Files &#47; DNS issue&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sethar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Offline Files &#47; DNS issue&#63;</h2>
                    We are having a problem where files and folders are either completely disappearing from view on a network mapped drive, or showing up with grey X's on it.&nbsp; We have a GPO in place to "Prevent Use of Offline Files", "Remove 'Make Available Offline'" and
 "Prohibit user configuration of Offline files". &nbsp;<br />
<br />
When this problem happens, it lists the folder as "Offline".&nbsp; The server is pingable by name and IP.&nbsp; When I UNC path to the folder \\servername\share it has the grey X's over the files and folders, but when I go to \\10.1.0.1\share, the files are visible and
 the folder status is "online".<br />
<br />
I already tried the registry entry for formating the CSC database.&nbsp; Any other ideas?&nbsp; A reboot usually makes them work again for a while then randomly throughout the day they go grey X again.

            Sometimes a website will block all save page as, copy, paste, etc abilities from happening. Mostly to stop plagiarism. Sometimes there are extensions that will allow you to though that you might find.
