<h2>            What is the best way to access AOL Mail on Windows 8.1 &#63;</h2>
                    <ul>
<li>The built in Mail app. was cumbersome and unreliable. </li><li>The AOL App stopped working and I got conflicting&nbsp;information from AOL as to whether it is for Windows 8.1 or not (despite downloading it from Windows Store.
</li><li>I don't want to install AOL Desktop as it adds a layer of extra clutter as I recall from Windows XP days. Seems like the best solution is to access AOL Mail from the website in IE. Is that right ?</li></ul>
<p>Many thanks - Martin Y,</p>

    <title>News App Displaying Strange&#47;Irrelient News Articles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> s415  say:</h3>
<h2>            News App Displaying Strange&#47;Irrelient News Articles</h2>
                    <p>Since the 19th of April my News App (formally MSN News) on Windows 10 has been displaying strange results and completely irrelevant news articles, instead of ones I'd be interested in/need to know. A lot of the articles in my "Top Stories" and "My News"
 section&nbsp;are now clickbait, and I'm getting a lot of results from foreign countries I've never expressed an interest in (such as India), on topics I've never read before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An example is today's attack in Paris does not appear anywhere in my news feed, though I have random clickbait articles about&nbsp; shaving a dog (England) and Top Stories: Things that made news in the cricket world today (India). The sources these are coming
 from also seem to be different than what I've normally seen, with many unknown websites being cited.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My News Location/Edition is set to Australia (English), and it only happens when I'm signed in to my account. Signing out of my account displays news as I'd expect to it, as does changing my edition to United States (English). To try remedy the situation
 I've cleared all app data, uninstalled the application, performed a soft reset on my phone, as well as a hard reset. The issue persists across all my devices that are signed in with this Microsoft Account, including a Nokia Lumina 930, and Microsoft Surface
 Pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, the first news article in my "My News" tab is always devoid of any image, displaying just a red box. When finding the article in it's own tab it displays correctly. Images of Signed in vs Signed out News app provided below, taken at the exact
 same time.</p>

    <title>Loss of video signal when Windows loads- Vista - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrick36  say:</h3>
<h2>            Loss of video signal when Windows loads- Vista</h2>
                    <p>My stepson replaced my TV(RCA L26wd26d) with his TV(a 37"Vizio model) so I set up his on my computer, as I had mine set up. &nbsp;I do not remember if I had to change any settings when I did this. &nbsp;During the time his TV was serving as my monitor, I had to re-install
 Windows Vista on the computer. &nbsp;This process went without any problems. &nbsp;All was well. &nbsp;Then he moves out his TV and I replace it with original RCA TV that I was using before. &nbsp;But now when the computer starts up, the video signal is lost just before the sign-in
 screen. &nbsp; I've looked up this problem and I find nothing that helps. &nbsp;Other posts deal with a different OS. &nbsp;My display adapter is NVIDIA GeForce 6150SE nForce 430. &nbsp;This is an onboard device and not a card, so I am assuming that the system configuration should
 be set to ONBOARD and not PCI. &nbsp; I do not remember how it was configured before he swapped out the TVs, nor do I remember if I had to change anything when I connected his TV. &nbsp;Apparently I need a memory scan myself! Ha! &nbsp;Can anyone help me figure this problem
 out? &nbsp;Seems like it would be easy to figure out, but it AINT!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: &nbsp;I can boot in Safe Mode with no problem. &nbsp;And Device Manager shows the current display driver is in use. &nbsp;I can disable this device and boot successfully in Normal Mode. &nbsp;Not having knowledge about how this works, I am assuming that there is a default
 display device operating, since it still shows the display adapter is disabled. &nbsp;I do not know how these things work. &nbsp;But by the time I get this figured out, I think I will! &nbsp;So, my GeForce 6150SE is disabled, but the display signal is sent to the TV? &nbsp;Things
 seemed to be moving very slowly during the short time I left it disabled, so I enabled it again and rebooted. &nbsp;Back to the same "No Signal" message on my TV. &nbsp;So I rebooted in Safe Mode again and disabled the display adapter again. &nbsp;This time Windows started
 up until my desktop was up. &nbsp;Then it just went to a black screen, but not a loss of signal according to my TV. &nbsp;There was no "No Signal" message. &nbsp;Any suggestions short of tying a rope around it and using it as a boat anchor?</p>

            <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the problem is a certain resolution is set and that resolution is not supported by the monitor, so the system starts and works but the monitor shows "No signal".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press F8 at boot time and instead of "Safe Mode" choose "Enable low-resolution (640x480)" from the options. Windows will use your NVIDIA display adapter now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now change the resolution to a higher-one that works: right-click on a free area on your desktop-&gt;Personalize-&gt;in the new opened window, at the bottom click "Change desktop settings".</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>What is the F8 option? &nbsp;It does not exist on this system. &nbsp;F10 is Setup, F11 is System Recovery, F9 is Diagnostics, and Esc is Boot Options.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the resolution would not stick. &nbsp;It would automatically change back to the lowest resolution. &nbsp;I found that I had to disable the original display adapter and then manually install the NVIDIA drivers. &nbsp;Although I had completed the installation process
 after downloading the update, and the process said that the installation was successful, none of the updated drivers were being loaded. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I actually ended up doing is rolling back the original driver, then uninstall the display adapter. &nbsp;I'm assuming that that forced the system to search for a display adapter and use the updated version of the drivers. &nbsp;When booting in Safe Mode, the
 only driver that would be used is the VGA Safe driver. &nbsp;And the Device Manager would never find the drivers that the installation package showed were installed. &nbsp;That is because they were not installed. &nbsp;I had to manually run the setup program from the driver
 folder in the NVidia folder that was downloaded under C:. &nbsp;It had not placed them in the driver folder, as it should have, under C:/Windows/Sys32/. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received a warning message before the first installation attempt that installation would not be successful unless the original network(?) drivers were uninstalled first. &nbsp;And I chose the option to uninstall them. &nbsp;The program went through that process
 but did not ever installed the the updates. &nbsp;So, my original display adapter was being used until I uninstalled it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The TV is now working normally using the 1024x768 resolution setting, which would not work when I plugged the TV back in yesterday. &nbsp;I hope this all makes sense and is helpful with anyone left using Vista! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestion Sorin-Mircea Neagoe! &nbsp;Although I was not able to do as you suggested, I understood your suggestion and did it in Safe Mode, but it would not hold. &nbsp;But the uninstall and manual install of the updates did exactly what you were suggesting.

<h2>            I need expert help with windows 10 issues.  How do I get over their heads&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Have been to regular MS support 4 times....issues still not resolved...how do I get over their heads?</p>
<p>Every time they get into my computer remotely...more things get messed up.&nbsp; I have files and programs missing.&nbsp; Windows</p>
<p>file explorer closes at it's own whim.&nbsp; When I&nbsp;turn off my embroidery app windows 10&nbsp;closes everything.&nbsp; I would LOVE to go</p>
<p>back to windows 7 but they say I can't because it's been more than 30 days....wish I had known about that 30 day timeframe&nbsp;before the "upgrade"...I would&nbsp;have checked it out more thoroughly right away...as it was... I was busy with other things and didn't
 get to before the 30 days was up.&nbsp; Every time the tech's get into my computer I have more of my embroidery files lost or corrupted...they were fine BEFORE.
</p>
<p>Is there a way to get the tech's teacher?...this all started with a blue...then black screen.&nbsp; I couldn't turn off the computer...it wouldn't let me...I had to unplug it.&nbsp; I thought it was my computer and took it into the shop...80 bucks and 3 days later
 I got it back...but the very next day it did the same thing (blue screen)&nbsp; that's when I called MS the first time....that issue seems to be ok...but now I have all these other</p>
<p>problems to take it's place....If someone knows how to get a real MS expert...please tell me....I am so frustrated with this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For anyone out there trying to decide if they want to upgrade or not....wait...I sure wish I had.</p>

            <p>1.&nbsp; one problem now is windows file explorer doesn't give me an error code...it just shuts down...everything I have open.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I can't seem to get file explorer to open in 2 windows so I can sort&nbsp;and move files that are in my "download folder" (grrr that's another sore spot) to the correct folder in my embroidery folders. (which
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;File explorer is very slow and blinks a lot...then I &nbsp;have to redo what I was doing when it blinked...then finally it will close down&nbsp;anything and everything I have open...I will have&nbsp;a desktop...and have to reopen everything I was working on.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I have to "log in"....with a password every time I start the computer.&nbsp; Now that might not seem like such a big thing to you younger people...but my hands shake a lot in the mornings and it's hard to me to type until my pain pills kick in...but always
 before I could read my emails and check out some of my favorite web pages in the mornings...by clicking my mouse....now...I have to type in my "password" over and over...because I keep messing it up and hitting 2 keys at once....so I really HATE that I "have"
 &nbsp;to use a password....who decided that for me????</p>
<p>5 In Edge...a lot of my favorites are gone...and what was transferred is in alphabetical order...I had them arranged by type (embroidery pages/ thread pages/ sewing forums)....who decided&nbsp;that for me...why couldn't they have been transferred over exactly
 as they were????</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can go on...and on....but I'm tired of typing...send me your teacher.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Trouble shooting steps?...well...I've let your peers into my computer 4 times...before that...I hit control+alt+delete&nbsp; to try to get computer to give me a way to get into safe mode and may be restart...but that didn't work...that's why I had to unplug
 it and take it to the repair man....&nbsp; I didn't know it was windows and not my computer at that point....&nbsp;In fact none of the old commands that I have learned over the years seem to work on windows 10.&nbsp; So after unplugging all those wires in the back and putting
 the computer in the car ( desk top) and then in reverse going to get it and lugging it back in the house and plugging everything in again and it does the same thing the next evening...so that was my first call to your peers...I can't tell you what they did...they
 didn't really tell me...other than " we will fix this...we know about this issue"....hopefully they made notes...and the next time...and the next time....and the next time........ so after all those times in my computer....some of my files are corrupted....and
 some are missing...and my media player is gone...and my sound recorder is gone...and no telling what else is gone...I'll know when I try to do something and can't anymore...oh yes...my "program files"...can't find them...they are moved and not even where they
 were when I first got 10.....So .....</p>
<p>I appreciate you are so polite...but I want a guru at this point...I'm an old lady out of patience....I am also a broke old lady and I can't afford to replace what you guys have lost...and I definitely don't want to lose any more things...so....where is
 the guru...the teacher...the expert of all the other experts????&nbsp; That's who I want....please tell me how to get that person.</p>

            <p>I see you no one has responded to my reply....????&nbsp; You ask me to explain...I did...then nothing????&nbsp; Great going!</p>
<p>
</p><p>another thing....my cd player doesn't work anymore...it worked great BEFORE windows 10...now I can't play</p>
<p>a cd and all my back-up files...that I stored on cd's...can't use them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the blue screen last night again...and windows just quit working...I had to re-start...but that was good because
</p>
<p>at least I could do it.&nbsp; That was using "Edge"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer&nbsp;also shut down in file (windows)&nbsp;explorer...but just to my desktop and then I had to go open my files again and find my place...it did that over and over....</p>

            <p>You are kidding right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is an "ISO" image?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I follow all the steps you have written above...and the computer crashes...then what?&nbsp; I</p>
<p>think with trouble tickets listed below...this has been done several times including the</p>
<p>"new user" account&nbsp;that&nbsp;crashed that night...next day telephone support took it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;call to phone support ...I didn't get a ticket number...disconnected after about 1 hour working</p>
<p>&nbsp;in my computer...that was - &nbsp;Jake.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;call tic.# 1315765356 - Daisy</p>
<p>3. call tic.# 1315958602 - Albert</p>
<p>4. call tic.# 1316137578 - Elisa</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm asking....how do I get a teacher or expert?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am NOT an expert...just smart enough to know I need one now.</p>

            It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen crashes. 
<br />
<br />Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.

            Hi JacksonWaugh,
<br />Kernel-Power 41 (63) error mostly means the problem with power supply unit. Can you replace it for checking?
<br />Or carefully look at motherboard and PSU for leaked or swelled up capacitors (little barrels).

 if it does indeed happen though it may get me to buy the new console. I don't have a 4K tv and probably won't for a long time and don't remember name but someone at Microsoft was saying not to buy the Scorpio unless you have a 4K tv because you won't notice
 the benefits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I said that to my wife today that there is no point getting it unless we get a 4k TV. &nbsp;It didn't go over so well because we just bought a new TV at Christmas time. If I can get 1 for around 5 or 6 hundred I'll do it. I'll do it anyway. It'll just be a fee
 days of arguing over it lol</p>

<p>I recently bought a 55'' 4K TV, was £649 so thought why not. But it doesn't support HDR sadly so I still don't think I'll be getting the best out of the new consoles.
</p>
<p>Saying that though, even if you don't have a 4K TV there are still benefits like 60fps and overall better performance from games.

 Microsoft’s GM of Game Publishing Shannon Loftis said it was up to developers, whether they choose to go for the “very high-end 4K,” leaving owners of the original in the dust".</span><span><br />

<p>It would also leave everyone without a 4K television in the dust too. &nbsp;Maybe the 4K TV guys will subsidise them.</p>

<p>"These are most likely some VR games tbh..."</p>
<p>I would assume that VR games would have to be exclusive to the Scorpio. &nbsp;It would seem like the most logical reason to make it. &nbsp;To get in early in the VR game. &nbsp;</p>
<p>"When asked whether there would be some exclusive games for the Scorpio, Loftis said: "I don't know about that. &nbsp;Well see. &nbsp;It's up to the game development community what they want to do."</p>
<p>This statement tries to pass the issue on to the development community and take some pressure off MS. &nbsp;But, they put this out the One. &nbsp;And they are putting out this Scorpio upgrade. &nbsp;And they are NOT totally open. &nbsp;They have rules and restrictions already.
 &nbsp;They could require any non-VR games to run on both. &nbsp;Scalability in the graphics would be one way they could keep things running the same on both. &nbsp;Just allow one to have higher graphical settings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But then:</p>
<p>"After a storm erupted on Twitter following Loftis comments, the head of Xbox Aaron Greenburg said reports claiming confirmation of exclusives where "not true".</p>
<p>The thing is Loftis never said there where exclusives. &nbsp;So the reports are mostly just rumors. &nbsp;But these rumors seem to have legs on things like these. &nbsp;And with the system coming Holiday 2017 there has to be some dev work going on. &nbsp;Unless they are just
 going to launch and have the older games just work. &nbsp;And then the Scorpio get some games that take advantage of its hardware later. &nbsp;Even working on both consoles with just a graphical upgrade would require some hands on with the hardware. &nbsp;So, yeah, it is
 a little hard to believe that devs have not at least been given the specs to work on thing. &nbsp;That way they have a solid window to test in. &nbsp;</p>
<p>"A Microsoft spokesperson also added: All of your xbox one games and accessories are compatible across all Xbox One family of products including Xbox One, Xbox One S, and Project Scorpio."</p>
<p>Yeah, but the key here is that this could easily be referring to current games and accessories. &nbsp;I am sure some VR stuff, at least, will be Scorpio exclusive (understandable). &nbsp;Same with VR games. &nbsp;But I could see some devs. wanting to push 4k or even more
 intensive AI and Physics at 1080/60 that just cannot happen on the current One and maybe even the S model. &nbsp;Little bit of a touch situation here. &nbsp;Could be that everything will work. &nbsp;And it could with just logical things improved on the Scorpio making things
 more scalable. &nbsp;But it sounds like MS is going to use the "We left it up to the developers and they chose to move to the more powerful/newer hardware. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For me this is a very crazy time for gaming. &nbsp;Realistically hardware is about to make a nice jump to where 4k is viable at a decent price. &nbsp;VR is going to make a push and gaming and other industries will be the catalyst for that. &nbsp;So these older consoles
 are destined to fade quickly really. &nbsp;And MS/Sony had to know this going in. &nbsp;They just needed some hardware to fill the gap. &nbsp;I did not feel from the beginning we would get more than 5 years out of this hardware. &nbsp;And with the Scorpio/Neo it seems we will
 not. &nbsp;MS/Sony may push games for the older hardware for a year after Scorpio launches, which puts these older consoles at 5 years, but they will let the devs/pubs move on without pushing for older hardware support.</p>
<p>I would also not be shocked to see, especially with Scorpio/Neo playing the current games, many current console owners move forward. &nbsp;If a sizable group moves forward it will weaken the position of the current Xbox One and might just push MS to move forward
 faster. &nbsp; People have shown they are not against upgrading regularly so I doubt this upgrade will hurt. &nbsp;And look at the prices of something like the RX480. &nbsp;If what I have heard is correct then this Scorpio could be a decent price. &nbsp;If that $200 model can
 push 6.1 or so TFLOPS with some tweaking then I could see MS (will get a very nice discount over consumer prices) being able to push that at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>I will say that I would expect Scorpio to have GDDR5 and some better hardware interface specs. &nbsp;Need to improve certain bandwidth areas for the 4k and VR. &nbsp;But those improvements can and will, if devs chose to use those for "regular" games, push things past
 what the current One can do. &nbsp;And past the Xbox One S.</p>

<p>I guess,Windows 10 team are trying to sell a bit more Xbox one,until next year.</p>
<p>-VR games will be "exclusives" to Scorpio and i guess even without VR some games might be only available on Scorpio.</p>
<p>And 3rd party &nbsp;devs/Publishers might abandon very quickly current gen,a year or two after Scorpio release.</p>
<p>- Scorpio will runs games better even without a 4k TV.</p>
<p>Let's take Tomb raider (reboot) on Xbox 360.Now take Tomb Raider definitive edition on Xbox one ,play it at 720p and even at 720p,the game perform better on Xbox one.</p>
<p>Same with GTA V..</p>
<p>Their "you need a 4k tv speech" is just to bring some consumer to buy Xbox one S this chrismas and not wait until Scorpio release.</p>
<p>A speech that might change with the release of Scorpio.</p>
<p>(But of course,it will be even better on a 4K tv.</p>

<p>"Their "you need a 4k tv speech" is just to bring some consumer to buy Xbox one S this chrismas and not wait until Scorpio release."</p>
<p>Most definitely, although the S model might make a nice 4k blu ray player and they are sort high. &nbsp;Decent deal. &nbsp;But still, no way that the Scorpio will not play games better. &nbsp;Even if they look frame rate and stuff it would be missing those stutters. &nbsp;And
 it should upscale the image better than the current model does to 1080p if the game is not set to full 1080p from the start. &nbsp;Plus that dynamic scaling. &nbsp;The Scorpio would not need to scale at all at 1080p if it can handle 4k decently. &nbsp;But the original, and
 S model, will have to use that dynamic resolution setup that they are currently using. &nbsp;Feels like they might have been better off holding off an announcement and then launching this as the next console. &nbsp;And point out that games would continue to work on
 both for at least a year or 2. &nbsp;That would put the original at 5-6 years in by that time.</p>

<h2>            User.V2</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 7 ultimate 64 bit, on a wireless network with 3 other computers (1 with windows 7, 1Vista and 1 XP) I recently installed a Network Attached Storage, a couple days later I noticed that under OS/Users I have myusername and myusername.V2
 I don't know how or what created this, if it's safe or spyware or what. I didn't notice it until after I added the NAS and I think it has something to do with that. I deleted it and every thing was ok but I turned the computer off for more than a day and when
 I started it back up it took about 25 to 30 min. and when it was done the myusername.V2 was there again. Does anyone know what this is, can it hurt my system and what I can do about it or do I need to worry about it. The system is working fine, hasn't caused
 any problems, but I need to know.

<p><span>Hi ,</span></p>
<p><span>The user profile namespace used in Windows XP is identical to the one used in Windows 2000, making interoperability between
 the operating systems transparent. However, the significant changes in the Windows Vista profile namespace create a challenge. These significant changes prevent Windows Vista from loading user profiles from previous versions of Windows. Also, previous versions
 of Windows do not load Windows Vista user profiles. Therefore, Windows Vista roaming user profiles will add "v2" to the end of the profile folder. The "v2" is used to isolate Windows Vista roaming user profiles from roaming user profiles created by previous
 operating systems. You can find more information about user profile interoperability with Windows XP user profiles later in this document.</span></p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that when you download the language pack you get the error detail.</p>
<p>I recommend you to follow the methods given below.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Run <strong>Windows Update troubleshooter</strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows has an Windows Update troubleshooter that can fix some common problems with Windows Update.
</p>
<p><br />
a) Open the Windows Update troubleshooter by swiping in from the right edge of the screen,
<br />
</p>
<p>b) Click Search (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking Search),
<br />
</p>
<p>c) Entering Troubleshooting in the search box, <br />
</p>
<p>d) Click Settings, and then click Troubleshooting. <br />
</p>
<p>e) Under System and Security, click Fix problems with Windows Update.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>If the issue still persists please follow method 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
&nbsp;b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
&nbsp;c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.<br />
&nbsp;d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.<br />
&nbsp;e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.<br />
&nbsp;f) On the ‘StartUp’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.<br />
&nbsp;f) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Enable half of the services<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
&nbsp;b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.<br />
&nbsp;c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.<br />
&nbsp;d. Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.<br />
&nbsp;If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
&nbsp;If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Enable half of the Startup items <br />
</p>
<p>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.<br />
&nbsp;If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
&nbsp;If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
&nbsp;If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Resolve the problem<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem
 item.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 7</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</p>
<p><br />
Now try to download the packs and install the packs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3</strong>: Let us temporarily disable Windows firewall and Windows Defender and check if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Step 1</strong>: Disable Windows firewall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Press ‘Windows + W’.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Type ‘Windows firewall’ and press enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Select ‘Turn Windows firewall on or off’ and select ‘Turn off the Windows firewall’ for&nbsp; both ‘public network location settings’ and ‘private network location settings’.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Step 2</strong>: Disable Windows Defender.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a) Press ‘Windows + W’.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Type ‘Defender’ and press enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) Click on ‘settings’ tab and uncheck ‘Turn on real-time protection’.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Important Notice:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now try installing the packs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should help fix the issue,if still persists feel free to post, we are here to help you.</p>

                    <p>So my computer started restarting by itself all the time.<br />
So,I went to the event viewer which says things like The Peer Name Resolution Protocol cloud did not start because the creation of the default identity failed with error code: 0x80630801.<br />
and The Peer Networking Grouping service depends on the Peer Name Resolution Protocol service which failed to start because of the following error:

            A restore normally wipes out the previous installation and formats the hard disk. Usually, the best thing to do when you want to recover a system thats not booting is to perform a custom install and recover files from Windows.old.
<br />
<br />Check if they might be there.

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Did it now offer to let you save your files?  It's too bad you didn't ask because there's always a way to rescue files even if you have to make a boot disk.
<br />
<br />Check at C:\Windows.old to see if the old install is archived there with your files under your User account name.
<br />
<br />If not study the Users under C drive to see if your files might have migrated to a different account which   couldn't' start.
<br />
<br />Photo Gallery is an app that is no longer Supported in Windows 10.  It may not reinstall but you can try in Compatibiliity Mode:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 Photos app is about the same with some improvements.  
<br />
<br />Other tips here for setting up which includes everything that works best in Windows 10, in this gold standard Clean Install you might want to do some day if you want the very best install which is about the opposite of factory recovery:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            In general no you can't. There is a very small chance you can recover some files from before the new Windows install. There is some "undelete" programs that can rebuild files.   Here are some articles I've collected. Most are for files that simply have been deleted. You need to look explicitly  for a tool that says it can work on files after a Windows install or a re-format.  In other words, most of the tools listed here WILL NOT work for your problem  (I simply am too lazy to take the time to weed them out).

<br />&lt;snip&gt;  
<br />The product ignores file system, scans disk at physical level. It supports all versions of FAT and NTFS and regenerates files even from lost, deleted partitions, and from reformatted disks 
<br />&lt;/snip&gt;  
<br />I (rohn007) tried this tool (Office Regenerator). It claims to recover files from deleted file fragments. It seems to work. On my 100GB data partition it ran for about 1 hour and found 691 files, 450 MB, going back almost 7 months! I don’t remember if that was the last time I used a wipe freespace tool on my drive They definitely were not in my recycle bin.  Don’t do first auto run . The interface provides lots of Filter criteria such as: date created range, last saved range, last printed range, title, num pages, editing time, revision number, file type, author. 
<br />All of the recovered files I looked at were properly structured.
<br />Site has a 30 day moneyback guarantee. I haven’t tried the guarantee, but that sounds encouraging.

</p><blockquote>I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.
<br />
<br />
Did it now offer to let you save your files? It's too bad you didn't ask because there's always a way to rescue files even if you have to make a boot disk.
<br />
<br />
Check at C:\Windows.old to see if the old install is archived there with your files under your User account name.
<br />
<br />
If not study the Users under C drive to see if your files might have migrated to a different account which couldn't' start.
<br />
<br />
Photo Gallery is an app that is no longer Supported in Windows 10. It may not reinstall but you can try in Compatibiliity Mode:
<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a> <br />
<br />
The Windows 10 Photos app is about the same with some improvements. <br />
<br />
Other tips here for setting up which includes everything that works best in Windows 10, in this gold standard Clean Install you might want to do some day if you want the very best install which is about the opposite of factory recovery:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> <br />
<br />
You can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> <br />
<br />
Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most
 thoroughly. <br />
<br />
I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

I would like to say as a newcomer how impressed I was with the quick response to my question.&nbsp; Unfortunately I think I am a bit out of my depth here.&nbsp; If I was 60 years younger I might have a chance.&nbsp; I have gone throughthe 4 answers I received.&nbsp; I tried Recuva
 but didn't seem to be able to get anywhere.&nbsp; I tried windows old but got lost there.&nbsp; Many of my files I try to open deny me.&nbsp; I have tried to follow Greg but again I think I am out of my depth.&nbsp; I am a bit afraid of clicking on the wrong thing.&nbsp; I will keep
 trying but I wanted all those who were good enough to try to help me that I was not ignoring them,

            If the main issue is still the loss of your files and you found a C:\windows.old folder then let's focus immediately on that because your files should be in there and ready to be rescued, but the system may delete them within 10 days so we need to act now.  I will be here to help you as you go.
<br />
<br />Go to C:\windows.old and open the folder, then look for Users, then your User account from the previous install.  There should be all of your folders like Documents, Pictures, Desktop, etc.  What is the exact error when you try to open these?  The goal is to copy them out to an external, flash or CD/DVD, or at least into the new folders in the fresh install.  
<br />
<br />If there is any problem getting access to those files then install this shortcut to your right click Mouse menu:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>. 
<br />
<br />Now right click on each of those folders and choose to Take Ownership, let it complete, now try to open the folders and files again.  Once successful copy the contents of the folders to backup or to their new folders at the present C:\Users.  Here's a tutorial on how to copy large groups of files.  Please study it:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />I am waiting here to help you do these things, then we'll move on to the next thing that needs attention.

            I followed the instructions through windows old, got to my files I tried Pictures,Documents and Music.&nbsp; They wouldn't open so I downloaded the take ownership and opened them but all I got was&nbsp; desktop.ini.&nbsp; I did get some files on pictures but they were
 all empty.&nbsp; I notices that all these files were dated 21st Feb which I think is at the time I had my problem or just after. so I think these are not old windows. I don't know.

            You said you ran Dell Factory Restore, but did it offer to save your files like it should?   Some Dells customize the Windows 10 Reset to do the restore but it also always asks if  you want to save your files.  Did you see this option?  If so check at C:\Users if your old account or another account is present to look into it's folders to see if you find your files.  
<br />
<br />Do you have any old backups of your files at all, even a Windows image backup which can be mounted to access files?   
<br />
<br />Your files should always be backed up because the hard drive can die at any time.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  
<br />
<br />Or you can drag or copy them to a USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />A better file backup to external disk is free Macrium which is the choice of the experts:

<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>

<p>When Dell Backup and restore started I think it said it would take some time so I left it and when I returned it was all over.&nbsp; My computer was slow starting up this morning and suddenly The Dell Backup and Restore started up again so I quit it.&nbsp; Then it
 went into disc repair.&nbsp; It got to 30% and suddenly it all started up again.&nbsp; I have a Fixme stick which I thought would start me up if I had a problem.&nbsp; I have a 8GB Lexar pen drive attached to increase the amount of back up space as the amount provided by
 the computer is full but apparently there are none of the files that I want on it.</p>
<p>My music files I found some of them but not all.&nbsp; They show up but won't play.</p>
<p>I have 2 other computers Desktops.&nbsp; 1 is Windows10 and I can't find any pictures on that one either.&nbsp; The other desk top is one a friend upgreded to a windows7 It was a Vista but that crashed.&nbsp; My friend managed to save some of the stuff but it is so slow
 that I don't really use it now except to keep updating it.</p>
<p>I do have some of my photos on pen drives and many originals but of course I don't have any&nbsp; since I got a digital camera.&nbsp; I don't think i will be scanning anymore on as my HP G4050 scanner which is very good does not now work on Wndow10, though I was using
 it up until recenty.&nbsp; I have tried downloading drives for windows10 but no luck so far.&nbsp; I am afraid I am a bit of a lost cause.</p>

            Why don't you let us work with you so that you don't have to face this again, but even more you learn what works best so that you permanently become the master of your PC instead of feeling like a victim.  
<br />
<br />This can all be done in one shot by studying and preparing to do the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />It will make you permanently the master of your PC because you will know what works best and have applied it with your own hands.  
<br />
<br />As to the printer/scanner, Many reports of failed printers after Version Upgrades.  Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall the printer software.    
<br />
<br /> 3) Next copy and paste in Start search box:  printui /s /t2     (Note that there is one space before each forward slash).
<br />
<br /> 4) Right click result to Run as Administrator.   
<br />
<br />5) Open the Print Server properties, Remove the printer’s drivers for this printer and for any other printers you don't use presently.  If you get a message about access denied or the printer being in use and you cannot find the driver or any installed program that would account for this, you may restart the computer in a diagnostic startup and then use the printui  command to remove the driver package(s): <a href="https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-diagnostic-startup-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-dia...</a>
<br />You must restart back to normal mode before you will be able to install the printer again.  
<br />
<br />6) Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the printer to delete the Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />7) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />
<br />8) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the procedures I followed:</p>
<p>1)</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open Administrative Tools by clicking the <span>Start</span> button <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%2520Vista%2fmain%2f4%2ff%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33.png" />, clicking
<span>Control Panel</span>, clicking <span>System and Maintenance</span>, and then clicking
<span>Administrative Tools</span>.</span></li><li>
<p>Double-click <span>Services</span>. <span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%2520Vista%2fmain%2f1%2f8%2f18abb370-ac1e-4b6b-b663-e028a75bf05b%2f18abb370-ac1e-4b6b-b663-e028a75bf05b.png" /> If you are prompted for an administrator password or
 confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Right-click the <span>Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS)</span> service, and then click
<span>Properties</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <span>General</span> tab, next to <span>Startup type</span>, make sure that
<span>Automatic (Delayed Start)</span> is selected. If it is not, select it and then click
<span>Apply</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Next to <span>Service status</span>, check to see if the service is started. If it is not, click
<span>Start</span>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>These options were already ticked when I went to check this anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)</p>
<p><span>Windows</span> provides a built-in troubleshooter that can automatically find and fix some common problems with
<span>Windows</span> Update.</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Open the <span>Windows</span> Update troubleshooter by clicking the <span>
Start</span> button <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%25207%2fmain%2f4%2ff%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33.jpg" />, and then clicking
<span>Control Panel</span>. In the search box, type <span>troubleshooter</span>, and then click
<span>Troubleshooting</span>. Under <span>System and Security</span>, click <span>
Fix problems with <span>Windows</span> Update</span>.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>When I type "troubleshooter" in the CP searchbox nothing is found, there is also nothing called "System &amp; Security"
</span></p>

    <title>Superfetch precaches &#34;Command &#38; Conquer&#34; and &#34;Supreme - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> setsunaaa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Superfetch precaches &#34;Command &#38; Conquer&#34; and &#34;Supreme Commander&#34; BEFORE logon</h2>
                    Vista 64, 4 GB, 6 GB swap, Quad core, more than one hard drive.<br />
Vista is installed for 4 month, works well enough so I won't go back to XP.<br />
Two month ago I saw superfetch precaching unneeded file for bootup, making the bootup process slower, so I changed in the registry "EnableSuperfetch" to 2, (= boot files only), which helped by that time.<br />
At the 30 of December I saw (using perfmon.exe and boottrace) it prefetching "Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour" and "Supreme Commander" files BEFORE logon, and rattling on the harddrive DURING logon on those files instead of taking care of Virus Scanner,
 Realtek-Audiomanager etc.<br />
My Autostart part is very clean, there are not even icons on my desktop for those two games.<br />
I did not use som strange "Vista Optimizer" tools, everything I changed was under my own control.<br />
<br />
What I saw in perfmon (after logon):<br />
svchost.exe (LocalSystemNetworkRestricted) accessing "G:\Supreme Commander" + "G:\Command &amp; Conquer The First Decade\Command &amp; Conquer(tm) Generals Zero Hour", all subdirectories, not linear, multiple files at the same time.<br />
Those two add up to about 9.7 GB, more ram than I have (real + swap make up 10 GB).<br />
So, Superfetch worked fine for first two month, then I had to restrict it to "boot files only", and now two more month later Superfetch runs HAVOC precaching Gamedata files before logon, trying to precache 9.7 GB of data.<br />
<br />
The Superfetch service is set to "manually" now, but I would like to reenable it. If it works the way as expected it is great, but how can I configure more precisely what is is allowed to precache during boot and what not? Where is the information stored what
 files to precache?<br />
Why does it even with "superfetch=2" precaching files like:<br />
"G:\Supreme Commander\gamedata\*.scd" = 1.93 GB.<br />
"G:\Supreme Commander\movies\*.sfd" = 2.3 GB<br />
etc etc etc (lots of examples).<br />
<br />
Please help, Superfetch worked so fine, but now it runs amok, even when I start the service manually it does again do the same stupid thing, reproducable.<br />
<br />

<div>Hi Set,<br />
<br />
I just wanted to verify that you changed <b>both</b> EnableSuperfetch <b>AND</b> EnablePrefetcher as your original post indicated that you had only changed
<b>one</b> key (EnableSuperfetch) and had not changed EnablePrefetcher.<br />
<br />
No harm done, since I work in the computer department I understand why you ask so specific, there is often a difference between what the user says and what he did.<br />
<br />
Do you know where superfetch stores it's information?<br />
<br />
My current info / trace is that it is five files:<br />
C:\Windows\Prefetch\AgAppLaunch.db<br />
^^ contains some readable string, including supreme command and C&amp;C<br />
C:\Windows\Prefetch\AgGlFaultHistory.db<br />
^^ contains unreadable data except for "MEMO" at the beginning.<br />
C:\Windows\Prefetch\AgGlFgAppHistory.db<br />
^^ contains unreadable data except for "MEMO" at the beginning.<br />
C:\Windows\Prefetch\AgGlGlobalHistory.db<br />
^^ contains unreadable data except for "MEMO" at the beginning.<br />
C:\Windows\Prefetch\AgRobust.db<br />
^^ contains some readable string, including supreme command and C&amp;C<br />
<br />
When I delete those files while the service is stopped superfetch behaves "normal" again, Vista ist fast.<br />
I suspect it will do it for a few weeks until it runs havoc again, then I have to kill those files again.<br />
<br />
This is not a good solution, but a working one, I hope MS has already adressed this in SP2 or in a hotfix so superfetch does not run havoc or we have more control over its fetching parameters (i.e. which&nbsp; drives / directories to include or exclude, either via
 cmdline/powershell tool or a .mmc).<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What happens when you try to open it?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you receive any error message?</span></p>
<p><span>You have to look for causes and become a detective when software doesn't function.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Possible causes are:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Corrupt file download
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Security software prevents activation.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Clashes with another software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1: I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the software.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Check if you are able to start the program in Clean Boot.</span></p>
