    <title>Install win8 after ssd Upgrade, but key is &#39;injected&#39; into - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Install win8 after ssd Upgrade, but key is &#39;injected&#39; into motherboard.</h2>
                    I just bought a dell inspiron laptop (win8.1), and an evo ssd. &nbsp;I swapped out the 5400rpm hdd with the ssd and now I need to install win8. &nbsp;The problem is that Dell 'injects' the activation key into the mother board and the installation usb I made for
 win8 will not let you do the install even as a trial unless you have a key. &nbsp;So I'm running in circles, and Dell support said contact MicroSoft support. &nbsp;Before I start down that path I wondered if there were any trial installs of win8 that would let me do
 the install to get online and let the laptop activate win8 automatically for me. &nbsp; Thoughts and suggestions?

            No, I made the usb using an iso of win 8 standard, the same version the laptop came with. &nbsp;With the expectation that the activation key would be physically on the laptop somewhere. &nbsp;Its been a couple years since I bought one, but they have always be obtainable
 before. &nbsp;By not giving the key it is impossible to upgrade the HDD of these laptops by normal means.

            Won't work. The Windows 8.0 that came with your computer is different and is the only version that will work.&nbsp; &nbsp;Hope this helps and if you need any further assistance post and we will be glad to help you.

    <title>Could I possibly get this Gamertag&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Could I possibly get this Gamertag&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Well, long story short I had the gamertag Trojan iLy changed it someone took it when I went to changed it back, changed it to MLP iLy and now am clueless for a good Gamertag...</p>

<p>I have always wanted the GT Trojan...and if you look here:&nbsp;https://live.xbox.com/en-US/Profile?gamertag=trojan That account is inactive and is not currently in use. Therefore I was thinking to myself since its been inactive for some time that an XBL staff
 member might be able to reset the account so that I could get the gamertag? I would seriously have a emotional melt down if they did.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So thank you for reading this and if any staff member reads this please reply with answer? Please and Thank you</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>there is no way to get that gamertag untill that is still in use, even if it has been inactive.</p>
<p>Once every several years, Microsoft releases any gamertags that aren't used anymore, due to bans etc.</p>
<p>But I wouldn't wait for that.</p>
<p>Other then that there is now way somebody could reset the account or let you get that gamertag. sorry</p>

                    I've looked all over the internet, and even posted an earlier question with no answer. There is no end to this stupid networking error.&nbsp;
<div>Please, any techs that see this, ask for ANY and ALL DETAILED info you need to correctly answer and solve my dilemma. ALL OTHER SOLUTIONS IN OTHER THREADS AND OTHER WEBSITES DO NOT WORK. So, be creative and think harder here, because you have a new problem
 in town.</div>
<div>Again, please ask for any/all needed detailed info so you can help me figure out what's wrong with this. I can give you hosts files, ipconfig dumps, netsh dumps, etc. you name it and i'll retrieve it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Oh, and one more thing, this is NOT a regular problem that would usually be the result of a "stupid" user. No troubleshooters or MS help pages will do a damn thing here.&nbsp;</div>

            Ok, I have not changed anything to the system prior to the issue, but I did change USB wifi adapters, so that might be one thing to test.&nbsp;
<div>2. I get the error message whenever i try to access another computer in the network, or even when i try to access a shared folder on the same local PC.</div>
<div>3. The exact error message is as follows (and this is trying to access another computer on the network, that is visible under "Network") window title: Network Error</div>
<div>1st message: "Windows cannot access \\ACER-PC"</div>
<div>2nd message (same window): "Check the spelling of the name. Otherwise, there might be a problem with your network. [Not.*] To try to identify and resolve network problems, click Diagnose.[already done that countless times**]"</div>
<div>3rd message: "Error code: 0x80070035, The network path was not found [i have no idea why it cant find it when it can see it]"</div>
<div>And the button options are "Diagnose" and "Cancel".</div>
<div><br />
<div>*Every computer in the house can connect to each other and access their shares. Not a single problem with my main network.</div>
<div><br />
<div>**The trouble shooter always comes up with nothing. Can't identify the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>in response to Method 1, i've already done that countless times as i've just said.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>in response to Method 2, i've booted into safe mode with networking and it doesnt work at all. cant see any PC's because some services are disabled, im guessing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>in response to Method 3, I've of course already done that. It leaves me nowhere as a result. Nothing different.</div>
<div><br />
<div>in response to Method 4, I've already updated my wireless drivers, and before/after the update the hardware reported no problems what-so-ever.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, I did change the wireless adapter, i'll try using the old adapter and see if that works. (both adapters are N, one is netgear, the other is belkin. belkin is what i currently have.)</div>

I actually just have windows firewall. I've even turned it off and that didnt work.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I'll try method 2. I havent done much with resetting windows socket(s). I think i did a command to clear something with netsh though.</div>

            Ok, as i was looking through method 2, I am doing the "msinfo32" thing and i've come across something.&nbsp;

<div><span>Those are missing from System Information&gt;Components&gt;Network&gt;Protocol</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>everything else is there (including ones that pertain to IPv6)</span></div>
<div><span>I'll do the fix for that, and try it. It looks like that might be the main problem because NetBIOS plays a big role in SMB
 server sharing.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>One other thing, it mentions that this could be caused by proxy software. If thats the same as VPN/Tunneling software, then
 I have Hamachi and Tunngle installed, but adapters disabled. All adapters except for the wifi are disabled (including the virtual box host adapter)</span></div>

            <p>Thankyou for your reply Anusha Verma. The event log Microsoft-Windows-Shell-Core/Operational has added many informational entries at each logon (more entries than any other event log) since I updated to Windows 8.1 with no errors or warnings. The system
 works&nbsp;well, but&nbsp;I asked the question because I have learned that generally&nbsp;by eliminating uneccessary events, system performance improves. However, the events listed in this event log appear to come from a source that I can't locate any adjustable area for.
 Since most of the events are about functions I am not using on my computer I was asking if there was any area (I.E. registry key or value) that might disable these seemingly&nbsp;uneccessary operations that occur at every logon. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Dana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update. </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you facing any issues while working on the PC except looking at Event logs?</li></ul>
<p>Event logs are special files that record significant events on your computer, such as when a user logs on to the computer or when a program encounters an error. Whenever these types of events occur, Windows records the event in an event log
 that you can read by using Event Viewer. Advanced users might find the details in event logs helpful when troubleshooting problems with Windows and other programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Event Viewer tracks information in several different logs. Windows Logs include:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p><span>Application (program) events.</span> Events are classified as
<span>error</span>, <span>warning</span>, or <span>
information</span>, depending on the severity of the event. An error is a significant problem, such as loss of data. A warning is an event that isn't necessarily significant, but might indicate a possible future problem. An information event describes the successful
 operation of a program, driver, or service.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Security-related events.</span> These events are called
<span>audits</span> and are described as successful or failed depending on the event, such as whether a user trying to log on to Windows was successful.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Setup events.</span> Computers that are configured as domain controllers will have additional logs displayed here.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>System events.</span> System events are logged by Windows and Windows system services, and are classified as error, warning, or information.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Forwarded events.</span> These events are forwarded to this log by other computers.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Applications and Services Logs vary. They include separate logs about the programs that run on your computer, as well as more detailed logs that pertain to specific Windows services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are facing any issues while working on the PC, we'll be happy to fix it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            <p>Thankyou for your reply Niranjan Manjhi. I'll assume at this point that this log is simply reporting operations that are not better adjustable than how I've already adjusted them since there are no errors or problems. If anyone has anything more to share
 on this event log, feel free to reply. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Xbox One X &#40;2-5tb HDD&#47;1-2tb SSD&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I know it has been said by so many fans at this point but I feel like it has fallen on deaf ears so I want to say it again. The Xbox One X needs a larger I'm out of space be it a larger hard drive or a solid state drive. a single terabyte of space is not
 really enough to hold enough of a library especially when they are constantly advertising Game Pass. something where you should be able to download a lot of games at a single instance but instead you cannot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I myself I'm not subscribed to Game Pass and even though I have been gicen countless trails for it I never make use of them. It is an amazing program and I know that a lot of people appreciate being able to play a lot of games for dirt cheap but I just
 kind of want to buy my games at full price for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting off topic. I tend to lose my train of thought easily so let me get back on topic. The Xbox One X needs a larger amount of save space. I have a limited edition Crimson Gears of War Xbox One S. It has two Terabytes of HDD space. I have 60 something
 games installed. I play all of them and I only have about 90gbs left and I'm probably going to use a good chunk of that redownloading Prey.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd have upgraded to the X on day one had it being able to match or out match my S' HDD space. But it didn't. So I waited thinking that they would release a model with more space. They have had to do so. Now I have access to 3 PS4s and one of them is a Pro.
 I don't like how the controllers feel though even though I do want to play Spider-Man. Sony controllers just aren't for me. I have a Nintendo Switch in that works because the controller is almost identical to the Xbox. All I play on it as smash 5 but still.
 And even with all of these systems I still find myself wanting to play Xbox over them most of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to get an X so I can experience it's amazing graphical and processing power. But I am not about to half the amount of games I can have on it at any given time. I don't want to have to have to constantly make decisions about what I want to play
 and constantly uninstall things. I want everything that I want to play to truly be at my fingertips at any given moment. And with my Xbox One S that is my reality but if I upgrade to the X it will no longer be so. And don't want to have to get an external
 drive just to have the same amount of space as my less powerful system.</p>
<p><br />
So how is everyone else feel with the Xbox One X? Do you have one? are you liking me where you had a version of a previous model that has more hard drive space? And if so what made you jump to the X when you would have to pick and choose what to install? Is
 the graphical power really worth the lack of choice? I don't think so but ond just one person. I want to know what everyone else thinks so that Microsoft can know what everyone else thinks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So feel free to share your thoughts.</p>

            I have two external HDDs giving me a further 6TB of space, 7TB including the internal. I can't see where the issue lies, as there is the ability to expand with USB 3.0 HDDs.

            Also, imagine how much more expensive the console would be. The Xbox branded external 2TB hard drive is overpriced as it is. It's cheaper to just get another external hard drive.&nbsp;

</blockquote>
<p>Back when I got it it wasn't too much more expensive than a regular Xbox One S but I got it before it was discontinued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to others I do know that there are a lot of external drives available I'm just saying they shouldn't be necessary.</p>
<p>But I do respect the input of everyone here and I have considered external drives I just feel that again that they shouldn't be necessary.</p>

            I have a library of 252 games, currently taking up 4TB of space. I would say the ability to expand by USB 3.0 HDDs is a fantastic asset. It means I can play any of my games whenever I want. I truly can't see an Xbox being made, this generation with that
 size of internal storage.&nbsp;

            The size of the internal HDD is enough to get started however it will likely never be enough for a serious gamer. I added dual 3TB Seagate's to my Xbox One when the option became available, one to use and one to backup. I eventually filled the 3TB HDD
 and upgraded to dual 8TB Seagate's with two built-in USB 3.0 ports.

            I guess Im not seeing the issue. The OP says theres a lack of choice when being able to bring your own HDD and plug it into a system is the exact definition of having a choice. Id rather use a HDD I have lying around than buy a more expensive console.

<p>Plus, having your games and apps on external drive makes an upgrade path a lot simpler. When I upgraded from my original Xbox One to Xbox One S and then to Xbox One X, I only had to remove my external HDD from older console and attach to new one. All my
 games and apps were ready without the need of downloading and installing them again.</p>

<p>I bought the XBOX One X and it didn't come with enough disk space.&nbsp; 1 TB of included space is consumed too quickly, and this version should have come with at least a 2 TB drive.&nbsp; No one wants to waste time uninstalling and reinstalling games or waiting to
 download them, and the only cure for that is to have an external HDD sitting on my entertainment stand attached to the XBOX.&nbsp; Now some might argue that you could open the XBOX and replace it with a larger drive, but not all gamers are technically minded enough
 to do this.&nbsp; I know some have considered the lack of internal storage a non-issue based on ability to expand with external, but for me, it's also an aesthetic issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now looking ahead, with project Scarlett, I believe that Microsoft should consider using some form of Fuse Drive software which will give the benefit of fast solid state loading times and the flexibility of having more storage.&nbsp; I think that many gamers
 would appreciate something like 1 TB M.2 fused with at least a 2 TB drive.&nbsp; It works with PC's and it should work with the future XBOX.</p>

<p>Barb,&nbsp; This printer is used in my homegroup network and is physically, through USB cable, attached to my Surface Pro4.&nbsp; It is still offline on the Surface Pro4 and, of course still not connected to homegroup.&nbsp; I purchased a new USB cable but that didn't
 make any difference.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I usually connect all my accessories devices, etc. through a 10-port hub.&nbsp; All my devices but the printer work OK.</p>
<p>I reinstalled the printer and driver.</p>
<p>Sorry I couldn't reply earlier to your question "is it a network printer or is it attached to a different computer that is shared?", but for some reason I could not access this site on Sunday afternoon and didn't have time yesterday to pursue this problem.&nbsp;
 I hope you can help.&nbsp; I had this problem a few months ago but resolved it by doing what you have suggested this time.&nbsp;

            <p>I purchased the Surface Pro4 last year, and nothing but programs after problems.&nbsp; My network printer constantly went offline!&nbsp; We tried EVERYTHING possible, re-install, delete printer everything.&nbsp; The work around is to send files to my phone and have my
 phone print.&nbsp; One day, the printer came online magically and then it went offline again.&nbsp; 3 hours later, it is offline AGAIN!

<p>do the simple things first. try uninstalling and reinstalling your Black ops 2 disc if you had it installed to the hard drive before, from the dashboard go to settings&gt;system&gt;memory&gt;highlight hard drive&gt; Y-button&gt; clear system cache to redownload game updates
 that may have corrupted, if not then it may be a bigger issue with your profile</p>

            <p><span>Hi Audrey,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your description, I assume you was trying to send IMs to external contacts, right? If so, Id like to confirm if youre using Skype for Business Online services included in Office 365 or Skype for Business/Lync on-premises services?
 If the former, please refer to the <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Let-users-contact-other-Skype-users-08666236-1894-42ae-8846-e49232bbc460?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> to turn on external sharing for your tenant, wait for some time to let the feature takes effect and then check if the issue persists(<strong>Please note:</strong> You need an administrator account for the steps).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, if the issue persists, Id like to collect the following information for troubleshooting:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>In the Skype for Business client, click the gear icon &gt; <strong>
Help</strong> &gt; <strong>About Skype for Business</strong>, let us know its detailed version.</span></li><li><span>Which kind of contact did you try to send IMs to, Skype for Business users of another organization, Skype users or any other users?</span></li><li><span>A screenshot of the error message for analysis.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any updates will be appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Aaron</span></p>

<li><span>If youre using the custom domain, please refer to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2566790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

This will help us identify if the issue is related to settings of specific Skype users.</span></li><li><span>Try logging into Skype using a Microsoft account(For example,

                    I have an apple superdrive that I'm trying to use on a thinkpad with windows 7 pro, but it will not take the dvd. When you go into devices and removable storage I can right click and eject the dvd, but still it will not accept the dvd when I try to insert.
 DO I need to use bootcamp?

<h2>            &#34;Windows Media Player encountered a problem while playing the file.&#34;</h2>
                    So, I just recorded a video with my recording program. Then when I tried to play the clip, I got the message:&nbsp;"Windows Media Player encountered a problem while playing the file." This has never happen before. I tried to download a Codec Pack but it didn't
 work. So what can I do to fix this? The file is a .mp4 and the size of it is only 399MB but it should be around 5-10GB because I recorded for about half an hour (with 60fps).

<h2>            My screensaver Windows 7 has stopped working</h2>
                    <p>On New Years Eve I did a full recovery of my ASUS K55A and downloaded all updates
</p>
<p>The screen saver Bubbles was working fine.</p>
<p>Over the next few days I had more updates and yesterday I noticed that the screensaver has stopped working.</p>
<p>I am running Windows 7 Home Premium, , 64bit SP1, </p>

<p>I would appreciate some help getting this working again.</p>

            No other screensaver works.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was working fine till about the 4th Jan 2014.<br />
I did a restore factory settings on NYE at ASUS suggestion as the Screensaver had stopped working and that was their fix .... but after installing all my programs and WU &amp; MSUpdates ... screensaver has stopped again.<br />
<br />
I have attached a snippet of my history - it seems MSE updates are the only ones installed since it has stopped working.&nbsp;
<b>But would this be the problem?</b><br />

<br />
Test shows Bubbles on the screen.<br />
Installed and waited&nbsp;&nbsp; . . . . nothing happens.<br />
<br />
Also have been reading others with similar problem and have now noted that sleep mode / hibernation do not work either - with AC power / Battery mode.<br />
So even if screensavers are out of date&nbsp; . . lol - the system is not working correctly .<br />
<br />
I have also run the Microsoft Fix It for - screensaver/control panel and also had it check hibernation and turn it on.&nbsp; It found no problems in either case !!<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok I get it screensavers are old school - Windows 7 has great Themes that change and do the same job really so I can live with out screensaver.... HOWEVER my sleep mode is not working and that is important for battery life . . .&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So Ramesh lets focus on getting that working shall we please . . . <br />
<br />
Thank you ::-)<br />
