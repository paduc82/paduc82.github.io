disable windows defender before installing 8.1 and make sure to do all updates while still in windows 8, before installing 8.1<br />

            Apparently the same error code happened with the preview if there were any corrupt Modern apps installed on the computer. Since the 8.1 upgrade deletes all the Modern apps you have installed, perhaps uninstalling them all first might clear things to let
 the upgrade through. Or at least identify any corrupt or no-longer-available apps and delete them.<br />
<br />
I'm going to try that myself, since I am having the same problem as you (except it gets to 90%) and can't find any other explanations either.<br />
<br />
<b>UPDATE 2013-10-19 20:43 ET:</b> No good. Failed again at the 90% mark (after 7 and a half hours of tedious wait, including over an hour at "Set up a few more things" stuck on 89%), and now I get to watch my laptop roll back everything, again. This has to
 be the most buggered SP release I've ever seen Microsoft do.<br />

            Same error codes at "Setting up a few more things 78%." I tried unplugging all USB devices and updating my display drivers. Also installed all games. Same error every time at same place.

 not at all surprising that Microsoft would screw up the Windows 8.1 rollout. What is frustrating is that I have NO INFORMATION regarding what the problem is other than the 14 digit hex-code it gives me when it apologizes for not being able to complete the
 update. It reminds me of the "Guru Meditation" errors I used to get from my Amiga 500. Man, we've come a long way in 25 years, haven't we?</font></div>

            So it's been ten days now, and I guess I thought there would be tons of people experience my same problem and same error code and workarounds by now. Anyone know if Microsoft has 1) acknowledged lots of upgrade problems and/or 2) has any plans to address
 them or provide some diagnostic tool to determine what is causing the upgrade to fail or what the codes mean?

VPN software should be uninstalled prior to running the update, it needs to be installed after 8.1 has loaded

<h2>            Lenovo Windows 7 Laptop screen blank ...external monitor works</h2>
                    Not sure if I should ask this here...but..I have a lenovo WIndows 7 64-bit laptop. Suddenly two weeks ago, the screen went black...It was working fine until I just barely touched it to adjust the angle and the screen went off. On startup, I can very very
 VERY faintly see the Thinkpad logo then nothing more. Took it to repair shop, first they thought it was a backlight issue but a new OEM screen didn't fix the problem. They now say it's probably the motherboard.&nbsp; New MB costs as much as the computer (it's obviously
 OOW). It works fine with an external monitor, tho that kind of defeats the purpose of the laptop. Just want an opinion..is this really most likely the MB or could it be something else? Thanks for any and all info.

What sort of removable drive do you have connected?&nbsp; Perhaps a printer that can read SD cards - or a monitor?

<h2>            Lock options and other weird things are missing</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>very odd thing happened in the last update and I am at a loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. My computer no longer requires me to enter my pin when I start my lap top from sleep mode. It is still a requirement when I start up from having turned it off completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When I alt+ctrl+del there are NO OPTIONS available (except "cancel"). No lock screen, task manager, nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Hitting the windows + L keys does not lock my computer any more. It used to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps taken:</p>
<p>1. I tried checking account options. All boxes that need to be checked to enable a lock screen for my account are indeed checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I tried going to the local group dealy but that is not available on my computer. It doesn't seem to exist. I tried typing in gpedit.msc into the run box and was told that there is nothing on my computer like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No idea what's going on, but I would very much like to get my options back: ie get my lock screen working again and restore the options available when I alt+ctrl+del. I have scoured google and cannot find any information on this particular situation.</p>
<p>Any help is much appreciated</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi Raymond,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. My computer does not have any other accounts. I could always create a new one and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. There have been no other hardware or software changes to my computer; I did just check for updates and there was on so I ran it in hopes that it would fix the problem but it did not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. My computer is an HP Pavilion Notebook, less than 1 year old.</p>

<p>I ran the DISM and then the SFC Scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The restore program completed successfully. I ran the scan which did not find any integrity violations. I then went to windows update to check for updates and it said my computer was up to date...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still don't have any options available to me when I alt+ctrl+del, nor can I lock my computer when I'm away from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to run task manager, and it said that Task Manager was disabled by my administrator... I am the only user of this computer and I did not disable task manager.</p>
<p>So I'm still left wondering what is going on here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I google this type of issue, it tells me to run gpedit.msc but my computer tells me that gpedit.msc does not exist.</p>

    <title>Problems after Creator update on tablet&#47;laptop with Intel Atom - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roachiebadmood  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems after Creator update on tablet&#47;laptop with Intel Atom processor</h2>
                    <p>This is a long and sad saga......</p>
<p>I'm an Australian living and working in Turkey /i purchased a locally manufactured tablet/laptop a Casper Nirvana N310. Recently I was prompted to update to the Fall Creator Update....... Instantly I lost controls for Sound and Brightness, I also lost the
 Power icon in the system tray, everything has slowed down considerably, its HORRIBLE. Searching for solutions I found out that INTEL no longer has compatibility at all with Windows 10. Even the manufacturer who incidentally is still selling the device with
 Windows 10 pre-installed, admits that it's product is no longer compatible with Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have asked MS, Intel and my manufacturer for desperate help. I have spent literally many hours with MS going through any and all possible solutions. I have reinstalled several builds and STILL have the same problems. I have originally updated to Build
 1709, the back to 1703, 1607 and now 1511, My manufacturer, got to love em! , suggested I take my device to (sic) A shop and get them to load Windows 8 and download a pirate Product Key from some app on my phone. I have loyally only&nbsp; used MS licensed products
 for more than 25 years and here are your partners suggesting I resolve the problem by using pirated programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This device came with YOUR Operating System...... Windows 10., you people prompted me to update..... and even as we speak your Windows 10 Update Assistant is downloading 1709. I actually hold MS fully responsible for this failure. I need you to help me.
 Hours I have spent on this with your Techs, they for the most part were very helpful. I have received several Case Numbers, and now for some reason I can no longer access a Live Agent, I fear I have been blackballed.&nbsp; I was told to submit my problem to the
 Feedback Hub on my current version of Windows 10.... but alas all I have is an empty Feedback Hub folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When will you take responsibility for the failure of your update on my device? When will you assist me in getting my life back?</p>

    <title>blue dragon 6 DLC cannot purchase in uk. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris cpc  say:</h3>
<h2>            blue dragon 6 DLC cannot purchase in uk.</h2>
                    
<p>Ok here is info</p>

<p><strong>Account region: UK</strong><br />
<strong>Physical region: UK</strong><br />
<strong>Internet Service Provider (ISP):</strong> BT<br />
<strong>Content you are trying to download:</strong> Blue dragon 6 items DLC</p>
<p>Here is the problem.</p>
<p>In the console logged into live the extras tab is missing for the game, so there is no DLC visible at all.</p>
<p>On the xbox marketplace website, all the DLC is visible, I downloaded the free hard mode DLC and the 80 points extra dungeon, but when I tried to get the 80 points 6 items DLC it says offer not valid in your region.</p>
<p>So has this particular DLC been region locked to USA only? (poor if the case) or is it a bug as it does show on the uk website, and uk news sites did announce the DLC.</p>

<p>something is broken on it for sure.</p>
<p>here is the update.</p>
<p>when I selected previously downloaded updates, remember &nbsp;Isaid 2 worked, they started saying the same message, offer not available in your region yet I had previously downloaded them, then I started noticing for one of them it was randomly working and not
 working.</p>
<p>I also noticed the extras tab appear in my xbox screen for the game after it was sat there idle for a while and it showed the 2 DLC I installed as downloaded and the 3rd as available (6 items), when I Selected it on the xbox the price was -1 instead of 80
 points, (clearly corrupt), the big white box would appear but then close itself, it did this whenever I tried. &nbsp;I then tried the website again and that kept failing, but after about 5-6 goes it gave me the chance to pay the 80 points and it installed.</p>
<p>So those DLC seem corrupted on microsott's servers.</p>
<p>yes I was on the en-GB pages, and from uk ip and on uk live account.</p>
<p>Incidently now viewing the DLC page only shows 2 of the DLC, the rest arent even visible even tho is now installed on my xbox. &nbsp;Unfortenatly seems no easy way to report this problem, I am not ringing up a dumbed down hotline which will blame everything my
 end. &nbsp;I dont find any kind of way to submit bug reports.</p>

<p>your isp would be the issue then</p>
<p>two steps you can do </p>
<p>first is it virgin media?</p>
<p>typically people have issues with their resolve</p>
<p>check speedtest.com</p>
<p>and post the picture</p>
<p>now you have two options </p>
<p>1 hard reset your modem and router or contact your isp to renew your gateway or dns</p>
<p>2nr which is faster run over to a friends with a different isp and download it using your console</p>

<h2>            &#34;svchost.exe_WpnUserService&#34; stops working whenever I shut down computer</h2>
                    <p>This is a new thing that has occurred since the October 2018 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The WpnUserService (Windows Push Notifications User Service) stops working whenever I shut down the computer. Don't know what harm it'll bring to my computer, but it's kinda annoying to see it pop up in the Reliability Monitor. :/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Alt+F4 to shut it down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to be starting on the same day I updated several apps and installed Adobe Acrobat 7.0.</p>

            HI SomeoneRemainingInPrivate... This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

            Well at this point I would just let it be until the next update and see if it fixes itself.

<p>I have a similar issue, though in my case notifications crash randomly through out the day, not during shutdown.<br />
<br />
1. I have no Avast or anything like that<br />
2. SFC did not help<br />
3. DISM did not help<br />
4. renaming Notifications folder to force the service to rebuild its database did not help<br />
<br />
What else can be done? (So far I had to turn the service off.)<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t purchase Office suite - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t purchase Office suite</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to get a new subscription to Office 365 Personal but can't complete the purchase because the 'Buy now' button is greyed out and unclickable. Here are the steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 30px">1: I add the product to my basket and click 'Checkout'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 30px">2: I'm redirected to a screen headed 'Review and place order'. It has what look like data fields which are greyed out and flashing. It holds like that, until redirecting to a standard checkout screen to review the
 order, address and payment method.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 30px">3: I input my card details and address, and save them. I do this and click 'Save' but nothing changes. 'Buy now' is still greyed out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 30px">4: I go into the payment details/address page and the card hasn't saved, while the address has. I input card details again - 'Buy now' still greyed out. I'm stuck in a loop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 30px">5: I try PayPal instead, assuming there's a problem at Microsoft's end with saving cards. But when I go to sign in, I can't add PayPal and get this error code:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">45fmw7J4QU2OIGHu.30</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I've tried multiple times on both Chrome and Edge with no luck. All my regional settings are correct (I gather problems can arise
 if not), so I'm stumped. Temporary system problems for Microsoft? Some obscure setting that's wrong? Or am I doing/not doing something obvious? Any help welcome!</span></p>

<h2>            Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems &#40;KB3193494&#41; &#40;KB3194496&#41; &#40;KB3194798&#41; &#40;KB3200970&#41; fails</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, </p>
<p>
</p><p>It started with the previous version KB3189866 and as I found out in the following article this version was released to resolved the inability to complete the installation on the previous one, but basically having the same behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4 days in a row was the systems booting every night trying to update without success</p>
<p>
</p><p>This have happened also with previous cumulative updates on version 1511, and only in my case was solved when the anniversary update was applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The procedures established to fix the installation problem of the updates, that the Microsoft representatives communicate had proven to not be useful at all, but the we continue suffering the same case over and over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previous Cumulative updates like KB3176934 and KB3176938, worked perfectly, so not sure why this unexpected behavior cannot be resolved with a real solution that works for all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope Microsoft of somebody have a final direct answer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Marco</p>
<p>
</p><p>2016-10-17: Updated as all the cumulative updates after (KB3176938) are failing</p>
<p>2016-12-03: Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB3200970) also fails</p>

<h2>            how do I stop my surface from going to sleep too quickly</h2>
                    Hi, just taken possession of a replacement surface and, because my previous one 'died' I lost everything on it, including settings. I know there is a way of lengthening the time before the surface goes to sleep but cannot remember what it is - I seem to
 remember up to 30 minutes....but it would be great if somebody could help me to do this. Thanks. Alan

<p>Hi Georgia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some devices adjust the screen brightness automatically like the adaptive display technology found mostly on smartphones. You can check this article on how to
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026946/windows-change-screen-brightness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Change screen brightness">Change screen brightness</a></strong> if you need to change the brightness on the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, should you wish to extend the time before your screen dims and sleeps, go to the
<strong>Power &amp; sleep</strong> option under <strong>Settings</strong> and choose your preferred time.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur because of incompatibility between DFX Audio Enhancer 12 and the Creator's Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve this issue, uninstall the existing version of DFX, and then install the latest version of DFX. You must install the latest version. For more information about how to obtain the latest version of DFX, go to the FXsound website:
<a href="http://www.fxsound.com/dfx/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.fxsound.com/dfx/index.php</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>thank you very much for your quick response! Unfortunately this doesn’t work, because it is impossible to install the program properly. During installing I get the following messages:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>DfxSetupDrv.exe funktioniert nicht mehr (this is german and means: „doesn’t work any longer“)</span></li><li><span>Same</span></li><li><span>Setting driver name failed</span></li><li><span>DfxSetupDrv.exe funktioniert nicht mehr</span></li><li><span>Setting Driver Icon failed</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Afterwards the program seems to be installed, but doesn’t work. Since tody I get never ending Messages with numbers, like
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>„79 ..\,,\UTIL\dfxSharedUtil\ dfxSharedUtil.cpp“</span></p>
<p><span>Or</span></p>

            I found the answer.&nbsp; Thank you Brad Groux from Microsoft Fanboys.&nbsp; It's a DPI issue.&nbsp; You need to find the itunes executable file (the program file), right click to properties, find the compatibility tab and check the disable scaling option.&nbsp; I tried it.&nbsp;
 It works.&nbsp; His article is <a href="http://www.microsoftfanboys.com/2013/02/how-to-adjust-windows-8-display-settings-for-high-dpi-ppi-screens/#comment-66" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            LifeCam VX-7000 or NX-6000 issues with Skype and Windows 8 64-bit</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 8 64-bit machine and try to use Microsoft LifeCam -7000&nbsp;or NX-6000&nbsp;with Skype. I get an error message that video can't be started, suggesting to close other programs are using the WebCam. apparently I have just restarted the computer. In
 Microsoft LifeCam SW I get "an initialization error" message. </p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 7 (on a different computer) the webcam works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to install the Windows 7 driver from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/lifecam-vx-7000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/lifecam-vx-7000</a> -- didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would expect that Microsoft HW is compatible with Microsoft SW, but it isn't the case apparently...</p>
<p>I wonder if there is a solution to this&nbsp;or should I just dump the webcams?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Stuck at &#34;Checking for updates&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I just formatted my computer using Windows 7 Proffesional 32bit and I am unable to install windows updates</p>
<p>The steps I took:</p>
<p>- after format I created restore point, then:</p>
<p>- went straight to windows update</p>
<p>- changed settings to "Check for updates but let me decide whether to download and install them"</p>
<p>- started checking for updates</p>
<p>- it said "Windows update needs to update itself" or something like that - I clicked Install or whatever there was, it downloaded it and restarted Windows Update</p>
<p>- I clicked "Check for updates" and now nothing happens - it checks for hours without any result.</p>
<p>It is a clean installation - I didn't install any antivirus, nor any other program, I didn't change any system settings (the only thing I did was creating restore point)<br />
I tried solutions found on internet like using Microsoft Fix It, Windows Update Diagnostic, answer to this thread&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-update-hangs-on-checking-for-updates/b762abf5-655c-4a60-aabc-9f59785bd8d9</p>
<p>I also read this thread&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-7-checking-for-updates-stuck-forever/cf0aefb1-477c-41df-a330-130383581c6d and it might be the case but I don't know how can I check it (I don't have access to any other
 internet connection) - can I just ping microsoft servers or something to make sure my network works fine?</p>
<p>Any other ideas on what can I do?</p>

<p>
</p><p>There may be nothing wrong with your computers!&nbsp; The problem is a hopelessly inadequate Windows Update service.&nbsp; Likely it is overwhelmed sending millions of 5 gigabyte malware Win10 files to unwilling Win7 computers, using the same equipment and network
 that normally services you and I.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From Microsoft’s perspective, the updates you want are an extremely low priority.&nbsp; They do not want you updating Windows 7.&nbsp; They want you replacing it with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no reason to do this upgrade unless you are a real adventurer.&nbsp; Windows 7 will be supported through January 2020.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excellent read&nbsp; http://www.infoworld.com/article/2953655/microsoft-windows/windows-10-review-hold-off-if-you-use-windows-7.html#tk.ifw-infsb</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen cases where the green bar continued overnight and finally found the updates, then spent many more hours downloading those updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yours is a notebook PC, turn off sleep and hibernate functions.&nbsp; Leave WU running at least overnight, maybe longer</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Stop trying to fix your computer.&nbsp; You are likely to make a mess of it for no benefit.</p>
<p>Trying to fix your computer may be pointless, when the problem is your supplier.&nbsp; Sort of like taking a part your car’s engine because it does not start, when the problem is the gas tank is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>One tip:&nbsp; Check to see if BITS is corrupted.&nbsp; If it is, solutions get a lot tougher</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Start, All Programs, Accessories, right-click on Command prompt choose Run as administrator.&nbsp; In the black box type net start bits.&nbsp; If BITS is corrupted, you will know by its response.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If BITS is ok, it is likely simply a matter of waiting a long time — by that mean a day or so.</p>

            What is your system make and model?
<div><br />
<div>What is your XP Version and Service Pack?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation: &nbsp;McAfee, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What is the issue you are having that you think System Restore will remedy (or are you just&nbsp;practicing)? &nbsp;System Restore is not a time machine, but of course it should work if you think you need it.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Some Anti Virus tools will "protect" your system so much that they will not allow a System Restore to work properly.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<div>For example, if you are running any Norton/Symantec products, you may see a message like this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Restoration Incomplete. Your computer cannot be restored...</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is such a popular Symantec problem (well, I'll be polite and call it an "undocumented feature"...), they wrote an article about it:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://service1.symantec.com/support/sharedtech.nsf/pfdocs/2005113009323013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://service1.symantec.com/support/sharedtech.nsf/pfdocs/2005113009323013</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Depending on what you are using for malware protection, you may have to disable the product(s) temporarily, do the System Restore and then&nbsp;turn the products back on again when the System Restore is complete.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sometimes you will need to boot your system in Safe Mode and while your protection programs are not running, then do the System Restore. &nbsp;Microsoft hints in some of their articles that if System Restore fails to restore your computer, boot into Safe Mode
 and then execute the&nbsp;System Restore. &nbsp;That works for some configurations.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sometimes System Restore is so afflicted or the Restore Points are suspicious, the best option is to just reinstall your System Restore. &nbsp;Doing so will delete any old Restore Points, but sometimes this is the only way to fix a broken System Restore. &nbsp;You
 don't have to reinstall XP, just the&nbsp;System&nbsp;Restore part.</div>
<div><br />
<div>That may leave you with your original unspecified problem that you hope System Restore will correct (using a System Restore is usually not equivalent to fixing the problem though).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Give those ideas some consideration if they apply to you. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sometimes malicious software will afflict your System Restore to prevent you from finding and removing the malicious software. &nbsp;It would much rather fool you into thinking that you have to repair or reinstall your XP when that is not necessary.</div>
<div><br />
<div>No matter what you are using for malware protection, I would do this and only then begin to troubleshoot any remaining issues:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs then resolve any remaining issues:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a></div>
<div>SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>These can be uninstalled later if desired.</div>
<div><br />
When the scans run clean, reboot, test and we can fix any other issue<br />
