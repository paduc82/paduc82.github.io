            Hello - thanks for the response.&nbsp; I tried all 4 methods and no luck.&nbsp; Spent 3 hours on the phone last night with a Microsoft tech support person and tried all 4 also with no
 luck.&nbsp; Note the last method (4) will not allow me to upgrade - only full re-install which is not acceptable considering the time it would take to reinstall all other programs.<br />

Any other thoughts greatly appreciated &amp; thanks again for your help

            Arya, can Microsoft at least tell us what error code 80073AA2 means?&nbsp;&nbsp; All these solutions posted so far are generic approaches to take in hope the problem will be resolved, but with no guarantee.<br />
<br />
Knowing more details specifically about the error message should help determine a more focused fix to try.

            Yeah, I don't see anything specific for the Windows 7 platform.&nbsp; Other fix-discussions give some steps already listed by Arya in the "12-Method" article.<br />
<br />
I am currently going through the steps in Arya's "12-Methods" article, completing almost everything except the chkdsk, which is running now (it is the slowest step to complete).<br />
<br />
I had to skip Method 10, "Download and manually install the 958056 update", since the Windows download search did not produce anything on the KB article on the security update we are having problems with (yes, I didn't use KB in the search).
<br />
<br />
Anyhow, will report back later when chkdsk is complete.<br />

            I completed 10 of 12 methods in Arya's article:<br />
<span><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2509997" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2509997</span></a></span><span><br />
</span><br />
So far no effect.&nbsp; One step I skipped, method 10, to download manually install the updates.&nbsp; The instructions for the method 10 are not precise for this particular issue.&nbsp; Eventually I was able to find the manual download (see below).<br />
<br />
Note the CHKDSK will take the most time, about 5 hours for me - there were no problems found from the CHKDSK analysis.<br />
<br />
I found the Nov 2012 security ISO download from Microsoft, which contains the security patch with problem (KB 2719033), from this link:<br />
<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35744<br />
<br />
The download is 1.5 gb so it's going to take a while before I can try to install it.<br />

Arya, I just went through the 12 methods in your KB article (2509997), and I still have the same problem: KB2719033 still fails on installation.&nbsp;&nbsp; After about 75% of the way through the installation indicates it fails, then reverts back to the last save point.<br />
<br />
I spent 5 hours going through the methods, all of them had no impact on the problem.&nbsp; I tried the manual patch installer and the win-update version.<br />
<br />
My only solution now is to turn off the auto-updates and be sure to remember to not select this update.<br />
<br />
Your Microsoft engineers need to come up with a better error message or log entry to explain why this update has failed.<br />
<br />
The Microsoft patch is failing to update one or many of the files listed in this KB article:<br />
<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2719033?wa=wsignin1.0<br />
<br />
I believe your engineers need to redo the patch and ensure no services have these files locked prior to the patch running.&nbsp; I cannot tell which files are locked and I have no way to do a trial-and-error test on each.<br />

            Thanks for all your efforts - I have tried ALL suggestions at least 3 times now &amp; no luck.&nbsp; After coming home from lunch today I received call #4 from Microsoft Recovery Debt and after 2 hours of watching my screen perform all the things I have already
 tried several times- plus watching them uninstall my Kaspersky password and virus protection program - plus a host of other changes - still no solution - other than - I will get another call tomorrow between 1-2pm from another tech to correct all corrupted
 system files via using original Windows 7 64bit Ultimate operating disk.&nbsp; Don't feel to good about prospects of next call - because I already tried that also &amp; no luck.<br />
<br />
I have 5 PCs that I have built myself &amp; using some logic - I checked the other 4 PC's update list and all 4 match exactly as to sequence of each update installed - but the other 4 update lists do not match my main used PC's update list as to the sequence of
 each update downloaded and updated.&nbsp; I have shared this with the last 2 calls from Microsoft Recovery and response " that's a none issue".&nbsp; I was going to do a recovery from a restore point before last tuesday's 13th updates - but the MS tech's attempts to
 fix, re-download &amp; update created so many restore points that I lost every restore point before 11/16/12.&nbsp; Reason for loss - I configured restore to a limit of 4 GB &amp; tried to explain this to the MS techs while they repeatedly created more and more restore
 points without them understanding my concern - I finally closed their session - reconfigured restore limits to 100 GB and re-established their remote connection - but too late as stated - no restore points before 11/16/12.<br />
<br />
Yes - I can still uninstall the 13th MS tuesday updates - no I can't - I use a program called Diskmax that removes junk files - including backup files left from Windows update that are required (MSI files) needed to uninstall.<br />
<br />
Well that's it as of now - I'll see what tomorrow's call brings???<br />
<br />
And YEP - I am writing this on one of my other PCs - PC with no virus protection - no use till repaired and safe.<br />
<br />
Again thanks and I am not giving up yet!<br />

            I am only having a problem with 2685813 (all the other updates worked fine when I did them one at a time). Error 80073aa2<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 7 Ultimate N 64 bit.<br />
<br />
I tried Method 1 (the fix it), didn't fix the problem<br />
<br />
I did the clean boot, got down to no non-Microsoft services turned on, and all start-up items disabled. The update still failed. I didn't try tuning off Microsoft services, because (a) there are a ton of them, and (b) it seems like some of those services would
 be needed to install the update.<br />
<br />
Didn't try manually installing the update, since there doesn't seem to be a link for it.<br />
<br />
Method 4 - No way am I going to start from scratch, I'd rather just see stupid 2685813 popping up every hour or so for the rest of my life. Hopefully there will be a better solution.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sooo...next I did most of "<span>Unable to install updates in Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2"<br />
<br />
1. I've restarted and tried again many times over the last few days.<br />
2. CheckSur.exe - didn't fix the problem.<br />
3. SFC.exe - didn't fix the problem<br />
4. catroot2 - didn't fix the problem<br />
5. Registry - I have no COMPONENTS under </span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or anywhere else in the registry (I also searched for the 3 registry entries mentioned, they don't exist)<br />
6. Register the update files - didn't fix the problem<br />
7. Set Microsoft Security Essentials to skip SoftwareDistribution directory<br />
8. Renamed SD directory, didn't fix the problem<br />
9. BITs, didn't fix the problem<br />
10. As mentioned, instructions are not valid<br />
11. No pending.xml file found<br />
12. Chkdsk - fixed a couple of things related to unallocated space. Didn't fix the problem<br />
<br />
And, as a retired software engineer, I second the comment "Your Microsoft engineers need to come up with a better error message or log entry to explain why this update has failed."<br />

<p>
</p><p>Due to the migration of Skype and Microsoft last October 2016, you only have two options to create a Skype account, via email address&nbsp;or mobile number. Accounts created using an email address will have a system-generated Skype Name which will show as
<strong>live:whatevercomesbefore@</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any further questions or clarifications.</p>

            Hmmm - CFS 2 allows for to select a location on any drive/partition. <br />
I reckon you can just install to C:\&nbsp; ,&nbsp; if you must, and then move the game to your game HDD.<br />
<br />
Make a new shortcut so the path is correct and you should be good to go. <br />
Most games from that era are pretty easy going in that respect. <br />
I reckon the worst that may happen is you may not be able to uninstall if you don't find the registry
<br />
entry that links Programs and Features to the games original location.<br />
<br />

            <p><span>Hi Zoro,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused to you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Safe mode and Clean boot.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Boot your PC in <strong>Safe mode with networking </strong>
by following the steps from the link below and check if you are facing similar issue.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Safe mode</strong> is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers necessary to run Windows. The words
<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear at the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expand the options to boot into <strong>Safe Mode</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To exit from <strong>Safe mode</strong> follow the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Open <strong>Run command</strong> by pressing <strong>Windows key + R
</strong>on the keyboard and type <strong>msconfig</strong> in the command box.</span></li><li><span>Under <strong>Boot </strong>tab uncheck the <strong>Safe boot </strong>
option.</span></li><li><strong><span>Reboot </span></strong><span>the system and check if the changes are effective.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To know more about <strong>Safe mode, </strong>following is an article on <strong>
Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode) </strong>(Applies to Windows 10 also)<strong>:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>If the issue does not persist in <strong>Safe mode</strong>, perform
<strong>Clean boot </strong>by following the steps from the link below and check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Putting your system in <strong>Clean Boot</strong> state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.
</p>
<p><span><br />
Following is a link to perform a <strong>Clean Boot</strong>:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: </span>Start the computer in normal mode refer the section,
<strong><span>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting
</span></strong>from the link above.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>If the issue persist, I suggest you to
</span>run <strong>SFC scan </strong>and <strong>DISM scan</strong> on your PC to determine the presence of corrupted files or folders on your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 1: SFC scan </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If a Windows Resource Protection (WRP) file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. For example, some Windows functions may not work, or Windows may crash.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Perform <strong>SFC scan</strong> by following the steps from the link below:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833</strong></a></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Windows corruption errors may prevent Windows updates and service packs from installing. For example, an update might not install if a system file is damaged. The
<strong>DISM</strong> <strong>scan </strong>or System Update Readiness tool may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Perform <strong>DISM scan </strong>by following the steps from the link below:</span></p>

<p>I am having the same issue. Purchased two of the same value loot crates months ago. Want to buy the Halloween crates tomorrow but it just says "Owned" on the pack I have already purchased in the past. Was talking with online support for an hour. They are
 looking into it and told me to try again in 24 hours.</p>

<p>I'm having the same issue with Rocket League Crate Keys. Because I've already bought them, it reflects that I "own" it rather than giving me the opportunity to buy more. I wonder if this is an issue across all games that have packs that you can buy multiple
 times?</p>

            Hey there Phil, to remove Auto-Hardware detect just follow the following guide:
<br />
<br />1. Log in to your computer, click on the Start button and click on the Run option. In the Run window type "SERVICES.MSC" and press Enter.
<br />
<br />2. Search for the service called "UPNP Device Host" or "Universal Plug and Play Device Host" depending on which version of Windows you are running. Right click on the service, select the Properties option and under the Startup Type, select the Disabled option, and then click the OK button.
<br />
<br />3. Search for the service called "SSDP Discovery" or "SSDP Discovery Service" depending on which version of Windows you are running. Perform the same actions you took to disable this service as you did to disable the Universal Plug and Play service in the previous step.
<br />
<br />4. Restart your computer to ensure that the settings changes you have made are applied to the operating system.
<br />
<br />Hope I could be of assistance :)

<h2>            Xbox One S won&#39;t install or update anything from Microsoft Store</h2>
                    <p>So this has been happening for a while now, maybe 2-3 months. Everything was normal and it would occasionally update from the My Games &amp; Apps screen, however, it would not install anything from the Microsoft&nbsp;store. Games would run normally. I eventually
 tried to fix it with my last option of a total Xbox&nbsp;reset (all games and apps) to start from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, that made it a whole lot worse. Now I have an Xbox that has zero apps to run, zero games to play, and to make matters worse, when I has online troubleshooting someone mentioned clearing the blue ray&nbsp;player data or of that sort on a forum and I had
 uninstalled it to reinstall and I can't even watch DVDs&nbsp;now in the Xbox&nbsp;since it has no player and I can't download anything. I've even done a second full console reset and still, nothing will install after setup. Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>What I could gather from troubleshooting and relevant information:</strong></p>
<p>Yes I can connect online fine. Connects to Live, I can move around the Microsoft Store, I can interact with friends. I have multiple Xbox One's so it's not a network issue either or&nbsp;something of the account since I've tried multiple to download from. If
 I attempt to download anything, it changes, for instance, the app to Owned then nothing happens and usually crashes the store. Clicking install just makes a click sound and then nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The crashing error is as follows for the Store:</p>
<p>Code: 0x80004003</p>

<p>Sounds like you have a very unusual situation.&nbsp; Have you tried performing the hard reset EXACTLY like this.&nbsp; &nbsp;<span>Hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.&nbsp;
 Unplug the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Plug the power cord back in and restart the console.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi Zachery,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying. Since it sounds like you've done a lot of troubleshooting, including a full factory reset of your console, and you are still experiencing the same issue, it begs the question: Do you happen to be enrolled in the Insider Program? If so,
 this may be something you need to report directly using the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-hub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Insider Hub</a> (assuming that app is still installed) as issues like these won't be solved by the normal means, including that full reset.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-hub-report-a-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How
 to provide feedback as an Xbox Insider</a> will let you know how to report the problem if you're unable to get or access the app from your console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not in the Insider Program, it may be worth your while to attempt an offline system update to the console as the latest update may not have installed correctly. The full instructions on how to perform this are found in our&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/system-updates-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox
 One System Update Solution</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give these options a try and please let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps out.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Ronald JBecotte,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Which version of Adobe reader are you installing??</span></p>
<p><span>2. Does this happen only when you try to Adobe reader?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may refer to the Adobe support articles and check if helps:</span></p>

<p><span>Important: The above mentioned article tells you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the
 registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.</span></p>

</p><p><a href="http://youtubemultidownloader.com/playlist.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://youtubemultidownloader.com/playlist.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then copy/paste the playlist URL in the <strong>Playlist Link</strong> box, choose your preferred settings, and click
<strong>Download</strong>. When the page is done with collecting all videos you can click the download button next to each video. Download each video to your
<strong>Videos</strong> library folder and they should also appear in WMP's video library.</p>

            Hi Annie.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Any previous Versions installed?
<br />
<br />Try installing in Safe Mode with Networking:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails run the Compatiblity assistant to see if it recommends an earlier mode:  <a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/set-compatibility-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/set-compatib...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>This computer has never had a version of QB installed on it.&nbsp; BUT, in attempting to install, they gave me the wrong download first (which didn't work) and then the right one (which didn't work).&nbsp; Both gave an error that the folder didn't exist and that it
 had to be installed on a hard drive (which it is).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there - yup - these are the instructions which imply that it will actually install.&nbsp; It won't.&nbsp; These are the steps that would lead you to the error and then their troubleshooting gives no indication that 1325 even hits their radar.&nbsp; I spent over 2 hours
 on the phone with them yesterday to get the whole - call Microsoft - it's their issue.&nbsp; AND, we tried a limited start up, safe start up, run as admin, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi again Annie. 
<br />
<br />Let's unhide Hidden and System files and then do a search for that folder by name from the Start Menu search box to delete it.
<br />
<br />To unhide Hidden and System Files:  <a href="http://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/show-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/show-hidden...</a>
<br />
<br />To take ownership of a file that will not delete otherwise:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/guide-how-to-take-ownership-permission-of-a-file-or-folder-manually-in-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/guide-how-to-take-ownersh...</a>

<p>Greg, I apologize for the ignorance - but which file do you want me to delete?&nbsp; The *.ini?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I control WHERE it attempts to install the program?&nbsp; I feel (based on other comments on other sites) that it may be part of the annie.altenhofen path.&nbsp; How do I install it to a different path?</p>

I think Dell should reimburse people who spend money on these cartridges that do not work.&nbsp; One out of every 4 pack I have ordered does this and your talking 25 bucks per cartridge.&nbsp; Dell is making the big money on this..

<h2>            Desktop files missing after Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>I just updated my Windows 10 Pro x64 and rebooted my computer. After that, all the files, I had on my desktop (<em>C:\Users\[username]\Desktop</em>) went missing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I've done my googling, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are not in C:\Windows.old</li><li>They are not simply set to hidden</li></ul>
<p>The list of updates installed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows cumulative update KB3213986</li><li>Malicious software removal tool KB890830</li><li>Flash Player security update&nbsp;KB3214628</li><li>Skype update&nbsp;KB3141468</li><li>Office 2013 updates&nbsp;KB3141470,&nbsp;KB3118349,&nbsp;KB3141464,&nbsp;KB3141465,&nbsp;KB3141466,&nbsp;KB3141474</li></ul>

            None of the suggestions helped. Like I said, I did some googling before and I tried those basic recipes. This is clearly related to this particular update, not an upgrade from older version of Windows (not my case anyway).

            Same here...Microsoft doesn't want us to have&nbsp;a mail program THAT WORKS!&nbsp; It wasn't broken, so WHY DID THEY FIX IT?&nbsp; Or rather, why did they **** it up?&nbsp; The Mail program with Windows 8 is a joke but I am having to use it since they sabotaged the Windows
 Live Mail program a few months ago.&nbsp; At least their Windows 8 Mail program lets me have ALL of my different e-mail accounts.&nbsp; Other than that, it's useless.&nbsp; WHY oh WHY oh WHY can I NOT use all of my different e-mail accounts in Outlook???&nbsp; I DO NOT want to
 forward all of the mail from those other accounts to one account.&nbsp; **** Microsoft???&nbsp; What, are you getting rid of Outlook at the same time you are getting rid of Internet Explorer?&nbsp; Hey, if you wanted to push your customers to other platforms...you are doing
 a GREAT JOB of THAT!&nbsp; You may be losing me to a Mac computer soon...VERY SOON.&nbsp; The only thing that will make me reconsider is if you BRING BACK WINDOWS 7 AND WINDOWS LIVE

            Hi Cher, click the link below to download the trial version of Nero BackItUp 2018
<br />
<br />Install that and use it to extract all your file out of those .nco file(s)
<br />
<br />Then once you have extracted all the files - uninstall BackItUp
