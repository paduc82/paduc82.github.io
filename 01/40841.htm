<h2>            Black screen after setting MSCONFIG</h2>
                    <p>Hi Expert</p>
<p>i have problem with my laptop (Win 7 Enterprise)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I accidentally disabled all the service at msconfig and now my win unable to boot as usual. Its stuck at Black screen after windows logo.</p>
<p>2. I have problem with my startup program recently and try to trace the root cause with enable/disable the program on startup 1 by 1 including all the Microsoft services on &nbsp;Microsoft services list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there chance for me to revert back to my original msconfig setting. I heard there is an option to use BCD via cmd on recovery console. I unable to start as Normal, Safe mode and Last Good Know Configuration by pressing F8 when bootup, it will stuck at
 black screen as well. the only option for me now is, i still can access the CMD when using my Win 7 installer (USB Stick) and boot to recovery console.</p>

<p>Yes, it is something that you should worry about.&nbsp; If the volume is dirty it means that there are inconsistencies or errors in the file system and a proper chkdsk needs to be run on the drive.</p>
<p>When the volume is dirty by default it should be checked the next time Windows is booted.&nbsp; If autochk doesn't run when Windows is booted maybe 'someone' changed the default behaviour of the operating system.&nbsp; To return the system to the defaults enter the
 following command at a command prompt:</p>
<p>CHKNTFS /D</p>
<p>You can also schedule a boot time check by running this command:</p>
<p>chkdsk c: /f</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Freezes on startup, update, shutdown, and restart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simplepleasures1205  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Freezes on startup, update, shutdown, and restart</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was having trouble starting windows a few days after the anniversary update. My computer froze on shutdown at "Shutting Down" for more than 3 hours and I decided to shut it down pressing the power button. After that when I started the pc, it came up to
 a black screen without a mouse cursor. I waited for an hour and it did not change so I had to shut it down forcefully again. After that I tried booting into safe mode which worked but I wasn't able to do anything. At that point I tried to boot into safe mode
 with networking which did not happen. I got a blue screen with error "Stop_Code". At that point I decided to refresh the pc and it booted up after i removed all the files and settings. But after that windows update happened "KB3176495" and then while the restart
 process it froze on "Restarting" and after waiting I had same issue. But this time it boots up and makes it to the log on screen where it froze again. I tried restarting a few times each time it froze after a few seconds after boot up, usually at the log on
 screen or at the welcome screen with the time. At this point I downloaded a fresh iso file using the media creation tool and formatted the hard drive and performed a clean installation of windows. The only thing I did after that is do a windows update to install
 any drivers I might need the update happened including&nbsp;KB3176495 after which I did a restart to install the drivers and it froze at "Installing Windows Updates 30%", I waited for a while and restarted the pc at which point it completed the installation and
 froze again at "Installing Windows Updates 100%". I then booted into safe mode and uninstalled the update and tried to restart but still froze again at the logon screen. This time I tried to boot into safe mode with networking and it came up with a black screen
 without a mouse cursor and after waiting for a while I shut it down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>For people who don't want to read the whole process here's the key points of the things I tried</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. <strong>System refresh</strong> with both keeping the files and without the files</p>
<p>2. Disabling the <strong>display driver</strong>,uninstalling it and re installing it.</p>
<p>3. Uninstalling <strong>windows update&nbsp;KB3176495</strong></p>
<p>4. Performing a <strong>fresh installation</strong> of windows deleting everything in the hard drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>My computer is still freezing and I need a solution</strong>. I tried to contact Microsoft support by calling them but other than a fresh installation they didn't have any other ideas either.<br />
</p>
<p>If anyone has any other ideas, Please do share.</p>

<h2>            Bad connection in multiplayer&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've got all the ports open for xbox live, NATs open and almost nothing using up the internet while I'm on xbox live. Yet for some reason my connection seems to be terrible. Usually 1 bar of connection no matter what game I go into. I've even reset my router,
 double checked the IP addresses of the console to make sure I got it right when opening the ports and still nothing...What could be causing it?</p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>As far as I am aware, there isn't a promotion ongoing at the moment where you can get a free EA Access trial. You can see more about EA Access here:

            <p>Hey PANTHERSfanJACK - </p>
<p>Is there a specific promotion you are referring to regarding EA Access? That's often a pre-order incentive for a lot of EA games such as Madden, FIFA, or NHL. Having a bit more insight into the promotion you saw will help us figure out what the issue is though. </p>
<p>Keep us posted! :)</p>

<h3> kingcobra460  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strange ReCore checkpoint glitch....HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm 3 hours into ReCore. I just completed the checkpoint "Is anyone out there" in The Cradle portion of the game. After the cutscene where I'm sent out to find some parts for Kai. I decided to stop playing here. I turned off my Xbox and left. I come back
 later and when my game boots up, it puts me in the spot before running into Kai. So my mission is still to find the distress call. But during the cutscene, Kai gives you the blue power up for your gun, which I still have. When I follow the checkpoint marker
 to Kai's ship, nothing happens. I'm stuck there waiting and waiting. So it's like I'm stuck in a previous checkpoint with no way to accomplish it. I've uninstalled the game, reinstalled, deleted my save, resynced it, turned my Xbox off and on again.....nothing
 is working. I don't want to start the game over, PLEASE HELP!</p>

<h2>            Update Windows 7 without a network connection.</h2>
                    I have a Windows 7 machine I set up for a client; it houses their financial data and they refuse to have it connected to a network, which leaves me without a way to get and install updates as needed.&nbsp; Is there a way to download the cummulative updates
 and apply them to their system without connecting to a network; i.e., can't I burn essential programs and files on a CD?<br />

http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/resultsForCategory.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;categoryId=7&amp;stype=n_dc</a>&nbsp;from another machine, simply save the update files to a USB flash drive or burn them to a CD, then install them on the client's machine.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps, have a great day!

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Work Folders - Enterprise ID Revoked</h2>
                    <p>Good Morning!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows Work Folders setup in my organisation from Windows Server 2012 R2. Connected to the system are Windows 8.1 Clients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the machines has repeatedly generated the below error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/98a880b1-ed0d-4ab0-b9ab-4a33bbe950a5" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have googled this error code and also the message but found absolutely nothing that explains the cause of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to fix this briefly by deleting the Work Folders "Folder" on the server and the local PC. I had to stop the Group Policy that defines the details for Work Folders otherwise I encountered this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4c1efe0a-16cd-4898-a9d4-f3ce1f874739" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>After removing the Group Policy from the user, I managed to stop the partnership, delete the Work Folders on both the server and client and reset it up manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reapplied the group policy to the user and everything worked fine around 10 minutes. When the user changed their password and went to make a cup of coffee. After returning to find their machine at the locked screen they logged back in to find the above
 error (first screenshot) again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a loss at to what is causing this. No other users using Work Folders have reported the problem and I cannot think of anything I am doing that work revoke this user from the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be seriously appreciated. Thanks for your time ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a good weekend ahead :)</p>
<p><br />
Dominic :-)</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No need, I found a solution. I'll post it below in-case anyone else stumbles across this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just in case anyone else ever has the same issue. You need to delete the affected User Profile from C:\Users. In this case; Delete: C:\Users\Dominic</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then clear the registry entries for the User Account under ProfileList and ProfileGuid. The Registry entries will be found at:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\ProfileList</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c48a4711-2efd-4000-8e80-90bc91c13044" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Look for the affected User Account and Delete the S-1-5-21-XYZ Folder (Where XYZ is the menu as per the ProfileImagePath marked by the Red Arrow)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The corresponding Key to Delete under ProfileGuid is the same as the Guid Registry Entry under the ProfileList for the affected User Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once that is done, Reboot the machine and setup Work Folders again and the problem will disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps anyone else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dominic :-)</p>

<p>As far as i know there is no yellow light fault on the 360 console.</p>
<p>Yellow lights can appear on the power pack to indicate a fault.</p>
<p>What exactly is your console doing when this light shows, is there anything on screen , error code etc??</p>

<h2>            sfc&#47;scannow always shows corrupt files that it can not fix</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I had been having issues with my brand new HP dv7 laptop and I followed the steps recommended by the hp folks and after scanning all drives and looking for viruses etc. i performed the sfc/scannow utility.&nbsp; This scan showed corrupt files that could not be fixed.&nbsp;
 So i did a complete system restore from the recovery drive and again got the same corrupt files message.&nbsp; Then I formatted the hard drive and installed the OS from disc and again got the same corrupt files message from sfc/scannow.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So... hp sent me a new better laptop with the same OS (Windows Vista Home Premium SP1 - 64bit) and so I just got my new computer in the mail and the first thing I did was run sfc/scannow and sure enough again it showed corrupt files that could not be fixed!<br />
<br />
What's going on???<br />
<br />
From combing the web I have noticed that this seems to be a prevalent occurence. <br />
<br />
What should I do?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />

</span><span>&nbsp;This does not always resolve all issues, especially if the corruption was caused by a 3rd party program or service, you might need to do a clean installation if this is unsuccessful.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            nikon d5100 videos won&#39;t import into Windows Photo Gallery</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to a Nikon D5100 from the D5000.&nbsp; I had no problem at all importing pics and video from the D5000.&nbsp; However, only photos import to Windows Photo Gallery... and the videos do not!&nbsp; I have tried everything I can think of and nothing will
 work.&nbsp; Is Windows Photo Gallery not compatible with this camera?&nbsp; Are the videos from the D5100 a different type of file than the D5000?&nbsp; Help!!!!! &nbsp; Thanks! ;)

<br />
</blockquote>
<p>============================================<br />
I don't have experience with these cameras but maybe the<br />
following info would help you find&nbsp;a solution&nbsp;that works&nbsp;for you.<br />
<br />
Yes the video format is different. You could check the owner's <br />
manual but I don't think the camera has an option for&nbsp;exporting <br />
the video&nbsp;in a different format.<br />
<br />
Since MPEG4 is a QuickTime format...there is a possibility <br />
that the following article would be useful:<br />
<br />

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/944563" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/944563</a>
<br />
<br />
Also the 3ivx Decoder may be worth a try for making the MPEG4<br />
files compatibile with your system:<br />
<br />
The 3ivx decoder components play back <br />
most MP4, M4A, 3GP, MOV and AVI files <br />
with MPEG-4 Video and MPEG-4 AAC Audio<br />

<br />
As for conversion...there are many converters available on the <br />
net...some free...some retail.<br />
<br />
Apple QuickTime can&nbsp;export&nbsp;MPEG-4 video files&nbsp;to other formats<br />
If you upgrade to the Pro (retail) version. Maybe it&nbsp;was included&nbsp;<br />
with your camera.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />

Apple QuickTime Pro 7<br />
<a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/extending/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.apple.com/quicktime/extending/</a><br />
(I'm thinking you have to install the free version first)<br />
<br />
The following freeware converters&nbsp;are&nbsp;just two examples<br />
and may be worth experimenting with:<br />

Format Factory (freeware)<br />
<a href="http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Format_Factory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videohelp.com/tools/Format_Factory</a><br />
(the 'direct link' is fastest download)<br />
(the file you want to download is : &gt;FFSetup296.zip&lt;)<br />
(FWIW...when installing...you may want to uncheck<br />
'all' the boxes on the final screens)<br />
(Windows XP / Vista / 7)<br />
<br />
First you will need to unzip the file or just open the<br />
folder and drag &gt;FFSetup296.exe&lt; out of the folder<br />
and drop it on your desktop. Left click it to install.<br />
<br />
Next...after downloading and installing Format<br />
Factory...you may want to open the program and<br />
left click the 'Option' button on the toolbar and<br />
select an 'Output Folder' / Apply / OK.<br />
(this is where you will find your files after they<br />
are converted)<br />
<br />
Drag/drop your video clips onto the main screen...<br />
<br />
Select 'All to WMV' / OK...<br />
<br />
Click...Start...on the toolbar...<br />
<br />
That should do it...<br />
<br />
One more freebie...<br />

<p><br />
First, note that you can have a wireless internet connection with *either* a laptop or a desktop. That's no difference at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the major differences, in no particular order:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Laptops are considerably more expensive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Laptops are harder to fix if something goes wrong, and service on them is more expensive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Laptops&nbsp;break&nbsp;and have hardware problems more than desktops do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Replacement parts for laptops are more expensive, and service often costs more..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Your ability to upgrade laptop hardware is much more limited than with a desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. A laptop&nbsp;screen is smaller that&nbsp;monitors that are available for desktops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.. Laptop keyboards are sometimes smaller than desktop keyboards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; It may nnot be possible to upgrade a laptop to a new version of Windows. because drivers for that version may not exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Laptops are stolen more than desktops are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Regarding the clutter of wires, almost the only wires you need on a desktop and not on a laptop are those for a monitor. A desktop can have a wiresless keyboard and a wireless mouse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you might guess from the above,&nbsp;for&nbsp;almost everyone I&nbsp;recommend that you have a desktop as your main computer, not a laptop. Almost the only advantage of a laptop is its portability, so it's good for use when traveling. So, for example, I have a desktop
 for my main use at home, but also have a laptop that I take with me when traveling.</p>

                    <p>On the first run following boot, 'open file location' from a desktop shortcut results in the opening of the desktop folder rather than the folder location of the file associated with the shortcut. Would anyone know what causes this, or has anyone had something

<p>It basically looks like this from the Windows context menu...I apologize for my wording, I meant the first run of the shortcut after boot, not that I am using Run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time after the first log-in if I choose Open file location it opens the Desktop folder rather than the actual location of the file. Upon a second try, it then gets the correct, actual folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering if it is a refresh issue or something.</p>

<h2>            Sticky note doesn&#39;t auto resize after unplugging from external monitor</h2>
                    <p>Hell there.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I just received my surface pro 4 recently and I encounter this strange annoyance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My sticky note will not auto resize after unplugging the external monitor adaptor.<br />
Pictures below are taken after the messed up.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The first pic shows the initial mess.<br />
The second pic shows "the messed up" being mess up, again.<br />
<br />
What should I do to keep its size while using external monitor ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.<br />

<p>Hi Clement,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are using a duplicate display, sticky note won't resize automatically when you plug or unplug your external display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try to customize your display using the <strong>Display settings.</strong></p>

    <title>Lenovo Explorer not working with mixed reality or steam. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> krivkroutons  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lenovo Explorer not working with mixed reality or steam.</h2>
                    I got a lenovo explorer and the controllers and setup the controllers and headset, they seem to be showing up fine in SteamVR.&nbsp; When launching WMR though all the items show up the headset has no display, I even tried adding boundaries to my room and the
 sensors don't seem to be working either,&nbsp; the only time the display has ever worked is when I close everything and launched Mixed reality for steamVR from steam and then again it only shows up for about 5 seconds and dissapears, I've tried reinstalling, driver
 updates and everything, nothing seems to work.&nbsp; I did buy this refurbished so I'm guessing worst case scenario they gave me a damaged one.&nbsp; One more thing just in case, I only have one HDMI port on my PC so I got a display port to vga and that is going to
 my monitor and my lenovo explorer is using HDMI.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you start Windows and see a blank or black desktop with no icons, video adapter problems are the most common cause of this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try the following troubleshooting steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Gain access to your computer and reinstall your current video driver</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1: Launch Task Manager and restart Explorer.exe:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>1. Press the
<b>Ctrl</b> + <b>Alt</b> and <b>Delete</b> keys on the keyboard at the same time</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the
<b>Start Task Manager</b></span></p>
<p><span>3. Click the
<b>Processes</b> tab, right-click<b>explorer.exe</b> from the list of running processes</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click
<b>End Process </b>to stop the Explorer.exe process</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click
<b>File</b> from the menu and click<b> New Task (Run)</b></span></p>
<p><b><span>6.
</span></b><span>Type <b><i>Explorer.exe</i></b> in the <b>Open:</b> window and click
<b>OK</b></span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Uninstall your video driver and allow Windows to re-install it:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>7. Click
<b>Start</b> and type <b>Device Manager</b> in the Search box</span></p>
<p><span>8. Click<b> Device Manager</b> under
<b>Programs</b></span></p>
<p><span>9. Restart your computer to allow Windows to reinstall the driver</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Once the driver is reinstalled you may need to reboot your computer again to complete the installation.
 Additionally, you may also need to adjust the screen resolution to its previous setting.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Check for registry issues</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>If reinstalling your video driver does not work, follow the steps in method 1 again and then perform the following troubleshooting steps
 to check for registry issues:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click
<b>Start</b> and type regedit.exe in the Search box</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click
<b>Regedit.exe</b> under programs</span></p>
<p><span>3. Browse to the following registry key</span></p>
<p><span>4. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click to select the
<b>\WinLogon</b> key</span></p>
<p><span>6. Browse through the list to<b>\Shell</b></span></p>
<p><b><i><span>7.
</span></i></b><span>The value of<b> Shell</b> should be <b><i>explorer.exe</i></b></span></p>
<p><b><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>If the value of <b>Shell</b> is not <b>Shell</b>, double-click<b> Shell</b> and type
<i>explorer.exe</i> in the <b>Value data:</b> text area and click<b>lock </b>and then<b>
</b>close the registry editor and restart your computer</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify
 the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore
 the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
</span></p>
<p><span>322756 (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/</span></a>

<p><span>How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: Enable low-resolution video (640x480), and then update your video adapter driver</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>If resolving registry issues does not work, perform the following steps to enable low-resolution video:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<b>Start</b> button, click the arrow next to <b>Shut Down</b>, and then click <b>
Restart</b>. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press F8 before the Windows logo appears.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the <b>
Advanced Boot Options</b> screen, use the arrow keys to highlight <b>Enable low-resolution video (640×480)</b>, and then press Enter.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you can see your desktop, there's a problem with your video adapter. Try updating your video adapter driver. For more information, see
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 4: Start your computer in Safe Mode and disable your video adapter</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>If enabling low resolution and then updating your video adapter driver did not work, perform the following troubleshooting steps to disable
 your video adapter driver:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When your computer restarts, if you can see your desktop, there's a problem with your video adapter. Try updating your video adapter driver.
 For more information, see Update</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If these steps did not solve your problem, try booting into Safe Mode again and follow the steps in System to restore your computer to an
 earlier point in time.</span></p>

    <title>Avatar Store on Xbox 360 purchases have been disabled. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Avatar Store on Xbox 360 purchases have been disabled.</h2>
                    
<p>So it is a sad day for avatar users as no more avatar gears can be purchased in the Avatar Store. It seems that when you open the menu's category, it keeps loading all items and they never complete. In the end, it's safe to say that Avatar Store is closing
 and all purchases have been disabled as part of the marketplace shutdown. Right?</p>

<p>There's a problem with it loading content on 360 for sure, but I doubt it's deliberate. Also, I can buy content, I just can't see what I'm buying. lol</p>
<p>If you select anything that's in the process of loading it brings up the purchase confirmation prompt. Saving and exiting the store makes the 360 hang for like five minutes too... I thought it'd frozen.</p>
<p>S'just run of the mill service problems in my opinion, methinks, by my reckoning, by mine estimatus... &nbsp;=) Be patient.</p>

<p>Actually, everything is disabled. Whenever it brings up the selection of Style or Collection, each items will be deselectable. So, Avatar Store and Avatar Editor mode are closing and is now disabled.</p>

<p>Weird. I was browsing the avatar store yesterday and everything worked fine. Perhaps this is part of the devising of a cross platform solution? Avatars have limited screen on the XB1, despite them being there.</p>

<p>Apparently Microsoft had job postings last month for folks able to work in bringing avatars to multiple devices [Polygon article]. Windows 10 has an avatar app alongside its Xbox app.</p>
<p>I think Kanaye is closest to what's going on. Peeps are messing with the features and its affecting performance, but it doesn't look like the avatars are going anywhere. The OP reached his conclusion first, and then piled in his ~cough~ facts second. Ya
 should work the other way, OP. {XD</p>
<p>Set the neutral alarm. And tell my wife... hello.</p>

<p>I buy Avatar gear and that low tier dlc for games, like skin packs and stuff, with rebates from the Rewards program.</p>
<p>Join that, spend a few quid a month on games as normal, and/or do a survey, and get some free nothing-stuff for sh-poos and giggles every coupla weeks or so. ~shrug~</p>
