<h2>            WLM folders corrupted</h2>
                    <p>When I move an email from my inbox to the "Storage Folders / Personal Saved /&nbsp;whatever"&nbsp;&nbsp; that I created, the heading line appears correct, but the contents are from another email. I have about 50 folders, broken down by subject and I would hate to have
 to export each one and then re-create the tree structure after re-installing WLM. Is there any tool to clean/verify the structure of the store?&nbsp; How would you suggest cleaning up this mess?&nbsp; Running WLM Version 2009 Build 14.0.8117.0416.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was working
 just fine until a couple of weeks ago and I just noticed the problem.</p>

<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I understand the challenge you've encountered moving inbox messages to folders using Windows Live Mail.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are glad you contacted us so that we can find solutions and fix this issue immediately. Please
</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>Repair the Mail.MsMessageStore file
<font>by following steps </font></font></span></span>below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>1. Restart the computer. (This is to ensure that Live Mail is fully shut down, and that none of its components are in use when the computer starts.)</font></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>2. Click Start, type CMD but do not press enter.</font></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>3. You will see cmd.exe in the search results, right click on it and select Run as Administrator - type your admin password if asked, and if UAC pops up asking permission, allow it.</font></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>4. You should now see the command prompt, with the following displayed:</font></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>Microsoft Windows [Version 6.1.7600]</font></span></span></i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>5. Copy the following. (Ctrl+C)</font></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>esentutl.exe -d "%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Mail.MSMessageStore"</font></span></span></b></p>

<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>Note: the "" are necessary</font></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>6. Right click in the command prompt Window, and select Paste, so you now see the following:</font></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>7. Press enter. esentutl will now defragment the Live Mail database file.</font></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>8. Once done, you can close the command prompt, and restart the PC again.</font></span></span></p>

            <p>This symptom indicates a corruption in the message database. Each message is stored as an individual file. The entries you see in the message list are taken from the database, while the body of the message is retrieved from the message file itself. If the

Forcing a compaction of the database may help by re-indexing all your messages. This procedure is flaky, though, and may not work. Nevertheless, it's worth trying:</p>
<ol>
<li>When viewing your message list, press Ctrl-Shift-O for Options.</li><li>On the <em>Advanced </em>tab, click <em>Maintenance</em>.</li><li>Select <em>Compact the database on shutdown every...</em> and change the number to 1.<br />
Close the options dialogue.</li><li>On the <em>View </em>menu, close&nbsp;the&nbsp;reading pane&nbsp;if it's open.</li><li>Click File &gt; <em>Work offline </em>and disconnect from the network.</li><li>Disable any security software (e.g. anti-virus) that may be running.</li><li>Close down Windows Live Mail and leave it for several minutes. To be sure that you don't interfere with the process, start Task Manager (Ctrl-Shift-Escape) and wait until wlmail.exe disappears from the processes list before doing anything else.</li><li>Reboot the computer and check that your security software is running.</li><li>Launch Windows Live Mail again and try to view the messages that wouldn't display previously.</li></ol>
<p>Please report back with your experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incidentally, the instructions you were given to use esentutl will not repair the database. The -d switch only defragments it. Repair requires a different switch. The instructions apply to Windows 7; the version of Windows Live Mail you're using will run
 on XP, Vista and W7.</p>

            <p>Kay, </p>
<p>thanks for the information. The command did not work as was presented in step 5. I am on WinXP and was using WLM 2009 Build 14.0.8117.0416. I needed to change the path to point the correct&nbsp;files for WinXP. Still it failed. I tried other variations of the
 command, and did what FireDog mentioned below and finally your esentutl.exe started working (initially I was getting error 1811, then I got 1032, and some others.)</p>
<p>None of the commands fixed the problem. The index needed to be rebuilt completely.&nbsp; I wanted to migrate to Win7, so I set up a new WLM on another computer and started exporting folders from the old WLM and importing them into the "new" computer.&nbsp; Occasionally
 I still had problems with the index being corrupt in the Imported folders, so I would delete it and try again (a little different each time).
</p>
<p>I had almost 68,000 emails (files) and 74 folders in the mail store. I lost about 7 folders (non-critical and I probably should have deleted them anyway), but I am 'migrated' now to Win7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was very used to the screen/tools that were available to me using WLM2009, now using WLM2011, there are some things that I don't like and in one case, can't figure out.</p>
<p>SPECIFICALLY: I don't want the pictures or other embedded attachments to automatically load when the email is received and displayed. I want to click on the bar to show pictures, when I am ready to see them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't like the ribbon (toolbar) and would like to edit it, move things around, remove some things, add some things that the old WLM2009 had available quickly. ( I would like to add the GO button, specifically to be able to get to the CONTACTS quickly.
 In New Message, I don't see an actual button for SpellCheck. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to both FireDog and Kay_C for their assistance. I await your answers.</p>

            <p>Thanks everyone for your suggestions, but they didn't help repair the message store. I decided to migrate from a Win/XP platform&nbsp;to a Win/7 platform and installed the current WLM on it. I then imported each folder from the previous message store and organized
 the folders the way that I wanted them (I think it was about 100 folders). Still, the new message store doesn't look the way I want it to look, but all the critical emails in the archive are accessible.&nbsp;&nbsp; Good enough for now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/9c5fd39e-08c0-4b06-b7da-2044614ae54f"><font color="#0072c6">Karla Camille O</font></a>, you gave me some information on how to not download all the images and HTML and I appreciate
 it. It mostly worked. I have some rules that direct some of my inbox mail to certain folders so that I know to look for them because they have certain things in the message or the From email address. The images are still being automatically loaded for those
 emails in those special folders, and I don't want it to do that.&nbsp; The old WLM didn't do that, why does it now? I didn't re-enter the rule, it came over as I imported the profiles for the different email addresses that I have within my WLM.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HELP PLEASE (anyone).</p>

<div><br />
<div>You've mentioned that the rule that was provided by the previous moderator is being negated as the images were still being loaded to the folders that you've created. Note that the rule where you removed the check is only applicable to those contacts that
 is not within your Safe Senders list.</div>

            <p>I have checked my contacts and safe senders and the sender is NOT in either list, so far as I can tell.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish there was a way to export/import the safe senders list so that I can really edit it and clean out old addresses that I don't want in the list
 any more - there are so many of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: I normally use WLM to handle things, but I remembered that it doesn't support the filtering and moving (rules)&nbsp;directly, that I need to go to the former HOTMAIL.COM (outlook through Mail.Live.Com) to edit those things.&nbsp; I found another parameter about
 downloading pictures and other things for all mail or just those on the SAFE SENDER's list. I changed that parameter and will have to wait for a new email to come in to see how it works. I will reply again in a couple of days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Still not "leaving it alone".</p>
<p>There is one domain that I am monitoring email from. There is a rule established at the HOTMAIL site (accessed through IE) that directs all mail from this domain to a special folder.&nbsp; I don't want the pictures and other stuff automatically&nbsp;downloaded, but
 as soon as I preview the email that is in this folder, all the pictures populate.
</p>
<p>I have set WLM to not download:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OPTIONS: &nbsp;MAIL:&nbsp;&nbsp;READ: Automatically download message when viewing in the Preview Pane is NOT checked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OPTIONS: Safety Options: SECURITY: "DOWNLOAD IMAGES": &nbsp;"BLOCK..." is checked, "Show images and external content sent from email addresses in my Safe Senders list" is NOT checked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It worked just fine with the previous version of WLM, but now I can't get it to work.</p>

            Port forwarding is easy, but you'll need the right ports to connect to. Can find those on sites, but make sure the right ports are open, we can't have you unprotected

<p>Hi their do not port forwarding in your router if you do, you cannot log in your Xbox 360 console and from your Xbox one from Xbox 360 log in I have very long issues about it. And now I have problem solved reason why my router Wi-Fi single keep going up

<p>Hi, if you cannot connect to xbox live after port forwarding. You most likely did the port forwarding incorrectly. I had the same issue awhile back after port forwarding on my router so my nat type on Bo2 would be open.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> reo2010  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connecting to wireless router&#47;external hard drive with Windows 7 Home Edition</h2>
                    I just got a new computer with Windows 7 pre-installed. I have an Apple Time Capsule that acts as both my wireless router for my network and my external hard drive as it has a TB of memory. I was able to successfully setup the network to get online but
 now I can not get the Backup and Restore Program to recognize it as memory. I spoke with HP and they informed me that Windows 7 Home Edition does not allow you to setup a wireless network for backing up your PC. All other editions of Windows 7 do. Is this
 correct? If so, is Windows going to do something to take care of their loyal customers who now can not utilize their wireless external hard drives? I find it hard to believe they would leave out such an important tool. Disgusting.

            HP almost got it right.&nbsp; The Backup and Restore program in Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, and Home Premium doesn't let you select a network location (wireless or wired) for the backup.&nbsp; Windows 7 Professional and Ultimate can.<br />

<h2>            Scanning a photo picture or document &#40;.jpg, .png, .gif, .tiff&#41; with the MFC-J-680DW</h2>
                    Is there any way to scan a pdf document and convert it into any of the following file types: jpg, png, gif, tiff? The Brother MFC-J-680DW scans everything into the PDF type of file. That is, after scanning a document or picture, is there an application
 capable of converting the scanned file and saving it as a jpg, png, gif, or a tiff type file?

            <p>You could try to figure how it is misconfigured but that may not be easy. The simple solution is to remove the scheduled task and start again from within Slim Cleaner Plus, or uninstall and reinstall &nbsp;Slim Cleaner Plus. My inclination would be to remove
 Slim Cleaner and not bother reinstalling.</p>

            <p>That is a feature of some mouse hardware's software support.&nbsp; Check your user guide.&nbsp; For example, Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center supports that option for multi-button mouse devices.&nbsp; LogiTech does too I think.&nbsp; More generally you may find some software
 which allows you to create "mouse macros" and tie such a specification to an unused button.</p>

Your password to your PC is the&nbsp; same password you use to get in to Microsoft so if you do not know it get on a different system change password to Microsoft and that should be the password to your PC your account password. I hope this helps I am a little rusty

<h3> randyored  say:</h3>
<h2>            All my internet shortcuts have turned into URL files</h2>
                    <p>I have several systems now running Windows 10. One of them has somehow changed ALL of my internet shortcuts to URL files, with the URL extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what has happened to cause this. It looks really ugly. Especially in my favorites folder and in the favorites bar.&nbsp; The url file extension goes away if I select "hide known extensions". But, the other systems do not have that checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is what leads me to think that the shortcuts were converted to URL files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I convert them back and stop it from happening again?</p>

            <p>Bit locker is turned on by default on the Surface pro 3 devices. So you do not even need to do anything for it to turn on. Because the Surface pro 3 is running Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 Professional this is a requirement unless you turn it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you say in your post that you have the bit locker recovery key. If you do just give it to them. If not you will&nbsp;</p>
<p>need access to your Microsoft account to get your Bitlocker key:&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/find-my-bitlocker-recovery-key<br />

            <p>Hi Vikram,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When your computer is in use, it consumes memory not only when you play games but also applications as well. it could be for eg: the file explorer etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to open the task manager, Press CTRL+SHIFT+ESC and check click on the process tab. There you will the apps that are consuming the memory. Don't worry the 1 GB is not taken away or lost. It is being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this post helps. Get back to us for further queries. We are happy to help!</p>

                    <p>Hi good morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 and today wanted to change my user pic. &nbsp;My PC still have all the folders for my pics, but all the files inside have completely disappeared. Folder properties states 0 kbytes. I have tried everything that was suggested by other forums,
 un-hiding, malware checks, etc. Nothing worked. &nbsp;It is as if they just vanished. &nbsp;I then checked other folders and found that a lot of the files have gone as well. &nbsp;Can anyone please help. &nbsp;15 years of memories just gone. &nbsp;I am so regretting upgrading to Win
 10 right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you Microsoft</p>

    <title>Windows 7 reports unsigned driver for xbox one controller - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 reports unsigned driver for xbox one controller</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to connect my xbox one controller to my windows 7 pc (64-bit), I downloaded the official x64 driver at:</p>
<p>https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-one/accessories/controller-pc-compatibility</p>
<p>The driver installed correctly, but windows is reporting that the driver is unsigned, and can't be used. I highly doubt Microsoft didn't provide a driver signature with it, but I could only find one instance of people will the same issue (http://steamcommunity.com/app/241560/discussions/0/619573787340602068/),
 which doesn't really help, I don't wish to turn off windows integrity check.</p>
<p>I hear sometimes the signature isn't included in the driver itself, but in a catalogue which comes via windows update, I ran windows update and found everything was on the latest version. I haven't had any issues with drivers for other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea why I might be getting this issue and how to check what the specific problem is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing us.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that the Xbox controller driver is unsigned and hence you are unable to install it.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sometimes the drivers may be unsigned. This issue can occur because the Digital Signer entry is not correctly updated in Device Manager until you restart Device Manager.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hence to fix this issue, please follow the suggestion given below and check the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please install the Xbox controller driver from the link you have mentioned in the last post, once done then please follow the steps mentioned below and check the issue.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows Key + R key.</strong></span></li><li><span>Type <strong>sigverif.exe</strong>, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong> and click on start on the next screen to view digital signature details. This will check if all the drivers on your computer are digitally signed.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Please try the above suggestion and let us know the status of the issue.</span></p>

            <p>I ran sigverif.exe and it came up with 71 unsigned files, I'm guessing that isn't a good result. However that list didn't include xb1usb.sys which is confusing, does that mean sigverif isn't detecting that the controller driver isn't signed?<br />
</p>
<p>If it helps I can post the log with the 71 unsigned files.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">You have mentioned that there were 71 unsigned drivers on your computer then you can't verify from were those files came from or they had been cracked and modified and not compatible with your system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">I would like to inform you that not all unsigned drivers are a bad thing a lot of freeware/shareware offered as free downloads on the internet doesn't have signatures on their installers or the actual executable.</span></p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p></div>
<div>For unsigned driver issue you can uninstall the driver which you installed for Xbox One Controller try to disable Driver Signing in Windows 7 Using Group Policy Editor and then try to reinstall driver.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To Disable Driver Signing in Windows 7 Using Group Policy Editor, Follow the below steps.</div>
<ul>
<li>Click on Start, then click on run, type gpedit.msc to open the local group’s policy editor.</li><li>Expand ‘Administrative Templates’ (it’s under ‘User Configuration’). Expand ‘System’. Click ‘Driver Installation’.</li><li>In the right panel, double click on ‘Code Signing for Device Drivers’.</li><li>Choose ‘Enabled’ in the window that appears. In the underlying options, choose ‘Ignore’. This disables drivers signing in Windows 7, and now you can install unsigned drivers in Windows.</li><li>Click Apply, OK. Restart your computer to install unsigned drivers.</li></ul>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>If the above suggestion didn’t work you can post your query in Xbox Forums. </p>

<h2>            Win 7 TCP&#47;IP v4 DNS static entry keeps returning</h2>
                    <p>Windows 7 Ultimate x64 </p>
<p>My Wireless TCP/IP v4 DNS settings keep reverting back to specific static entries.</p>
<p>I select "Obtain DNS settings automatically" save it and when I go back to check it has gone back to the same static entries that were there before.</p>
<p>I have reset the TCP/IP stack and catalog with the netsh then restarted the PC several times to no avail.
</p>
<p>I have manually edited the HKLM\SYSTEM|CurrentControlSet\services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\{C95193B5-261F-4B95-BA29-C5A066A1A3EE}&nbsp;&nbsp; registry entries where I found the IPs.</p>
<p>This is happening on any network I connect to wirelessly. I connect to many different wireless networks&nbsp;and it's not specific to any one network it happens on all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This one has me stumped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone know where these manual enties are&nbsp;populating from or how to make a TCP/IP protocol reset actually work?</p>

<p><span>Let us try these methods to check the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Boot the computer in safe mode with networking and check the status.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Disable firewall and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Turn Windows Firewall on or off</span></b><span>:

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: You should
 not turn off Windows Firewall unless you have another firewall enabled. Turning off Windows Firewall might make your computer (and your network, if you have one) more vulnerable to damage from worms or hackers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Run a full computer scan with the Microsoft Safety Scanner to make sure that the computer is virus
 free.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Microsoft Safety Scanner</span></b><span>:

<p><b><span>Safety Scanner Disclaimer</span></b><span>:
 There could be a loss of data while performing a scan using Microsoft safety scanner to eliminate virus if any.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 4.</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refer to this article to check if this helps.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 5.</span></b></p>
<p><span>If this does not help, try the following.</span></p>
<p><span>Click Start, type: CMD. Right click CMD and click Run as administrator.</span></p>
<p><span>At the command prompt, type:”<b> ipconfig/release</b>”.</span></p>
<p><span>Then “<b>ipconfig/renew</b>”.</span></p>
<p><span>Also type:”<b> ipconfig/flushdns”.</b></span></p>
<p><span>Type exit to close the command prompt, and restart the system.</span></p>
<p><span>See if the problem is resolved.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 6.</span></b></p>
<p><span>1.Click
<b>Start</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>2.Click

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 7.</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform SFC scan and check if that helps. The

    <title>Windows 10 update disabled usb mouse and keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tedung  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update disabled usb mouse and keyboard</h2>
                    <p>Acer Aspire 603G with Microsoft wireless mouse 1454 and keyboard 1455 running Windows 10 10240 TH1 Pro. Mouse, Keyboard and USB ports worked in the morning, dead in the afternoon after idle time update (I bet). Restart, power switch shut downs give nothing
 but the pretty start-up screen. Without mouse and keyboard there seems no way to proceed. All keys including "Delete" and "F12" get no response. Mouse shows no cursor; click does not get login box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Ted,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now try to use a external keyboard and mouse and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the external keyboard and mouse works, this issue might be caused due to the recent drivers update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you get access to the&nbsp; desktop, try to install Microsoft mouse and keyboard center and the check the mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To download Microsoft mouse and keyboard centre, refer to the below link:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps.</p>

            <p>I was forced updated today and normally I can roll back my computer and fix this. Now I cannot. I have total access to the bios and the mouse and keyboard (both sub) are disabled when I get to Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>keep in mind I allowed the most recent update to apply before I attempted rollback. Now I have a paper weight as I cannot get any function once Windows wakes up and takes over. Please advise</p>

<p>Same thing just happened to me- all USB ports non-op after windows starts.<br />

Were you ever able to resolve the issue?&nbsp; I'm not finding anything on it that is helpful.</p>

<p>My problem occurred in 2015. Nothing I did helped, but the subsequent update fixed it. I am sorry to say I have no clue.</p>

    <title>Exe. Application Will Not Run. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kimorialyesse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exe. Application Will Not Run.</h2>
                    <p>I have my application I've downloaded, and it's a RAR file.&nbsp; I used a program named winrar to extract. It did. No virus was detected. the file is good.&nbsp; It's right here on my laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the Exe application, nothing pops up. Not even an error message. I did right-click on the application to see if its blocked. It's not.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I decided to run it as admin. - doesn't work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to my windows firewall and added the program onto the list. Once I did that, I went back to my desktop and clicked on the program. It still didn't work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I tried another solution. I thought to myself "mmmmhh.... maybe I might have a malware somewhere on my computer that's probably preventing the exe program to launch." What I did is I started researching. I've seen somewhere on this microsoft to do the
 registry fix. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did. I did the services.msc. the change exefile to 1 percent. ALL that. I restarted my laptop and try to run the program. Nothing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I kept clicking and clicking and clicking over and over on the program to get it to launch. NOTHING. No error displaying nothing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to try another solution which is - I downloaded 7 zip and re-extract the file. When I did I got an error message displaying</p>
<p>" Can not update file. </p>
<p>'C:\Users\Kim\Appdata\Local\Temp\7zOCE6A20f0\(name of program).exe</p>
<p>Read-only</p>
<p>C:\Users\Kim\Downloads\(name of program).rar\ "</p>
<p>
</p><p>what does this mean?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HP NOTEBOOK (ENERGY)</p>
<p>Avast secureline (protecting my line when I use the internet) </p>
<p>McAfee antivirus ( It came with the purchase of this laptop) </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did updated my net framework to 4.2 the newer versions'. All my drivers are up to date.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did mange to download DLLSuite 9.0 to see if I was missing any DLL files or if anything was messed up. I did the scan and I got this message displaying the error.</p>
<p>" .SYS</p>
<p>pcmastercoredrv.sys [THE PATH] its in system32\drivers "</p>
<p>The file verison of pcmastercoredrv.sys is 1.2.6.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't know what to do at this point. I even went onto youtube and seen this 1 person using the same program I use and that person have windows 10 as well.. I really not for sure why it can not launch fully on my laptop.
<br />
</p>
<p>Can someone please help me. I really need the help.&nbsp; I really will not mind skyping with someone who can help me out with this. IF
</p>
<p>INTERESTED in skyping please let me know.</p>

            Seeing that this is a third-party application rather than a native Windows app, your best bet would be to get in touch with the program's supplier.

            You really need to let us know the name and version of application. Otherwise, the best option is to contact the software developer to find out about Windows 10 support.
