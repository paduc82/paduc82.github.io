<h2>            Windows 8.1 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I've tried downloading the Windows 8.1 Pro with Media Center upgrade to my Windows 8.0 machine today.
</p>
<p>It went through the initial process OK, but when it restarted to boot up 8.1 I got a blue error screen saying "Windows has encountered a problem, your PC will restart", It restarted again and opened normally, but I got the following message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The upgrade to Windows 8.1 has been unsuccessful your previous version has been reinstalled"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And&nbsp;it had the following error code - "0xC1900101 - 0x20017"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<h2>            Getting VPN Error 809 when using IKEv2 and machine certificates</h2>
                    <p>The 809 message "talks" about problems with a Firewall blocking UDP ports 500 &amp; 4500 (NAT Transversal)
</p>
<p>However my windows 7 client (Professional 64 bit) firewall is TURNED OFF.</p>
<p>The firewall in my at&amp;t Pace 4111n wan-router is set to allow UDP 500 &amp; 4500 packets thru.
</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a way to trace the UDP packets from the nic in&nbsp;my win7 client to the pace 4111n wan-router?
</p>
<p>I'd like to set up a trace, then issue the VPN connect. </p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 Create a Recovery Drive Image - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keithss  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Create a Recovery Drive Image</h2>
                    I've checked this forum before posting. The Windows 8.1 recovery drive image wizard indicated I needed a 16MB flash drive to create. After running it, it does NOT ask me for another drive to create&nbsp;the image for my approx. 60 GB of data&nbsp;on my C: drive.&nbsp;
 Can this be correct? Did the wizard compress 60GB of data onto a 16GB hard drive? Please advise. Thank you.&nbsp;

Normally, when you create a Recovery drive for troubleshooting purposes, it will only be 512MB allowing you to use a low capacity USB pen drive. There is an option to copy the data from the laptop's own Recovery partition, but if you go that route, you'll only
 be duplicating the one which is already installed on the machine.<br />
<br />
See this article on how to create a Recovery drive: <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/ouc1too/archive/2013/10/22/windows-8-1-upgrade-reboots-to-black-screen-of-nothingness.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://blogs.technet.com/b/ouc1too/archive/2013/10/22/windows-8-1-upgrade-reboots-to-black-screen-of-nothingness.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Take note though that the link provides instructions on how to troubleshoot a startup issue and therefore it's not intended that you follow those instructions since you don't have that issue.<br />
<br />
A system image on the other hand is rather like a screenshot in that it contains the system state as it was when you created it. So for example, if you were to create a system image today and then in six months time you use that to restore the operating system,
 what you'll get is the system state as it is today. This means you'll have to update Windows with all the security patches, hotfixes etc., which were released between now and six months time.<br />
<br />
To create a system image as opposed to a Recovery drive, you'll need a much larger capacity storage unit. That's not a problem these days and even a 500GB external hard drive will only set you back about $60. But it's inadvisable to save a system image to the
 same hard drive that the operating system is already installed on because if the drive fails, you lose everything.<br />
<br />
But as I already mentioned, most laptops ship these days with a Recovery partition which you access with a certain key or key combination when the machine boots up.
<br />
<br />
You didn't mention the make and model of your own machine, so here's a list of laptops and the key combinations needed to access the Recovery partition and how to use it:

            A Recovery Drive doesn't contain a system image, just the tools to access a system image on an external hard drive or the factory restore partition on your hard drive. To make a System Image--also a compressed file--go to File History to create it on an
 external hard drive or on the network or a second separate hard drive on a desktop computer. The Recovery Drive can contain the Factory Restore file to return to original factory settings if your computer came with windows 8. If you upgraded to Windows 8.1
 from windows 7, skip the factory restore copy because it is no longer usable since it had Windows 7 factory settings.
<div><br />
<div>Be sure to test the recovery drive to make sure you can boot to it and access the Recovery Tools. Cancel and backout of it before restoring anything.</div>

<h2>            Use of OneDrive and One Note with VPN</h2>
                    How do I get my OneDrives and OneNote to work with a VPN?&nbsp; This is a very odd problem to have.&nbsp; On both my Surface Pro (5) and Surface Pro 3, when I connect to a VPN, I lose the ability to sync my OneDrive and OneNote accounts.&nbsp; I have this problem with
 both Witopia and NordVPN, so I think the issue lies with Microsoft.&nbsp; With the way that Microsoft pushes the "Cloud" this should be no problem at all; who wants to connect to the cloud in a public environment and not use a VPN.&nbsp; All the posted issue comments/solutions
 that I have read are confusing beyond belief.&nbsp; This should just simply not be a problem.&nbsp; What is Microsoft doing to fix this and when can I expect the fix?

<br />
<br />Unfortunately, OneDrive is not supported over VPN at this time, but I recommend you send in Feedback so the engineers can maybe change this in future.

<p>Hi Andre,&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp; That answer seems strange.&nbsp; Why would one need to expose their Microsoft activity to others when using a public internet connection?&nbsp; Does Microsoft think this is a good idea?&nbsp; With the Microsoft emphasis on the use of the "Cloud" (which I find
 sometimes very annoying - especially when there is no way to make a connection), I would think security would also be a concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, I do not seem to have issues with accessing my Microsoft services when using a VPN on my Android devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>

            <p>No, its not compatible with Windows Easy Transfer.</p>
<p>You could try copying the Files and Settings transfer backup locally to the drive and attempt the extraction from there.
</p>
<p>If that does not work, your best option is to do the backup properly. </p>
<p>With Windows Easy Transfer, when you do the backup, you have the option of restoring the backup of your personal data and settings in an existing account or have the wizard create a new account.

</p><p>A few days ago a new insider build came out - 10525.</p>

You don't want build 10525 on a 64 bit system. It's 32-bit only unfortunately so any memory over 4GB is wasted.

            <p>Okay. That's not that bad then. With regards to getting the builds, are you set to receive the builds via the Fast or Slow Ring? 10525 has not been released to the Slow ring yet. Only the Fast ring has received it thus far.<br />
<br />
Go into the Advanced Settings again and at the bottom of the page you will see Build Speed. Use the Drop menu and select Fast. Just keep in mind that you would experience bugs from time to time as these are technically "beta" versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been beta testing since Win 95 and as long as you create system restore points and/or back up your data, you'll be fine.<br />
<br />
Switch to the Fast Ring and then restart your system and run Update once again. If you don't get it tonight, don't worry. You very likely will tomorrow.</p>

            Yes. The only thing that does not work is scann to computer, although sometimes it works once when I first hook it up.&nbsp; Everything else works fine.&nbsp; The workaround I use is to get a memory card which slips into the computer (less than $10), and then use
 the printer control to scan.&nbsp; My computer will then read the memory card as an external drive, and I can then do whatever I want on the computer.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can just slip the memory chip into the computer.<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<p><span>It checks for common issues and makes sure that any new device or hardware attached to your computer was installed correctly.</span></p>

 every device under the Universal Serial Bus controllers node, and then click Uninstall to remove them one at a time.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 the computer, and then Windows will reinstall the USB controllers.</span></p>

<h2>            cursor hopping around</h2>
                    I have a Dell&nbsp;laptop 64 bit with Windows 7. The cursor keeps hopping around when I'm typing. One second I'm typing in Word and suddenly the cursor has vanished along with some of what I was typing. It is as if&nbsp;someone had clicked the mouse in a different
 window.&nbsp;This is a real pain. How do I fix it?

            Thank you Sandeep.
<div>I am afraid these links were ultimately not helpful. But I did solve the problem during a chat session with McAfee tech support.</div>
<div>
<div><b>Here's what happened.</b></div>
<div>In addition to this cursor issue I have been experiencing my computer going to sleep (black screen) and when I move the touch pad or hit a key it wakes up and goes immediately dark again. I can't get out of this with out shutting the laptop down and waiting
 a few minutes before restarting. My McAfee virus software also didn't work properly anymore.&nbsp;</div>
<div>After many hours on chat with Dell, Microsoft etc. I was finally talking to a gentleman at McAfee. He helped me to downgrade from Explorer 9 to Explorer 8 and not only were all the issues with McAfee solved but the cursor and sleeping problems are gone
 as well.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I was not expecting this but I am grateful for a solution.</div>
<div>I just wanted to pass this on in case it's helpful to anyone else.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again,</div>

    <title>Windows 16 bit subsystem virtual device driver invalid - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> masoncajun  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 16 bit subsystem virtual device driver invalid</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7 professional and use a card program from 20 years ago.&nbsp; Recently when trying to start it I get an error message that the Wiindows 16 bit subsystem virtual device driver is invalid.&nbsp;&nbsp; Various web notes indicate that this needs to be reset
 in the registry, but these messages are old and the instructions do not correspond to the msdos edit commands in the regedt32 windows boxes that come up in my Windows version.&nbsp; Can anyone explain how to fix this?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I recently had great difficulty with the upgrade to Adaware and uninstalled it.&nbsp; I gather this likely caused the problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            I had this the same problem with this card making program after running adaware on my Windows 7 computer. The instructions at&nbsp;
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/254914" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/254914</a>&nbsp;fixed it for me.&nbsp;<span>Those instructions are for an older version
 of windows and in my registry, the "VirtualDeviceDrivers" key was missing completely so the steps I actually performed were changed slightly as follows:</span>
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Start Registry Editor by clicking Windows
<b>Start Button</b>, type <b>regedit</b> and press <b>Enter</b>.</li><li>Locate and click on the following key:
<div><b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control</b></div>
</li><li>On the&nbsp;<b>Edit</b>&nbsp;menu, click
<b>New&gt;Key</b></li><li>Newly created key should be selected and waiting for you to type its name. Type
<b>VirtualDeviceDrivers </b>and press enter.&nbsp;</li><li>With newly created key still selected, click&nbsp;<b>Edit&gt;New&gt;Multi-String Value</b></li><li>Newly created value should be selected and waiting for you to type its name.&nbsp;Type&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">VDD</span>&nbsp;and press
<b>Enter</b>.</li><li>Quit Registry Editor.</li></ol>
<div>After restarting my computer (which may or may not be necessary), my calendar making program worked like normal once again. Hope that helps you.</div>

<h2>            Photos app keeps re-syncing a folder I remove from it</h2>
                    <p>I've had Windows 10 installed for a couple of days now, and whilst the Photos app is a nice add-on, I've hit a few snags with it. It keeps syncing the main photos folder into the app, even after I remove the pathway so it doesn't sync again. The picture
 folder has some sensitive documents stored in it (Like backups of personal details) that I don't want to make public to anyone who might use the PC and browse in the Photos app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried removing all folders, but they just get re synced after a reboot. I've tried adding a different folder along with removing the others, but said folder reappears. Is there any way to fix this?</p>

            &nbsp;Hi Michael,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I appreciate your interest on windows 10.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I understand the inconvenience you faced. We certainly help you with this issue.</div>
<div>I want to inform you When you disable auto arrange, and either unzip a file in a folder, move a folder, or rename a folder, it will refresh and auto arrange the files in that specific folder only after each time you do this. Auto arrange is still disabled
 for that folder, but you will need to arrange the files back to whatever non-auto arranged order you like again after unzipping a file in a folder, move a folder, or rename a folder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to follow the below link to fix issue.</div>

            <p>I am sorry, but I cannot find any options for Auto Arrange in a folder.&nbsp; I see it for the Desk Top icons, but not in a File Explorer window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not change any settings.&nbsp; The file list has always resorted itself immediately after renaming a file in Windows 7 and Windows 8.&nbsp; But it is not doing so in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a setting for Auto Arrange in a File Explorer window, can you tell me where to find it?</p>

<h2>            XBOX WONT REFUND ME&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So apparently if you havent owned the game for a certain amount of days (20?) and havent played it for more than 2 hours you can get a refund if you are not happy with the product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS IS NOT TRUE!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The game CRASH TEAM RACING has just come out. Ive played it for 1 hour tops and Xbox are refusing to refund me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So annoyed right now... One of thier selling points is their consumer friendly attitude but I guess thats all changing..</p>

<p>Typically even if I don't like something I purchased I don't try to get refunds, but I remember someone saying that you have to have a good reason to ask for a refund.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't quite think "I don't like the game" is enough of a reason for them to have to refund it to you. Since that usually falls into the customer's job to research a game and make a decision to purchase based on if the game looks like something they'd enjoy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you find a specific reason for refunding, you may have better luck. Such as a game stating it has online co-op when it actually doesn't, or something along those lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck, but maybe check out some gameplay or something before purchasing a game next 5ime.</p>

    <title>Help&#58; Post-HomeGroup File Sharing Troubleshooting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> no idlady  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help&#58;  Post-HomeGroup File Sharing Troubleshooting</h2>
                    <p>I need some help, please, figuring out why we're having issues accessing files previously shared with HomeGroup following the April features (1803) update.&nbsp; I'm optimistic I'm missing something simple &amp; that there's an easy fix.&nbsp; I do understand that HomeGroup
 was removed in 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I'm not sure how to explain, I'll boil it down to one concrete example -- please ask if more info is needed -- between a wired Win 10 Pro desktop (Ethernet to a switch to the router) and a Win 10 Pro SP3 (wi-fi to a WAP that connects to the router
 via Ethernet).&nbsp; You could multiply this problem by 8 or so because we have a 7 wired desktops and 8 wi-fi Surface Pros &amp; laptops (all running Win 10 Pro) and all in the same workgroup, which IIRC, is left over from pre-HomeGroup times.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Files from all were shared with each other through HomeGroup prior to the 1803 Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first snag was that the update didn't hit all the machines at the same time, which broke our HomeGroup.&nbsp; Yikes.&nbsp; So, then I updated all the machines &amp; thought that would resolve things.&nbsp; It didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the simple example is this.&nbsp; On PC1, going to File Explorer, Network, the SP3 1 shows up as a Computer -- double-clicking it takes me directly to all the shared resources with no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, on SP3 1, going to File Explorer, Network, <strong>no</strong> Computers show up -- there isn't even a Computer category.&nbsp; The only categories are:&nbsp; Media Devices, Multifunction Devices, Other Devices, Printers, Scanners 😢&nbsp; PC1 shows up as a media
 device, but clicking on it only opens Media Player -- it doesn't show the shared files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Why isn't there a Computer section in File Explorer, Network on the SPs &amp; laptops like there is on the desktop computers?</strong>&nbsp; I'm suspecting it has something to do with the fact that the laptops &amp; SPs are using wi-fi rather than Ethernet, but
 I have no idea what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As described&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4091368/windows-10-homegroup-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">towards the bottom here,</a> I think (haven't tried all the folders) I can get to the shared files on the wi-fi laptops
 &amp; SPs <span>"<span>in File Explorer by typing the name of the PC and the shared folder name in this format:
</span></span><em>\\homePC\SharedFolderName."</em>&nbsp; Honestly, though, it's not at all practical for anyone here other than me to remember all those paths.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA for any assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            As you noted, Homegroup has been discontinued with the release of Windows 10 1803. Your best option is to use a basic peer to peer workgroup network with Public File Sharing and Permissions. Learn more:

<br />Expand All Networks
<br />Under Password protected sharing
<br />
<br />Switch between 'Turn on password protected sharing and Turn off password protected sharing' 
<br />
<br />Then choose 'Turn off password protected sharing' 
<br />
<br />Then click 'Save changes'
<br />
<br />Also:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: optionalfeatures.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support
<br />Tick the SMB 1.0/CIFS Client
<br />Untick SMB 1.0/CIFS Automatic Removal and
<br />Untick SMB 1.0/CIFS Server
<br />
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />Restart if prompted. 
<br />
<br />Microsoft apparently has a workaround which does not require enabling SMBv1, for those who rely on the ability to 'browse' the network.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4034314/smbv1-is-not-installed-by-default-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/403431...</a>
<br />
<br />Explorer Network Browsing
<br />
<br />The Computer Browser service relies on the SMBv1 protocol to populate the Windows Explorer Network node (also known as "Network Neighborhood"). This legacy protocol is long deprecated, doesn't route, and has limited security. Because the service cannot function without SMBv1, it is removed at the same time.
<br />
<br />However, if you still have to use the Explorer Network in home and small business workgroup environments to locate Windows-based computers, you can follow these steps on your Windows-based computers that no longer use SMBv1:
<br />Start the "Function Discovery Provider Host" and "Function Discovery Resource Publication" services, and then set them to Automatic (Delayed Start). When you open Explorer Network, enable network discovery when you are prompted.
<br />
<br />All Windows devices within that subnet that have these settings will now appear in Network for browsing. This uses the WS-DISCOVERY protocol. Contact your other vendors and manufacturers if their devices still don't appear in this browse list after the Windows devices appear. It is possible they have this protocol disabled or that they support only SMBv1.
<br />
<br />Additional troubleshooting steps you can apply:
<br />
<br />- Try browsing to some of the computers manually, press Windows key + R, type: \\computername, hit Enter
<br />- Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />1. Start the "Function Discovery Provider Host" and "Function Discovery Resource Publication" services, and then set them toAutomatic (Delayed Start).
<br />2. When you open Explorer Network, enable network discovery when you are prompted.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X &gt; computer management--&gt;shared folders--&gt; choose the shared folder, right click it then click Properties &gt; Share Permissions --&gt;protection that everyone can read and execute, see folder contents and read permissions.

<p>Andre, thanks for your detailed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I'd read somewhere that MS&nbsp;<strong>strongly</strong> advised not to enable SMBv1, so I'm confused about the . . . wisdom of having to enable it to regain a functional network?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another question, if I might.&nbsp; Back in the Dark Ages &lt;g&gt;, our network was originally set up using workgroups (that is, all computers were in the same workgroup) to share files &amp; resources like printers, scanners, NAS, and the like.&nbsp; Then along came HomeGroup,
 and we switched to that . . . and it worked flawlessly.&nbsp; Now, HomeGroup is gone.&nbsp; I'm wondering if the problem is that somehow settings (or whatever) have become hopelessly messed up &amp; that's why the instructions&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4092694/windows-10-changes-to-file-sharing-over-a-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MS
 provides here</a> aren't working in our environment?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If</strong> that's the case, is there a way to basically start from scratch and see of that gets functionality back?&nbsp; Is there some way to unshare everything on all the computers, get rid of the old workgroup, create a new workgroup (if that's even
 needed in Windows 10), and then set all the shares up from scratch?&nbsp; I really am just getting pretty desperate to get things working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've forgotten more than I ever knew about networking -- back in the old days, I was pretty good at configuring things, but since switching to HomeGroup back with W7 (IIRC), I've just not had to think about process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>EDIT AFTER BEING REFFERED TO THIS THREAD: I DON'T RUN TWO MONITORS ANYMORE. PROBLEM IS STILL THERE WITH THE PERFORMANCE.<br />
<br />
I have a SP3 running 10. I also have a Docking Station.<br />
<br />
Since I got the docking station last year, when the SP3 is docked, the performance&nbsp;is absolutely laggish, slow, takes forever to open anything, and overall - severly frustrating. Severely. Not only that but the fan runs constantly while the unit is docked,
 even when no program is running or updating or uploading. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was running an additional monitor with it at the time that was really low res compared with the SP3, and thought that maybe have that hooked up was tasking the SP3 - hence the chugging. Removed said monitor, running solo in docking station, problem is
 still there. <br />
<br />
I went and I updated all software and check all my drivers - good and good - up to date.&nbsp;Problem still there. :/<br />
<br />
Thing is, is that this unit is a replacement only a month old, having replaced an original SP3 that had different defect... but also had the exact. same. issue. of performing awfully in the docking station.<br />
<br />
What am I missing here?<br />
<br />
P.s. and for a bonus that could be another question, my fan sounds like a lightsaber when I move the unit only a little bit, like it's hitting something and I am super careful with my unit.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone!<br />

    <title>USB driver malfunction__ - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB driver malfunction__</h2>
                    USB driver malfunction (win 7 problem) - ?randomly renewing itself?<br />
A USB device will disconnect and connect momentarily (within about 3-10 min <strong>
of use</strong> ) with out any physical changes happening. It only happens to <strong>
all</strong> my windows 7 computers. It is more common with USB printers, USB mass storage devices, and USB mice so far. It doesn't happen to all the devices connected, just one of them, for example: on computer A I have - USB printer, USB mouse, USB flash
 drive, USB HDD (the only one affected is the USB HDD); Computer B - USB mouse, USB printer, USB keybord, USB flash drive (the only one affected is the USB mouse); Computer C - "same setup" (only the USB printer is affected).<br />
I have determined it is not a hardware issue, it is something with windows 7 I can't explain.

<p><span>Hi ,</span></p>
<p><span>Unplug the devices and plug into different ports.</span></p>
<p><span>Uninstall the device driver from device manager and restart the computer. Computer will recognize the device and install drivers automatically.</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;Go to device manager and right click on the flash drive and click uninstall.<br />
</span><span>2. Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer this link to troubleshoot problems with USB devices:</span></p>

</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This link is for Windows Vista but it also applies for Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>This can also happen if there is not enough power supply for the USBs. Check with minimal USB devices.</span></p>
<p><span>Also make sure your chipset drivers are up to date and also update your BIOS.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 screen is stretched&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 screen is stretched&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Like many others have said - my screen is stretched and squashed horizontally and everything looks awful with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've followed advice on other posts and so far I have:</p>
<p>- tried to update the driver through device manager and it is up to date - nothing changed</p>
<p>- uninstalled the display adapter through device manager and restarted - nothing changed</p>
<p>- changed the screen resolution (and tried every single option) - nothing changed</p>
<p>- checked everything is correctly plugged in - nothing changed</p>
<p>- installed windows updates - nothing changed</p>
<p>- the text is at 100% in display settings (this isn't even relevent because it has nothing to do with the size of the text, it's the shape - it's stretched out and squashed because of resolution issues. I've seen this suggested 1000 times and it has nothing
 to do with the problem)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a new computer that came with Windows 10 so I can't revert back, I need this issue solved.</p>

<p>Hello shunoichi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I missed thinking about the video resolution problem. Have you changed monitors?</p>

            <p>It's a new computer, as I said.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it's not an issue with the monitor, as I explained above. I've seen the screen behave normally and work unstretched during the update screen. And when it had restarted it was back to the stretched screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen dozens of people with the same issue, many of them posted here and no one has helped resolve this issue and almost everyone has had the issue because they had installed Windows 10. As I said, this is a new computer so I don't have the option of
 reverting back.</p>

            Had the same problem. We changed the screen resolution and it seems to be fixed.&nbsp; I don't know if you've tried this but go to Settings, click System, go to Display tab, click Advanced Setting Display, and makes sure the resolution is on the recommended
 setting (1366x786 for&nbsp;our computer).&nbsp; This might work for you or not. I'm not an IT person so I don't know, but I figured I share what we did at my office.&nbsp; Good Luck!

<p>The first part, win+R, I'd seen on every forum I've visited. Nothing changes.</p>
