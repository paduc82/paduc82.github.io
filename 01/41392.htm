                    <p>I'm trying to add my gamertag to my sons friends list but says that we are already friends? but go onto his friends list and I'm not there! I've tried numerous things, reset the xbox, reset the router, changed his privacy settings, deleted my profile off the console nothing makes a difference. Any ideas as to why this is?</p>

<h2>            Child&#38;&#35;39&#59;s Friend List</h2>
                    
<p>My son has been trying to add his friend on his Xbox 360 for days now. We went through the whole process where he adds the friend, it asks for my password, I put it in, and then it just says "Friend Request Pending". I have checked other posts and have checked
 that his account is a child account and not a custom account, and it is definitely a child. On the PC, we can see the new friend, but on the console, he does not show up, and my son cannot reply to messages from his new friend because the console still says
 that he is not a friend. I have even tried changing my son's permissions so that he does not need my permission to add a friend, deleting the request on the console, and re-adding, and it still not only asks for my permission, but still will not add the friend.
 Now, when my son tries to sign onto his own profile online, it just gives him an error. It gives him an error also when he tries to click on the friend's profile. What is happening?? Please help!!</p>

            <p>Hey, it sounds as though your son is trying to add someone who has an Xbox One. &nbsp;In order for him to accept the request he'll either need to do so from a 360 console (or do it when he's playing an Xbox 360 backwards compatible game) or from the website.</p>
<p>Your son should let him know this.</p>

<h2>            Mail, Calendar and People App not installing on windows 8.1</h2>
                    I was facing an issue with the mail app after upgrading to 8.1. The problem was that none of the e-mail accounts were getting synced. I have logged in with a Microsoft Account, not a local account. Internet is working fine and the accounts are intact and
 receiving mails. Hence I un-installed the app. then while trying to install the app from the store, it gives the following error code:&nbsp;0x80072f78
<div><br />
</div>
<div>No other app is installing as well!! giving the same error code. Prior to this I have downloaded and installed apps on the store.</div>

<h2>            How to make external hard drive the main download drive&#63;</h2>
                    hey everyone! This is just a simple question. I have a two terabyte external hard drive on my xbox one console. It already has games on it. When I formatted it quite a few months ago, I didn't click the option "Install new things here!". At that time I
 didn't think it was necessary because I didn't have a lot of games. But now how do I changed it now that I want to make it to main drive for downloading and installing new stuff there without reformatting it? I thought I saw the option before but I can't find
 it now. :-)

<p>Hi DogRox1,</p>
<p>you can manage storage via &gt; Settings &gt; System, then select Manage storage. </p>
<p>Also as an extra tip to manage existing games in My games &amp; apps highlight a game or app, press the Menu button on your controller, and then select Manage game. You will then be able to move or copy content between storage devices.</p>
<p>That should help you sort stuff out! </p>

<p>thanks for the reply, as before I went to the &gt;Settings&gt;System&gt;Manage Storage, that's where I thought it was also, but when I select the external hard drive the only options I get, are just View contents and format. It does not give me the option to select
 it as the main download drive. so I'm not sure exactly where the setting is to set it as the main drive.</p>
<p>as far as copying and moving gamed and files back and forth I already know how to do that I've been doing that since I've had it. :-)</p>

<p>Hi DogRox1,</p>
<p>in the manage storage section the drive where installs go to by default should have a blue triangle in the corner. I have the same setup - when i select the internal drive I get the 'install here by default' option as my external is default.
</p>
<p>If you don't get that option when you select it and the blue triangle is on the internal drive please post back as we might have to see if other troubleshooting will help.</p>

<p>yep, you are RIGHT!!! &nbsp;:-) &nbsp;Well, &nbsp;except it's not blue, &nbsp;it's green on mine, cuz I never changed the colour theme of my dashboard. Haha :-).... and the external drive has the triangle on the top right hand corner. &nbsp;apparently I may have already set it and
 didn't realize it, that's why it wasn't showing me the option to change it. but the internal one has the option because it doesn't have the triangle. :-) &nbsp; I just don't remember ever changing it. &nbsp;THANKS Doode!!! :-)</p>

<p>hi, I'm just up dating my post about the external hard drive., as found a new issue. It seems that when I set the Power and Startup set to "Instant On", and the setting "When Xbox is off turn off storage", is unchecked, and I'm using the external hard drive
 at the main download hard drive. When I'm downloading updates, games or DLC it seems to NOT want to work automatically in sleep mode when I shut the Xbox off. Although the power light stays on the power supply, and still connected to network, as I can see
 the light on my switcher, i notice the external hard drive power is off. and nothing is getting downloaded. updates and DLC do not get downloaded to the external hard drive in instant on mode? &nbsp;it seems I have to put it back into energy saving mode before
 I start downloading, and let the Xbox stay on the whole time. is there another setting that I missing to fix this?</p>

<p>Hey again!</p>
<p>If the light on the power brick is white then instant on should be set up (it is orange if you use energy saver).</p>
<p>A couple of things to try. First switch the default install drive back to the internal one in settings then switch off (to instant on mode). Then head to store.xbox.com and 'buy' a free demo for something. You should hear your xbox start do do something
 once it receives the download details. Wait a few mins then turn the xbox back on and check your download queue.</p>
<p>If whatever you chose from the store is there and downloading then its the HDD, otherwise its a setting somewhere!</p>
<p>Some HDD's seem to have problems with sleeping/waking so - its not consistent and probably related to the drives firmware. I would suggest you have a quick look online with your make/model number to see if other xbox users have had issues. There might be
 a firmware update available to sort it.</p>
<p>Hope that helps! :)</p>

<p>okay instant on mode is already off because that's your way to get it to work with external hard drive it's an energy mode right now. And I have to keep the x box on in order for it to download to that hard drive. So you're saying leave the instant on mode
 off and keep it on energy mode, and try to download to the internal hard drive? if it works with the external hard drive then it should work with the internal hard drive doing it that way shouldn't it? Because it does work with the external hard drive with
 it on energy mode</p>

<p>OK to clarify, below are the power modes you can choose from in settings:</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<b>Save Energy</b>&nbsp;option uses less power. However, the console powers down instead of going into sleep mode. Therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>The console will take longer to turn on. </li><li>You cannot turn on the console using voice commands. It will only turn on when you press the&nbsp;<b>Xbox</b>&nbsp;button on the console or on the controller.
</li><li>The console cannot automatically download system updates. You must manually accept system updates when you turn on the console, then wait while the system downloads and installs system updates.
</li></ul>
<p><span>The&nbsp;</span><b>Instant-On</b><span>&nbsp;option uses more power. However, the console goes into sleep mode instead of turning off. Therefore:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>The console ‚Äúwakes up‚Äù much faster (2 seconds). </li><li>The console automatically downloads and installs system updates. You don‚Äôt have to wait for updates to download and install.
</li><li>You can ‚Äúwake up‚Äù the system just by saying ‚Äú<b>Xbox On</b>‚Äù as you enter the room. All the devices needed (TVs, audio receivers) will turn on, the Kinect sensor can identify you for sign-in and you can enjoy your Xbox One experience immediately.
</li></ul>
<p>You need to be in <strong>Instant On</strong> mode for downloads to work when the box is 'off'</p>
<p><b>Note</b>&nbsp;When you choose&nbsp;<b>Instant-On</b>, you‚Äôll have additional power management options:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Wake up Xbox by saying&nbsp;</b>‚Äú<b>Xbox on</b>‚Äù.<b>&nbsp;</b>This allows you to use your voice to power on your Xbox One console.
</li><li><b>Automatically download updates and purchases</b>.<b>&nbsp;</b>This allows you to download games and apps that you purchased on the web to install on your home Xbox.
</li><li><b>When Xbox is off, turn off storage</b>.<b>&nbsp;</b>This setting adjusts the behavior of your external storage device. If you‚Äôre seeing problems with your external storage device, we recommend leaving this option deselected.
</li></ul>
<p>I think the key bit might be that last line!</p>

<p>yes that's what I'm trying to tell you, &nbsp;instant on mode does not work. When I put it in instant on mode and I uncheck if Xbox is off turn off storage. That way when I turn the Xbox off I don't want the external storage to turn off but it seems to do that
 anyways. When I turn off the Xbox to download the DLCs or updates whatever, the power light on the power supply is white, the network is still trying to download the files because I could still see the network switcher blinking but the external hard drive
 is not powered on. &nbsp;So &nbsp;yes I know all about the instant on and the energy mode.

<h2>            Skype for windows 10 not working properly</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest windows 10 version of Skype is terrible. It is usually not possible to answer calls, there are many issues some examples:</p>
<p>
</p><p>if the application is running on a smartphone as well it rings on the smartphone and it is not possible to answer on the PC,</p>
<p>you can't here the dial tone if you ring from the PC and it is hard to know if the other party answered the call,</p>
<p>you can't see the status of the other person,</p>
<p>and more. The overall behavior is much worse that what has been before so my usage of Skype that was my favorite before is very minimal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible installing an old version?</p>
<p>Do Microsoft considering of bringing it to the same level as before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not only my personal impression, all my friend that used Skype before considering of stop using it because of this major downgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eitan</p>

<p>I have the same problem (with Windows 10)</p>
<p>When someone is calling on Skype my Android and Iphone register the call and the answer buttons on my PC disappear and so I have to answer on either the Android or Iphone, tell the caller to hang up and then call rhem from the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any options other than signing out of Skype on my phones?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has not always been a problem, not sure what has caused the change.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to hear about your issue on the Skype for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it is possible to use the Skype classic version, but first may i know what kind of Skype version that is installed on your Windows 10 device? And is this happening to one specific contact or Multiple Skype contacts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will wait for your response.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have the same problem. I'm using version 12.10.572.0 and it happens with all contacts who try to call me when i have skype running on my android phone and desktop at the same time (it rings on phone and doesn't allow me to answer on desktop).</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype version is 12.10.572.0 I believe is the latest. This issue is not related to specific contact, usually it is not possible to answer calls on the PC especially is it rings on the phone, sometimes it not rings on the PC only on the phone and sometimes
 it not ring at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried installing the legacy - it looks much better! I would recommend anyone to use this version and not the windows 10 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>

<h2>            XDCAM EX Clip browser won&#39;t run in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Using SONY XDCAM EX Clip browser v2.6 on HP workstation to import footage from XDCAM EX3 broadcast camera. Used to work fine in Windows 7 Pro but fails to run in Windows 10 pro with "A problem caused the program to stop working...".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried all the troubleshooting options, running it in compatibility mode for Windows 7 (and Win 8, vista, ...), etc but they all failed the same way. Also tried running it as an administrator, and also tried running an older version (v1.3) of the same software.
 All failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also tried running it on a laptop running windows 10. Also failed in the same way, and again tried all the compatibility options etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All windows updates are applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also tried repairing the software, and doing a fresh install on 2 different machines. The install appears to work successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how to get it running or to debug it to find out where the problem is?</p>

<h2>            Why is Microsoft going backwards, instead of forwards&#63;&#63;&#63;  its 2018, not 1985, c&#39;mon&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello to all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im here today to discuss the the poor quality that Microsoft has allowed itself to become, so yeah a little vent session, sorry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought the day would never come that I would be so angry and frustrated about Microsoft, that it would make me come to a forum to post a negative things about them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have many stories and scenarios that i could write up on how ridiculous and stupid of some of my experiences have been with microsoft OS's lately, but for now im going to just talk about just one topic that has just happened to me tonight, as i would be
 here for an eternity if i were to speak about all the other **** that i have been going through.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a customer that just brought me a laptop because it wasnt running right, had boobies and asses popping up all over the place, running really slow and sluggish etc...&nbsp;<br />
Anyone in the IT industry would know what im talking about, anyhow i did the normal thing clean and tidy files and system etc...</p>
<p>As i saw how bad of a state the machine was i thought to myself, i should go check to see if they have been keeping their machine up to date on window updates and sure enough it hadnt as per usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, not only was the machine 1607 version, but it appeared to be stuck in a loop for quite sometime for the new updates, as when i looked in the history it was fail after fail after fail. No biggy tho one would think, boy wasnt i wrong!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I knew of the problem and how to fix it, update it to 1803 manually, one would think that this would be an easy task, go to microsoft's website type in 1803 update in the search download the update and install it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NO! that would be to easy wouldnt it. I see tonnes of instructions and guides about turning on windows update and allow them to scan and update the machine, well how can I when its consistently stuck in a friggin update loop, you morons???<br />
Getting really sick and tired of all this automatic scanning ****, stuff doesnt work when software is stuck and not working in the first place, if it was as easy as turn on auto-update then i wouldnt be at your site trying to download the patch myself if your
 system did it on its own, dum asses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after 4+hrs trying to get this machine from 1607 to 1803 and failing on every known guide attempted, i thought you know what stuff this, ill contact customer support and get them to do it, im just sick and tired of fart-assing around with trying to find
 stuff now.</p>
<p>Got onto live chat told the person wtf was going on and then they remote connected to my laptop, went heidoc.net downloaded the .iso, i then told the person thanks i got it from here and disconnected the session.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now this is the thing that pisses me of, back in the day with WinXP and win7 versions of windows i could get similiar problems like this and it took me around 30mins in total to see a problem and fix it, unlike tonight it takes me over 4+hrs of fart assing
 around, + contacting microsoft support. On top of that the customer support rep. went to a 3rd party website to download the 1803 .iso so i can change my machine from 1607 to 1803, so wtf??? i mean WTF??? IS GOIN ON HERE??? REALLY???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never ever had i ever needed to contact support or even google stuff for info until of late especially more now cause of win10, i mean this is getting ridiculous to be quite honest. Technology is supposed to me moving people forward and making things much
 easier and simpler, but instead its the complete opposite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps im just getting old and just preferred those good old days when you could just go to microsoft update centre website type in the patch number download the update and install it. Dunno why we have to fart-ass around now with **** tools and scanners
 etc. Just sayin! If things were so automatic then i wouldnt be here would i? ever thought of that microsoft!</p>
<p>Could even go one step further and ask the question that, why in the hell is it so hard to even update a machine from previous version to the latest one?</p>
<p>I mean its 2018 and microsoft updates cant install the latest version on its own now in the first place? The system cant detect and solve the missing items and do it automatically in 2018?</p>
<p>What a joke, if i worked in microsoft i would be embarrassed, but hey thats just me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow my rant is over, so now back to this laptop to get it finished a 2 to 3hr job turns into a 12+hr job, ridiculous.</p>

    <title>Power Adapter Issue after Windows 10 Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nick_881  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power Adapter Issue after Windows 10 Update</h2>
                    I recently purchased a Dell Inspiron 5000 series that came with Windows 10 installed. &nbsp;Everything worked fine until I installed the latest Windows 10 update 2 days ago. &nbsp;Now it will not detect my power adapter. &nbsp;I have tried removing the battery, tried
 different outlets, etc. &nbsp;It still will not detect the adapter. &nbsp;I am down to 19% on my battery and would like to figure this out before i run out of power. &nbsp;Thanks. &nbsp;

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to the Skype Community Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It‚Äôs important that you choose a <strong>secure password
</strong>to access your Skype account. Hackers use lists of common passwords to access accounts (not only on Skype but across all websites), so it‚Äôs critical that you use a strong, unique password. Use a mixture of letters, numbers and characters&nbsp;‚Äì like the
 characters above the numbers on many keyboards such as %, *,$, ¬£ and !.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Nevertheless</span><span>, e</span>ven if you have a strong password,
<strong>you should change it regularly. </strong>If another website or service where you use the same or a similar password&nbsp;is compromised,
<a href="http://go.skype.com/changepassword" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">change your Skype password</span></a> as soon as possible to protect your account. Moreover, always use an
<strong>antivirus program </strong>to check the files you receive from other people, whether on Skype or any other method, even if you know the sender. Keep your antivirus software
<strong>up-to-date </strong>and running at all times.</p>

<h2>            Accidentally deleted some c&#43;&#43; redistributables, stuck in recovery mode</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was recently cleaning my computer and decided to be strict on what to have an what not to have installed, and while looking at the installed programs i noticed a lot of c++ redistributables from different years. Being a java developer i was sure that wasnt
 installed by me so i presumed its not needed... Uninstalled one or two of the most recently installed (at most week ago) but soon realized almost no .exe files would run, some said they didnt find some class, while some apparently had invalid sidebyside configurations.
 No browser could work for me to download the libraries and reinstall them. No util like task manager or the sfc worked, so i only had the option to reboot and hope for the best.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So rebooting the computer it turned on and of a couple of times (based on the lights) with the screen flickering from truned off to a black backlit one. After a few minutes the ROG logo comes up (i have an asus laptop) and underneath the message about startuing
 automated repair and i get launched into the recorvery mode. First off i tried to boot into safe mode, but that repeated the process back into recovery. Tried running the startup repair which reporred it wasnt able to fixthe problem and looking at the logs
 it sajd it could find a hard disk, while in the BIOS theyre both there... Tried running the command prompt and chkdisk returned no errors or badsectors as expected and sfc tried to run and completed the verification but after that the message "Windows recource
 protection could not preform the requested operatio" and exited to command promt again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am stuck like this and out of solutions to try, I really would not like to reinstall windows if at all possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            Sign in to the Skype application.
<br />
<br />    Go to one of your Skype contact‚Äôs messaging field.
<br />
<br />    Type in the command ‚Äú/dumpmsnp‚Äùand send it as a message.
<br />
<br />    Type in the command ‚Äú/MSNP24‚Äùand send it as a message.
<br />
<br />    Sign out of the Skype application and then sign back in.
<br />    Go again to the messaging field of any of your Skype contacts and Type in the command ‚Äú/remotelogout‚Äù and send it as a message.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />You can also try installing Skype Classic to see if it helps:
<br />
<br />Also, try changing your display name to see if that works.
<br />
<br />Click your Profile picture in Skype, then click edit button and enter a modified screen name. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

            you know, I really don't understand what you're telling me to do.&nbsp; where or what is the contact messaging field? and what are we supposed to do when this version is unavailable as it says it will soon be unavailable every time I start up the classic and
 it prompts me to load up the new trash version?

<br />Sorry you are have a hard time with this. Just know its no fault of your own. These changes to Skype have been dramatically negative and the team is doing a lot of fix whats wrong.

            I'll just limp along with the older classic version. thanks. I tried to find one on the skype website and couldn't. I had several old versions but every time I went into my trash file to use one and install it, it said I was using an outdated version and
 forced me to load the latest. they could do a better job of making the classic available and way easier to find.<br />

            Its gonna say outdated because Microsoft wants you using the latest version no matter what. Your best option is to just ignore any prompts to upgrade for the time being.

    <title>Getting black screen error message &#34;The selected boot device - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johns57za  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting black screen error message &#34;The selected boot device failed. Press &#60;enter&#62; to continue&#34; on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Old title: black screen message windows 10</p>
<p>I was setting up a new HP notebook for my sister already loaded with windows 10. All went well. then I closed the lid. When I went to open lid &nbsp;again and power on instead of expecting a sign in page I got a black screen with message and no mouse cursor saying
 "The selected boot device failed. Press &lt;enter&gt; to continue." So I did and all that happens every time is it closes. Have tried disconnect everything and take battery out and then hold power button for 15 secs to fully discharge then connect all again, have
 tried press esc repeatedly, have tried press F10 and F everything else and always just turns off. Ready to take back to store but before hand can anyone help. Thanks John S</p>

            <p>Hello John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess the problem might be with the Boot Configuration Data files or with some BIOS settings. Since you're telling it's a new laptop, better I suggest you to get in touch with the store people, where you purchased it.&nbsp;Doing some troubleshooting steps might&nbsp;violate
 device warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope they will guide you accordingly for fixing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep posted if you require further assistance.</p>

            Thankyou for your help. I did take it back to the store and it turns out the hard drive had failed so there was nothing any of us could do. They replaced it and now I have another new one only this one is up and running. Thanks , John

    <title>HP Deskjet 3000 Printer J310a is not recognized by the computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael frazier  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP Deskjet 3000 Printer J310a is not recognized by the computer</h2>
                    <p>Original title: HP printer </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been hitting a brick wall with this problem. I have an HP Deskjet 3000 Printer J310a that absolutely refuses to be recognized anymore by my desktop. The printer was installed fine on the computer previously but was left disconnected for a few months.
 When reconnected it, the desktop didn't recognize it at all. At the time it would still connect to my laptop (which has since gotten a new HD and is no longer a workaround option) both wirelessly and via usb so I know the printer and usb cable both work fine.
 Any thoughts on why a previously working, less than 3 year old desktop/printer package suddenly won't recognize each other. HP support says they don't support this "one of the greatest deskjet printers they've made" anymore (after less than 3 years?) but for
 $24.99 they'd email me an update to the driver.</p>

            I've already been through every support and driver option for my printer on the HP site. Since it worked on my laptop both with and without the usb cable but not on my desktop, I'm assuming it's something that changed with the desktop while the printer
 was disconnected. What that change is though is anybody's best guess though as that covered a span of several months and I can't account for every software change that was made on my machine during that time.

            Yep, was the first thing I tried when it threw up the error when first plugged it back into the desktop. I've reached a workaround that explicitly demonstrates that it is a problem with my desktop machine though. I went ahead and tried reinstalling the
 printer on the laptop. Despite what HP told me about it being because the driver is out of date, it installed on the laptop just fine, at least wirelessly. From there I was able to do a remote install of the printer. So, while I'll have to have my laptop running
 to print anything from the desktop (at least until I can purchase a router), I do once again have the capability to print.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I'm just glad I decided to at least TRY installing to the laptop. Once HP Support told me the driver was outdated I dismissed the idea for awhile figuring that the new HD and fresh install of Windows would just give me the same results.</div>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing the information. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the drivers are outdated, it is best not to install the outdated drivers. Make sure to install the updated drivers once it is released by the manufacturer. Do let us know if you face any issue or have any concerns and we‚Äôll be happy
 to help.</p>

<h2>            Razer Synapse software prevents windows 10 from sleeping</h2>
                    <p>I've been trouble shooting this for awhile now. I completely reinstalled the OS and I am manually creating restore points before each small set of updates or software installations.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Razer Synapse, which updates itself automatically, prevents the display from powering down as well as preventing the PC form going into sleep mode.</p>

<h2>            Win 10&#58; where is Windows Picture and Fax Viewer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still struggling with Win 10. &nbsp;Lots of useful features have simply disappeared or placed in somewhere I cannot find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the picture viewer, I used to have Windows Picture and Fax Viewer. &nbsp;When a picture is opened, jumping to the next picture is just a click on the forward arrow at the bottom. &nbsp;With the Win 10 Photos, there is no forward arrow. &nbsp;To open another picture,
 I have to close the current picture, then reopen another one. &nbsp;This is very bad for high speed browsing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a forward arrow in Photos that I don't know? or MS is simply testing the loyalty of their users?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cannot design a software that is better than the previous version, simply don't do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your answer...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>I had a clean install of win 10 after I got tons of problems with the upgrade version. Now the original windows photo viewer is gone. And a new one called Photos is the only option. Sometimes it shows forward/backward arrow, and sometimes it doesn't. I just
 can't find the old photo viewer anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I found a thread that explains the win10 has somehow not put in the register for the old photo viewer, and taught me how to add it back, so I can select it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it worked. But frankly speaking, this Win10 is such a nightmare that I regret upgrading to it so much!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have tons of other problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thank you for your reply.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>To run Windows Picture and Fax Viewer in Windows 10 you should do some changes in registry.</p>
<p>The better way to change it - download prepared .reg file and run it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow this link <a href="http://texfaq.ru/windows/microsoft_photo_viewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://texfaq.ru/windows/microsoft_photo_viewer.html</a></li><li>Scroll down, download <strong>tweaks_all.reg</strong>, run it.</li><li>Then in the Search box, type ‚Äú<strong>Default</strong>‚Äù without quotes and select
<strong>Default apps</strong> from the list of results.</li><li>Click on <strong>Set your defaults by app</strong>.</li><li>Choose&nbsp;<strong>Windows Picture Viewer </strong>from left list and click&nbsp;<strong>Choose defoults for this programm</strong></li><li>Mark all and save.</li></ol>
<p>Right now it must open pictures by Viewer, if no - now Viewer should be in&nbsp;<strong>open with
</strong>menu</p>

            It seems you didn't read his question. He didn't ask how to fix the Photo viewer. Its terrible and he doesn't want it, infact nobody wants it and as a general community I think most of us would be happy if in the next update your photo tool just disappeared
 into the background like it never happened with the photo and fax viewer happily back in place since it was a good tool that basically just always worked unlike most of the metro apps. Somebody submitted a guid that if it wasn't in Russian it would probably
 be helpful. But what would be better is if instead of MS releasing an OS and us forever modifying bios entries to make it work properly you could just roll out an OS that works. Please forward the request to just re-instate picture and fax viewer in the next
 update cheers.

            I tried this (against my better judgement - Russian program...) but did not see Picture and Fax Viewer program anywhere (did a reboot also)... Microsoft should reply to this - why get rid of a simple editor/viewer that worked?&nbsp; I used it mostly to rename
 files for better organization in a folder...

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this is clear to avoid an unwanted response - I DO NOT WANT TO USE THE PHOTO APP ITS RUBBISH</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know from Microsoft how to get back the photo viewer app as this was far more efficient - Please do not respond with something being wrong with the Rubbish photo app as this works fine but is NOT useable</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll tell you why - THE MOUSE WHEEL used to zoom in and out of pictures which I preferred and click and drag to move around</p>
<p>
</p><p>These features should be added to the photo app or it should be replaced / have the other app put in as an addition to the current one</p>
<p>
