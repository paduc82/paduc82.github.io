            I'm sorry. You can always go back to your previous operating platform. And, as I stated, there are ways to block the upgrade permanently.

<h2>            Auto changing input method issue &#40;keyboard language&#41;</h2>
                    Hi, I am using Win 10. In my Language Preference, I have only US keyboard. But I dont know why on the desktop toolbar there is an other VIE keyboard (Vietnamese keyboard). And the problem is whenever I play games (Dota 2, CSGO, PUBG) it will automatically
 change from US keyboard to VIE keyboard, so I can not use the number button 123456, etc. I have to go back to my desktop to change it back. I tried changing the key sequence to not assigned but it didnot work. I tried to remove VIE keyboard from language preference
 but it was not there, only US keyboard. So what am I supposed to do now? Please tell me.

<h2>            Windows 10 update &#40;in March 2018&#41; breaks Asus N500JV laptop</h2>
                    <p>A recent unsolicited Windows 10 update has left my Asus laptop in an endless BSoD / Repair /BSoD loop since the beginning of March.</p>
<p>I have tried just about every troubleshooting option possible without success:</p>
<p>- "Automatic Repair" always ends with "couldn't repair your PC" (stopcode 0xc000021a),
</p>
<p>- "Start-up Repair" (Fails!),</p>
<p>- returning to a previous Restore point before the update ("System Restore")&nbsp; -Fails!</p>
<p>&nbsp; (Attempt 1: "unspecified error - 0x800701e3", Attempt 2: "0x80070017"),</p>
<p>- re-installing Windows 10 (keeping my user files) "Reset this PC" - Fails!,</p>
<p>- system command prompt - I can see my user files.</p>
<p>So, Windows 10 will not boot apart from perpetually failing "automatic repairs".</p>
<p>How can I really repair/rollback the damage caused by the update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Extra info: Command prompt gives me Windows version as: 10.0.16299.15</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a possibility that there is an issue with the system files of Windows 10 and that can be the reason why your computer is encountering a blue screen error. It is also possible that an outdated driver or a third party application are the one that
 is causing the blue screen issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to know the exact error that your seeing when the computer goes to a blue screen. Is it the "0xc000021a" error code?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, kindly check if you can boot the computer in safe mode with networking. Since you can select "Startup repair" and "Reset, it means that you can access the Windows Recovery (WinRe) environment. In the "Advanced options" page of WinRe, kindly
 select <strong>Startup Settings</strong> and click on <strong>Restart</strong>. After the restart, press number that corresponds to
<strong>Enable Safe Mode with Networking</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your reply.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>yes, the exact stopcode is 0xc000021a.</p>
<p>I have tried restarting in safe mode with networking. That ends up with the same BSoD, and once the “collecting info” reaches 100%, it fails to reboot - I have to hard-reset to get back to the same “Preparing Automatic Repair” -&gt; “Diagnosing PC” -&gt; “couldn’t
 repair” -&gt; “Advanced Options” -&gt; “Troubleshoot”, etc. endless loop.</p>

<p>Thank you for the update and information. Since you're unable to boot the computer in safe mode with networking, our best option to resolve this issue is by performing an in-place upgrade outside Windows. In-place upgrade is like re-installing Windows but
 it will keep your data. Before you can do this, you need to have a blank USB flash drive with at least 8GB of space and another working computer. Once you have these devices, you can access this
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to download the tool which you can use to download Windows 10 and create an installation media. The page also has the steps on how
 to use the tool, how to load the installation media on the computer, and how to use the installation media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After loading the installation media of Windows 10 to your computer, you can follow the steps found in this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install-insiderplat_pc/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">Forum Article</a></strong>
 in order for you to re-install Windows 10. If you're in the <strong>Which type of installation do you want?</strong> page of Windows 10 Setup, please choose
<strong>Upgrade: Install Windows and keep files, settings, and applications</strong> to proceed on performing an in-place upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>We understand where you're coming from. It is important to us for our computer to always run with no error especially when we're using it for work. Upon seeing the screenshot, you're unable to perform an in-place upgrade. We need to perform an in-place upgrade
 so that we can replace the system files of Windows 10. The current system files of Windows 10 is possibly corrupted and that is why your computer cannot load it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The DISM and SFC tools will not be able to fix the system file corruptions because the issue is deep within the code of Windows 10. Our next best option to resolve the issue is by performing a custom install of Windows 10. This will remove all of the programs
 installed on the computer but it will preserve your files. To do this, you can follow the steps
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">here</a></strong>.<br />
</p>
<p>Kindly update us if you're able to perform a custom install.</p>

<p>So, the rescue partition (drive X) running 10.0.16299.15 cannot repair my original 10.0.16299.192 on drive C. Neither can a usb stick installation media (which also appears to be the 10.0.16299.15 build). I’m having difficulty believing the “it will preserve
 your files” part. I’ll take a look at what “Custom install” entails, but it is beginning to sound like Linux is a better idea...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, thanks for your efforts... I would appreciate a little more technical detail if you do have any further encouragements...</p>
<p>I thought dism &amp; sfc were there precisely to fix file corruption?</p>

<p>That doesn’t get me much further than all the other attempts: It sounds to me (from this latest message) that the windows update I have suffered has a problem with the hard disk driver! N.B. This PC had been running W10 like a dream for a long time (year
 or so) before the update decided to install itself (with no option to not do so).</p>
<p>So I took a look at “load driver” which doesn’t find any drivers on the usb stick.</p>
<p>Please advise how I can get back to the hd driver that worked.</p>
<p>Also, what is this “disk may fail” message based on?... Do you have a cmd line disk diagnostics command for me to try to get more details?</p>

            So, if for some reason, my laptop which was <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
working fine with w10 until now</span>, wasn’t compatible with a future update, WHY does w10
<strong>impose</strong> the update??

            Hi,<br />
<br />
It sounds like your system is infected with malware and the malware has disabled the restore point options, so I recommend running scans:<br />
<br />
http://www.malwarebytes.org/<br />
<br />
<b>You can also run the Microsoft Malicious Removal Tool:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; Type MRT (right click run as admin).<br />
<br />
You can also head over to the virus / malware removal section on answers - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_scanning<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

<h2>            Input Signal Out of Range error during automatic windows 10 update</h2>
                    My Windows 10 started an automatic update after I was away from my desk. Somewhere along automatic rebooting process I started geting an Input Signal Out of Range error - Current Settings: H=497.kHz V=30Hz - Change Settings to 2560x1440-60Hz. I can change
 settings if I can get into. I have tried using my Recovery flash drive, but it does not work. Although I did not think it would work, I did try the old Shift F8 at startup trying to get to a Safe Boot. This did not work either. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

            Terry, since you are still getting the same error, what you can do is to contact the monitors manufacturer for further assistance with the set up or configuration that you can do. You can also try to get a different monitor that has a better or a higher
 input signal that could meet the minimum requirements.<br />

Let us know how it goes.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade resulting in seemingly irrepairable partial - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewmeacham  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade resulting in seemingly irrepairable partial boot-crash-reboot loop</h2>
                    <p>So, to summarize my whole "wonderful" windows 10 experience: I can not seem to repair or restore my computer after the infamous free Windows 10 upgrade my Alienware running Windows 7 was eligible for. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested my computer with the appropriate windows upgrade tool (cant remember the actual name of it) which it passed with flying colors. &nbsp;So I naturally went to the microsoft website and downloaded the correct .ISO to install to my machine via USB. &nbsp;Install
 completed, downloaded a few updates during the process, and before I know it, the machine is stuck in a partial boot, crash, reboot loop. &nbsp;The machine will load up to the new windows icon, spin the dots once for about 4 seconds, go black, flash an empty command
 prompt window, and then reboot. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now all I can access is Boot Setup (F2) and the Alienware diagnostics via (F12). &nbsp;I was able to access Start-up Recovery by holding shift after a hard start power cycle. &nbsp;From there I attempted a OS Repair via a freshly downloaded Windows 10 .ISO, again
 on a USB. &nbsp;Machine attempted repairs and power cycled. &nbsp;Still partial boot-crash-reboot looping, so I attempted to launch Start-up Recovery again, looking for other options. &nbsp;Instead of Start-up Recovery launching, I now get a error code: 0xc000000e. &nbsp;From
 this screen my only supposed options are "Press Enter to try again" and "Press F8 for Startup Settings" neither of which work, the screen only flashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas or possible solutions, or even comments are appreciated. &nbsp;I'm not too happy that my $2100 computer I use for work and school is completely useless, so the sooner I can fix this better.</p>
<p />

            <p>I don't know if this will work now, but this is how I have successfully recovered on a couple of computers</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try starting in Safe Mode then go back to your previous system</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Start Windows 10 Recovery mode using three consecutive power-ups (ie power up, when you see the Windows log and/or rotating circles, power down by holding down the power button for three seconds).
 Do this three times - if this works you should see Recovery mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try rapidly pressing F8 as you power up and see if that triggers Recovery screen.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Recovery mode, get to Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Startup settings, Restart then select option 4 (Safe mode)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Safe mode to go back to Windows 7 (8)</span></p>
<p><span>Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery &gt; "Go back to Windows 7 (8)"</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Now stop Windows 10 from upgrading again<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>In Windows 7 (8), Right click Start &gt; Control panel &gt; Programs &amp; Features &gt; View installed updates, find Windows update KB3035583, right click &gt; uninstall. That stops the upgrade icon happening</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>Run Disk Cleanup and let it finish scanning, then tick Cleanup system files, tick all the boxes - that removes the Windows 10 upgrade files</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>Then to stop Windows 10 bothering you, start Windows Update, Check for updates, right click on KB3035583 and hide it</span></p>

            I guess I should have made it clear before. &nbsp;My drivers are all up to date. &nbsp;I don't know the exact model of mouse. &nbsp;I've been using it for years with no problems. &nbsp;There are no recognizable problems for the troubleshooter to identify. &nbsp;About every 20
 minutes, the connection just drops. &nbsp;If I click the Bluetooth icon at the lower right of my screen to open up the pairing menu, the connection instantly restores itself, without me changing any settings. &nbsp;I restored my computer to Windows 7 and the problem
 went away completely. &nbsp;Reinstalled Windows 10, and it's back. &nbsp;This is a Windows problem, not user error or a problem with the device drivers. &nbsp;

            Still nothing? &nbsp;So when the problem is on your end (Microsoft's), you have nothing to say, is that it? &nbsp; I would really like an answer to my question. &nbsp;FYI, the mouse is a Logitech V470, but the problem is with Windows 10. &nbsp;

            Similar situation. Just upgraded to Win10 from 8.1 on our HP Stream11, and what a mess. The computer froze and had to take it to the MS Store near our city. They had it for 6 days while they rebuilt the OS with 10. Lost a lot of apps. Finally after hours
 of rebuilding the apps, noticed that the Realtek v4 Bluetooth disconnects every time the system goes into ' Sleep' or screen saver comes on. Have to RESTART every time. Have turned off the power management event to keep the Bluetooth active, so that's not
 the problem. Have run Troubleshooter and it says it fixed the problem, but it didn't -- same issue after the PC went to 'Sleep'. Our mouse is a BT Microsoft Sculpt. We had zero problems with it in 8.1. My advice is not to upgrade if you have any BT devices
 that you use and everything works fine.

Exactly the same problem. ASUS UX302 zenbook. Upgraded from 8.1 to 10. Initially Bluetooth drivers disappeared altogether from Device manager and the control panel window. Now they are&nbsp;back after manually downloading them but Bluetooth MS Sculpt mouse keeps
 disconnecting and reconnecting without working. Device manager keeps flashing on and off (updating) when mouse is trying to connect. Everything worked perfectly before....Contacted ASUS and they said Bluetooth drivers not supported with Windows 10 despite
 advertising everywhere how good it is to upgrade and saying computer was Win10 compatible (except for drivers)....... nice work everyone.

When we passed a checkpoint, the game freezed and after that, I was not abble to continue because my save break the game. I think my cloud save was corrupted by this "freezing checkpoint" and it's because of this that I can't load it anymore.</p><p>But my friend, her, can load her cloud save normaly and continue the game... It's only when I load MINE that the game freeee and Xbox RESTART !</p><p>I'm tired of this, please help !</p>

<h2>            Extraction failure when trying to install Visual C&#43;&#43; redistributable x64</h2>
                    <span><span>Hi,<br />
                    <span><span>Hi,<br />
I am trying to install Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 SP1 Redistributable Package (x64) on a Windows 7-64 bit Release Candidate build 7100.&nbsp; Each time I get an "extraction failed. The operation completed successfully" and the software does not install.&nbsp; I am able
 to install C++ 2005 by selecting run as administrator, but this does not work for 2008.&nbsp; I have uninstalled and reinstalled the program several times.&nbsp; I've tried uninstalling all the C++ versions.&nbsp; I've turned off my antivirus software.&nbsp; I've even tried the
 Windows Installer CleanUp Utility to uninstall and then reinstall all versions of C++.<br />
Is Visual C++ 2008 SP1 compatible&nbsp;with Windows 7 RC?<br />
I need to install it to use Laplink PCMover to upgrade from RC to RTM.&nbsp; Otherwise I'm going to have to do a fresh install.<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p>Hmm, this is a bit of an odd issue, perhaps the file is corrupted? Re-download it from
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=BA9257CA-337F-4B40-8C14-157CFDFFEE4E&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=BA9257CA-337F-4B40-8C14-157CFDFFEE4E&amp;displaylang=en</a>&nbsp;and give it a try. If it doesn't work, then perhaps you could try creating a new account with Administrator privileges and attempt to install the
 software within that account?<br />
<br />
As a bit of a workaround, in terms of moving your settings and data you could use Windows Easy Transfer to back up your settings under the currently installed Release Candidate, then install RTM followed by your programs, then&nbsp;restore your data and settings
 back onto the system. It's a bit more tedious, but it works quite well.<br />

<h2>            Netflix video disappears on Chrome but not audio...</h2>
                    <p>Running Netflix in Chrome browser. On several occasions when trying to use finger to skip video, the browser closes and the Chrome icon disappears...but the audio continues on like there is no problem. I do have the keyboard attached, but folded back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I reopen a Chrome browser, I get a new window (not Netflix) and no indication of a Netflix session...but the audio continues with no interruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no Chrome app in Task Manager, but there are Chrome processes. If I quit the processes I can kill the audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find and run another hardware update following the last occurrence, but haven't yet run Netflix again to see if I could recreate the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had a similar experience?</p>

            This happened again last night when playing YouTube videos on Chrome. I had to quit Chrome processes (there were about 4 of them and not all of them stopped the YouTube audio). The common denominator seems to be Chrome/Win10.

                    <p>When trying to create a tiled resource texture array with mipmaps I get the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ID3D11Device::CreateTexture2D: On a device with Tier 2 Tiled Resources support, Tiled Resources cannot be created with both more than one array slice and any mipmap that has a dimension less than a tile in extent. For the Tiled Resource being created, Mip
 [4] has (width=256, height=256) while the tile dimension for the given format is (width=512, height=256). Hardware support in this area was not able to be standardized in time to be included in D3D.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any plans in fixing / standardizing this in the near future to support a complete set of mipmap sizes ?&nbsp;<br />

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As you have mentioned 'Hardware support in this area was not able to be standardized in time to be included in D3D'. 
<br />
<br />Display device hardware must support Microsoft Direct3D feature levels, refer:

<p>Hi Ganesh, and thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I don't think there's something I can do to use this feature as according to the error message it's yet to be implemented / standardized.</p>
<p>My question is intended to the Direct3D product team to ask when it's scheduled to be implemented.</p>

<p>Hi Stefan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you considered using tiled resource tier 3, you may use volume tiled textures as a workaround.</p>
<p>It doesn't work for me as the size limits are too small.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't find the forums mentioned here, but I opened a thread in windows development forums.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I have no tier3 card. I have NVidia 1070 which is tier 2.</p>
<p>So right now i have cut of the mip maps.</p>
<p>Adopting tiled resources is in general very slow.</p>

<p>Your claim is improbable.</p>
<p>Please refer to the following image, it's from a machine with Gigabyte GTX1060 (6GB)&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not just information, I actually tested it.</p>
<p>being limited to tier 2 might be related to the Windows version being used.<br />

<p>Actually you are right.</p>
<p>I did not pay attention to this, I have checked PIX returns also tier 3, however in my app I get Tier 2</p>

<p>It does not work, actually</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resource Tier3 is not standartized also.</p>
<p>This code does not work.</p>
<p>I need the cube textures, because i need the filtering</p>

            Hi, I have a windows 8.1 laptop that I got last year, I will click the purple camera app and it says "To get started, connect a camera.". However, I have used my built in camera many times before. Also, I have asked google how to fix it, and it told me
 how I can turn my camera on and off, so I tried that yet nothing happened... Do you know what it might be?

<p>=============================================<br />
If&nbsp;the source files are&nbsp;still shots...I would blur the faces in an image<br />
editing program before importing the photos into Movie Maker.</p>
<p>If the source files are video clips...there is no face blurring feature <br />
native to Movie Maker. However...it's possible to do with an overlay...<br />

You likely won't have a system restore since its off by default when you install Windows 10.

I recommend you try performing a repair upgrade to see if resolves the problem you are experiencing:

    <title>Trouble with Polar Bowler on a HP Stream 8 Tablet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gatito761  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble with Polar Bowler on a HP Stream 8 Tablet</h2>
                    I have a HP Stream 8 Tablet, and everything works on it great, the problem is the WildTangent Polar Bowler game I installed from the original retail disk. It installed without a problem, it loads without a problem, the problem occurs when the "Play" button
 is pressed, a runtime error occurs. WildTangent suggested I download from their website which I also did as well as HP Games, the same issue occurs for all three. Microsoft states the program is compatible with Windows 8.1 and the tablet has a full version
 Windows 8.1 preinstalled. I&nbsp;ran the compatibility troubleshooter and ran it under old version compatibility, and still to no avail still the runtime error. After running compatibility Windows is reporting incompatible which is not true since I am running on
 all my other computers using Windows 8.1 without issue....if anyone has any ideas or suggestions please help.

            No I think I found the answer to the issue bc I also have the program running on my HP Split x2, and when I detach the screen from the keyboard and run Polar Bowler it gives me the same runtime error. The program requires a keyboard and mouse, so something
 tells me the software is looking for a keyboard and mouse and if it doesn't see them it doesn't run, otherwise the program runs without issue when the screen is connected back to the keyboard component..... Otherwise I can run Polar Bowler 1st Frame which
 doesn't have the same requirements on the tablet, but it is not nearly as fun as the Classic game. Thank you for your insight and suggestions, but I think what I wrote is the answer to the issue.

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>First of all <strong>BIG THX</strong> for that post - helped me change almost all fonts except those used by Modern UI in Windows 8.1. Looks like Modern UI is using "Segoe UI Light" as default font, but changing it your way changes it only in the destop,
 and not in Modern UI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, anybody knows how to change the font used in Modern UI?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Managed to achieve this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9eva06jw47henwq/2014-09-13_17h00_40.png?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Screenshot</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think, there is a last default font used by the system, and all I need to do is to find its name, and then just follow your steps again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:</p>
<p>The font is arial. But, when I change it in the registry, the system takes another font as default - arial italic.</p>
<p>How to prevent the system from changing the font to the next one in the cue?</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Dany,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You cannot change the font size in Windows Modern UI, it is by design. However you can install some third-party application using your favorite search engine to change
 the fonts. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your
 computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope it helps.

<h2>            Lost font after Windows reinstall</h2>
                    After reinstalling Windows 10 (so it's upgraded itself) I lost a load of fonts that were previously available with Office. I found a thread on here which showed me how to reinstall them, followed the instructions and found most of them, but not the one
 I was looking for, which was Dom Casual. I do have some fonts that I downloaded separately, which I also lost, but Dom Casual wasn't one of them. It definitely came with Office/Windows before. Where has it gone?

    <title>Sound Quality on Sony WH-1000MX2 Headset - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sound Quality on Sony WH-1000MX2 Headset</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been attempting to connect my bluetooth&nbsp;headset (Sony WH-1000MX2) to my laptop (lenovo ideapad 700-15isk, windows 10) for the past few hours now.&nbsp; It would seem that when connected there are 2 bluetooth profiles create, one stereo and one Hands-Free.&nbsp;
 On the Hands-Free option the sound is really poor but I can use the mic.&nbsp; On the Stereo option I have good sound but no mic.&nbsp; But I cant use the mic from Hands-Free and the sound from stereo.&nbsp; I've checked all drivers are running the latest versions but there
 had been no improvements.&nbsp; After reading online it seems this may be an issue with Windows 10, which I find hard to believe.&nbsp; I was hoping to be able to use these headphones for work to connect to clients and then to listen to music in between.&nbsp; Do I really
 have to have such poor sound quality?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rob</p>

    <title>Sound alert for new message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c_dove  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound alert for new message</h2>
                    I am using Skype 8.28.0.41 installed on a Windows 10 laptop. Most of the time the sound alert when I get an Instant Message does not work so I miss them when I am working on other things on my computer.&nbsp; I have Chat Notifications turned on but I am not
 sure this even means sound alerts for new messages. I am not even sure this new version of Skype supports sound alerts for new messages.&nbsp; Any help with sound notifications for new messages would be appreciated. Thank you.

            1. This might be an issue with latest Skype which is v8. 
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers - Open v8 skype &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Help &amp; feedback &gt; Give feedback 
<br />
<br />Feedback can also be given through Uservoice where you can find the feedback of others and status would be visible to you - <a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype-ideas/filters/my_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype...</a>
<br />
<br />2. As a work-around, You can download Classic Skype and use that. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a> 
<br />
<br />Good news is that Classic Skype is not going to be retired. Its last date in service was 1-Sep-18 and it has been decided not stop the services to Classic Skype for some more time. It would nag you for updating to latest version which is v8 which you will have to ignore and tolerate.
