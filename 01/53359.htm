<h2>            Connecting to a fiber channel HBA using windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi all.. first of all, greeting from Chile,!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please excuse the noob nature of this question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work in a small VFX studio, and we have a Fiber Channel HBA storage system installed, which is not in use right now. However, i am attempting to connect to this storage array using a windows 10 system with a FC HBA card, and keep running into some problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have connected my windows 10 workstation, using a ATTO&nbsp;82EN and can confirm that the fiber connections are correctly connected to the switch. I just did this and haven't done any configuration at all. However, i am unable to mount the drives, and keep
 getting multiple instances of RAW drives show up on my device manager!</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I do not have any background on these kind of matters, and the vendor who installed this system doesn't exist anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, if you have any information on how i should configure a FC HBA please send me in that direction. I have admin access to the storage array but again, i do not know how to get this to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!!</p>

<h2>            &#91;NEED ASAP HELP&#93; Windows 7 Won&#39;t Boot - 0xc000000d - An Unexpected Error Has Occured</h2>
                    <p>Currently I have Windows 7 Ultimate 64 Bit and Windows 8 duel-booted, but today I decided I also wanted to install Mac OS X Yosemite and Ubuntu on the machine. After shrinking my Windows 7 partition twice making two more partitions for Mac OS X Yosemite
 and Ubuntu, I restarted my computer. Please note I have not booted Mac OS X Yosemite on my machine at this point. But I decided to go back to Windows 7 again for a moment. And it didn't work. After a few errors that I forgot, I finally landed on this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0fce8d31-5156-4dbf-9cf0-92091af80376" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Just looking here I have to say, I've never stumbled upon something like this.</p>
<p>Apparently the 0xc000000d error is not that uncommon, but I couldn't find the fix with the same info in the error as mine portrays, 'An unexpected error has occured.'</p>
<p>I really don't want to reburn Windows 7 to my USB, but I'm willing to if it must be done.</p>
<p>Also, my computer has UEFI on the BIOS, but I disabled that and enabled Legacy Boot.I also don't have a disk for Windows Repair, and don't plan on acquiring one soon, unfortunately, but I doubt it would work anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to do chkdsk /f X: (X is for Windows 7 on my hard drive),</p>
<p>And it didn't fix it.</p>
<p>I've also tried to fix it with this method as well, though with a different boot information message.</p>
<p>http://www.sevenforums.com/hardware-devices/82226-boot-bcd-0xc000000d-unreadable-boot-configuration-data.html</p>
<p>No dice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help.</p>
<p>Badly.</p>
<p>So Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>tell me what to do now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Miles.</p>

            <p>Hi Miles,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue could have occurred when you tried to shrink the partition containing Windows 7. This might have deleted the boot drive or any other system files. I see that you have tried most of the basic troubleshooting steps, its really unfortunate that none
 of them worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the methods below and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Run the SFC (System File checker) Scan in Windows Recovery mode.</p>
<p>Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>a. Open Command prompt from Windows Recovery Mode</p>
<p>b. Type <strong>C:</strong> and press enter. On <strong>C:\</strong> prompt type
<strong>cd windows\system32\</strong> and press enter. </p>
<p>c. Type the following command, and then press ENTER: <strong>sfc /scannow</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p>Run the <strong>Start up Repair Tool</strong> from Windows Recovery and check if it helps:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also refer to the KB article provided below and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Vista or Windows 7 no longer starts, and the Startup Repair tool does not fix the problem</strong></p>

Hope this helps. Get back to us if the issue persists.</p>

<h3> helpless_in_seattle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Lifechat LX-3000 - sound in headphones completely distorted</h2>
                    
<p>I have recently purchased a Microsoft LifeChat 3000 USB headset.</p>
<p>I tested it on a laptop running WinXP SP3, and it worked perfectly. I then tried connecting it to my desktop. After the device was detected, it was correctly set as the default audio device. However, the sound in the headphones is completely distorted. There
 is constant buzzing and crackling (static-like), and any sound that is played via the headphones is distorted to the point of being unrecognizable. Even default Windows dings and dongs come through as staticky crackles and growls.</p>
<p>My desktop is running Windows XP Pro SP3, fully up to date.</p>
<p>Just to be sure, I connected the headset to the laptop again, and it worked fine. So, this isn't a problem with the headset.</p>
<p>I also tried connecting it to EVERY SINGLE USB port on my desktop. Same result: snap, crackle, pop, growl. There is a constant "undercurrent" buzz that I can hear in the headphones when no sound is being played at all. Problems happen regardless of what
 sound I am playing: youtube videos, mpeg videos, songs, or anything at all.</p>
<p>I have had no problems connecting other devices to the desktop's USB ports. I have a USB keyboard, a USB mouse, an XBOX360 controller, and multiple USB storage devices that I've connected and disconnected, and none of them have problems.</p>
<p>Reboots, reconnections did not help. Unplugging speakers did not help.</p>
<p>I'm helpless. In Seattle. Please help if possible before I chuck this thing through the window.</p>

<p><br />
As you said above Helpless_in_Seattle,this controller must be using the same system plugin as the headset and I recommend to,as possible as you can do not use them at same time....</p>

    <title>Removing shortcut arrow from Desktop Icon without creating black - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Removing shortcut arrow from Desktop Icon without creating black square problem</h2>
                    <p>I found the following on the web to make the Desktop Icons go away (make them transparent rather).&nbsp; However,
<strong>it created</strong> <strong>a new problem;</strong> black squares after turning on the laptop the next day.&nbsp; The black squares did not show up on every single Desktop Icon, however, it was quite a few of them.&nbsp; I was able to get rid of the black squares&nbsp;by&nbsp;reversing&nbsp;what
 was created in the registry keys; but of course the arrows are back.&nbsp; Which I do not want.</p>

<p>The problem may be with how&nbsp;the ATI driver&nbsp;and/or the computer handles Flash, particularly the Flash hardware acceleration.</p>
<p>What you are experiencing appears to be what is discussed in the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.adobe.com/message/2953527" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.adobe.com/message/2953527</a></p>
<p>If you had a previous version of ATI drivers that worked without issue you could try reverting to that version.</p>
<p>To work around the issue without reverting to a previous ATI driver version try disabling hardware acceleration with Flash:</p>
<p>See "If I have display problems with Flash Player, what should I do?" in the following link:</p>

<h2>            xbox one randomly loses connection to internet.</h2>
                    
<p>so I've had my xbox one for about a year/ year n a half. then just outta nowhere it started randomly losing connection to xbox live/internet. but its only for a second cause when i dashboard its connected. and if i run the connection checks everything says
 I'm connected. i have 2 phones, an iPod, 2 laptops, a PS3 and an iPad all connected to the same wireless router and they don't lose connection. its just the xbox one. I've googled nd I've seen tons of people having the same issue as me but not one resolution.
 &nbsp;anyone have any idea what causes this?&nbsp;</p>

                    I just moved from a Samsung S5 to an S7 with Android 7 and with that I installed the newest Skype software. When I am in a Skype call and minimize it to e.g. look at Google Maps, there is no longer a window of the call floating on top of other applications.
 What gives?

            no one is talking about calls going on hold. the problem is that we can't see the call while doing other tasks. there used to be a floating window, now there isn't. bring it back!

<p>Crysis online is terrible, way too much lag and glitching</p>
<p>Homefront is really good WHEN IT WORKS. Lost count of the number of times I was doing really well in a match for it to disconnect me from the game and lose all my stats. Traded it in because of that! Still, when it did work, it was great fun and pretty easy
 to be good at tbh</p>

<p>"Hunted: The Demon's Forge" was a big surprise for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a 2 player coop game, a little like Army of Two meets Fable meets Resident Evil 5 Meets Enslaved with the Gears of War Cover System.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Great single player campaign and then your own personal dungeon builder to create your own dungeons, play Developer made dungeons or try out other people's creations.</p>

<h2>            Problema&#58; Harry Potter - se cuelga en Hogwarts</h2>
                    
<p>Buenas,</p>
<p>Mi mujer tiene un problerma con el juego Harry Potter de Lego. Tiene el 90% del juego terminado y para terminarlo s√≥lo le falta completar Hogwarts pero cada vez que entra all√≠, se cuelga la XBOX qued√°ndose la pantalla en negro.</p>
<p>Hemos borrado la cach√© y no hemos aplicado la actualizaci√≥n cuando lo pide el juego. Tambi√©n hemos probado de borrar la cach√© y descargar la actualizaci√≥n del juego cuando lo pide al cargar el juego. Hemos probado de entrar con mi perfil y el juego aparentemente
 funciona bi√©n. A m√≠ me huele que su partida ha jorobado. A parte de empezar de nuevo, ¬øalgui√©n tiene una soluci√≥n a eso?</p>
<p>Gracias.</p>

<p>Me temo que no hay soluci√≥n porqu√© en ning√≠n sitio resuelven este tipos de problemas. Se comenta de programas para recuperar perfiles da√±ados y muchos cuentan que las partidas no se recuperan.</p>
<p>Acabo de leer esto en Meristation pero no s√©:</p>
<p>Para recuperar partidas guardadas intenta pasarle el Hash Block Calculator al archivo que contiene los datos de la partida.</p>
<p>Si tienes alg√∫n m√©todo para pasar las partidas del HDD o la MU al PC en principio si tiene arreglo.</p>
<p>Saludos.</p>

            Hi jerry,<br />
<br />
<p><span>We currently don't have the option in Windows Live Photo Gallery to include a water mark on a photo. However, I will forward this
 as a suggestion over to our product team&nbsp;for considerations in a future release.&nbsp;</span><span>Y</span><span><span>ou
 can also submit this as a feature request by going to the&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://feedback.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://feedback.live.com/</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;page
 and then&nbsp;select</span></span><span><span> "</span></span><span><span>Windows
 Live Photo Gallery".<br />
<br />
You can perform the workaround provided by Dissed and Bob in adding a water mark to your photos using MS Paint.</span></span><span><br />
</span><span><br />
Regards,<br />
Gerard G.</span></p>

<br />
<p><span>We currently don't have the option in Windows Live Photo Gallery to include a water mark on a photo. However, I will forward this as a suggestion over to our product team&nbsp;for considerations in a future release.&nbsp;</span><span>Y</span><span><span>ou can

Dear Moderator,
<div><br />
<div>Could you please inform me if there is any update on the possibility to add "water mark" as feature to the photo gallery ? I really like your tool as I find it user friendly and I believe this option would only improve its quality.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for you feedback.</div>

            Great to have the info from April 2012. Has there been an upgrade that I can add in 2013/2014 to the 2010 version I have? Also, I would need 2 watermarks, depending on "who" I was taking picts for. I would like a save feature that drops down to select
 which watermark to use :)<br />
<br />
Thanks Much!<br />
<br />
&amp; yes, I submitted a suggestion...<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for participating here and thank you for the feedback that you gave. The latest version of Photo Gallery was the 2012 one with a build version of
<em>16.4.3508.0205</em>. That version was for Windows 7 and 8. You can check the version installed on your computer by pressing
<strong>ALT + F</strong> in Photo Gallery then click <strong>About Photo Gallery</strong>. Please take note that even on the latest version, we still do not have the feature you are asking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

<h2>            &#34;Windows Did Not Shut Down Successfully&#34;. Critical error found in Event Log. Help&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    Today, just on an hour ago, I was using the computer as normal. I was using Skype, had one tab open on Firefox, and was playing The Lord of the Rings Online. I walked off from the desk for a moment, and when I was out of reach, it suddenly went to a black
 screen, shut down, and restarted itself. Upon restart, it brought up the black and white screen "Windows did not shut down successfully" and gave a few options. I let it start normally, and it's fine now.<br />
<br />
I have a fairly weak graphics card, a Geforce 210. However it's never had a problem with this game (LotRO) before, even when I was running it on high settings -- I now run the game on medium settings.<br />
It couldn't have been the graphics card, could it? Or, worse, the fan?<br />
<br />
<br />
It's working as normal now. However, I'm worried and want to get to the bottom if the issue. It did this at approximately 4:34 or 4:35pm.<br />
<br />
I had a look through the event logs and found the below errors under System (I've omitted a few things such as PC name and keywords for errors I'm sure you good folks are already familiar with).<br />
<br />
Could someone please PLEASE shed some light on this for me? I feel like the computer is fine, that it's fully recovered, but I have this niggling anxiety that something is wrong.
<br />
<ul>
<li>Was this just a small power surge (it's plugged into a great quality surge protector)?</li><li>Was it a graphics card failure?</li><li>Was it a hardware failure that's much more serious?</li><li>Was it something else entirely?</li></ul>
Please, I am worried. This is the family's only computer and I'm terrified of something happening to it.<br />

    <title>Remote desktop connection will not connect &#40;Windows 7 or 8&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthewwinq  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote desktop connection will not connect &#40;Windows 7 or 8&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Here is my issue and I hope that anyone can help.</p>
<p>We have a local domain running through a windows 2012 server. &nbsp;We have migrated our quick books to an external company. They are also running 2012.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They issued some of our users that still need access to quick books a login and sent them a RDP file to connect.&nbsp;<br />
The issue that we are having is that some can connect and other it keeps telling us that, "The credentials that were used to connect to company name did not work please enter new credentials."<br />
I know that the credentials are correct. &nbsp;Here is a list of what is working and not working&nbsp;<br />
(NOTE: all IP's were verified from an external website):<br />
<br />
User A (desktop) is Same IP (windows 7 pro not working)<br />
User A (laptop) is Same IP (windows 8.1 Pro not working)<br />
User B (desktop) is Same IP (windows 7 pro not working)<br />
User C (desktop) is Same IP (windows 7 pro not working)&nbsp;<br />
User D (laptop) &nbsp;is Different IP then the rest &nbsp;(windows 8 Home not working)<br />
<br />
User E (desktop) is Same IP (windows 7 pro WORKING)<br />
User F (server) is Same IP (windows 2012 R2 Standard WORKING)<br />
User G (laptop) is Different IP (windows 8.1 pro WORKING)<br />
User H (surface) is different IP (windows 10 WORKING)<br />
<br />
I have checked the port settings on each one individually to no avail, all of them do have administrative user credentials for that unit. All are up to date on updates and I have checked the firewall settings on each also.&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for any help ahead of time that you may be able to provide.</p>

            Also note that the current version of CCC requires&nbsp; MS .NET 4.5 -<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 from Official Microsoft Download Center</a>
<br />
<br />
After installing .NET 4.5 run Windows Update as there are several security updates.<br />

            Hi Jayant,<br />
<br />
I have already tried reinstalling CCC several times and still have the problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Moreover, whenever the Catalyst control center starts, this error message appears, whether its the automatic start on startup or if I open it manually. I can also not access the Switchable graphics option because the same message appears when I start it.
<div><br />
<div>I had not installed or changed any application or update myself. I suppose the automatic updates could have created the problem although I have Windows Update deactivated too. The problem just started a few days back suddenly. It was running fine in the
 morning and started showing this error message in the evening.<br />

<p>Hi KStateler,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you purchase an app from the Microsoft Store, update settings are the only ones you can manage from there. For you to purchase crystals from the game or any other settings related to the game, you can contact your app developer. They'll be able to check
 your account in the game as well as help you purchase crystals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any Windows issues, do not hesitate to get back to us.</p>

 mine Died. would it be possible to use my win8 key to activate my win10 or do i have to call the support line
</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: i see that connecting account to digital licentie was possible since the annyversary update and my pc Died before i could do that update. i hope my pc is repaired and ready somewhere this week and ill post my findings here for future references.</p>

            In the updates in the past month my PC shows in my account under devices, It has a digital license from&nbsp;the free&nbsp;upgrade from 7 pro, and now it will not activate if updated past v 1709 build 16299.19. It stays activated so long as as it isn't updated the
 win 10 pro digital license was activated for 2 years and another 3 years before that with 7.

<p>I don't think this question has ever been answered. Right now all my PC's are activated, but all the licenses are the same. So how do we legitimately manage the licenses? I'm not about to shell out $100+ only for it to be converted to yet another digital
 license that breaks every time I upgrade or reformat.</p>

    <title>Lost Excel file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hal4321  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost Excel file</h2>
                    <p>I've lost an&nbsp;Excel file (Excel 2003 on Windows 7) that I opened in Hotmail and saved several times then closed.&nbsp; I realized later I should have used Save As.&nbsp;&nbsp;4 hours of work lost.&nbsp; When I look where Excel saves a temp file like this, using Save As on a
 similar file, it goes to a temp file at:</p>
<p>[User]&gt;AppData&gt;Local&gt;Microsoft&gt;Windows&gt;Temporary Internet Files&gt;Low&gt;Content.IE5&gt;[ZN9R8BIQ]</p>
<p>If I go to this location after unhiding all file types there is no "Low" or "Content.IE5" subfolder.&nbsp; Have I lost this file forever?&nbsp; I have NOT set the browser to delete the Temporary files when it closes.&nbsp; There is nothing in the Excel autosave folder
 (C:\Users\[User]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\).</p>
<p>Can a utility like Norton Utilities bring it back by searching the hard drive for unique file content text in free space?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Hal4321,
<div>Your own investigation is on the right track. &nbsp;The file was likely running from the temporary download location. &nbsp;What I would recommend is to return to Hotmail and download another copy of the file. &nbsp;Note where it saves to. &nbsp;Because the file you worked
 on before will already be in that location, the new download will have a number appended to the name (such as ExcelFile[2].xls). &nbsp;You might also be able to open Excel, click the File menu and see if the recently-used-files list has the file you were working
 on.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The file should still exist, but typical Windows 7 searching alone won't find it because it doesn't search the Temporary folders. &nbsp;So if you still haven't found it, try this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1 - Enable the searching inside the contents of all files, even if not in an indexed location. &nbsp;Do this by opening Folder Options, go to the search tab, and choose "Always search file contents..." (the 2nd option).</div>
<div>2 - Open the Temporary Internet Files folder, and type <b>*.xls</b>&nbsp;into the Search box to find all Excel files.</div>
<div><br />

            <p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation
 Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>
<p>If you are prompted to enter a product key, click 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later'</p>

            The receiver is paired to the mouse in the factory and is not a user option. This allows 2 mice near each other not to conflict with each other.

<p>Asi es, en el Instructivo (Que casi Nadie Lee ¬¨¬¨) Viene el Codigo para que Puedas Hacer las Tranferencias, El de AC/DC Era Gratis, y los Packs, Rock y Country Tambien.</p>
<p>Lo Mismo Aplica para los Guitar Hero, Creo Desde el World Tour Trae Dichos Codigos pero no son Compatibles Entre si Todos.</p>

<p>con los trackpacks son gratis entre comillas por que solo te deja cambiarlo una vez osea que si compras uno usado y no se canjea el codigo es por que ya lo usaron y los codigos de los trackpacks son diferentes alos de rockband2 y rockband green day se canjean
 diferente al igual que el lego que es un poquito mas especial para cambiarlo que los otros</p>
