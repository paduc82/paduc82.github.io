<h2>            5.1 setup HDMI not working...</h2>
                    
<p>So I have asked this all over the place... no one answers or has a solution.</p>

<p><span>So I have a Samsung un55fh6200 TV, xfinity cable box, Xbox one, Samsung htj5500 5.1 system.</span></p>
<p><span>I have Xbox hdmi out to TV hdmi in.</span></p>
<p><span>Xfinity Cable box out to Xbox in.</span></p>
<p><span>T</span>hen I run the receiver hdmi out to the other hdmi in on the TV.</p>
<p>I have optical from receiver to Xbox. Receiver only has one hdmi output. No hdmi in either.</p>
<p>When I go into sound settings on the Xbox I have surround on and it lets me chose Dts or dolby digital for the optical audio but hdmi doesn't let me Choose anything but stereo uncompressed. How can I get the hdmi 5.1 uncompressed
 setting on the Xbox to enable the 5.1 surround sound without having to Unplug my cable box from the Xbox . Having the seamless transition from TV to gaming is something I can't give up... Any options?</p>

<p>Hi, I'm not familiar with the Xfinity box but I did find the link below. Whether it's an issue with the Xfinity box itself I'm not sure. Is there a setting on the Xfnity box to enable surround sound on the optical input ?</p>
<p>http://forums.xfinity.com/t5/X1/X1-box-settings-audio-surround-sound/td-p/1776156</p>
<p>Your cabling looks fine from your description.</p>
<p>Also bear in mind that not all programs are broadcast in surround sound, many use stereo only so that may be adding to the equation.</p>
<p>As you're using the optical audio output on the Xbox you may as well turn HDMI audio off totally, the audio from both the Xbox and your Xfinity box should then be routed through the optical cable only. I have a very similar setup but being in the UK I use
 a Virgin Media Tivo. I have HDMI audio off and things seem to be working fine.</p>

<p>I take it you are using the receiver for audio purposes only ?</p>
<p>If that's the case you won't need the HDMI cable from the receiver to the Tv, the audio from both the Xfinity box and Xbox should be routed through the optical out on the Xbox to the receiver so that HDMI cable is pretty much redundant.</p>

<p>So my optical from xbox to receiver &nbsp;and selecting DTS digital is going to give me 5.1 surround?</p>
<p>It def sounds really good when watching netflix.. but ive always thought uncompressed 5.1 under the hdmi audio setting on the xbox would give me better surround sound?</p>

<p>Using optical audio you should have the options for Dolby and DTS both of which provide 5.1 audio.</p>
<p>The source is the important factor in which channels you will hear sound through, if the source is a Dolby or DTS source it's going to sound far far better than a stereo source which may be what's throwing you off a little. The receiver will simply output
 the same audio through the front and rear speakers generally to make the stereo input sound a little less fractured, whereas a Dolby or DTS source will be split into it's respective channels.</p>
<p>Some receivers will try to up the stereo input to 5.1, some work ok some fail miserably but you're always going to notice the difference between a stereo input and a true surround sound input source. That would explain why Netflix sounds better as it does
 provide a true surround sound audio source. Your cable box however may have 1000 tv channels and 5% of those provide a surround sound audio signal and the rest just a stereo signal.</p>
<p>Anyway I'm rambling on, did you try removing that HDMI cable from the receiver to the TV? from what I can see you don't really need that.</p>

<p>Yeah I removed it. &nbsp;I just left it in honestly because I figured my EQ settings i input on the receiver wouldnt take place if i didnt have the hdmi into my tv..</p>
<p>then again.. those probably only work when I use the apps on the &nbsp;receiver or a bluray/dvd in the receiver not the other source inputs (xbox)</p>

    <title>How can I migrate from one Windows 8.1 PC to another&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I migrate from one Windows 8.1 PC to another&#63;</h2>
                    I recently purchased a new computer and would like to copy files from my old computer to the new one. Both run Windows 8.1.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I did some digging and saw that Windows Easy Transfer was suggested for similar transfers, but I can't choose "This is my old PC" on either computer running Windows 8.1 -- I can only copy files from a computer with an older version of Windows.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have hundreds of GBs of files to copy to the new machine. Using SkyDrive to upload these files to the cloud and then download them on the new one would be a nightmare.<br />
<br />
Can you please advise me on how to migrate from one Windows 8.1 machine to another Windows 8.1 machine?</div>
                </div>

            No it doesn't. The object is to copy settings and files from an old computer to a new one. Sharing of files is not the issue.

            <p>He didn't mean it as a permanent setup, just as a means to do the transfer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've shared the folders on the old computer containing the files you want to copy, all you have to do it copy them from one computer to the other. It works exactly like copying files between folders on the same computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have the Homegroup set up, go to your new computer, and check that you can see the files/folders on the old system you want to copy. Then just drag &amp; drop to their new home on the new system. It'll take a while, depending on how much you need to
 move. </p>

</p><blockquote>Hello im tring to hook up my xbox 360 controller with charge cord....</blockquote>
<p>H,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's your problem, right there. Unfortunately, if you connect your wireless Xbox 360 controller with a charging cable, all your doing is charging the controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 360 wireless controller can't be turned into a wired controller with the charging cable as neither the controller or the wire were designed to send data this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You either need 360 wired controller or an Xbox One controller. Xbox One controllers can use wired or wireless, but wireless is only supported via Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>

            Hi Tom.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />First try the steps here:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-dvd-cd-drive-not-working-missing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-dvd-cd-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />Did the DVD drive work in that PC before?  If so this might have been caused by Windows Update.  Did you receive Windows Updates recently?  Check at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Update History.  You can try uninstalling any affecting Updates there.
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before this happened:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by October Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />See if the problem returns with the Update reinstalling and if so uninstall it and block it using the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />To attempt to repair this, go to Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Under DVD Device, click on Driver tab, first try Update Driver &gt; Automatically.  If that fails see if Roll Back is available.  If not choose  Uninstall, restart PC to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Next right click Start button to open Disk Management, scroll down to find the DVD drive.  Does it have a drive letter?  If not right click to issue a drive letter so it shows up in File Explorer, save and exit.
<br />
<br />Run Hardware troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />FYI there is no DVD player in Windows 10, they want you to buy one from the store.  There are better free options here:  <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/how-to-play-dvds-in-windows-10-for-free.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Upload speed issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the alt knight  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upload speed issues</h2>
                    So my current router, a Netgear R6400v2 (couldnt find this in any of the Netgear options in the question credentials), has been working well up until the past couple of months. I am using it wireless, and its good normal amount was about 75 download and
 6 upload on the xbox. But here recently it has stayed around 45 download (not an issue) and 1 upload (the issue). When i run tests on other devices it shows my speed as optimal, around 90 download and 7 upload. So the issue is only on my xbox and only the
 past few months. I have countlessly tried to hard reset the router AND the xbox, unplugging both for at least 30 seconds (typically longer), and holding the power button on the xbox for the 10 second amount required to hard reset. I factory reset the router
 even. I still cant get back to the same speed it had. Is there something I can do in the router settings to optimize it? Recently I have tested turning off upnp and changed NAT filtering from secured to open. No changes. Any suggesti

            Check in your router if you have the current firmware. And it is also possible that your router is outdated. The router is for two years, sometimes for a year. Technology is going so fast ahead. That routers are being upgraded basically year after year.

<p>Below is a quote from my own posting regarding this issue which unfortunately was CLOSED by an administrator for completely bogus reasons. I'm appending it below so that any of you reading this and looking for a resolution can know what I have already attempted
 and what hasn't worked. Please feel free to contact me on xbox live using my forum name if you have any questions or happen to come across a resolution.

<p>
</p><p><em>"OK i'm not here to ask for the same obvious tech support tips that everyone's mother already knows so only remark if you know what your talking about.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>System is the xbox one original (with a samsung SSD internal drive swap)</em></p>
<p><em>Docsis 3.1 modem, (have tried 3 different models all of them are stand alone modems not router/modem combos)</em></p>
<p><em>Router is an Asus RT-AC68U flashed with latest asuswrt (merlin firmware)</em></p>
<p><em>I have all Cat 7 cable, and I have tried a second set of all Cat 6 cable, all cable is less than 20 feet segments.</em></p>
<p><em>I DO NOT USE ANY WIFI ... I have disabled the wifi on the router it's never on, never will be so don't suggest it because it's not the issue.</em></p>
<p><em>ISP is&nbsp; SPECTRUM&nbsp; (crappy I know) 400Mbit down/20Mbit up</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>So...</em></p>
<p><em>I use to get my regular paid for speeds no problem on my xbox using all the same hardware mentioned above and then one day about 7 months ago or so it went to hell. I believe it was right about the time M$ started pushing all this trash with cortana,
 alexis, new avartar editors, MIXER.... you know when they forgot we bought the xbox to GAME and not to play pocket pull with amazon. So my issue is now I get my 400mbits down still, but about 2-3mbits&nbsp; up and always a packetloss of 1-3%.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>So here are the things I have done to try and resolve my issue as well as the thing items I believe to not be a contributing factor.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>***My PC gets the same speeds just fine still on this same network, this problem is largely aligned with the xbox***</em></p>
<p><em>*Got Spectrum to actually run me a private line direct from the main box to my residence.</em></p>
<p><em>*Upnp (enabled/disabled)</em></p>
<p><em>*Port forwarded (without Upnp on I know)</em></p>
<p><em>*DMZ (without upnp or port-forwarding)</em></p>
<p><em>*Different DNS servers</em></p>
<p><em>*Disabled Firewall entirely</em></p>
<p><em>*Disabled TrendMicro deep packet scanning on router</em></p>
<p><em>*Configured QoS tried it multiple ways, and tried without it on at all as well</em></p>
<p><em>*Bypassed the router ENTIRELY and went straight to the modem still same issues on all 3 modems</em></p>
<p><em>*Booted up my xbox360 to see if it could get better connection by chance... same trash on the upload</em></p>
<p><em>*Enabled IPv6 and it's correctly configured and passing ipv6 tests online , still same trash</em></p>
<p><em>*Disabled IPv6 still same trash</em></p>
<p><em>*Disabled all pass-throughs (SIP, RTSP, H.23, PPTP, L2Tp, IPSEC) no luck&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>*ENABLED all pass-throughs as well neither way mattered at all</em></p>
<p><em>*Performed an entire factory recovery on my xbox using the eject/sync and power button trick and choose options to do a full recovery keep nothing. Had to download all the games and everything again including profile and still the same BS....&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Now understand once in a rare moment I can run the test and I'll score great then it goes away the very next time I reset, play a game or shut down. I've even installed those EMI reducing rings on the usb cables that connect
 to the back of the xbox for my keyboard and charging cable. The only other info I can offer you all is that in my connection logs I always see the ports connected as 3074-&gt;3544 teredo (which I realize is the ipv6 encapsulation) but why do I never see a straight
 connection when I have ipv6 enabled? The Xbox has an ipv6 address on both the xbox itself in settings, and on my router in the leases page, and as mentioned above the xbox can pass IPv6 test websites no problem, still never see a single ipv6 connection or
 handshake. Is it possible that something in my profile settings or the profile itself could be corrupt and causing this? I'm beyond frustrated because each new dashboard update is just more TRASH to bloat the system with, and live service just begins to circle
 the drain faster... but AT LEAST WE CAN ALL USE ALEXIS NOW!!! and THANK GOD for that and the game dragging MIXER streamers... they are really a joy to have in the game aren't they?"</em><br />

                    <p>When I try to mount my bitlocker-encrypted VHD file, I get the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Couldn't Mount File, Make sure the file is in NTFS volume and isn't a compressed folder or volume</p>

    <title>Samsung 305T resolution limited after upgrading from Windows XP to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timothymcgarvey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Samsung 305T resolution limited after upgrading from Windows XP to Windows 7 Ultimate</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded from Windows XP to Windows 7 Ultimate.&nbsp; Immediately upon upgrade, the maximum resolution of my Samsung Syncmaster 305T monitors went from 1920 x 1080 to 1280 x 800.&nbsp; Neither NVIDIA control panel nor Windows will 'allow' a resolution higher
 than 1280 x 800 now.&nbsp; Of course, I have the same high end NVIDIA graphics cards and the same monitors; however, a change/upgrade in the OS forced a lower resolution in the same monitors.&nbsp; I've recently added other monitors and Windows allows then to be 1920
 x 1080.&nbsp; In fact, the 305T monitors have a higher native resolution than even 1920 x 1080.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had contacted Microsoft Windows support after the OS upgrade and they couldn't help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any assistance would be helpful. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My graphics cards are NVIDIA QUADRO NVS 450 and NVIDIA QUADRO FX 560.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

            <p>Since an upgrade from winxp to win7 is via a clean install, did you then visit your hardware makers to install the win7 specific drivers? or did you rely on the windows update drivers?</p>
<p>The max resolution available is governed by the drivers being used, as you probably know.</p>

                    How do you remove the icon of an uninstalled app that still show in Apps and Features win10.&nbsp; Clicked (offending program) uninstall and shows windows cannot find c:\windows\system32\ss2uninst.exe.&nbsp; So I removed the program manually.&nbsp; Was able to remove
 all traces of the program, including from the folders and startup menus.&nbsp; The only thing left now is to remove from App and Features.&nbsp; I also tried the Repair in Control Panel procedure.&nbsp; Didn't help.&nbsp; Anyone know how to do this?&nbsp; Thank you.

            Hello niclin
<br />Thank you for participating in the Microsoft Community, my name is G.Paz, I am an Independent Advisor. 
<br />Verify from regedit if the program still appear, for that access to the following route on reggedit:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall
<br />Froom the uninstall tab verify if the app still appear. 
<br />If so, select them and remove it. 
<br />Then restart your machine. 
<br />If the issue still persist follow the steps on this link: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17588/windows-fix-problems-that-block-programs-being-installed-or-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17588/...</a>

<p>Hello mdTushar,</p>
<p><span>If the program is not compatible, then you may try to install and run the program in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Use the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the Program</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Properties</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Compatibility tab</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 Run this program in compatibility mode and select Windows Vista or whatever operating system the program was running successfully.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link here: Make older programs run in this version of Windows</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you run Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate version, install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP mode (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx</span></a>)
 and execute your software in Windows XP.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you run Windows 7 Home Premium, try VirtualBox (<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.virtualbox.org</span></a>) or VMware Player (<a href="http://www.vmware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.vmware.com</span></a>)
 or any other 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; party virtualization software and install a separate copy of Windows XP (either Home Edition or Professional) for that purpose.<span>You can find virtualization software free of charge that will run on Windows
 7 Home Premium.</span></span></p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

</p><p>One laptop cannot "see" the router wirelessly. It can contect by cable(ethernet).</p>
<p>Other devices <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">do</span> connect wirelessly. (Desktop, Printer, Phone)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bottom right has <strong>wireless bars with red X</strong>. Clicking this says "<em><strong>No Connections Availabl</strong></em><strong>e</strong>".</p>
<p>"Troubleshooting" finds nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions tried so far:</p>
<p>No little <strong>Wi-Fi button</strong> - but Fn&gt;F8 shows that Wireless is on.</p>
<p>Below the F8 wireless symbol is an oval Wi-Fi symbol. This is on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Device Manager, there are two <strong>Network Adapters</strong>. Both have been uninstalled and re-installed.</p>
<p>In "Properties", both claim to be "working normally".</p>
<p>Network Adapters are:</p>
<p>i) Realtek PCIc FE Family Controller</p>
<p>ii) Realtek RTL8188CE Wireless LAN 802.11n PCI-E NIC</p>
<p>iii) (<em>Can't remember but something about Tunnelling for IPv6.</em>)</p>
<p>[<em>I assume that the Family Controller is for the cable/ethernet connection.</em>]</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>BIOS</strong>: Some people suggested a wireless on/off switch in BIOS. I cannot find a "Network Settings", "Wireless" or (someone else...) "Config".</p>
<p>The initial BIOS list seems to be the order of loading - -with Realtek being last. Clicking this seems only to cause Windows to load.</p>
<p>In Power Management there was a switch for "LAN wake up" (or similar). This was disabled so I enabled it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop is a <strong>Toshiba Satellite</strong>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Is there another part of the BIOS I'm missing</strong></em>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So ... this laptop cannot detect the wireless router.</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be very welcome.</p>
<p>(<em>I''ve been fiddling with PCs since DOS days .... but I still get confused by missing steps or alternative terminology ....</em> ;-)</p>
<p>Thanks very much</p>
<p>

            <p>Ramesh, </p>
<p>I'm sure you're a great guy - but please don't cut and paste an answer without reading the question.</p>
<p>(<em>Too many answers in this Community answer a different question, which adds to frustration......</em>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>How does <em>this</em> help?</p>
<p>"<em>The wireless networks will only appear if your PC has a wireless network adapter installed, the adapter is turned on, and the wireless access point is in range</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I explained that the two Network Adapters have been <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

<p>Perhaps I did<em> not</em> spell out that the Router (why confuse with "network access point?" was 6 feet away - although I did mention it working via cable/ethernet
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you have any insight in to how an Adapter can be "on" yet the laptop not "see" the router, then I would appreciate the info.</strong></p>
<p><em>And why send me a link to Win XP when this subject header clearly says "Windows 7" ?????</em></p>
<p>Then, having found the Win 7 equivalent, it provides no insight about a Network Adapter being "on " but not "seeing" the router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked a question about Wireless LAN in the <strong>BIOS</strong>.</p>
<p>The lack of answer supports my theory of answers being "cut and paste".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry - but that's my impression.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be really, really appreciative of anyone that can help explain how to get this one laptop to "see" the wireless network - and join the other devices that connect fine by wireless.</p>

<h2>            Blue Screen Crashing Randomnly Since Windows 10 1803 April Update</h2>
                    <p>Since installing the april 2018 update (version 1803) on my hp spectre x2, i've had random blue screen crashes happening continuously. i know there is an issue with blue screen crashes using chrome browser and when activating cortana by voice command, but
 i'm having blue screen crashes elsewhere in other applications as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>steps i've tried: resetting my pc back to factory settings and then reinstall all of the updates; running a chkdsk scan of my windows drive, and doing a clean boot. nothing has worked. please advise.</p>

            HI Tony.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />Run the Blue Screen Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Prepare the BSOD crash report for analysis following these steps:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I just had a blue screen crash a few minutes ago after running the blue screen troubleshooter, which didn't find any issues, and I still couldn't generate a crash report. So, to confirm, I should skip trying to find the crash reports?

<p>Si la caja del juego viene con la leyenda "completamente en español", NO, no podrás cambiarle el audio a ingles, me parece que solo los menús cambian a ingles y nada mas. En la tienda de "jugadores" (la misma que tuvo serios problemas con las ediciones especiales

<p>Chavos... desde halo 2 hasta el reach.. el multiplayer se escucha en inglés cambiando la configuración de la consola a localización: estados unidos y lenguaje: inglés... pero esto no ocurre en Halo 4 cierto?... alguién ha intentado cambiar el idioma (NO
 DE LA CAMPAÑA) sino el multiplayer??... será por la actualización del juego??... porque sinceramente es una porquería escuchar "muerte doble, muerte triple... etc" &nbsp;</p>

<p>No se puede cambiar, es como dice la leyenda que tiene la portada “Completamente en Español” y tampoco se puede cambiarle el idioma al cambiarle la región de tu consola porque seguirá estando en español. La única alternativa es comprar la versión Gringa
 que la puedes adquirir en Gameplanet y esa si viene con subtítulos en Español.</p>

<h2>            Does Windows 10 have that infuriating auto maintenance&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm certain I am not alone in asking, Does Windows 10 have that obnoxious "Automate Maintenance" program? I absolutely HATE it! It is more than frustrating to be in the middle of a project, which requires you to be off your keyboard for a few minutes at
 a time, only to return and have to wait for the maintenance program to stop before you can continue using your system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know you can let it run solo, for as long as an HOUR, and it will leave you alone for the rest of the day, but some of us have no inclination to do so, nor should we have to. Contrary to popular (programmer) belief, the vast majority of we users do
 NOT want everything "automated". In fact, most of us don't want our computer running ANYTHING unless we tell it to.</p>

            <p>I assume you mean Windows 10 can turn it off by deleting the scheduled task, because I have found no way to do it in Windows 8.1, as you cannot delete, or turn off scheduled tasks in 8.1.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again I want to reiterate that none of the users, to whom I have spoken on this subject, want any type of automated maintenance. Only basic system necessities should run without the operators direct permission, and even then permission is given by
 turning your system on and logging in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But thank you for taking the time to address my concerns.</p>

            <p>I appreciate your taking the time to address my question but, when you tell me that, "it does it's job without interfering with whatever you are doing", that is obviously not true, or I would have had no reason&nbsp;bring it up in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you leave what you are doing for even a couple of minutes, and automated maintenance goes into a deep mode, it can take as much as three minutes to regain control of your system. This may not be a problem for most, but if you are in a business where
 your computer runs from the time you start it until you close the lid, or you are through for the day, and&nbsp;you must leave the computer idle for 2 to 3 minutes at a time, this is an incredible, and frustrating, waste of time.&nbsp;It is a flawed concept and should
 never have been implemented.</p>

            Unfortunately there is no way this question will be truly answered until I implement the download, and have seen for myself that you can "delete the scheduled task". I have found no way to do so in Win 8.1, so I will have to see this for myself.

                    <p>recently downloaded windows 10 everything is now working fine, but I keep receiving popups from my Norton security suggesting</p>
<p>I choose e explorer or google chrome as my default browser instead of Microsoft edge, but my new window 10 recommends using</p>
<p>Microsoft edge. am I vulnerable while surfing the web using Microsoft edge and having Norton security. Also is it necessary or recommended to keep Norton security {or any additional security}&nbsp;if I should decide to keep using Microsoft edge. Basically should
 I turn on windows defender and the windows firewall and eliminate the&nbsp;Norton security is my Question.</p>
<p>Is this preferred and will windows defender and firewall provide adequate or better security for my Microsoft edge browser. I am getting more familiar with the new W10 and like it . Just need some clarification on this security issue. I am currently using
 M-edge and intend to eliminate Norton Security, but if using windows defender and firewall should I choose to use another browser such as google will windows defender and firewall provide the same level of security. I am new to computers and all the security
 and viruses issues confuse me just want to know what the best level of security is. without all the&nbsp;overkill need some answers&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks Tony</p>

            <p>Hi Tony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your query, I will assist you with this.</p>
<p>Basically, Windows defender also works to protect your PC from malicious viruses and keeps your PC safe.</p>
<p>If you have installed third party antivirus&nbsp;Windows defender&nbsp;is turned off automatically by itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows defender provides the same level of protection as any other antiviruses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information I suggest you to refer the link:</p>

</p><p>Hope the information is helpful, feel free to post Windows related issues in Microsoft Community. We will be glad to assist you.</p>

            <p>Thanks for reply. Exact date unsure, but every update for win 10 listed as failed, even though it worked, first showing 13 aug 15. The win 7 update failed since 14th aug. Many listed failures since. Can't remember details but just followed Microsoft instructions
 for returning to win 7.</p>
<p>Used mcaffee since computer was bought over 5 years ago, no previous problems.</p>
<p>Don't use registry cleaners.</p>
<p>Something showed as missing or corrupted but I can't find that message now. Perplexing!</p>

            It went away for a while, now it's back just the same problem.&nbsp; Every time I shut down a message "uploading 1 of 1".&nbsp; All listed as failures in update history but showing uploaded in updates. Doesn't effect how I use the internet, Mcafee security working
 fine. I know friends who have experienced/still experience the same problems as microsoft try to force everyone into win 10. WE DON'T LIKE IT OR NEED IT! It's not the second coming, despite what the advertising campaign tries to make it. No competition, you
 do as you like. But it's just the internet, nothing important. I will just use it less and less. Thankfully I have a life in the real world.

            Thanks for your perseverance, you probably have many questions to deal with. As I said before, it would have been about 13/14th august that win 7 removed, win 10 installed &amp; removed, win 7 re-installed. Norton was included when I bought the computer over
 5 years ago and was soon replaced by Mcafee in conjunction with broadband package BTNetprotectplus. No problems with this set up before. Updates are shown as successful for KB915597 windows defender 10/SEPT/15, KB3084135 windows 7 security update 11/SEPT/15
 but I expect you already know that.

<p>No, I didn't know that - KB3084135 was one of the updates I asked you about&nbsp;two days ago&nbsp;&amp; you told me you couldn't find any of them listed in

<p>
</p><p>2. Is KB3083324 listed in <strong>Installed Updates</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. BT NetProtect Plus "powered by McAfee" is installed <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
AND</span> Windows Defender is enabled (turned on) <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Fact: Norton and McAfee applications are <em>notorious </em>for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The "leftovers" may be the source of all your troubles.</li></ul>

<p>&nbsp;When I scroll further down in installed updates I find a whole new area and guess what, all those numbers are listed on the 9th sept. and 4135 on the 10th sept.</p>
<p>Will check defender.</p>
<p>Never used Norton or Mcafee removal tool.</p>
<p>Thanks for your assistance.</p>

<br />
Hello, <br />
my <span style="font-weight: bold">Steinberg Cubase 5.2 </span>used to work on Windows XP, but now I have Windows 7 64-bit (Home Premium) installed and it won't work anymore.&nbsp; I mean, it installed all right on Program Files (x86), it will open and run, but no
 sound comes out of it.&nbsp; I've already tried changing the sound device, but at no avail.<br />
I can't even install "Windows XP mode" because I would have to have the Professional Edition of Windows 7.<br />
If anyone could please give me a hint, I would appreciate very much!!!!<br />
Thank you,<br />
Leonardo<br />

Is the software designed for a previous version of Windows such as Windows XP? Most older programs cannot work with Windows 7, especially some programs for Windows XP, possible that you might need to upgrade to Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate if you are
 not running either edition and download the free Windows XP Mode program which will allow you run older programs:<br />

<h2>            Computer clock falls behind</h2>
                    <p>The clock on my computer keeps falling behind.<br />
</p>
<p>I've tried syncing it with time.windows.com under "internet time" in the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried going to "services.msc", to "Windows Time" and changing the start type to automatic and made sure that thing was running</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've scanned my computer for malware (With malwarebytes) and nothing came up.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
One of the possible reasons why the time displayed on your computer keeps falling behind is because of a corrupted user profile. For us to assist you, we suggest that you create another account with administrator privileges and check if the time doesn't fall
 behind. Here's an article that you can visit to see how to do it: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create a local user or administrator account in Windows 10</a>.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, we recommend that you contact the OEM of your computer to check if there's an issue with your CMOS battery. You may refer to this article on how to contact the manufacturer of your computer:
