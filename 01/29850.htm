<h2>            error number 0xC1900101-OX30018</h2>
                    <div>I've been trying for the past two days to upgrade my Windows 8 Pro machine to Windows 8.1.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Every time, after the reboot, it continues the install for a while; sometimes, the machine reboots again and continues. The install always eventually freezes my machine (the dots in a circle stop moving) and no length of waiting allows it to continue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I get the error: "Couldn't update to Windows 8.1 - 0xC1900101 - 0x30018" once I hard reset my computer and it reverts to the previous version.</div>
                </div>

            That is the same error number I received when I tried to update,and it was because of an update that wouldn't install kb2861702,kb2756872 and kb2771413.

<div>
<p>After trying everything, the last resort was:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)redefined comp, erasing everything , which lasted 5(five) hours to install win 8 !!!!!</p>
<p>2)there was 88 update archives or 500 MB for win 8, which taked 3 hours.</p>
<p>3)upgrade to win 8.1 , more 4 hours...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Impressions: </p>
<p>a)More battery life from 2 hours to 3 hours, the comp is of 2008.</p>
<p>b)Have to desabilitate sound improvements, because of &nbsp;horrible sound, after cd quality.</p>
<p>c)the driver to card reader was lost, win 8.1 do not find it, DriversHQ to te rescue!</p>
<p>d)videoboard SIS mirage 3 works, but 3D is slowwwww.</p>
<p>e)no troubles with realtek wifi and ethernet.</p>

<h2>            Lost windows 7 for 10,want it back but have no discs</h2>
                    I had windows 7,and it worked fine. I decided to go to 10 since it kept prompting me and I thought they knew best. Well,it seemed to work fine, but now some of my games keep crashing. I tried updating graphics drivers (it said I had the best suited for
 my pc) and when I got drivers from intel, it said my computer couldn't handle ANY of them. I wanted to restore back to 7, but I lost it. I have no discs either. Can't Windows just give me a free download of 7? I mean, if 10 is free, can't it be free to go
 backward? Any tips?

            Re-build Windows 7
<div>
<p>If you are going to do a re-install, you may be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you had or have Windows 10 installed</strong>, you are unlikely to ever get Windows 7 working again satisfactorily unless you do a complete re-install.&nbsp; The Windows 10 reverting program just does not do the job correctly, and will leave your system
 in a state that you will not find satisfactory.&nbsp; &nbsp;In this case, a System Repair disk is not going to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you have a corrupted Windows 7 system</strong>, you are trying to recover, you want to try a System Repair disk to boot the PC.&nbsp; It may be more successful in fixing and offer other alternatives.&nbsp; If you do not have one, go to any other PC that
 has windows 7 with the same bitness (32/64).&nbsp; Start globe, All Programs, Maintenance.&nbsp; You need just a blank CD.&nbsp; When you boot, ensure that you are in fact booting on that CD and not the hard drive.&nbsp; Usually pressing F12 will lead you to the option to do
 so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best alternative strategies to rebuild are the following in preference order:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Factory restore — replaces everything on the hard drive with exactly what it had on it when you bought it.&nbsp; You access this before Windows starts using a special key that can varies by brand.&nbsp; F11 is the most common. This is an option only if the installed
 hard drive is the original.&nbsp; This is not a valid strategy on a failing hard drive.</li><li>“Upgrade” install using the Win7 install disk.&nbsp;(<em>This is not an option when recovering from a Windows 10 installation</em>). You start as if you are re-installing from scratch but when it gets to the point where it offers the Upgrade choice you choose
 that.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is not a valid strategy on a failing hard drive.</li><li><em><strong>Full Clean install.&nbsp; The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; If you are not using a brand new disk, when it shows the screen to select where you want to put Windows, click on the Advanced link and delete all partitions.&nbsp;
 Do not install any software until after ALL Windows Updates are installed and Device Manager shows all devices installed.</strong></em></li></ol>
<p>You will need a Win7 install disk for 2 or 3.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code for 3 and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Clean Install tip</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<em><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">before</span></strong>
</span></em>any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">+</span></strong></em>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive,
 you will have a precise duplicate of your system as it was at that point.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for PLUS R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>

<h2>            Downgrade from MP12 to MP11</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm running Windows 7 and I'm&nbsp;not getting on with Media Player 12 - looks, feel, navigation, all of it basically.</p>
<p>I'd like to be able to uninstall MP12 and install MP11. Ideally I'm looking for a solution which is relatively easy and doesn't require registry hacks etc.</p>
<p>Any help or suggestions for how I&nbsp;can achieve the above would be most welcome</p>
<p>Many thanks, Darren</p>

<p><span>You won’t be able to downgrade from Windows Media Player 12 to Windows Media Player 11 as Windows Media Player 12 comes as a default player with Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>However, refer the below link, this might make you use Media Player 12 in a easier way:</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 wont boot up, black screen with blinking cursor..</h2>
                    <p>After upgrade on my HP probook, windows7 will not start. All I get is a black screen with a flashing cursor. I do not have the discs for Windows 7 and I have never done a back-up to my computer on discs or other hard drive.</p>
<p>1. This computer was ordered for me by the VA for my schooling.</p>
<p>2. All that is available upon start up is the HP system check and restore to factory settings by pressing the escape key.</p>
<p>3.Norton Anitvirus came with the computer and was installed when I received it.</p>
<p>Please give me some hope, for this computer for all of my school related work is gone.</p>

<p>Why is my screen black when I start Windows 7?<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/why-is-my-screen-black-when-i-start-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/why-is-my-screen-black-when-i-start-windows-7</a></p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>Saving any needed data and re-installing Windows 7 might be the best option though here are a<br />
few others.</p>
<p>You can save your files by putting the drive in another computer or an external drive case and then<br />
backing them up. Do so using several methods in a redundant manner. Of course a real computer<br />
shop or your System maker can help recover the files.<br />
<br />
Or you could use an Ubuntu boot CD to back up the data.<br />
<br />
Use Ubuntu Live CD to Backup Files from Your Dead Windows Computer <br />
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer</a><br />

<br />
Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel<br />
- Device Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver -<br />
then Right Click on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.<br />
<br />
A method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and Safe Mode) is to CTRL +<br />
ALT + DEL - Task Manager and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - then<br />
on Applications&nbsp;Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe. Safe Mode is reached by<br />
repeatedly tapping F8 as you boot up. CTRL + SHIFT + ESC also starts Task Manager.<br />
<br />
First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back to this thread.</p>

<p>Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss<br />
basis. That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just<br />
adds to the difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect.<br />
<br />
You can try a google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these<br />
cover a wide field of efforts.</p>
<p>Here is a video of one fix.</p>

<br />
Do you have a&nbsp;Window 7&nbsp;Disk? You can try System Restore from it. If you do not have the<br />
disks your system maker will sell them cheap. Or try from Safe Mode if you can get<br />
there.<br />

    <title>Watch Dogs Season Pass on Xbox ONE if purchased on Xbox 360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> superniceguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Watch Dogs Season Pass on Xbox ONE if purchased on Xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>I bought Watch Dogs and the season pass on 360 and then the digital download of Watch Dogs on Xbox ONE, then went to download the season pass on Xbox ONE and it is asking me to pay for it again.</p>
<p>I thought if you bought &nbsp;a season pass on 360 you automatically got it on Xbox ONE too? Should do according to this:&nbsp;<a href="http://news.xbox.com/2013/08/xbox-one-season-pass-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://news.xbox.com/2013/08/xbox-one-season-pass-program</a></p>
<p>Ubisoft are part of the season pass guarantee and it states for all blockbuster titles in 2013 and 2014, so Watch Dogs should qualify</p>
<p>I only started to play Watch Dogs today on 360, so maybe needs 48 hours to register?</p>

<p>Not every game from those publishers will be included in that offer. If the pass is eligible, it will list it in the description. So you would have to purchase that pass again if you want it on the One.</p>

<p>It didn't say the pass was eliglble for Ac4 in the description either, but it was.</p>
<p>That link I provided is an official xbox link, and Watch Dogs would be one game to qualify for being a blockbuster title in 2014, and it fits all the conditions stated. If it was a game like Rayman Legends or a games released in 2015 then I would see it
 not qualifying. I only bought the Xbox 360 version because of this. I am not buying the Season Pass again, and I am not playing the game on Xbox ONE unless I am able to get the pass on Xbox ONE too.
</p>
<p>If you have to buy them separately hopefully, due to lack of clarity, they will be either be able to switch the pass from 360 to Xbox ONE, or refund the Xbox ONE game.</p>
<p>If this game does not qualify then Ubisoft and/or microsoft are reneging the Season Pass Guarantee</p>

<p>I got the AC4 Season Pass ages ago in Nov / Dec as it said it was free because I bought it on Xbox 360. The message was specific to me not a general message as it is now. It must have been since updated to say that.</p>
<p>Even in the link I provided it stated you needed to have both games to qualify, and although I had both games of AC4 on Xbox ONE and Xbox 360, I had not put the disc in the console let alone even play it, for the account to qualify, yet it still gave me
 the Season Pass free, because I bought the season pass on Xbox 360 and played the game on Xbox 360.</p>
<p>At the end of the day it is not clear, and I hope they can switch the pass from &nbsp;360 to Xbox ONE then, otherwise I have shafted myself through lack of clarity. If it does not qualify then they should put a message that this does not work for the Xbox 360
 on Xbox ONE and does not work on Xbox ONE on the 360 version.</p>
<p>When they said participating titles it seems to mean blockbuster titles. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When they go make a statement that season passes will work on both consoles for Blockbuster games in 2013 and 2014, and &nbsp;then do not say it will not work for both in the description on titles that do not actually qualify but fill the criteria as mentioned
 in that link to qualify, then they are asking for trouble. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On Shopto.net for the Season Pass it says it works on Xbox 360 and Xbox ONE</p>

<p>On GAME if you click on the black Watch Dogs Season Pass link on the Xbox 360 version it gives you the pass with Xbox ONE written on it:</p>

<p>At the end of the day it is still not clear. I have searched the internet high and low for information whether it work on both, and everything I found suggested it would work on both, and nothing to say that it would not work on both</p>
<p>Will a Xbox / MS customer service agent come online in the week and be able to refund the Xbox 360 Season Pass or the Xbox ONE game or will I have to send a ticket in somewhere? I can play the Xbox 360 version without Season Pass but I do not want to play
 Xbox ONE version without season pass</p>

<p>You would have to contact support directly to ask about a refund. Although everything in the marketplace does state that there are no refunds so there is no guarantee that they will give one.</p>

<p>I only bought the Xbox 360 Season pass on the understanding it would carry over, as they made a big deal about season passes carrying over, and as it specifically does not say that it will not carry over then should get a refund.
</p>
<p>Even after all this discussion here, it is only assumed now that the pass does not carry over, there is no 100% positivity on the matter, and it could take about 48 hours for the account to register both games, and I could see it free on Xbox ONE for me
 in a day or two, or they could make it carry over later on, and milk the impatient people. They may not have assigned it yet. Hopefully a support official will make comment in the week, and clarify the situation right up.</p>

<p>I just contacted MS support through live chat, as no response here, and they said the pass does carry over, but for the finer details on how it works the game developer has the information about it.</p>
<p>I have not played it much so that could be it, to prevent people renting or borrowing and playing briefly to get the pass on the Xbox ONE. 10 hours or so should do it, plus maybe 48 hours to register. If not then it could be something else</p>

<h2>            Samsung Monitor not working after Windows 10 install</h2>
                    <p>After installing Windows 10 on my HP laptop, the Samsung external monitor doesn't want to display. All drivers are updated, Device Manager under Monitors shows the monitor (with model number: SD590_S24D590PL) "working correctly." It is connected via HDMI.
 I have installed the drivers with compatibility mode. Any help would be appreciated - thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Marty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's unfortunate that you are facing this issue. Let me assist you to resolve the issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me ask you few questions first. </p>
<ul>
<li>Are the correct graphics card drivers installed which provide multiple monitor support?</li><li><span>What happens when you try to connect the second monitor to your computer? Do you get any error message?</span></li></ul>
<p>You may check running hardware devices troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>
<p>a. Type <strong>troubleshooting </strong>in the search box on taskbar.<br />
b. Click <strong>troubleshooting </strong>in the search results.<br />
c. Click "<strong>View all</strong>" and then click "<strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>".<br />
d. Click "<strong>Next</strong>" and follow on-screen instructions. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest uninstalling all your graphics card and display drivers, rebooting and letting Windows go and find the right ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press <strong>Windows +X</strong></p>
<p>Go to <strong>Device Manager &gt; Display adapter </strong>right click <strong>Update Driver Software</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this post helps. We look forward to hearing from you. </p>

            Are the correct graphics card drivers installed which provide multiple monitor support? YES
<li><span>What happens when you try to connect the second monitor to your computer? Do you get any error message? No error message - the computer thinks "This device is working properly."</span></li><li><span>I also uninstalled the drivers for the graphics cards as well as for the monitor and had Windows find the correct ones.

<h2>            Skype message cash</h2>
                    Hey. I've been using skype for a long time. Of course, I understand that the further the hardware becomes more productive, but try don't forget about ordinary users. I have a processor i3-3110m (2 cores, 4 threads), ordinary HDD, when switching between
 the dialogs the CPU utilization reaches 30%. Make a cache for messages or something else. I understand that downloading dialogs every time comes from the hard drive, but at these moments, he eerily hangs fo about half of second. Even just when you hover the
 cursor beetween different dialogs, the animation is delayed.

Can you tell me when a restore point is created where is it kept? I know how to make them and how to use them and how to turn them on and off, but after I deleted some files none of my roll backs to a particular restore point work that is why I am looking for
 them so I can find them in a back up and put them back.</blockquote>
<br />
I <em>think</em> Restore Points are in C:\System Volume Information.<br />
I may be wrong about that, but I don't think you can restore the restore from backups...

            From the Help on "previous versions":<br />
<br />
<em>"Previous versions are automatically saved as part of a restore point. If system protection is turned on,
<span>Windows</span> automatically creates previous versions of files and folders that have been modified since the last restore point was made."</em>
<br />
<br />
But you are right: data is not <strong>automatically</strong> restored during a System Restore.<br />
<br />
All restore point data is stored in the <strong>heavily protected</strong> folder "System Volume Information" of the particular partition.

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro - Airplane Mode Stuck on a Wired Adaptor</h2>
                    <p>I'm having an issue where the yellow triangle will not go away on my taskbar notification area, when you hover over the triangle it says "Network No Internet Access". Which is odd because I can get on the internet just fine. Also the Airplane-mode is stuck
 on which I don't understand because I do not have a wireless adapter installed on this computer. I do have a couple Bluetooth adapters they include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Kingston Bluetooth 4.0 USB Adapter.(use this for a Bluetooth headphone set that I use)</li><li>a Logitech Unify USB adapter for my Logitech K520 keyboard and MX Master Mouse.</li></ul>
<p>I have two Network Adapters one is integrated it is a Intel Ethernet Connection I218-V &amp; one is a PCI Card it is Intel Gigabit CT Desktop Adapter. I get the same issue with both so I do not think it is the adapter being at fault. The odds of both new items
 being bad is slim.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps I have taken so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Made sure all windows updates are up to date and installed. (Showed no errors in the history)</li><li>Downloaded the latest drivers for windows 10 from the wired adapter Manufacturer (Intel), installed and rebooted.</li><li>Disabled all power saving and wake on LAN settings in the Network Adapters from Device Manager &gt;Network adapters&gt;Selected adapter&gt;Properties dialog window&gt;Power Management(Tab).</li><li>Flushed ARP Tables, Flushed DNS, Reset IP Log, Released and Renewed IP.</li><li>Reset the Charter Cable Internet modem and router.</li><li>Flushed the DNS cache on the Windows Server.</li></ul>
<p>This computer is on a local domain that uses a Windows Server 2012 R2 installed on a virtual machine from Citrix XenCenter Version 6.5 64 Bit. The Windows Server is the DHCP server for the network and our DNS goes thru this server. We also have a paid service
 thru Cisco Systems called OpenDNS Umbrella which filters web content for our company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed this on a couple other computers on our network also. I have followed the same steps as this one but nothing has helped. Does anyone know what is causing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I use a program called CPUID which gives a report on my hardware. The link is to that report.

            Quite often in your scenario the Airplane Mode bug is triggered by having a UPS data cable connected to your computer. In that circumstance Airplane Mode can be removed by either unplugging the data cable or installing the UPS data management software
 (eg. -Powerchute for APC, etc. etc.)

            <p>I do have a battery backup, APC Model No. BACK-UPS NS 575G. I unplugged the USB cord rebooted, Did not fix the problem. I then Installed Power Chute Personal Edition 3.0.2, Did not fix. Read a few googled articles, come up with the solution. Apparently Windows
 10 has an issue with Static IP addresses. I turn DHCP back on and the problem goes away. Use the static address again and it comes back. Go figure!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I must admit I hadn't heard of that one yet. Seems an easy enough change so I tried to duplicate it here but no luck. Airplane mode&nbsp;didn't appear&nbsp;when my Ethernet adapter was set to use&nbsp;static IP. I do note though that one of the other known&nbsp;cures&nbsp;for stuck-on
 Airplane mode is to&nbsp;disable the setting that allows the&nbsp;computer to turn off the Ethernet adapter to save power.&nbsp;I've had&nbsp;that disabled&nbsp;since long ago, despite the fact that it didn't&nbsp;fix the Airplane Mode problem on this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm suspecting that, what with all the&nbsp;seemingly random scenarios and different fixes for the stuck Airplane mode issue, especially on desktops without WiFi or Bluetooth, that in each circumstance it is some unidentified unique characteristic&nbsp;of the affected
 computers' hardware&nbsp;which&nbsp;could be the real cause of this bug appearing. </p>

            <p>OK now I'm confused. I have my computer set up on a schedule to shut down every night around 8 pm. This gives our company Backup software time to do its magic. Then it is set to boot up at 5:45 am and then it runs a powershell file (start.ps1) which opens
 all my software and the computer is ready to go for me when I get to the office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get to work this morning and everything is opened like it is supposed to but the stupid yellow triangle is back. So I change the adapter from DHCP to Static and the triangle goes away. It has done the exact opposite of what it did yesterday. What gives???
 I'm starting to get that image of the copy machine beat down scene from the movie "Office Space" in my head. Any suggestions on this new development?</p>

            <p>
</p><p>I've seen that when multiple network adapters are installed in the computer Windows can activate&nbsp;an inappropriate one first and then tries to&nbsp;connect to the network&nbsp;through that adapter. If that happens you can correct&nbsp;the problem&nbsp;by manually assigning interface
 metric values to the adapters. Lower numbers give higher priority.. ie. 5 before 10, 10 before 20.

<p>
</p><p>Some&nbsp;other possibilities that could confuse Windows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Errant behaviour by AV software&nbsp;which has the ability to block network connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Multiple routers on the network or the network's IP changes periodically? </p>

            <p>I have the PCI Card Adapter disabled, It was added as a backup by our IT department when they built the workstation Its just a precaution in case the motherboard integrated adapter fails.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as Anti-Virus, we do not use any. The only protection we use is Windows Defender and the Cisco/OpenDNS Umbrella Service we pay for annually. It is mostly a content service to block malicious websites and like web pages. &nbsp;I followed your suggestion
 on the metrics, this is my settings. I will keep an eye on this for the next few days and will follow up when I feel it has solved the issue. So far it has. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            My Xbox doesn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t detect my Ethernet Cable. </h2>
                    
<p>It's been awhile since I've played XBL, however when I fired it back up recently, I couldn't connect. I thought it might be someone had messed with the cables, but they were all in place. I tried to go through the steps to connecting to a "Wired Network"
 (I'm using an Xbox Elite, no WiFi directly) And it just doesn't detect my Ethernet cable... I tried using 2 different cords, to the same effect. The Wifi works fine &amp; The cables work fine. I have no idea what's wrong, and I'm hoping I can be playing by the
 6th.</p>

<p>Hello </p>
<p>sounds possibly like your ethernet port might have failed.</p>
<p>Do those ethernet cables work on the same port on the router/modem with a PC/Laptop.</p>
<p>Have you tried different porst on the router if thats what your using?</p>
<p>remove the cable and try this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;When I go to network settings, it doesn't even detect that the Ethernet cable is plugged in. I can't get to those settings because of that. And the Ethernet cable is working, because it works on my laptop just fine.</p>

<h2>            google chrom not responding with new pc</h2>
                    <p>i have an almost brand new dell intel core 17. &nbsp;i let office max install an ssd drive. mostly it runs fast an ok, but very often google does not respond or i see that blue circle for ever until computer gets white. after i cancel they ask me to restore but
 so far that has never worked and i just restart. &nbsp;i still prefer to use a 10 years old mac that google do not even update any more. the 10 years old mac runs smoother and just as fast as my new pc so i am really not very impressed with my dell. is it a common
 problem that google do not respond. actually it happens mostly when i use outlook. i also use google browser with the old mac, but then i have much less problems and the mac actually restores the page if i have problems while my pc cannot restore the page.
 if i try to pc just freezes. in general i prefer google to Microsoft explorer but have not tried other browsers, but as i said google runs good with my 10 years old mac. does anybody else has problems with google or outlook. outlook also has more since they
 updated with more windows etc. is my experience. &nbsp;i still use my old mac more than the new pc but since i cannot update the mac any more i needed another computer</p>

<h2>            Surface RT &#38; Windows Store Issue</h2>
                    I decided to resurrect my old Surface RT. I installed all of the updates (with help from online forums because they don't work very well anymore). Now I cannot open the store app. It displays a message which reads "This version of windows is no longer
 supported by windows store". Has Microsoft discontinued the store app on surface devices? Is my surface unusable now? I find this all very hard to believe, but not entirely surprisingly.

<h2>            Windows 10 ethernet Doesnt work</h2>
                    <p>I have recently clean installed Win-10 after upgrading.</p>
<p>Till yesterday I was using the network via Ethernet flawlessly,but from next day I couldn't use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I plug a Ethernet cable into the port, the&nbsp;network symbol shows a system with a red cross mark and due to this no network connection is detected.I have tried to renew the ipaddress but doesn't work since no network was discovered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the problem? Please help me with a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to use the Wifi .</p>
<p>Please check the below screen shot of the network adapters:</p>
<p>There is another Ethernet connection named ethernet 2,I don't know from where did it came or got created.</p>

    <title>Settings won&#39;t open on latest installs. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pad406  say:</h3>
<h2>            Settings won&#39;t open on latest installs.</h2>
                    <p>Ok Microsoft, looks like you missed something out on your previous patch (</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/settings-doesnt-launch-or-launches-the-store/ec439819-7ee4-4b4d-abdd-35d82e04c55f?page=1</p>
</span>
<p>) for settings not opening. I only installed W10 yesterday and guess what, settings won't open. The aforementioned patch does nothing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's my theory:</p>
<p>
</p><p>From all I've read you had an issue and provided a workaround to sort it, quoted earlier. The you released an update
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">KB3081424</span>&nbsp;to prevent it happening again, but the Patch had to be run first to re-instate the settings option. This update was most likely part of my installation but I never had the chance, even if I had known, to run the
 workaround. Now, I reckon the tool thinks I shouldn't have the problem, as I have the latest update, therefore won't fix it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how about a new patch please? It's really annoying :(</p>

<p>
</p><p>I do still have&nbsp; Windows Media Center installed, and it seems to work.&nbsp; Do I need the DVD player? I see that microsoft is asking $14.99 for it.&nbsp; There are many freebies out there.</p>

            I have upgraded to Windows 10 for Windows 7 Ultimate and then Windows 8.1 with Media Centre. So according to Microsoft rules I qualify for the free upgrade with Windows DVD but KB3081704 has not downloaded. Any&nbsp;ideas how to resolve.

            @Gizmo, I have no idea how to resolve this.&nbsp; I even purchased an external DVD Player (hardware!) and despite it being the high-volume seller on CNet, the drivers are not supported on Windows 10.&nbsp; Microsoft just doesn't want us to watch DVDs.&nbsp; damn it.

            <p>Hi Elliotm,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that you are unable to install DVD app.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8 Pro with Media Center, or Windows 8.1 Pro with Media Center and you install Windows 10, Windows Media Center will be removed. For a limited time (the “eligible
 period”), on systems upgraded to Windows 10 from one of these older versions of Windows (a “qualified system”), a DVD playback app (“windows DVD player”) will be installed. Note: the Windows DVD Player may not be installed immediately; it will be installed
 after the first successful Windows Update. The Windows DVD Player will be available for purchase from the Window Store for systems that (i) are qualified systems but the eligible period lapsed; (ii) are non-qualified systems; or (iii) were qualified systems
 but windows 10 was subsequently clean installed (in this case, Windows Update cannot detect that it was previously a qualified system).
</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Kickstand Durability</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased a new Surface Pro 4 and am brining it to work. Over the course of the day, I'm adjusting it multiple times to bring it to meetings, write in OneNote and a variety of other tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm worry that I'm going to wear our the kickstand mechanism over time. My question for the community is: how durable is the kickstand? Should I change my habits to adjust it less to protect it, or should I expect it to continue to work after I've been doing
 this for several years. How are people fairing with the Surface Pro 3 after similar usage?</p>

            Make sure the tuner has Windows 7 drivers. There have been changes to multimedia interfaces from Vista and Vista drivers may not work.<br />
<br />
To work with Windows Media Center an analogue TV tuner must have hardware MPEG encoding. It may work with manufacturer supplied software.<br />
<br />
Digital TV tuners with Windows 7 drivers should all work with Windows Media Center. Digital broadcasts are encoded MPEG at source.

Most commonly used browsers including IE ones come capable of showing many types of image files including .jpg, .gif, .png, and many other image formats. Also most browsers have menus where you can opt out of showing all images. In dial up days many set their
 browsers not to show up images to speed up page loading. There are a few special purpose text only browsers that do not support images. Most browsers including IE ones have supported both .jpg and .gif for very many years. Png images are a bit more recent,
 and were not supported well by some earlier IE and other browsers.The question these days is why would a browser not be built to support many image formats. Very few people would use such a browser when there are so many browsers out there to select from.

<p>You posted also on I HAVE MORE THAN 200 PICTURES ON MY VISTA DESKTOP! .jpg pictures also appear on websites. I clicked on a .jpg picture at support.foopets.com. You say that .png files are on IE? Lucky for me.</p>
