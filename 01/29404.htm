<h2>            Sound coming only from left speaker when headphones connected to Xbox One Controller&#38;&#35;39&#59;s built-in 3.5 audio jack</h2>
                    
<p>I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Windows 10 laptop </li><li>Xbox One wireless controller&nbsp;<strong>with built-in 3.5mm audio jack</strong> (<a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/productID.319983900" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/productID.319983900</a>)
</li><li>Xbox One wireless adapter for windows (<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/a</a><a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/controllers/windows-10-wireless-adapter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ccessories/controllers/windows-10-wireless-adapter/</a>)
</li><li>A standard pair of Bose headphones (no mic, no USB, audio plug has only 3 sections - ground, right, and left)
</li></ul>
<p>I have completely updated the laptop through Windows Update, and have updated the controller using the Xbox Accessories app.</p>
<p>When I connect my headphones to the controller's audio jack,&nbsp;<strong>I only get sound out of the left ear speaker</strong>. I am trying to use my setup to game on Windows with an Xbox One controller, and while the input works fine,&nbsp;<strong>I cannot fix this
 audio output bug</strong>.</p>
<p>By digging deep into the sound settings (Windows sound menu &gt; right-click headphones &gt; Properties &gt; Advanced &gt; Default Format), I see that the headphones are set to "1 channel" - which would explain the lack of stereo. The dropdown is greyed out and I can't
 choose any other setting.</p>
<p>One of my theories is that the driver is somehow confusing my headphones with an old chat headset (1 ear speaker, 1 mic), causing the "1 channel" output.</p>
<p>The really frustrating thing is that&nbsp;<strong>the headphones used to work fine</strong>. When I first got the Xbox One Controller and adapter, I connected everything, and tried to watch a YouTube video. Stereo sound came out of my headphones perfectly. However,
 this issue popped up some time after the Threshold 2 update and/or the controller update through Xbox Accessories.</p>
<p>Please fix! Currently I have to connect my headphones directly to my laptop, which makes it hard for me to sit far away from my screen (playing in living room on TV, etc.)</p>

<p>I will ask the obvious question, sometimes a loose connection can result in the symptoms you describe, are the headphones seated in the jack properly (flush). Also please check if an update is available for your controller in the Xbox Accessories app, making
 sure to take updates to the Accessories app itself.</p>

<p>The headphone plug is pushed in as far as possible. I have also tested the headphones with other sources so I know that there's nothing wrong with the headphones.</p>
<p>Again, the Windows Sound Menu forces the output to be "1 channel", so I think the problem is software or firmware based, not a trivial hardware matter.</p>
<p>I have checked for updates through the Windows Store app plenty of times, so I believe the Xbox Accessories app is up to date. There may be a problem with the Store app, as I've run into issues with that before. But anyway my Xbox Accessories app version
 is 100.1511.19006.0. This should be the most recent version, otherwise something is wrong with the Windows Store update functionality.</p>
<p>The controller had already been fully upgraded through Xbox Accessories before I started this thread.</p>

<p>The plot thickens!</p>
<p>I've tested the controller audio output with another device: cheap Panasonic earbuds.&nbsp;<strong>The audio output works completely fine with this setup!</strong></p>
<p>However, my headphones (Bose QuietComfort 15) still have the one-side only issue.</p>
<p>I can only see the following differences between the two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the sound menu:
<ul>
<li>earbuds: "Headphones, USB Audio Device, Default Device" </li><li>headphones: "Headphones, 2- USB Audio Device, Default Device" </li></ul>
</li><li>In the "advanced" menu: "2-channel" is properly selected when earbuds are plugged in.
</li></ul>
<p>My earbuds and Bose headphones have EXACTLY the same audio plug - I looked at them carefully to ensure this.</p>
<p>Ok, so basically this looks like a driver problem to me and I shouldn't expect a solution anytime soon, so :(. But it's okay because I bought an audio extension cord which allows me to use my headphones directly with my laptop's audio jack, and at least
 I get stereo properly when doing that.</p>

<p>The firmware in your controller still needs to process the audio data and pass it on through to the host so I would not assume a driver problem, it could be related to firmware. We will try this on our end.</p>
<p>Also FYI, I was talking about "updating the device" through the Accessories app, NOT updating the Accessories app itself. When you plugin a controller that requires a firmware update, the accessories app should provide a button under the controller for updating
 the firmware, if it doesn't that usually means you have the latest firmware. Of course you will need the latest app to ensure you have the latest firmware to push to your device.</p>

<p>Ok, thanks for examining the firmware. For a bit more context, I should point out that the Boss headphones use a weird male-to-male cord (the part that plugs into the headphones has 4 sections, while the part that plugs into the outputting device has 3 sections.)
 If I plug ONLY the cord into the controller, without even being connected to the headphones, the Windows sound menu still forces the "1 channel” option.</p>
<p>And I recognize the update process you're talking about. I assure you that I have updated everything possible in relation to this problem, including the controller firmware through Xbox Accessories. If the most up-to-date firmware does not have any issues,
 then maybe there is an issue with the update delivery system. (I'd bet that it's much more likely a firmware issue.)</p>

<h2>            No settings or control panel items in search.</h2>
                    <p>When i try to search for something that i know is in either the settings screen or the controlpanel i get no hits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i go to the settings screen and try to search in the search bar there, i get no hits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to run SFC /Scannow and tried to rebuild the search index without any results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is on a fresh install of windows 10 (Updated, then ran the reset option.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some screenshots for clarity:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Could there be some strange setting that is hidden that makes it so that search omits any entries in the settings screen?<br />

<p>It feels as if settings and control panel are completely omitted in search results...</p>

            Here is my update from another forum:<br />
<br />
<p>So, what i have found that sort of works, is that i disable the windows search service. This means i get a slow search, but atleast it gives me the correct results. This tells me that there is definitely something wrong with the search/index function, it
 just doesn't tell me what is wrong. Going to keep at it for a bit longer as i refuse to give up on finding the fix for this, also i don't really feel up for setting up my whole main computer all over again for the third time this week
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fipb.s3.amazonaws.com%2fuploads%2femoticons%2fdefault_tongue.png" /></p>
<p><br />
What i have tried so far:</p>
<p>- Re indexing.</p>
<p>-SFC /scannow</p>
<p>-DISM check</p>
<p>-Rebuilding/integrity checking modern apps as per: <a href="http://winsupersite.com/windows-10/fixing-windows-10-apps-wont-launch-or-hang-apps-splash-screen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://winsupersite.com/windows-10/fixing-windows-10-apps-wont-launch-or-hang-apps-splash-screen</a></p>
<p>-Setting HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Search -&gt; SetupCompletedSuccessfully to 0</p>
<p>Only thing that sort of works is turning of the search service. That way at least it finds something.<br />
Hopefully MS will release an updated version of their Search troubleshooter compatible with windows 10 or some other fix.<br />
<br />
So far all i have achieved is having a bit more understanding of the inner workings of windows and a few more troubleshooting tools to add to my belt, but no permanent fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm open to suggestions folks :)</p>

            <p>Same problem as OP. You aren't the only one, there are a ton of threads about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance I have World of Warcraft installed. When I do a search I only get web links. I have Word and Excel installed, neither are found but excel and word mobile in the store are found. If I search paint I see some store items and web links. It can't
 even find Control Panel.&nbsp;None of my self installed apps can be found. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I did a test and installed classicshell, I also have an SSD so indexing is disabled. That gave me back a&nbsp;Win 7 start menu with search at the bottom and it works, it finds everything even with indexing disabled, but I would rather use the Win 10 start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The main problem seams that Cortana doesn't search for&nbsp;local apps and local search has been removed from the Win 10 start menu. At this point in time Cortana is just a fancy web search tool. This isn't a system corruption or indexing issue it is a programming
 issue.</p>

            <p>But it works fine on two other windows10 machines i have. So its clearly something not working as intended.
<br />
<br />
Also in my case, searching for programs works fine. Its just the settings and control panel items that are not found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you do me a favour and try to search for, for example "power" in the search box in your settings panel and see what happens then?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, have you tried turning on the indexing just to see what happens?</p>

            <p>I have exactly the same issue. I installed Windows 10 on my laptop and main PC. On my laptop, I can search within "Settings". On my PC, I cannot. It never finds anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like the OP, if I turn off Windows 10 Search Indexing Service, I can then search within settings. Search elsewhere works normally, EXCEPT, Cortana works on my laptop but not on my PC, even though Regional settings are the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a clue? I think not, because, at first, Cortana did not work on my laptop either and I am almost certain I was able to search within Settings before I got Cortana working (and, I have no idea how that happened either?!?).</p>

            No, turning off search indexing gets it to work. Cortana doesn't work on my PC, which is a separate problem, I assume.<br />

</p><blockquote>Are you saying that disabling Cortana can force it to work? </blockquote>
<p>For me specifically; it means that if I disable the search service altogether in services. Then suddenly the search box in settings starts working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems almost like the part of search related to control panel and settings is just flat out broken down completely. And normal index repairs or rebuilding of search has no effect (I would assume this is because it doesn't touch this part...)<br />
<br />
I really wish someone with intimate knowledge of the inner workings of the search functions could have a look at this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also this seems to be a problem for some users on windows 8 as well, and I have seen similar behavior on one of my windows 8 machines. This leads me to believe that something about search was changed, and now any trouble shooting related to search fails
 to include this issue.</p>

    <title>Touchpad Not working&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Touchpad Not working&#33;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Toshiba satellite P50-C laptop and the problem i am facing is that the touchpad is not working on it. I tried to download and install the Synaptics and Elan drivers from the Toshiba website, but when the software extracts and i click next for the
 installation process, the installation window just disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Funny thing is that the touchpad works during the bios setup just before the os loads but as soon as windows setup starts the touchpad stops working, so its not a hardware issue as some of you may think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also sharing the link to another thread because OP on that thread faced the same problem as me and i thinks its a common problem with toshiba laptops. But unfortunately that thread is locked and i cannot reply to it, hence the new thread. So if someone
 know the solution to this issue please help me out. Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            No, it doesnot work. I read it somewhere that it has something to do this bios and seems like its not a easy fix because i had already spent a good amount of time trying to fix this issue but without any success.

<p>Would you care to clue me in on the things you've already tried so that I don't waste your time?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you intentionally change the setting in your bios, I'm not sure why that would have changed spontaneously. That would be impossible. So really you should just be able to go put the settings back to the defaults, the way they shipped from the factory,
 and be good as new. But somehow I really just don't feel like that it would really tied to the by BIOS, could you provide your Source on that info</p>

            The thing is i bought this laptop from someone but it was like in brand new condition. Rearly used and the seller used an external mouse since buying the machine but when he wanted to sell it he noticed the touchpad doesn't work and told me so. After checking
 the machine i know its not a hardware issue because when you install new window on it , the touchpad works but as soon as the window installs it stops working.

<p>I made a system image back of window through windows inbuilt backup utility and formatted the laptop drive to clean install the window but now that backup is not restoring aswell and now i know its a common problem with window 10 but its too late for me,
 should have used a 3rd party backup software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now the touchpad won't even work during the windows setup process and windows doesn't automatically download the touchpad driver like normally it download and it shows in windows settings/Devices for other computers.</p>

Can you please tell me what is the make and model of your phone as well as the OS version of the phone? are you connecting to your PC with the phone wirelessly or via a cable connection?<br /><br />Thanks

            Hi Genie
<br />
<br />Are you installing programs from original setup.exe files?
<br />
<br />If so, all you need to do is connect the USB thumb drive containing those files.
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer &gt; This PC
<br />Open the drive containing the install files
<br />Launch setup files.

<br />
<br />My name is Patricia and I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to help you today.
<br />
<br />Could you give more details.
<br />I guess your programs are on a USB flash drive.
<br />
<br />Then connect your USB flash drive to your pc, double click on it in File Explorer and double click on the program to run.

 have no idea when it occurred I can't use system recovery to repair the problem. Nor can I go into properties and use the "restore default" feature since it is not there either.&nbsp;&nbsp; HELP!!<br />

    <title>Migrating data from MacBook Pro hard drive to Windows 10 machine - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rossepeo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Migrating data from MacBook Pro hard drive to Windows 10 machine</h2>
                    The logic board on my MBP is fried so the machine will not even boot up. I have seen a few articles about migrating Mac files to a Windows machine, but they all require using the Mac to "send" the files to Windows. That option is not available to me. I
 have an external drive containing Time Machine backups. I also have the hard drive salvaged from the dead Mac. How can I retrieve my files (Pages &amp; rtf documents, Numbers spreadsheets, Keynote presentations, Photos library of images, projects &amp; slideshows
 and videos, and music files) and apps from the hard drives I have? I don't yet have a Windows laptop. I am weighing my options &amp; trying to decide whether to stay with Mac or go back to Windows, which is what I pre-2011. Thanks for any insights you can give.
 If I have entered this question under the incorrect topic heading, could you please move it to the appropriate area so as to tap into the right experts. Thanks.&nbsp;

            Macbook uses a different file system, you will need third party driver or software to access the file system, some free some paid.
<br />
<br />If you decide to go with a Windows machine, the most simple way is to turn the existing MacBook hard drive into an external drive, and access it off another computer.

<p>I'm not absolutely sure but you may find a Linux live disc may help as a go between.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Knoppix or Ubuntu live disc will allow you to boot from the disc only and access both an external disk and a windows system so you should be able to transfer files between the two.</p>

            <p>Hi Serhan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To understand the issue better, I&nbsp;suggest you to answer the questions below.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In which browser are you facing this issue?</li><li>Is the issue specific to Google search?</li><li>Since from when are you facing this issue?</li><li>Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</li></ol>
<p><span>Let's try the below Steps and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<span>&nbsp; </span>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>Put the computer into
</span><strong><span>clean boot </span></strong><span>state and check if it helps.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />
Follow:<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> </span></span></span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run
 a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>Uninstall and reinstall the browser and check.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span><span><span>Press <strong>Windows + X keys</strong>, select <strong>Programs and Features.</strong></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Select the browser and click on <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><strong>Restart </strong>the machine and <strong>reinstall </strong>
the browser and check.</span></span></span></li></ul>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Install all the pending updates after logging in to Microsoft account and check.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>If still you are facing the issue, I suggest you to check with the
<strong>Google Desktop Search support </strong>and check if it helps.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Keep us informed if the issue is resolved. We are glad to help you further.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that you&nbsp;concern about mail app&nbsp;features on Windows 10.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I like to inform you that in mail app, we have the option to add the multiple accounts in it. So all the account will be listed on the left side of mail app. When we click on the individual account, it will display the inbox particularly only for that account.
 It will not show all the account's emails in one inbox.</p>
<p>I suggest you refer to the below Microsoft Help Article as a reference.</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let us know&nbsp;</span>if you need any further assistance on Windows related issues and we will be glad to help.<span>&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>If your web browser is frozen, open Task Manager and exit the browser from there ('End Process'.) There's no way to prevent this because you didn't do anything to cause it. The website was compromised.</p>

            This happened to me too. I could not do anything but force quit. I rebooted in safe mode and it was working so I rebooted again normally. So far scans show no infections, but why could it freeze up my computer?

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>This is a bit technical, but if you can follow it, I think it will work for you.&nbsp; I work on a lot of computers and this works for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>I must emphasize that this will work between now and September 12, 2016.&nbsp; I do not know if it will work after that.&nbsp; Also this is for Windows 7.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;emphasize that for this to work, you must follow exactly as this describes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two main types of Windows 7 installations: <strong><em>32 bit or 64 bit</em></strong>.&nbsp; You need to know what is installed in your computer.&nbsp; Click the Start globe, type system in the box.&nbsp;Choose System information in the list. &nbsp;The techie shorthand
 for 32 bit is x86 and for 64 bit is x64</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Start Windows Update and change the Setting to <strong><em>Never check for updates</em></strong>.&nbsp; When you do leave the setting at NEVER, Windows Update will no longer be automatic.&nbsp; From this point onwards, you are responsible for starting and installing
 updates.&nbsp; We recommend you do that a few days following the 2nd Tuesday each month.</li><li>The process starts by ensuring that there is nothing running that will prevent the update from working properly.&nbsp; Click on the Start globe and type
<strong><em>services </em></strong>into the text box.&nbsp; Click on Services in the list that pops up.&nbsp; In the window that then pops up (its alphabetic), find Windows Update.&nbsp;
<strong><em>Right-click </em></strong>on it&nbsp;(left-click if your mouse is set for left-handers) and choose
<strong><em>Stop</em></strong>.</li><li>Restart your computer.</li></ol>
<p>Now, you are going to reset Windows Update components:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start, All Programs, Accessories, Right-click on Command prompt, Choose Run as administrator, OK.&nbsp; Type the following in the black box:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>net stop wuauserv</strong></li><li><strong><strong>net stop cryptSvc</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>net stop bits</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>net stop msiserver</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>net start wuauserv</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>net start cryptSvc</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>net start bits</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>net start msiserver</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>pause</strong></strong></li><li><strong>Exit</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You are now going to download and install either one or two updates manually.&nbsp; In most cases only the first (KB3172605)&nbsp;of these is needed.&nbsp; If that produces a result that says the update is not appropriate for you computer, you need to first install the
 2nd of these (KB3020369), then install the first (KB3172605).&nbsp; Choose the one that is for your machine — 32 bit (X86) or 64 bit (X64).</p>

<p>
</p><p>After restarting your computer, wait about 10 minutes until Windows Update completes its tasks.&nbsp; Do not use the computer for any other purpose during this wait period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start Windows Update.&nbsp; It will take only a few minutes to come up with a list and download the updates you select.&nbsp; The process is quite normal as it always was from this point onward.</p>
<p>If your computer has not been updated for a long time, it may take longer.</p>

<p>I did not try any in KB822798 because all other Microsoft Updates from that day installed just fine.&nbsp; Ever since the first day it failed via Microsoft Update I have been using "fullfile" that I downloaded to my desktop.&nbsp; It is when I try and run the "fullfile"
 that I get the complaint about C:\Windows\win.ini.&nbsp; Running the "fullfile" doesn't even hit/seek the CD-Rom where there is a legitimate 2003 Office Basic CD.&nbsp; Office 2003 Basic came pre-installed by Dell.</p>
<p>The system participates in a domain&nbsp;run by&nbsp;a 2003 Small Business&nbsp;Server.&nbsp; It does not have roaming profiles but it does use 'offline' files so that the My Documents folder is redirected to a share on the server.&nbsp; I'm using Trend Micro Worry Free Security
 Advanced...</p>
<p>... As soon as I wrote that last sentence I thought what the heck turn off TM AV and try one&nbsp;more time...</p>
<p>And it installed just fine.</p>

            You can create a stop and start script for Windows Update. 
<br />
<br />Create a Notepad file with each of the following and save them with the .bat extension.
<br />
<br />stop-upadtes.bat:
<br />
<br />sc config wuauserv start= disabled
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />sc config bits start= disabled
<br />net stop bits
<br />
<br />sc config dosvc start= disabled
<br />net stop dosvc
<br />
<br />pause
<br />
<br />start-updates.bat:
<br />
<br />sc config wuauserv start= auto
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />sc config bits start= auto
<br />net start bits
<br />
<br />sc config dosvc start= auto
<br />net start dosvc
<br />
<br />pause
<br />
<br />Right click on stop-upadtes.bat and select “Run as Administrator”

            Keep monitoring it. 
<br />
<br />Other options you can consider:
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />Set your Internet connection as metered:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows-10-data-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Use Active Hours and Restart options:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windows-update-behavior-using-active-hours-and-restart-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 3: 
<br />
<br />Use Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update:
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />Option 4:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Update
<br />Select it then right click it
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, choose Startup type to DIsabled
<br />Click Stop
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Option 6:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />Regarding the issue, I would like to let you know that controlling Windows updates is somewhat difficult in Windows 10, but you can see the options here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />If you have Windows 10 Pro , Methods 4 and 5 are the best way to resolve this as Windows would always ask you to before downloading updates.
<br />Another way would be to use a 3rd party app like Stop Updates10. which allows you to disable Windows 10 Updates with a single click.
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-updates-windows-10-stopupdates10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-updates-win...</a>

            Hi Bob, all the old methods to stop Windows 10 Updates, no longer work, this method will permanently stop Windows Updates:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type services and hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to find Windows Update Service
<br />
<br />If it is Started, double click it and stop that service
<br />
<br />CLose the services App
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />sc delete wuauserv
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Restart your PC
<br />
<br />
<br />If you also have the Update Assistant installed on your system:
<br />
<br />The Update Assistant in Windows 10 cannot be uninstalled, but you can get rid of it 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type Task Scheduler and hit enter 
<br />In the left Pane, navigate to: Windows - Update Orchestrater 
<br />Right Pane double click 'Update Assistant' 
<br />Click on Triggers Tab 
<br />On each of the triggers ( At login . . . etc.) double click and uncheck 'Enabled' 
<br />
<br />Under 'Update Assistant, there is another event 'Update Assistant CalendarRun' 
<br />Do the same for all triggers on that event 
<br />
<br />Restart your system, that's It!
<br />
<br />When finished and after a system restart, open the services app and make sure the Windows Update Service is now gone . . .

<h2>            bluetooth headphones delay on windows 8</h2>
                    Hi, I have a problem with my bluetooth headphones, Jabra Revo Wireless, and my laptop, Acer V nitro 15 with windows 8.1 installed. If I connect the headphones there is a lag/delay in sound of circa 0.5 seconds which makes them unusable for watching movies
 or videos in general. The drivers are updated, what can I try?

<h3> galactic geek  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#38;quot&#59;I find the lack of your Elite Controller disturbing.&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, so I stopped by Wal-Mart today to pick up the new and recently released Xbox One Elite controller only to wait for 20 minutes and find out that they didn't have any in stock because they were all sold out already. The associate even told me she checked
 the Wal-Mart website and said that they were sold out on there too. So, I come home and go to the Xbox Store to see if I can purchase it there, and there too, it's sold out.</p>
<p>So, 1 of the biggest retailers around doesn't have it, and neither does the official source... I don't think I've ever personally seen demand quite like this before - I've always just been able to pick up the things I want, and because I waited, I now can't
 get it (at least without paying exorbitant and gouged price-hikes from those seeking to make a profit online by unsavory means, which I'm not willing to give in to, since it's already expensive enough as is).</p>
<p>So, is anybody in the same (sinking) boat as me? Do you know where it might be available currently at its regular retail price?</p>
<p>I want to feel elite; I want to be elite; but now at least, I just feel sad. :'(</p>

<p>This is all going according to plan. Microsoft creates massive demand by releasing a limited run but HEY you can buy the Elite Console bundle. Which is my guess to where 90% of the Elite Controllers are. Don't want to wait...just buy the bundle. I bet they
 plan to release more single controllers after the Holidays are over.</p>

<p>Scratch was saying the same thing so I pre-ordered over here in Aus just the other day because it doesn't come out until next Friday here. I honestly assumed I would be able to just walk in store and pick one up!</p>
<p>Though I had to get it posted to me instead of 'pick up in store' which means they only have units at the big warehouse and my local retailers are already completely reserved.</p>

<p>"I've always just been able to pick up the things I want, and because I waited, I now can't get it (at least without paying exorbitant and gouged price-hikes from those seeking to make a profit online by unsavory means, which I'm not willing to give in to,

<p>I had a good laugh at this. &nbsp;And please do not take it the wrong way. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen a lot of popular items sell out through the years. &nbsp;Things people expect to pick up in the store and they are sold out. &nbsp;In the case of this controller it could be that they produced a very limited supply. &nbsp;But I am surprised by how many I know
 that wanted one and ordered on early. &nbsp;I might pick one up myself at some point but am in no hurry. &nbsp;But all the "pro" players and some players who are not even trying to be "pro" that I know have one. &nbsp;Just really shocking. &nbsp;And then I have seen a decent
 amount of complaints or just wonder at not being able to go in and pick one up. &nbsp;The next batch will be fairly popular again and might sell out again. &nbsp;Really awesome controller overall too.</p>

<p>What I do find hilarious is GameStop and their bundles; they have the elite controller but you must buy the ridiculous charging stand with it for $40.00 more.

<p>Can't remember where I saw it, but there was a complaint thread about elite controller problems. Funny thing... every complaint I've seen about regular controllers (brand new ones), I saw there as well. Jammed D-pad, sticking buttons... even a loose side
 panel.</p>
<p>Anymore, IMO... getting something like that early is like being in the preview program... no thanks. lol</p>
