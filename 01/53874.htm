            <p>Thanks for the reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, I found the MUCH NEEDED solution for a lot of guys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the Geolocation Service in "services.msc" is disabled/or corrupted.Microsoft has actually accepted this glitch and given us solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can eliminate this glitch by deleting the regkey in regedit.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>FOLLOW THE SOLUTION PROVIDED IN BELOW LINK...<br />
</p>
<p>https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dn764773.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</p>
<p>
</p><p>After deleting the folder "3" location was back on and everything was back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS IS VERY COMMON PROBLEM FACED BY ALL WINDOWS 10 USERS AND THERE ARE MANY THREADS REGARDING THIS PROBLEM AND THE RESPONSE BY MICROSOFT GUYS WAS PATHETIC. THERE WERE SOME WHO WERE ABLE TO RELATE THE PROBLEM TO GEOLOCATION SERVICE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enabling Geolocation service in "services.msc" is not easy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tried to turn it to automatic the message was THE SYSTEM CANNOT FIND THE FILE SPECIFIED. &nbsp;So if you delete this regkey i.e., folder 3 ..then we can enable this geolocation service to automatic and then EVERYTHING IS BACK TO NORMAL......finally :)</p>

<h2>            windows 10 apps and app-related features dont run</h2>
                    <p>Recently Start-menu, app-store, notifications and all apps stopped running completely on a single account. With some apps a window will pop-up and disappear after a second or two, and others dont respond at all. I can click on start all i want but nothing
 happens. I tried creating new accounts and the problem doesn't exist on those accounts but remains on the first. I'd like to keep the account.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting your query&nbsp;in Microsoft Community.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to try the below methods and check if that helps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Run the System File Checker tool</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong> and click <strong>

<p><span>Type the following command and press <strong>Enter</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Do not close this Command Prompt window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 2: Run the Microsoft Safety Scanner.</span></strong></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>

</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 3: </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Run the command in Powershell</span></p>

<h2>            Sculpt ergonomic mouse wheel stopped working &#40;Windows 7&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I've been using the sculpt ergonomic mouse and keyboard combo for almost a year and the mouse wheel scroll just stopped working yesterday. It worked Monday and I'd left it plugged in. Went to begin work on Tuesday and scroll isn't working no matter what
 I do.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm using Windows 7, no updates have been made to my computer, and I've gone through all the troubleshooting/obvious things (changing battery, turning off and back on, opening the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center and checking to see that vertical
 scrolling is ON, reinstalling software and drivers, trying a different USB port). I looked through all the documents on the site&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-ca/products/mice/sculpt-ergonomic-mouse/l6v-00002#techspecs-connect and noticed the technical
 data sheet mentions the 'wheel vertical scrolling life' of 100,000 revolutions away and 300,000 revolutions towards. Could that really be it?&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>The second error relates to a Wireless card tray icon that also doesn't need to start with Windows or even to be installed at all except that it comes with the wireless driver and is bloatware.&nbsp; You can try to update the driver from the

<p>Hi Miguel -</p>
<p>
</p><p>How does this relate to the RunDLL error topic of this thead?&nbsp; What is the verbatim RunDLL error you're getting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't relate to this thread then start a new thread which correctly describes the problem you're having, and provide the crash file for analysis from an expert following

    <title>Refund - Black Ops II - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stafford beer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Refund - Black Ops II</h2>
                    
<p>Getting really annoyed now. cannot seem to get hold of anyone. I'm using a chromebook which doesn't support Silverlight so I cannot chat to an Ambassador and Activision make it really difficult to contact them.</p>
<p>I purchased Black Ops II through Xbox Live Marketplace. Activision have this stupid probation thing so because I left a game due to lag (and was kicked for accidentally team-killing during domination) I got screwed, and getting a message saying the Black
 Ops II servers are down before that really doesn't help.</p>
<p>I want a refund for this product. I paid for a game but as I am not able to get on and play I see no point in keeping this product and just want to get my money back and spend it on a decent game. Who do I have to contact for a refund?</p>

<p>I did say accidentally. The fact is people tend to run in front of those who are shooting at enemies, it happens too much where people take no notice of others trying to kill someone and it's the shooter who get's penalised for the actions of self-centred

<p>again you arrent going to find another game without suspensions for friendly fire</p>
<p>you should learn short controlled bursts</p>
<p>if you do not want suspensions then time to play solo</p>
<p>as all multiplayer matches have rules against friendly fire or only join no friendly fire matches</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 mail and exchange</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to change my default folder for sent items in Windows 10 mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an exchange account (IMAP) where on the internet browser, or outlook interface my sent items are held in a folder called "Sent"</p>
<p>
</p><p>in my Windows 10 mail program on my Windows surface 3 (all current updates installed) the default folder is called "Sent Items"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to use only the "Sent" folder that is present on the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple's iOS account software has an option to choose which folder to use for sent (and other) items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not find this ability in Win 10 mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I missing?</p>

            Hi WIlliam.     I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />When you sync your Mail to Windows 10 Mail, by default it should sync all your folders, which may be listed under More at the bottom of the list on left bar.  
<br />
<br />In mine my Yahoo accounts show a Sent folder and my Outlook accounts show a Sent Items folder exactly as it appears in the web mail boxes which Mail syncs.   I don't see why this should be different for yours.  It should not show any folders other than what you have in your actual Mail account.  Are any others different or missing?
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

<p>There are two folders on the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example I have to subscribe to both</p>
<p>"Sent Items"</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>"Sent"</p>
<p>in Outlook 2016 to see all the items sent from my various devices.&nbsp; </p>
<p>More specially all my devices/software except win 10 mail on Surface 3 are in the "Sent Items" folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not having the software combine the folders and issue a different name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you indicating that Yahoo changes the name for a single folder depending on which program has the folder open?</p>

            No, Yahoo just has a different name for the Sent folder than Outlook does.  
<br />
<br />My point is that Windows 10 Mail is set up to sync or mirror exactly what folder names you have in the originating mail account, nothing less or more.

But not because of the bad internet, my internet is 20 Megs and when I go to "My Games and Apps" on Xbox One it is downloading the game only with a download speed that ranges from 10 Mb / s to 8 Mb / s. I entered the support in the case by chat and I was given a list of doors that should be open in my router ... I never opened a door but I already have an idea of how it is then I went to my router&gt; Port forwarding&gt; 88 - Final Port: 88 and then had the Lan IP Address: I got the IP that shows in Xbox One and put the end there, I put the protocol right ... It is this curse of NAT remains strict and slow download TOO.&nbsp;I swear that I am getting really outraged with this NAT and with this Network Statistics data because I have a 20 Megabytes internet at home and I have this problem of having to wait forever to download some game and still when

<p>Hallo Stephanie. I did try the document even before but it wasn't helpful for me. I need to understand from where the issue arises. I suspect it is an issue in the trackpad or similar, but I am not sure. I have already updated the driver. I need somebody
 who could read my dumps, as stated in the Microsoft Wiki, as stated the last time&nbsp; to be able to see which part is generating the error. COuld you please help me?&nbsp; Thank anyway</p>

 but after a reboot the driver has been regenerated.</p>
<p>I am trying to delete the file following&nbsp;https://youtu.be/ZuuAt9dmUrM, but I need to activate the local administrator account to do this ( I only have the window10 microsoft account). Should I activate the local admin account or doing something else?</p>

<h2>            How do i get my Windows 7 Ultimate product key unblocked&#63;</h2>
                    I created a new computer so I had to put my Windows 7 Ultimate on my computer and it now says it is blocked by Microsoft. There isn't live help or an E-mail help for this situation. I tried calling the number I was told to call to activate by phone and
 it just keeps telling me to call back later.&nbsp;

<div>I would like to use my windows 7 and not have my 21 remaining days run out before then.</div>

            <p>I also have this power settings problem on my Surface Pro 3. When windows 10 was first installed all power plans were available. Then&nbsp;only balanced was available. My problem is&nbsp;that&nbsp;in Accounts sign in options the maximum time I can choose&nbsp; is 5 mins. I
 would like this to be never or a lot longer than 5 mins.</p>
<p>A message says in red type "Your PC's power settings are preventing some options being shown"</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have created a custom power plan and I have tried running Power Troubleshooter but this did not work. It reduced power to WiFi adapter and now my WiFi keeps switching off</p>
<p>

            <p>If you are still having this problem, this worked for me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the registry editor. &nbsp;If you don't know how, open search/Cortana and type regedit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the folders on the left hand side, navigate to the following folder:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power</p>
<p>
</p><p>on the right, one of the keys near the top should be called CsEnabled. &nbsp;Click on this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change the value of this key from 1 to 0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you reboot you should have your power plans back, and even be able to change advanced power options. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>thanks that was very helpful, very clear exactly the kind of help that is so hard to find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure MS has reasons for locking out a power saving mode and a performance mode but I really cant believe they are valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there was a fire risk , sure it makes sense and we should be given a warning.... but otherwise just silly, I was about to return this to the MS store when I found your solution....</p>

            Hey, thank you for the fix. There's one extra thing that it did that I didn't want though. It took away the option to let my computer sleep. I've looked everywhere to try to re-enable it but can't. Is there something else I could do in the registry where
 I could keep the power plans and the option to put my computer to sleep? I'm totally novice with this so I don't want to do anything in the registry without specific instructions&nbsp;and proven results where no harm is done to the computer.

<h2>            What is my Skype address&#63;</h2>
                    I have a job interview on Skype.&nbsp; They need to place a call to me, so I need to tell them what my address is.&nbsp; I do not know what my address is and it is not clear from any of the many, many results in web searches.&nbsp; Is there any way of knowing what information
 someone would need to contact me on Skype?&nbsp; I would like to be able to tell them, so that I can at least start the process of not getting this job.&nbsp; THanks

<p>There's two sets of permissions.&nbsp; Most likely one has been set but not the other, which can cause what you see.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the folder you want to share, and go to properties.</li><li>On the Sharing tab, click Advanced Sharing.&nbsp; Make sure the "Share This Folder" checkmark is on, then go to properties and set the permissions.</li><li>Click OK to save everything.</li><li>Go back to the same properties again (same as step 1 above) and this time go to the Security tab.</li><li>Set the permissions here also.</li><li>Click OK to save these and give it another try.</li></ol>
<p>As long as you set the same permissions on both step 2 and 5, it should be good to go.</p>

<p>Thanks Shawn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This simply didn't work for me. I then went and removed ALL shares . . there were some shares with the preexisting Homegroup under the previous Win10 version (for my old machine). . . and then shared just one folder.&nbsp; I rebooted both machines but I still
 have the issue.<br />
</p>
<p>File and printer sharing is turned on on both machines.<br />
</p>
<p>In File Explorer, each machine is visible! (Under "Computers"). If I click on the "other" computer, I get the messsage "Windows cannot access . ." \\ COMPUTERNAME. "You do not have permission to&nbsp; access .&nbsp; " \\ COMPUTERNAME.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on the immediate machine, I am taken to the shared folders on it OK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behavior is the same (actually reciprocal, of course) on the two machines. (Both have the most up to date Win10 version (unfortunately!!!))</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing (to me) is that MEDIA Devices on the two machines ARE recognized as are the Modem/router and a Chromecast device I have upstairs.<br />
</p>
<p>I've spend just TOO much time on this.&nbsp; I guess MS had a reason for changing/deleting the Homegroup feature, but surely they would have done a bit of testing.&nbsp; My system is simple: two PCs at the moment and two (wireless) laptops in the house. I shudder
 to think what might happen when I try to get the laptops back into the network!</p>
<p>I do appreciate the time and thought you have expended on my behalf.&nbsp; I guess I'm just bamboozled. I rode the microcomputer wave from the early 1970s . .but this is something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>
<p>Dave</p>
