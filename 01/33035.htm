    <title>Low download speed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nap4lm69  say:</h3>
<h2>            Low download speed</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have fiber internet with 300 mbps up/down. The problem I am having is that my two windows 10 computers limit the download speed drastically. I am seeing about 150 down and 300 up. All other devices on the network get the full 300/300, including a linux&nbsp;laptop
 and many wireless devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To confirm this issue, I did plug both devices into the router through ethernet and showed the same issue. However, booting into safe mode will show speed tests at the appropriate 300/300. I have tried disabling all antivirus and firewall, updating network
 adapter drivers, reinstalling network drivers from the manufacturer website, and running virus scans. I confirmed that QoS was not enabled on the router, also the safe mode working proves that, I have no idea what to try next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have only had the new internet for about a month. I noticed the issue as I was having some problems on a site and just wanted to see if it was me or the site about 5 days ago (was not on my end as 150 down is still plenty). But I can only say that I know
 for a fact it was good one month ago and was not good about 5 days ago. Not sure if there were any updates during that time that may have caused the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me find out why I am getting limited speeds in normal boot but not in safe mode!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

            Hi Tony.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Remember that your ISP is required to help you troubleshoot lower speeds  until you get what you're paying for.   It is included in your bill, a consumer protection issue, not merely a courtesy on their part.  
<br />
<br />It is interesting it is not affected in Safe Mode which normally means a driver is at fault.  Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />As a test you could even shrink C to do a test install following the tutorial above to see if it avoids the problem, then take your time to observe performance after each Updates group, Program install, Settings change, etc. to try to isolate the cause.  If it work I can help you move into the new install and remove the old one to recover its space.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Sorry it took so long to reply. I tried everything you said, and then I just decided to do a fresh install as nothing was working. I then immediately tried speed testing and was receiving the expected 300+/300+. Then, I installed only the apps that I needed
 and after I opened every app, I ran a speed test again. Continued to receive the respected results. Then like 4 days later, there was no changes in apps, and my speeds magically went back to being limited.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a complete loss here, I have no clue what is going on.</p>

<h2>            How to fix USB 3.0&#63; &#40;Windows 7 x64 Pro, SP1&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>Stopped running USB 3.0.1. </p>
<p>The device manager shows problems in the ASMedia USB Root Hub and the Intel Root Hub (R) USB 3.0.
</p>
<p>I run the DeviceDiagnostic.diagcab from Fix It. I see how he diagnoses the situation, downloads and installs new drivers, reports that "everything is ready" and asks for reboot.
</p>
<p>Before the reboot, I check the information in the Device Manager: the problem icons (yellow triangles) have disappeared.
</p>
<p>Reboot and ... nothing has changed. Still yellow triangles and USB 3.0 does not work. Windows 7 x64 Pro, SP1.</p>
<p>What I do? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Anatolykaz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the chipset drivers of your computer is outdated. Please update the chipset drivers of your computer as they are responsible for the well-functioning of many features including USB. You may visit the manufacturer's website on where to
 download the said drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us on the result.</p>

<p>Dear Herald!<br />
Thank you for participating.<br />
The latest version of the Chipset Drivers on the manufacturer's website (Intel) completely coincides with my chipset drivers (date, size, version). However, I downloaded and installed the driver from the site. Before installing the antivirus were turned off.
 External devices are disconnected from the USB.<br />
As far as it was possible to observe the installation process, it passed normally.<br />
However, the problem remained (USB3.0 did not appear in the system and the yellow backups in the device manager remained in their places)<br />
</p>
<p>This is not the first attempt to correct the problem. It seems to me that something blocks the drivers.</p>
<p>I found several descriptors associated with these drivers, disabled them and repeated installation of drivers from the site. No changes...<br />
</p>

<p>Thanks for the update. May I know if this is a personal computer or a work computer?</p>

</p><p>If you think that a certain program or application is hindering the driver installation, I would recommend that you try to install the driver update when your computer is in clean boot state. By performing a clean boot, third party applications&nbsp;that maybe
 causing issues to your computer are temporarily disabled. Click on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Solitaire stastics keeps resetting</h2>
                    I'm playing Solitaire in Windows 7 but every so often the games resets all by itself. The statistics will reset back to zero and I get the game tips as if i just started playing for the first time.<br />
I've deleted the game settings and prefs file, but that only worked for about 50 games, or so.<br />
Any ideas?

            <p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, no. Microsoft don't seem to care.</p>
<p>I've tried various things that I've seen suggested in other places, but nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've given up with Windows Solitaire and I've downloaded a free solitaire package called 123 Free Solitaire.</p>
<p>It's a restricted demo of a paid programme.</p>
<p>In the demo you<em> 'only' </em>get a dozen games (as opposed to hundreds you get in the full game!). Sadly, you don't get statistics in the demo, but I thinks that's more than made up for in having a variety of really quite good games. One called 'Yukon'
 is my favourite because it's largely about skill rather than luck.</p>
<p>I've been thinking of paying for the full programme, which is actually pretty cheap anyway.</p>

                    When you swipe from the right of the screen you'll see the Action Center/Notifications.&nbsp; The problem is that there are a lot of apps that right you to swipe from the right (eg. Kindle, games, etc...).&nbsp; This gesture interferes with those apps.&nbsp; I'm okay
 clicking on the Notification icon in the task bar, so is there a way of disabling the gesture?

            <p>There's no direct option to disable it, but there is a trick that is powerful once you know the capabilities. &nbsp;The action center only shows up if you swipe from outside the edge of your screen (past the black border in the margins). &nbsp;No other apps have this
 system ability to see outside the screen edge, so you can easily avoid it by only swiping (such as in Kindle) from further inside. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However, you can also use a registry edit (or if you have Pro edition, a policy setting) to disable the edge swipes. &nbsp;See

    <title>Geotag searches but does not find matches in Windows Live Photo - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Geotag searches but does not find matches in Windows Live Photo Gallery</h2>
                    <p>I recently got a new laptop running Windows 7. On my old laptop, when I opened a picture with Windows Photo Gallery, clicked on "Geotag" and started typing a city and state, Geotag immediately went into a search and I could find what I was looking for. If
 not, I was able to add the location anyway. However, on my new PC, I will put in a city and state and it searches and searches until it says, "No match found." It does not offer any possible matches like it used to on my old laptop and it will not let me add
 a location. How do I fix this?</p>

<div>Thank you for your reply. &nbsp;I have Windows Live Photo Gallery build version 2011 v. 15.4.3538.513 (c)2010 on my computer. &nbsp;Maybe I need to upgrade this, but I'm a bit nervous of downloading new PG in case I lose everything I'v done in WLPG. &nbsp;If you can

<h3> leonardfedorov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro can&#39;t activate after hardware change</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 Pro installed on my machine and recently replaced my motherboard and processor. From my reading of the various support articles on the subject before I made the switch, I understood that because I had used the free upgrade from Windows
 7 Pro I had a Digital License which I have linked to my Microsoft account and would therefore be able to log in with this account on the new PC and it would activate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it does not seem to want to activate. The Activation Window displays error 0xC004C003 and if I try to troubleshoot, after logging in the troubleshooter displays my device (with a name that matches the previous hardware config), but when I select
 this device I get a "<span>We can’t reactivate Windows on this device. Try again later. " with no further information. I am not sure what else to try.</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone else had similar problems?</span></p>

            Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />(Not applicable to you) 
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />www.thewindowsclub.com/showkeyplus-product-key-finder
<br />
<br />Uninstall the key
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-wind...</a> 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />(Not applicable to you ends)
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this(one if you have already run activation troubleshooter)
<br />
<br />Contact Microsoft using the phone numbers below or use the chat support link(weekdays only)
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/405170...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new PC, if it is OEM it will not . ..

            My step dad was unable to find the original key, but I called support anyway today. Without even asking for the key, they told me that my error code (C004C003) meant that there was no way to de-associate my key from my old motherboard and that I would
 need to get a new one.<br />
<br />
Is this right? Seems to contradict everything that's been said here and elsewhere online.

<h2>            Sorting folders and files in file explorer Windows 10</h2>
                    How can I sort files in the "directory" so that folders are listed alphabetically and below the files are in descending date order.&nbsp; "date modified. The fix for Windows 7 is not working for me.&nbsp; It can sort by descending date modified which puts the folders
 at the bottom of the list or by name which puts folders at top and files below all alphabetically.

<p>There's not a way to sort both alphabetically and date and the same time. Perhaps the best alternative is to configure the sort by name or date, then group by date or type.</p>

            Hi Bryan, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as volunteers we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. 
<br />
<br />Let's see if we can resolve this very difficult issue : 
<br />
<br />The problem can be caused by hardware such as hard drive or cabling issues among many.

<br />
<br />============= 
<br />
<br />STOP: 0xC000021A 
<br />
<br />Can be a difficult problem to solve and you may indeed need technical help from a real computer shop (one that does its own in-house service) or the System Maker's Support.

<br />
<br />=============================================== 
<br />
<br />You can try Option 5 here and run StartUp - Repair to see if it helps. You 
<br />would need to make a bootable USB or DVD using the Media Creation 
<br />Tool or other options.

<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for</a>... 
<br />
<br />Installing Windows 10 using the media creation tool - create media then 
<br />boot with it. 
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m</a>... 
<br />
<br />=================================================== 
<br />
<br />You may need to thoroughly check the hard drive for errors (be sure to inspect the cable as best you can). 
<br />
<br />Be sure to check for RootKits which can survive a format and installation of Windows. 
<br />
<br />TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN - it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not does not mean you should not check with the other methods below. 
<br /><a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions</a>?... 
<br />
<br />==== 
<br />
<br />After checking the drive for RootKits inspect the drive and cabling. Then thoroughly check the hard drive for errors using the Advanced Methods and the Manufacturer's Diagnostic Utilities. 
<br />
<br />These are much more efficient methods to check the disk. &lt;- Advanced Methods. 
<br />
<br />From the Command Prompt of the Windows 10 disk (boot from it) : 
<br />
<br />chkdsk /f /r 
<br />(Space after k and before / and after f and before / ) 
<br />
<br />REBOOT 
<br />
<br />sfc /scannow 
<br />(Space after c and before / ) 
<br />
<br />REBOOT 
<br />
<br />===== 
<br />
<br />Run the appropriate one of these and/or the trial versions below. 
<br />
<br />Manufacturer's Diagnostic Utilities. 
<br />
<br />(The old 302602 links is not valid now for the diagnostic links.)

<p>hey there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i have read everything i can about my situation and i am aware there is no way of solving it without redownloading windows 10 onto my computer. I dont have access to any computer that runs windows ten. So is there any way to fix it besides that??&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your plight and I can tell you i went through the same burdensome sitiuation last night. I did everything from startup repair to safe mode booting and all what not. But I'll tell you how I got around it successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am not going to be all techy and stuff since this is my first time answering a question in this community, I'll just make it simple and hit the nail right on the head.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When windows shows the opportunity to enter Advanced Options after it failed to start properly, click on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Go straight and click on the troubleshooting option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Just look for the command prompt option to troubleshoot windows and click.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Confirm your logon account by entering your system password (i.e. the one you use in logging to your computer), that is if you had one initially.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. When command prompt comes up, type the following instruction:</p>
<p>
</p><p>sfc /scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Allow it to complete, which should take between 3-20mins depending on the corrupt level of your windows boot files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. When its done, it will tell you it has found corrupt files and fixed them. After which you should just type: exit. (Please don't use the cancel button, you might just render your work useless).</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Now, from the same screen where you saw command prompt option, click on System Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Choose a restore date that corresponds to the very last windows update you got on your system. You can click the "show more restore points" if you don't see this. But incase there are none, just look for a date away from the last software you installed
 on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10. Let the system restore run. This might take sometime, so you might want to turn on John Wick 2 and enjoy with a cup of cocoa. Lol, I love that movie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>11. When its done, you'll be taken to a restarted system. There, you've got your system back. You can then run chkdsk /r and chkdsk /f at your free time. Also run the DISM.exe /online /RestoreHealth (am not sure that's the full and correct command, but just
 Google it: it will help repair damaged windows files- but you must be connected to the internet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that if the restore point fails, you can begin steps 2 to 10 again until you get the right restore point that will work. Some may have been corrupted with the boot files which resulted into Windows failing to boot out of the BSoD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps you and everyone in this dilemma. Truly they say, necessity is the mother of all inventions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers guys.</p>

    <title>Sound will not automatically switch between speakes and headphones - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ed riker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound will not automatically switch between speakes and headphones</h2>
                    <p>My computer will not automatically switch audio between my monitor speakers and my headphones. I brought up the play back device list. Right now my monitor speakers are set as the default audio device and they are playing sound. When I plug my headphones
 into my computer the sound does not switch, the monitor speakers continue to play the audio. In the play back device list I am able to switch the audio to my headphones and they play fine but once I remove the headphones from the jack the audio does not switch
 back to the speakers. So in this case there is no longer any audio because the computer is attempting to play audio through the headphone jack but there are no headphones.
<br />
How do I make it so the audio plays through my monitor speakers but automatically switches to my headphones when they are plugged in and automatically switches back when they are unplugged?</p>

            <p>Is the monitor receiving audio via HDMI?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so the headphone socket will be a different audio device to the monitor&nbsp;and use independent drivers and one cannot control the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the headphone socket is true HD audio spec you could try making that the default sound device with the headphones plugged in as when they are removed the device should go off line.</p>

            <p>You have posted in a Windows 7 section of the forum. I don't personally have a HP scanner/printer, but:</p>

<p>If you mean that you want to scan by using the printer's controls, see <strong>
HP OfficeJet Pro 6900 Printers - Scanning From the Control Panel (JPEG, PDF)</strong>:
<a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/hp-officejet-pro-6970-all-in-one-printer-series/8289585/model/11161264/document/c05098874" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you want to initiate the scan from the computer, see <strong>
HP Printers - How to Scan from the Computer (Windows):</strong>&nbsp; <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/hp-officejet-pro-6970-all-in-one-printer-series/8289585/model/11161264/document/c03466081" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>If you've installed the HP scanning software, click Start and then click "All Programs" and look for HP (or, as the video suggests, type the model of your printer -- 6978 -- into the Search box).&nbsp; As the second document linked above explains, you can use
 Paint (part of all editions of Windows) to scan.&nbsp; You probably can also use Windows Fax and Scan (to scan, but not to fax).</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi daddyal,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1. Since when are you facing this issue?<br />
2. What is the configuration of your computer?<br />
<br />
You may run the troubleshooter from the below mentioned link and check if you can get to the exact issue –<br />
Open the playing Audio troubleshooter -<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/enUS/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/enUS/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are still unable to identify the issue and the sound comes crackled and distorted check for the following-</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Make sure your speakers are correctly connected to your computer.<br />
Many computers have three or more jacks that connect to a sound card or sound processor, including a microphone jack, line-in jack, and line-out jack. Your speakers should be plugged in to the line-out jack. If you're not sure which jack this is, try plugging
 your speakers in to each of the jacks to see if any of them produce sound.<br />
<br />
Refer to the below links for assistance -<br />
</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Adjust-the-sound-level-on-your-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Adjust-the-sound-level-on-your-computer</span></span></a></span></span>
</li><li><span><span>In some cases, you can work around the problem by disabling optional speaker effects that are known as
<span><em>enhancements</em></span>. If disabling speaker effects solves the problem, you might need to update your audio driver.<br />

            Hi QUIKTUNE
<br />
<br />KMS GUI ELDI generally means you are running a cracked version of Windows 10 . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to System - About 
<br />
<br />What version of Windows 10 is reported there, is it Pro or Enterprise? 
<br />
<br />Then in the Settings App, go to Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />Does Activation report that 'Windows is activated using your Organisation's Activation server'? 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator' 
<br />
<br />Run or paste this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv 
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of the resulting dialog . . .

    <title>Printing .htm or .html files from File Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Printing .htm or .html files from File Explorer</h2>
                    <p>Hi all. Apologies if this has been asked already. If so I could not find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 file explorer, the Print button is disabled if I select an htm/html file. No problem with other files (eg .doc, .rtf, .jpg). I can get round it by opening the .htm file in a browser and then printing from there, but it is a much longer process.
 I hoped right click might work, but the print option does not show at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel there is setting or association that I have not found. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please be informed that, by default the print option may not be available when you select the .htm or .html files from the File explorer. The print option will be available if you select

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Anyway, you may try to print the .htm/.html files by opening through the browsers (Internet Explorer/Microsoft EDGE) as you have mentioned in the post.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Kiran</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate that the default setting is to disable print, but in Windows XP it was possible to click an htm/html file in file manager to select, then click "print this file". Made it all very quick. Has this facility been lost in Windows 10, or is there
 a setting buried in the bowels of the software that I can change?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>The print option is still available on Internet <em>Shortcuts</em> (type: .url).&nbsp; The kind that are found in your favorites folder.&nbsp; You can also right-click on desktop or in any folder to create shortcut and then browse to your .html file.)</p>
<p>

            <p>Found the trick to getting 'Print' back on the .html context menu.&nbsp; This will associate them with opening in IE rather than Edge.&nbsp; If that's acceptable, read on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to delete two registry keys.&nbsp; You should export these before deleting so you can undo your changes if you're unhappy with the results.&nbsp; The keys are:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.html\UserChoice]</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Roaming\OpenWith\FileExts\.html]</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Log off &amp; back on &amp; you should have 'Print' back in the context menu.</p>

            Hi June, what program are you using to open WPS files in Windows 10?
<br />
<br />It should be opened with MS WORKS, but support is sparse in Windows 10 . . .
<br />
<br />Open Office is free and can be successfully used to open WORKS files in Windows 10, Office will not open these files . . .
<br />

<br />Try below steps and see if the issue still persists:
<br />
<br />Go to your Phone settings and look for Applications or Application Manager.
<br />
<br />Look for Skype and then select Force Stop &gt; Clear cache &gt; Clear Data &gt; Uninstall.
<br />
<br />After uninstalling, kindly do a reboot on your device.

<br />Once it pop-up, please install Skype using Google Play Store.

<p>If the Security tab is still greyed out, go to the Privacy Tab next to it, make sure the Private Browsing is
<strong>not</strong> checked, and 'play' with the Privacy settings till the Passwords box is not greyed out (I seem to remember having to fiddle with it a bit to free up that check box), but it does eventually work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this fixes the issue for you.</p>

            I would recommend taking it in to your closest Microsoft Store and have them look  into it for you.
<br />We are just a community that helps with Windows matter and have no access to purchasing from Microsoft.

            Hi Terence, well the WipeDrive report if from 27 March 2017 % 03:55PM, so yes I would have to say that does look like it is a refurbished machine . . .
<br />
<br />If that system is supposed to be new, then I would definitely contact Microsoft . . .

    <title>Errors using Verizon for Internet connection on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Errors using Verizon for Internet connection on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After going from Windows 7 to Windows 10, I periodically get the following errors on my desktop while using Verizon to access the internet:</p>
<p>
</p><p>MBN0x80548212</p>
<p>MBN0x80548201</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Verizon on June 27 and they said they would investigate and get back to me.&nbsp; They have not.</p>
<p>I am running on their 4G network and have the latest updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I either have to disconnect/reconnect the Verizon modem, or power off/on the system, to recover the connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Microsoft Safety Scanner (1.0.3001.0) to see if it could detect a problem, which took several hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; No problems found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just had another error:&nbsp; MBN0x8007139F</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I realize that while using Verizon modem you are unable to connect to Internet. I will try to help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may want to plug in another USB modem into this PC to check if the issue persists. Further you may also plug in this USB modem into another PC to test if that helps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue is specific to Verizon modem then you may also want to post this question in the Verizon Forums:

            I guess I did not make myself clear.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am able to connect to the internet with Verizon, but after I am connected and running ok for awhile, I frequently get the MNB errors mentioned above.

            <p>I took my desktop computer (Gateway purchased in 2010) to a computer repair shop.&nbsp;&nbsp; They said that Gateway went out of business and there is no support for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; They determined that my computer was not compatible with Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; They reloaded Windows
 7 and now my system is running fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It sure would have been nice to know this before I went to Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I remember right, I was getting emails from Microsoft saying my computer was ok to upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; This caused me an unnecessary expense and several days without a system.</p>
