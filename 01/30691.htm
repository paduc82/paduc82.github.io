<h2>            File Download-Security Warning</h2>
                    All I want to know is how to get rid of the File Download-Security Warning box when trying to download media from third party apps, such as metacafe pro. I've tried changing every setting I can to no avail and no one seems to have any answers on this one.
 Anyone have any ideas?<br />

<p>I don't understand.&nbsp; You can't download anything from a third party app.&nbsp; You can download things from services, but not apps.&nbsp; Apps are client-side programs.</p>
<p>In Internet Explorer, click Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Security.&nbsp; Locate the Downloads section.&nbsp; What's selected in that section?</p>

<p>Well pals, I solved my problem a few days ago.</p>
<p>If it could help others, I'll be glad.</p>
<p>The one who sold Me the XBox 360 Slim 4Gb, was a personal friend, And with the help of you, among others we went To his house And made some tests.</p>
<p>The conclusion? </p>
<p>It was the "non original" 250Gb HD I bought.</p>
<p>With the HD change almost all my 30 original XBox titles worked, among them, Black, Lord of the Rings Third age, Fable, Fable Lost Chapters, Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, Halo 1 And 2, manhunt, etc...</p>
<p>Thanks a Lot pals.</p>
<p>Never forget, Original Xbox games on Xbox 360, ONLY on Original HDs.</p>
<p>Hugs.</p>

    <title>Double Taxed on purchases - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cheetohz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Double Taxed on purchases</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all, for Xmas last year, I purchased $500 worth of MS point cards to give away as gifts. I still had $100 left over and decided to use them recently. For simplicity I will only describe a purchase with a single $20 card. and I will use rough figures
 for taxes charged on these purchases.</p>

<p>So, originally I purchased these cards for $22 ($20 + $2 tax)</p>
<p>Xbox migrates to local currency and I redeem these for $20 in my account.</p>
<p>I make a purchase for $20 and am charged $2 tax.</p>
<p>I have now spent $24 for a $20 purchase. This includes $2+$2 in taxes. I am being charged tax twice. This to me seems like it could be a major legal issue, especially after reading that I would not be charged tax for these purchases.</p>


<p>Please see cutout from the online FAQ regarding this change. http://www.xbox.com/pointsfaq</p>
<p><b>What if I still have codes and/or Microsoft Points cards that I haven’t yet redeemed?</b></p>
<p>Go ahead and redeem them! Even after your account transitions, we’ll still accept purchased Microsoft Points cards and codes until further notice, and we’ll add to your account an amount of local currency equal to or greater than the Xbox stores value of
 those Microsoft Points. When you next redeem a Microsoft Points card or code, those Microsoft Points will be retired, and your account will begin using your local currency instead. Microsoft Points cards and codes that you have purchased and choose to redeem
 after your account has transitioned will expire one year from the date the Microsoft Points are redeemed. Applies to US/Canada only: we will not apply taxes when you spend the currency that&nbsp;<i>we</i>&nbsp;add to your account at the time you redeem your Microsoft
 Points card or code.</p>

<p>Well there's a couple causes for this because it was working perfectly fine if you qualified to not be double taxed.<br />
<br />
Let me explain:<br />
<br />
If you redeemed all of the points you had in your hands <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>BEFORE</strong></span>&nbsp;the transition took place then you wouldn't have been taxed twice on your transactions. This is because Microsoft charges taxes on the points you redeem
<br />
If you redeemed all of these points <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>AFTER</strong></span>&nbsp;the transition took place you will now be taxed regardless of you redeeming Microsoft Point codes or Xbox Gift Cards.<br />
<br />
You had a short time to add all of your points to your account before you were transitioned to local currency so you weren't taxed. I took advantage of this and had about $425 in points that I was not taxed on. The rest of the cards I have redeemed will now
 be taxed because it's after the transitional period.<br />
<br />
People who took part in the Xbox 360 Dashboard Beta for 2013 would have been transitioned right when they downloaded the update and attempted to purchase an item. They weren't aware of this taxation free points that Microsoft was allowing to others because
 the points FAQ wasn't up at that time with all of the information. So unfortunately, some of those people might have missed out, and that sucks.<br />
<br />
<strong>TL:DR:</strong> It seems you waited to redeem points cards after the transition took place, and you were double taxed. This is how it was setup, you had to redeem them all before the transition to not be double taxed.</p>

<p>I was just taxed twice by buying the Destiny Expansion Pass thru GameStop. The GameStop website, and the emailed invoice, said I purchased a download code; $35.00 plus tax. &nbsp;However, when I redeemed the code, I was credited only $35.00, and when I purchased
 the Pass I was charged $34.99 plus tax. &nbsp;So, after being in contact with both GameStop and Microsoft, it seems GameStop was only selling a gift card for the amount that would cover the Destiny Expansion Pass purchase; not a direct download code. &nbsp;So is this
 legal to charge tax on the Live Currency (a gift card)? &nbsp;And as the Microsoft Support suggested why would you ever buy a gift card or Live Currency (especially from GameStop), when you should just purchase everything via the Market Place?</p>

            Hi bluffguy,<br />
<br />
Firstly, I would suggest you to temporarily disable/uninstall your Anti-virus program and then try to run the game to check if the Anti-virus is conflicting with the game.<br />
<br />
If this did not help, then try performing a clean boot and then try running the game.<br />
<br />
Clean boot uses minimal set of drivers and startup programs and helps in eliminating software conflicts.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Start &gt;&gt; in the Start Search, type in msconfig and hit Enter.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Services Tab, check on Hide all Microsoft Services.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the Startup tab, click on disable all and then click Ok.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you get a prompt to restart the computer, click on Restart now.<br />
<br />
When the computer is in a clean boot, the third party services and applications are disabled. Once the computer is restarted, check if the issue occurs at this time.
<br />
<br />
Check out this link which talks about how to perform a clean boot<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Follow all the steps given in the link to figure out which software is conflicting. If this resolves the issue, do not forget to put the computer back to the normal startup.<br />

I would also suggest you to go through this link and try out the step as mentioned by Intel.<br />

    <title>windows 10 has become an endless loop of BSOD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gohanrage  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 has become an endless loop of BSOD</h2>
                    <p>First I was fighting with my computer with windows 7 to get windows 10 to install. when it finally installed. I noticed that my rear speakers were no longer working. I tried doing different things in the properties and using compatibility mode. I went to
 the asus site and downloaded the latest driver I was installing it when I got the BSOD every time My computer boots its a Blue screen that tells me to reboot. so its an endless loop</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so confused that windows 10 app said my computer was ready. but every time I tried to upgrade windows would automatically restore my previous OS which is windows 7. I guess I should of done what others were doing. wait months before installing it so
 that bugs can be ironed out. I have asbolutely no idea what I need to do now. how do I restore the function of my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>for some reason my motherboard USB ports don't work during windows 10 diagnostic area. I have to plug my keyboard and mouse into a 3.0 port so I can click advanced options. its really odd the USB3.0 ports are in a PCI-E 1X Card they aren't part of my motherboard.
 &nbsp;when I want to use F5 or F8 or Del the keyboard needs to be plugged into motherboard usb but this windows 10 trouble shooting stuff only works with 3.0 ports. weird&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to have windows 10 reinstall and default my settings but keep my files what ever that is called has already failed once. doing the process. this will really suck if I loose all my personal files and need to do a clean install of windows
 7 in order to upgrade to 10</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I booted into safe mode and deleted both the driver for my motherboard sound card and my video card. I figured it was sound driver because after updating it was what gave me the blue screen of death. but the error message I was getting was said to be caused
 by a graphics driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED</p>
<p>
</p><p>that was all it gave me and said I had to reboot. but then i used my laptop which hasn't been having any major issues with windows 10 even though the machine came with vista installed. so I looked up on that computer how to enter safe mode it wasn't i was
 pressing F5 and or F8 like a mad man but those didn't bring it up. after a new reboots windows 10 tried to trouble shoot and I was given restart again or advance settings and there i was able to reboot enabling safemode and uninstalling both those drivers
 for audio and video devices allowed me to boot windows normally and get to my desktop without a BSOD but I can't still figure out why my 4.1 speakers wont work. I usually use a 2x stereo mode but I can't figure out how to make my rear speakers work. I tried
 getting Vdeck to run multiple ways. it used to work in windows 7 so I right clicked it then trouble shooted and tested it and hd vdeck still didn't open it works for a guy on youtube. i was copying what he did</p>

<h2>            Lexmark X204n offline</h2>
                    I am unable to get my X204n to show as online.&nbsp; I installed multiple times and finally got it to show online and work fine.&nbsp; As soon as I put the laptop to sleep (windows 8 and also same problem with XP) the printer goes offline and will not come back.&nbsp;
 Multiple attempts to re-install on BOTH systems&nbsp;but printer still shows offline.&nbsp; Also, even after I delete the driver it still shows as an option when I try to print something.&nbsp; So I have multiple copies of the Lexmark driver on my printer list but not in
 my Device/Drivers list.

            Hi Chris,
<div><br />
Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and posting your query on Microsoft community.</div>
<div><br />
From your issue description I understand that Lexmark X204n printer status show offline whenever you put computer into sleep mode.</div>
<div><br />
Let’s start with some questions.<br />
1. What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
2. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div><br />
Now let’s try some steps for resolving this issue, which I have described as methods given below.<br />
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>Run the power troubleshooter. Follow these steps:</div>
<div>a) Press the ‘Windows + W’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) Type Troubleshooter in the search box and then press enter.<br />
c) Click system and security and run the power troubleshooter.</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>Run the Printer troubleshooter and check</div>
<div>a. Press the "Windows + C" to activate the charms menu or move the mouse pointer to bottom right corner of<br />
the screen and you will get the charms menu.<br />
b. Click on Search and select Settings. <br />
c. Type Troubleshooting and select Troubleshooting.<br />
d. Select View all on the left hand side.<br />
e. Select Printer Troubleshooter.<br />
f. Click next and follow the onscreen instructions.</div>
<div><strong>Method 2</strong>:</div>
<div>If the above method does not help, check for the following setting:<br />
a) Right click on Start, and then click on Control Panel.</div>
<div>b. Now click on “Devices and Printers”. This will open a window with a list of the printers currently set up on your computer. Now click on the printer that you have under the "Printers and Faxes" icon.</div>
<div>c. Double-click on the icon of the printer you want to change to online. A pop-up window detailing all current print jobs will open.</div>
<div>d. Go to "Printer" in the menu bar of the pop-up window and uncheck "Use Printer Offline". This action will change the printer from offline to online.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong> Please follow the instruction on this link and check.</div>
<div><strong>Fix printer problems</strong><br />

<p><span>Hi Daydreamin,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. What’s the
<strong>exact</strong> error message you receive when you try and open sticky notes?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First, let’s try and open Sticky Notes from its source folder. Default location is
<strong>C:\Windows\System32\StikyNot.exe</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you can open Sticky Notes from its source folder, the issue may be due to corrupted shortcut icon. If this is the case, you may delete the shortcut
 icon and create a new one from the source folder and pin it to the Start menu, if necessary.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above step does not help in fixing the issue, let’s run System File Checker (SFC) scan and check if it fixes the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>S</span><span>FC tool
</span><span>scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following article for more information on using SFC tool
</span><span>to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files</span><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Hi CA.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You don't lose anything changing from S Mode except the restriction that you can only install Microsoft Store apps. 
<br />
<br />See here to do this:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4456067/windows-10-switch-out-of-s-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/445606...</a>
<br />
<br />Defender will remain on to protect you.  I would use built-in Defender for adequate protection, best Windows performance and fewest issues.  It's made by Microsoft who make Windows and know how to protect it best.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi c.avery
<br />
<br />Switching from Windows 10 in S Mode does not cause you to lose anything, including virus protection . . .
<br />
<br />Yes, your system may be safer if you can only install Apps form the Microsoft Store and that is an extra level of security, however, once you only install genuine software on your system after switching out of S Mode, there is absolutely no danger to your system . . .

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the version of Microsoft Visual C++ installed on the computer is not the updated one. The Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package installs runtime components of Visual C++ Libraries required to run applications developed with
 the same version Visual C++ on a computer that does not have the version installed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the issue specific to particular game on Origin? If yes, which is the game?</li><li>Are you trying to play games online?</li><li>What is the exact error message that you receive when you run or install the game?</li></ol>
<p>As far as compatibility of Origin with Windows 8 is concerned, it is compatible. Refer to the link to get the details:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Type=Software&amp;Name=Origin&amp;ModelOrVersion=9&amp;Vendor=EA&amp;Locale=1033%2C2057%2C3081%2C4105%2C16393&amp;LastSearchTerm=origin&amp;BreadcrumbPath=origin&amp;TempOsid=Windows+8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Type=Software&amp;Name=Origin&amp;ModelOrVersion=9&amp;Vendor=EA&amp;Locale=1033%2C2057%2C3081%2C4105%2C16393&amp;LastSearchTerm=origin&amp;BreadcrumbPath=origin&amp;TempOsid=Windows+8</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as you have mentioned that setup doesn’t continue, check if Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 is already installed or shows up in Control Panel. Press
<strong>Windows+X</strong> keys and select <strong>Programs and Features</strong>. Check if the version already shows up within the installed list. If yes, then you can't reinstall it unless you uninstall the current version. To verify if the version you are
 trying to install is the correct one, refer to the link to download the latest version from Microsoft Download center:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784</a>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is specific to a particular game, you may contact the game’s manufacturer as there could be chances that copy of the game’s patch is corrupt (if you are not trying to play games online).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know the status of this issue. </p>

            Whether it's a game or just another app, downloading from the Store app is the same. Just login to the Store app on your Windows 10 using your xbox live account, then search for the game title, and download it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Since you already know how to buy a game, I assume that you already know how to download it. Setting up an account is much harder. Not unless you're having an issue doing it? Let us know if there is so that we can help. No need to go to xbox forum.

    <title>WDF_Violation issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> merlinau  say:</h3>
<h2>            WDF_Violation issue</h2>
                    <p>I updated my HP Envy 23 online about 7 months ago from 8.1 to 10. It has been running fine generally. I have VIPRE anti virus software installed. Yesterday I lost sound from the system. I tried various thing to restore it. System reported all the drivers
 were working OK.</p>
<p>I then rebooted the PC to see if that might help (I have found the system would tend to 'lock up' when I was swapping about using large files in the cache and have found a reboot usually fixes it)</p>
<p>When I attempted the reboot it failed to reach any level of activity before it began making a very loud continuous 'alarm' like noise. The only thing I could do was switch the unit off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At a later reboot attempt I received the message about 'There is a problem with your PC, we will restart it for you (and the WDF_Violation message).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system failed to reboot but again made the loud 'alarm' sound again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have the Windows 10 boot disk because I &nbsp;updated via the Windows online system that was available.</p>
<p>The system won't reboot far enough to respond to 'shift/Cntrl/Escape ' or any other commands.</p>
<p>What can I do? This PC is very important to my work from home life.</p>
<p>I have access to my wife's PC which is working with Windows 10 currently</p>

<h2>            How can I repair Windows 10 boot entry&#47;BCD&#63;</h2>
                    <div style="text-align: justify">I have a laptop with dual boot (Windows 10 + Ubuntu). Till I updated to 10 I experienced performance problems and I decided to create a Windows 7 VHD system for some tests. I used some tutorials for Windows 8 and I guess something
 changed till 8, cause some commands removed my Windows 10 boot entry while I tried to make the Windows 7 VHD. The boot entry just disappeared from the System startup list. I tried to restore it with MSCONFIG too, but it does not let me do anything. After that
 I tried to repair through Advanced Startup but nothing changed. I also tried to fix with the installer but bcdedit/bootrec commands fails too. The strange thing is that GRUB can still recognise and boot into Windows 10 without any problem.</div>

            <p>Here's the results but still the same output. <em>/fixboot</em> says that there is no known filesystem on the partition and be sure that filesystem driver are loaded or something like that. The partition was checked so it cannot be wrong. /rebuildbcd ends
 with the same.</p>

<h2>            Hibernate still uses power</h2>
                    <p>On my 4 month old HP Spectre i7, when I hibernate my computer (shutdown or sign out/Hibernate) with say 15% battery power left and come back to it the next morning ALL of the power is gone.</p>
<p>It's as though hibernate is still using power (definitely hibernate and not sleep).</p>
<p>It doesn't happen if I shut down so it's not a dud battery</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Ah ok. That's useful. I thought hibernate just took a snapshot add the current state, saved it to disk to reference on start up and turned all power off so it makes more sense now. No tasks. Don't use scheduler at all but I'll double check.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>** Does this error message pop up while trying to play the game or soon after double clicking on the game
 icon on the Desktop?<br />
** Did the disc from which you installed had an Ubisoft logo?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you uninstall the game completely from the computer, re-install it and try launching it without installing the patch, because patch needs to be installed only if the Zoo tycoon 2 disc has Ubisoft logo in it.<br />
<br />
For general troubleshooting on Zoo Tycoon 2 have a look at this link: <br />

            Hi, It actually did it before the patch as well. It switches to Windows 7 Basic mode as expected when I double click the icon, then populates that error message. The game never actually starts. I have tried so many different things, i just wanna play.
 Thanks for the future help..
