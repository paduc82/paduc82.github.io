    <title>New Surface Book Unable To Take Ownership Of TPM - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            New Surface Book Unable To Take Ownership Of TPM</h2>
                    <p>Hi to all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not execute any series of steps between the BIOS settings and tpm.msc in Windows 10 1607 to enable me to set my own ownership password. Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little background.</p>
<p>After doing some initial set up of the surface book, I forgot my Windows login password. I was able to get in by using the windows cmd.exe rename method in conjunction with a windows install disk. After resetting the password, I was never able to completely
 get the TrusedInstaller authorities exactly as they had been on the affected files so I decided to reinstall Windows 10. I have applied updates and am now back the version 1607, the anniversary update. Regarding the reinstall, I've seen other posts that they
 were locked out of the TPM at this point. It's important to note that I had never turned on Bitlocker and I am getting success messages from the BIOS when I clear the TPM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Current State:</p>
<p>Note that this is a v2.0 TPM which shows to be in ready for use state. The initialize/prepare the TPM option remains greyed out in tpm.msc. When I try to change ownership, a new key is generated but I can not apply it because I do not have the current owner
 key. I never had it or created it. In this regard, the TPM is as it came from the factory. I've heard that Windows 10 may automatically prepare the TPM but I am unable to locate any key file on the system drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also don't see the full tpm.msc command set, such as the option to turn off or on the TPM. I am able to do this in BIOS however. I've been through the TPM settings in gpedit.msc and don't see anything that is different from other non surface book systems
 where I have been able to own their TPMs. I have also been through all the bitlocker for system drives settings and have set them to the same as on my other systems - encrypt full drive, complex pins, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should mention that I am using local accounts, should that make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated! At this state, crypto-graphically, I do not own this machine. I'm unwilling to proceed further with setting it up or turning on bitlocker or moving any personal data to the machine until this is resolved. I'm falling behind
 schedule in a critical project this machine was intended for. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for any help.</p>

<h2>            dragon age 2 and wwe all stars</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to make a suggestion.</p>
<p>Could you make Dragon Age II a discounted game for xbox live gold users</p>
<p>or make it a free game for xbox 360 live gold members?</p>
<p>I know theres a chance you already had done this,</p>
<p>not when I had xbox live gold though...</p>
<p>I have had it on a year subscription and I have yet to see it.</p>
<p>And one more thing is you do not have an option to buy WWE All Stars.</p>
<p>Another game I would like to see discounted or as a free game!</p>
<p>I don't like any other wrestling games and currently I have got 57 games....</p>
<p>Thank you and any response from a moderator or xbox employee would be appreciated.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Repair Install after upgrading to Professional, can&#39;t I - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> figureguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Repair Install after upgrading to Professional, can&#39;t I use the upgrade key to repair install, if not what do I do</h2>
                    <p>I just got off the phone with Microsoft Support, and I am more confused than before I called.&nbsp; The worst part is that owning Windows 7 I know I am eligible for the free upgrade to 10.&nbsp; But the support tech told me I needed 8 to get the free upgrade and opposed
 to fixing 7 said I should just upgrade in order to get the free 10.&nbsp; ARGHHH!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhoo, sorry for the rant.&nbsp; But here is the problem.&nbsp; I have Windows 7 running on my PC and a while ago I upgraded to Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp; I have the cardboard insert with the key in front of me.&nbsp; I have been experiencing major problems lately and I want to
 do a repair install.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Right on the insert, below the key, it says <em>Keep this Upgrade Key and refer to it if you ever need to re-install Windows 7.&nbsp;
</em>Now I need to do a repair install so just how can I use the key to re-install?&nbsp; Am I able to just re-install it with the key, or what does that mean on the bottom?&nbsp; Why can't I use it if it says that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I have to do a repair install with the Windows 7 CD itself, and then upgrade again to 7?&nbsp; If I try that, won't my key turn up as invalid?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to make sure, I ordered a free system backup disc from Dell because I never go the image off the hard drive when I first bought it.&nbsp; I had never bought a computer before where the operating system backup wasn't just included with the physical disc.&nbsp;
 The discs should be here soon, I just wanted to know if I could repair it with just my upgrade key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my first time doing a repair install, and I just want to make sure I am doing it right.&nbsp; I would rather attempt the repair than to just return to factory settings and lose everything.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't do a Repair Upgrade Install just with a Product Key.</p>
<p>you need the Media too.</p>
<p>You upgraded to Windows 7 Pro, so where is the Media?</p>

            <p>Honestly you are best to either restore to factory settings or to perform a clean installation. In my experience repair installs do not fix the instabilities caused by a bloated registry. i.e. are just a waste of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why Microsoft introduced the Refresh (and Reset) for Windows 8 onwards. The Refresh allows reinstallation of Windows without loss of user data. A Refresh &nbsp;from Windows 8.1 installation media installs a fresh set of Windows installation files from
 the Windows 8.1 installation&nbsp;and removes all software and drivers installed. A refresh from a Refresh Image on the other hand reinstalls all the files including drivers and third party programs included in the time the Refresh Image was made&nbsp;again not affecting
 users files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Refresh is not a feature available for Windows 7 installation and in order to get a fresh set of installation files you really need to reinstall everything. Note if you use or have previously used the Dell Windows 7 Reinstallation DVD or Generic Microsoft
 Windows Installation DVD you will lose/already lost the ability to revert to the Dell Factory settings and the recovery partition is either deleted or useless in such cases.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have on the other hand used Windows Anytime Upgrade to go from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 7 Professional the factory image and recovery partition will be intact. You can revert to the factory image and then use Windows Anytime Upgrade again
 to get to Windows 7 Professional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to best help you, let us know if you used the DVD to previously upgrade to Windows 7 Professional or if you used Windows Anytime Upgrade as this will dictate whether the factory image is available or not.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also as you have not explicitly stated what the issues are, ensure you run the F12 preboot diagnostics alongside any extended tests:</p>
<p><a href="http://dellwindowsreinstallationguide.com/f12-preboot-diagnostics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://dellwindowsreinstallationguide.com/f12-preboot-diagnostics/</a>
</p>
<p>Report back if they have any errors quoting the code e.g. 2000-0142, 2000-0146 or if they pass.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also&nbsp;focus on data backup, copy all data to an external hard drive using Windows explorer. Or if your&nbsp;Windows 7&nbsp;install is really unstable&nbsp;or infected by Malware&nbsp;follow the instructions to copy your data using a Linux Live bootable USB:</p>

            <p>I don't have any media for the Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp; I have a plastic case I bought that has a cardboard insert with the key inside.&nbsp; It says to go to the Windows Anytime Upgrade site and input the code.&nbsp; I did that and it installed Pro.&nbsp; This is what McAfee is
 not doing with their AV, only including a code instead of media.&nbsp; It's less costly for the publishers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's where the problem lies.&nbsp; I read the link (thanks for including that) but I'm still not sure what to do next.&nbsp; If I use the Windows 7 disc for repair, will that erase my Pro?&nbsp; Or does it just repair the issues inside and leave Pro still installed?&nbsp;
 &nbsp;I'm just not sure how to reinstall it with the key only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Bill.&nbsp; I appreciate it.</p>

            <p>Thanks for getting back to me.&nbsp; I do not have any Windows 7 discs, according to the Dell rep I spoke with late last night they should be here in a few days.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Windows Anytime Upgrade with the Upgrade Key as opposed to the disc.&nbsp; When I purchased Pro it was in a plastic case with just a cardboard insert and the key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did run the F12 preboot, actually the Dell tech I spoke with last night had me do it.&nbsp; We found no issues on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't had to do this before, so if I can how do I revert to the factory image?&nbsp; Do I need to have the Windows 7 discs first?&nbsp; Will my files, information, programs etc. disappear if I do revert?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Malwarebytes regularly, and have not shown any Malware instances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you saying to backup the data once it is stable, or before?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Philip.&nbsp; I appreciate it.</p>

            <p>You should backup the data before reinstalling Windows. If the system is stable enough to copy the files within Windows then&nbsp;copy your&nbsp;files within Windows to an external hard drive. If its unstable use Linux Fedora to copy your data to an external hard
 drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The preboot diagnostics passed so your hardware is good and all your issues are likely brought about by a bloated registry or malware/spyware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you used Windows Anytime Upgrade before your factory image&nbsp;should remain&nbsp;intact. If your&nbsp; system is stable enough (i.e. won't crash)&nbsp;you should uninstall Dell DataSafe Local Backup/Dell Backup and Recovery and install the latest version of Dell Backup
 and Recovery 1.8.1.71 which has a multitude of fixes and enhancements especially in the creation of recovery media. Once you have the latest version use it to create a Factory Backup (16 GB Bootable USB). Follow&nbsp;my guide here:</p>
<p><a href="http://dellwindowsreinstallationguide.com/dell-backup-and-recovery-1-8-1-71/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://dellwindowsreinstallationguide.com/dell-backup-and-recovery-1-8-1-71/</a>
</p>
<p>This guide is for Windows 8.1 but is more or less identical for a Windows 7 system (except for restoring from the internal recovery partition).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are satisfied you have backed up your data you may use the 16 GB USB flash drive to restore to your factory settings as instructed in the same guide. When you are at factory settings you can use Windows Anytime Upgrade to revert back to Windows
 7 Professional using your same key as before ensure&nbsp;you&nbsp;do this immediately before updating. While theoretically it should make no difference I and others&nbsp;have experienced some issues with Windows Anytime Upgrade from an updated&nbsp;Windows 7 SP1 install where
 it rejected the upgrade key&nbsp;which weren't present with an un-updated&nbsp;Windows 7 No Service Pack install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend uninstalling McAfee and using the McAfee removal tool and then patching Windows 7 fully using the WSUS Offline Update before installing any other software:</p>

<p>
</p><p>The reason I wanted to do a repair and not a re-install is that I do not have an external hard drive available.&nbsp; Rather than pay for one and have issues with this I figured I would try and do the repair with what I have.</p>

            <p>Okay, I have spoken with Dell and Microsoft.&nbsp; Dell sent me a reinstallation disc for Home Premium, that I had when I bought the PC.&nbsp; I need the disk for Pro in order to repair it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I don't understand is Microsoft sold the Pro update with a key only and not a disc.&nbsp; Why can't I reinstall it off the key, if this is so then why not sell the disc or at least mark on the package telling you so?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought Microsoft's product, and now they are saying because you did not buy it in the right format you can't install it.&nbsp; That makes no sense to me at all.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem when I wanted to pass my TouchSmart on to my mother but use the Pro Upgrade that I had purchased but never used.&nbsp; The problem was that the ISO I wanted to use was W7sp1 Pro and my upgrade key specified W7 Home to W7 Pro (e.g. not W7sp1).&nbsp;
 It appeared then that I would have to do a factory restore of my W7 Home Premium, do the upgrade on that and then do the updating to W7sp1 Pro.&nbsp; Ugh.&nbsp; Unaware of this problem I had already installed the ISO and tried to use my upgrade key.&nbsp; The error I was
 getting&nbsp;very precisely described my case.&nbsp; Fortunately, I got a sympathetic support person to listen to this explanation and I was given a new W7sp1 Pro key as a replacement of my unused Pro Upgrade key.&nbsp; Otherwise, I was prepared reluctantly to face all of
 the updating I would need to do to use&nbsp;the upgrade key as designed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are just planning for your upgrade and haven't done anything about it yet, I would guess that uninstalling W7sp1 might be enough to be able to use your upgrade key as designed.&nbsp; Then if it didn't work as an upgrade I think you would have a stronger
 case for complaining about not being able to use it.</p>

<p>Okay, I have spoken with Dell and Microsoft.&nbsp; Dell sent me a reinstallation disc for Home Premium, that I had when I bought the PC.&nbsp; I need the disk for Pro in order to repair it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I don't understand is Microsoft sold the Pro update with a key only and not a disc.&nbsp; Why can't I reinstall it off the key, if this is so then why not sell the disc or at least mark on the package telling you so?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought Microsoft's product, and now they are saying because you did not buy it in the right format you can't install it.&nbsp; That makes no sense to me at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I mentioned before you are best to backup your data and clean install Windows 7 Home Premium then use Windows Anytime Upgrade to get Windows 7 Professional.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wrote guides in the past which had a large number of workarounds for these types of issues but Microsoft removed the proper sources of Windows 7 installation media the Digital River .isos and many of these workarounds are not possible now.</p>

            <p>If I do a clean install of Windows 7, how do I re-install Windows Pro since I already used the key?&nbsp; Will the key work again if I just go back to Windows Home?&nbsp; Before I do this I just want to make sure I can go back to Pro after things are reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mention using anytime Upgrade which is why I was asking.&nbsp; I paid for Pro and don't want to have to again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you mention backing up.&nbsp; If I reinstall Windows and get it back to normal, what happens with the backup?&nbsp; I have never backed up to an external before.&nbsp; If I restore it from the backup, will it put everything back where it was and keep the re-install?&nbsp;
 Or does it overwrite that?&nbsp; Just trying to get all the facts, thanks for everyone's help.</p>

<p>Kinda, yeah. Some of the best moments in the game involve ME2 squadmates. Thane, Grunt, and Mordin's appearances in particular being stand outs for me. And no Garrus?! Tell me you at least have Tali and Legion!</p>

<p>That said, Zaeed's appearance is kind of lame. Jacob's is mediocre (par for the course with him). Kasumi's is kind of cool, but it involves a lot of running around. Samara has an interesting moment. No idea what happens with Morinth (please don't tell me,
 I've got a renegade lined up for my next playthrough). Miranda's is alright as well.</p>

<p>Not sure. I know the demo offered several options to choose from, and that one involves a partial crew. So perhaps one offers a 'perfect' ME2 playthrough.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>@Arkham99- Yes, Jack's role was awesome, and I loved how they developed her character. The dynamic with her students (Rodriguez in particular) was great. I actually have a Vanguard that romanced her. Maybe that will be my third playthrough, lol.</p>

<p>Wait, I wonder what happens if both of them died? Rannoch would play very differently I imagine...<br />

<p>Yea you aren't going to see them at all cause they are all dead. You messed up UNLESS you were going for the whole shepard was the lone survivor. Only way to get them back is to replay the suicide mission on ME2. If you don't have a replay mission or a save
 before the suicide mission, you would need to start over. </p>

<p>If you didn't play Mass Effect 1 and save Wrex on Virmire, then Wreav is the clan leader by default.<br />
<br />
So starting ME2 and <strong><em>not</em></strong> importing a character from ME1 would have Wrex dead in the "what happened in the previous game" run down.<br />
<br />
As for the rest, if you've done Palaven (the Turian homeworld) and Garrus isn't there, that means he's dead.&nbsp; Same with everyone else.&nbsp; If Jack isn't at Grissom, then she didn't make it off the collector base.<br />

<p>The best part about Miranda's appearance were the gratuitous butt shots during the dialogues.</p>
<p>The only character I had get kiilled was Kaiden (I played ME`1 as a female but romanced Liara).</p>
<p>Jacob was kind of dull..but it was good of him to move on and make it so much easier to fall back into Liara's eager arms.</p>

            <p>You will need to check with Microsoft in your region. &nbsp;In North America Microsoft does not supply a dvd. &nbsp;The only usbs Microsoft supplies is with a purchase of Windows. &nbsp;If you have a friend or relative with an unmetered connection have them make a copy
 with the Media Creation Tool</p>

<p>
</p><p>and give or send it to you. &nbsp;A computer shop might also do that for you for a small fee. &nbsp;Be careful about untrusted sources like eBay who offer installation disks. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>New CPU isn&#39;t recognized by PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david bucur  say:</h3>
<h2>            New CPU isn&#39;t recognized by PC</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought a new CPU (is not new, but it works fine on other PCs) - I upgraded from Pentium 4, 3.00 Ghz to Pentium Dual Core, 1.60 Ghz - I need to mention that I don't use my PC for games etc, so I don't really care about CPU's performance. However,
 my PC doesn't see it ( I open the PC, monitor stays in stand by, there is not a "BEEP" sound that appeared at the old CPU). My motherboard is Gigabyte GA 945PL-S3P ( http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=2541#ov ). I also updated to the most
 recent BIOS version. I don't think there is a problem with the wattage because the old CPU consumed 80W, meanwhile the new one consumes only 65W. I have a 450W PSU, 3Gb of RAM, and Gigabyte Nvidia GT730 (if this helps with something).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do?</p>

            It's not a Windows issue. &nbsp;You need to check the motherboard manual for guidance on the BIOS settings required as the Motherboard needs to be able to recognise the CPU correctly before the PC can pass the information to the Operating System. &nbsp;Windows will
 only recognise the CPU when the system does, and the absence of any BIOS 'BEEP CODE' strongly suggests that that is not happening.&nbsp;

<p>Hello again, </p>

            Find where Wordpad stored the files on the computer's disk.&nbsp; The first place to look would be in your
<em>Documents</em> folder: click the <strong>Start</strong> button, then click<strong> Documents</strong> .

<p>Do you know the extension used on these files (the three digit file type after the dot in the filename)?&nbsp; Then you can do a COMPLETE file search for those files and then delete them.</p>
<p><span>To search the entire C: drive in Vista go to Start / Search Box and type in ‘&lt;filename&gt; or &lt;foldername&gt;’.&nbsp; In your case use the shortcut EXT:&lt;file extension&gt;.
 As you're typing you'll see two hyperlinks appear just above where you're typing and one will say Search Everywhere.&nbsp; Click on that.&nbsp; That will do a quick indexed search and bring up a dialog box.&nbsp; Click on Advanced Search.&nbsp; Click on the location drop down
 menu and find Drive C: and click on it. Check the box "include non-indexed, hidden, and system files (may be slow)."&nbsp; Then click on Search.&nbsp; You will now be searching your entire hard drive for the specified file.&nbsp; And yes, it's not a very efficient way of
 searching the entire drive for a file but that's how it's done in Vista.</span></p>
<p><span>Once you have them all located in the Search results window, select the old ones you don't want by holding down the CTRL key and clicking on the ones you
 want to delete.&nbsp; Once you've gone through the entire list then right click and select Delete (or just push the Delete button).&nbsp; That will delete the old saved files you want to delete from Vista.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

    <title>Can alert pop-up messages be turned off in Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jdjlpollard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can alert pop-up messages be turned off in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After installing Windows 10, every few min. there’s pop-up alert w/ an annoying four-note sound and the message, “Scan to computer is no longer activated. Connection to printer has been lost.” I was told that it’s an HP problem related to printer sleep mode,
 and not a Windows problem. However, before upgrading to Windows 10 (using the same printer) this never happened. Does anyone know how I can turn off this alert, or alerts in general, in Windows 10?</p>
<p>' Seems to me there must be a way.</p>

            Absolutely, just type "notifications" into your search box to manage them.&nbsp;
<p>You can turn any one on or off, or click the name to customize it even more like picking your own sound or whatever.</p>

<p>How are you connected:&nbsp; modem attached directly to PC, or thru a router?</p>
<p>Could you post the output of <strong>ipconfig /all</strong> from a command prompt?&nbsp; Open a command prompt (start &gt;<strong>cmd</strong>), and enter the aforementioned command.&nbsp; Right-click anywhere in the command window &gt; select all &gt; Enter.&nbsp; Contents are
 now copied to your Clipboard; simply Paste into your reply.</p>
<p>From what you're describing, your PC (or your router, if you're connected thru one) is pointed at a, ah, less-than-reliable DNS server, which is resulting in DNS timeouts for you.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Chris</p>

<p>I'm guessing that you're in Singapore (because that's where those DNS servers are located), correct?<br />
If so, try using another provider's DNS servers.&nbsp; A&nbsp;cursory Googling says that SingTel's are good; their addresses are 165.21.83.88 and 165.21.100.88 (that same cursory Googling had people complaining that Starhub's DNS servers, well, kinda sucked.)<br />
Or, you can use Google's DNS servers (8.8.4.4 and 8.8.8.8.)</p>
<p>HTH,<br />
Chris</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Since you are on Wireless connection it could be that the problem is No the Interent but the Wireless connetion between the Computer and the wireless Router.</p>
<p>-----------</p>
<p>A computer with Wireless connection has to maintain solid connection with the Wireless Router.</p>
<p>If the connection is not stable and often drops, then you can Not use the Internet or the Network even if the other computers are still Ok.</p>
<p>I.e., it is as if someone cut the wire that connects a regular computer to the Router.</p>
<p>Some Wireless Routers behave this way because they are "Quirky" to begin with. Check if the Vendor's support has a new firmware. Download and install new firmware.</p>
<p>Some Wireless cards might need the latest OEM Drivers to be stable. Download and update the Drivers.</p>
<p>Otherwise, try to change the channel that is used by Router for the Wireless transmission. Try all the channels and find which one yields the best results.</p>
<p>Try to take the Wireless card from the computer’s Power Saving loop. I.e., the Wireless card should work at full power and will Not be allowed to Save Power.</p>
<p>If your computer is too far from the Wireless Router, and the environment is electronically noisy it could be that you need to re-work the topology of the Wireless.</p>
<p>It is impossible to give instructions that are more precise since each device has different configuration menus. The extended manual of the devices usually explains how to apply the changes that were mentioned above.</p>

<p>Yup Chris, I'm from Singapore.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help, Your replied has made me decide to call on my service provider to get more information, Just that my computer has been attack by a series of blue screens, hangs and auto re-boot, After awhile, my internet starts to mess up, getting
 kind of worried.</p>
<p>Just wanted to ask you, My previous computer, which is totally different from this one, this is a new one. Which is Windows XP, Had problems like blue screen, Hangs and auto-reboots, So i decided to get a new computer, which is this computer, its running
 on windows 7, however, The problem resurfaced again. I'm wondering why my new computer is having the same old problem as my old computer, what could be the problem ?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot and sorry for the trouble.</p>

<p>I'm not really getting what you mean, but i have updated my firmware to the latest version, Just wondering my internet router is about 4 years old. Could it be the reason that is not working properly?</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>A failing router may create internet connection issues; however, it will not cause a PC to hang, crash applications, or throw a blue screen (and auto-reboot.)</p>
<p>As to why the new PC has come down with the same symptoms as the old PC (random hangs, app crashes, blue screen / reboot), well......&nbsp; frankly, that's rather likely your behavior (download habits, program installs - things like that), or a piece of hardware
 (and, with it, buggy drivers) that you had with the old PC.</p>
<p>Two things I'd like you to do for the BSoD (and, the other issues) that you're having:<br />
- disable automatic restart.&nbsp; Refer to <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a> for how to do it.&nbsp; Next time the system bluescreens, write down all of the information that's on screen (or, better, take a picture.)&nbsp; Post results.<br />
Also helpful:&nbsp; download and install <a href="http://www.resplendence.com/whocrashed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WhoCrashed</a>.&nbsp; It'll examine the system's crash-dump files, and (usually) can tell you exactly (in fairly plain English) what caused the failure.<br />
- Once point #1 is handled, start Windows in a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Clean Boot configuration</a>.&nbsp; Slowdowns/hangs still happen yes/no?</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Chris</p>

Bug check description: This indicates that the page frame number (PFN) list is corrupted.<br />
This appears to be a typical software driver bug and is not likely to be caused by a hardware problem. This might be a case of memory corruption. More often memory corruption happens because of software errors in buggy drivers, not because of faulty RAM modules.<br />
The crash took place in the Windows kernel. Possibly this problem is caused by another driver which cannot be identified at this time.<br />

Conclusion</strong>
<hr />
</span><br />
<span>51 crash dumps have been found and analyzed. Only 15 are included in this report. 2 third party drivers have been identified to be causing system crashes on your computer. It is strongly
 suggested that you check for updates for these drivers on their company websites. Click on the links below to search with Google for updates for these drivers:<br />
<br />
<span><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=copperhd.sys+Razer%20(Asia-Pacific)%20Pte%20Ltd+Diamondback%20USB%20Optical%20Mouse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">copperhd.sys (Diamondback USB Optical Mouse

<span><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ntkrpamp.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ntkrpamp.exe</a></span><br />
<br />
If no updates for these drivers are available, try searching with Google on the names of these drivers in combination the errors that have been reported for these drivers and include the brand and model name of your computer as well in the query. This often
 yields interesting results from discussions from users who have been experiencing similar problems.<br />
<br />
<br />

general suggestions for troubleshooting system crashes</a> for more information. <br />
<br />
Note that it's not always possible to state with certainty whether a reported driver is actually responsible for crashing your system or that the root cause is in another module. Nonetheless it's suggested you look for updates for the products that these drivers
 belong to and regularly visit Windows update or enable automatic updates for Windows. In case a piece of malfunctioning hardware is causing trouble, a search with Google on the bug check errors together with the model name and brand of your computer may help
 you investigate this further. <br />

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>I've done every instructions and steps you've given me, Nothing has changed. I'm still getting the Blue screen.</p>
<p>I've realized that my most of my driver is nearly outdated, is there program that can help me update my driver or something like a "driver-update helper" that helps with my driver updates?</p>

<p>Cher, "driver updater" programs are, frankly, useless (and, often, bad in and of themselves, too.)&nbsp; Often they'll point you to a less-than current "latest" driver, sometimes they'll bring with them various cooties.&nbsp; My recommendation:&nbsp; steer clear, and find
 drivers yourself (typically, not too hard to do.)</p>
<p>Mouse drivers are easy:&nbsp; simply go to Razer's website, and download the latest driver/software package for the mouse.<br />
As to the other crash (ntkrpa.exe) - more often than not, crashes that point to that module (and, that cannot be traced past that point) are caused by antivirus other security software, rather than by a hardware device driver (or Windows itself, or a hardware
 (e.g. RAM) fault.)<br />
Question for you:&nbsp; what antivirus program (full name / version, if at all possible) are you running?&nbsp; What other security (anti-spyware, anti-malware, etc) are you running on that PC?</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Chris</p>

            Refer to your laptop manual for the restore-to-factory condition method or check on the laptop mftr.'s tech support website. Most machines of this type will get you into the Factory Restore process by having you press a function key (like F10 for ex.)
 when the computer starts up, but each computer make/model is different.

<p>My game does this as well. I've reset the app, reinstalled it, updated and reinstalled my graphic drivers, checked for numerous types of updates, updated windows 10, but minecraft still crashes after a couple minutes of gameplay, specifically while breaking
 blocks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The crash will lead to a black screen in which the cursor will display the loading icon. The mouse wont move, and the screen stays like this until I have to hard restart the computer.</p>

            I'm having the same issue and the generic responses don't help in the slightest. It worked a month ago when I setup a Bedrock realm for my kids and their friends, but now I can't load a local world at all. As soon as I load the world and it starts to appear,
 it freezes up and I have to do a hard restart of my computer. It locks so hard, task manager won't come up. A response from Microsoft / Mojang would be nice, and preferably not the generic "reinstall your video drivers" line. If I can run Ark with everything
 set to Ultra at 4k, I should be able to run Minecraft.

            Ditto here. I can start the game and play for only a few minutes until it hard freezes when I used to be able to run it for hours just a month ago with no crashes at all. Can run other much more advanced games with no problem, even the java edition does
 not crash for me, with much higher settings.

            Its the same over here too. What happens for me is the screen freezes and then it just closes. This happens when breaking blocks. Its annoying and ive turned off the computer, restarted it, and un installed and reinstalled minecraft itself. Nothing works

            it happens to me as well. I don't know of there's a fix for it now. but realms is doing fine for me. The offline world though repeatedly crashes, it also happens when I am breaking blocks. I still want to play offline if possible. So having to experience
 this issue is a no go for me.

            <p>Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users. This means, as long you upgrade within the first 12 months (July 29th 2015 to July 29th 2016), you will not have to pay for Windows 10 at all.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10.
<strong>Once you upgrade within the first year for free, its yours forever at no additional cost.</strong>&nbsp;As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">I heard Microsoft representatives mention they are moving to a servicing model for Windows 10, does that mean Windows 10 is going to require a subscription?</span></strong></p>
<p>No, Windows 10 remains a perpetual license, which means, you can upgrade to Windows 10 and use it forever without it expiring or going into any reduced functional mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Are you saying there will be no more versions of Windows after Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft is moving Windows to a servicing model with Windows 10. The days of major revisions or what are called big bang releases are no more. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><span>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device
</span><span>–</span><span> at no additional charge. With Windows 10, the experience will evolve and get even better over time. We’ll deliver new features when they’re ready, not waiting for the next major release. We think of Windows as a Service
</span><span>–</span><span> in fact, one could reasonably think of Windows in the next couple of years as one of the largest Internet services on the planet.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>And just like any Internet service, the idea of asking "What version are you on?" will cease to make sense
</span><span>–</span><span> which is great news for our Windows developers. </span>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Why is Windows 10 free, is there some catch?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>No, its not a catch. We are computing in different times. Windows 10 is free so app developers can standardize on one platform and reduce the fragmented market of different versions and editions of Windows that have been an issue in the past. When everybody
 is on the same platform, it means better quality apps, a healthier ecosystem and more advances in hardware and software innovation.

    <title>IP adresses to get Microsoft patches - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            IP adresses to get Microsoft patches</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
<br />
We need to restrict internet access of our&nbsp;Patch server to&nbsp;allow only those IP's&nbsp;used by MS Windows update to get the Windows update CAB file and the&nbsp;related patches. Is it possible to get the list of&nbsp;IP&nbsp;or class IP (not the URL's)&nbsp;used&nbsp;by MS to provide the
 above patch service ? Does anybody know if those IP's change frequently ?<br />
Thanks Regards&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hello, <br />
<br />
Sorry for not replying sooner. <br />
I am confused with IP's&nbsp;I got from Mr. TD. The MS URL we are currently contacting is:
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=76054kID=76054" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linhttp://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=76054kID=76054</a>&nbsp;which seems to be on the server go.microsoft.com (IP 207.46.16.233).&nbsp;This IP is not in the list&nbsp;provided by Mr. TD. Can&nbsp;anyone explain?&nbsp;Is it really possible to get
 the entire list of&nbsp;MS server&nbsp;IP, we need to contact to get MS patches ? Does anyone know if these IPs are changed frequently ?<br />
<br />
Thanks Regards&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>I know this is an old thread, but I just wanted to see if you had any luck isolating the IPs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a few KB/Community articles specifying the FQDNs required for Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is though, that some of the FQDNs specified have wildcard subdomains... IE:
<span><span>*.windowsupdate.microsoft.com</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In our application, we have servers that need to run updates. These servers are behind a fairly restricted network and have almost no Internet access. The firewalls that we're using do support FQDN based address objects
 (to use in policies) but they do not support wildcard FQDNs, so we can create an FQDN object for windowsupdate.microsoft.com but we cannot create an address object for *.windowsupdate.microsoft.com.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Any help would be appreciated!</span></span></p>

<p>Ken,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For whatever reason HP has eliminated a light for the number lock and I can't tell except by trying the numbers in a document if it is on or not.&nbsp; I searched for the software and don't remember where I got it.&nbsp;It is called &nbsp;"Keyboard-Led" and you run it
 and it will turn on the number pad or caps lock.&nbsp; It has a panel that shows what it has turned on.&nbsp; In my case the number lock does nothing by itself but this program did turn on the number pad.&nbsp; Once turned on the program can be closed and whatever you used
 stay in effect.</p>

            <p>Thanks for everyone's input, but as I said before it was not with the Numbers Lock key. My Keyboard had a light that showed this function on or off....</p>

</p><p>That said I did find the solution to my two problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked Cortana, and it led me to a fix for the same problem with Windows 8.1!&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently it (Windows 10) preset a setting under Ease of Access that had to do with settings under my mouse! It turned on a button that allowed my Numbers keypad to move the
 cursor around the screen. Apparently in order to use this function of using the keypad as a mouse it disabled the numbers function! Obviously don't need this turned on if you have a mouse! So I was looking for a fix on my keyboard, when it was a settings function
 for my mouse under Ease of Access! Yea for Cortana!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the problem I had with my mouse and left&nbsp; double clicking not opening my folders turns out to be solved by halving the rate set under Windows 10 (It was set to Max). Slowing down the rate made the left side as my primary work again.</p>

<h2>            want family safety settings without microsoft account tracking</h2>
                    Does Windows 10 allow me to set up family safety, or even to add a family member that I can monitory locally, without setting up a Microsoft account, or associating it with an account? This tracking is maddening.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately you don't have an option to setup family safety with a Microsoft account. It is mandatory to have Microsoft account, because when you add a child to your family, you'll get regular activity report emails to your Microsoft account, summarizing
 how much time the child spent on the PC, the websites they visited, the games and apps they used, and the terms they've looked up in search engines like Bing, Google, or Yahoo! Search.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once your child has been added to your family with a Microsoft account, you’ll be able to set up appropriate website and app and game restrictions for their age, set PC time limits, and review their recent activity. Their settings will apply to any
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> device that they sign in to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/set-up-family-after-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Set up family features on Windows&nbsp;10 </a><span>to learn more on Family Safety. You can also create
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/create-a-local-user-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Local accounts </a>without need of Microsoft account for your child. But you don't get an option to monitor their activities and power to restrict them from accessing websites or apps.</span></p>

<h2>            AMD driver 15.2  will not function &#40;Windows 10 from windows 8.1&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Let me start out with this is and Out of the box Hard drive, the only windows on it was windows 8.1 which right after completion was upgraded to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The gpu has been RMAed and replaced within&nbsp;the last 3 months and has not been used&nbsp;till I was doing this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system specs are</p>
<p>MB: Asus m5a97 r2.0<br />
CPU: Fx 8320<br />
RAM:&nbsp; 16 GB corsair vengeance (2x 8gb)<br />
PSU: Corsair 600 watt<br />
GPU: HIS Iceq Radeon HD 7870 (fresh replacement)<br />
OS: Windows 10 64 bit (Fresh install)</p>
<p>For some reason the drivers new 15.12 drivers where stabile for about 5 days.&nbsp; To which after that the computer was idling and crashed giving the Thread stuck in device driver error.&nbsp; After that I could not get back into windows.&nbsp;&nbsp; I then booted to safe
 mode was able to get deleted the device driver via device manager and I could get back into windows using the VGA basic adapter ( there is not display on the MB)&nbsp; upon trying to install the drivers again once windows was operating fine, the error produced
 again this time I reinstalled windows.<br />
After re installing windows, I installed the display drivers it said successfully installed then on restart I couldn't access windows.&nbsp; I booted to safe mode go in that way used AMD utility to uninstall AMD drivers.&nbsp; Tried to re install again they wouldn't
 take would only give the Error message. <br />
This made me install an older version of the AMD drivers after using DDS driver (from guru3d) uninstaller utility in safe mode. The computer was working fine graphics was working fine for a few hours.&nbsp; After that I got a crash with a black screen and could
 no longer access windows again. <br />
I freshly reinstalled windows again.<br />
upon finish downloaded 15.12 driver said it installed successfully<br />
Created a restore point after a successful boot, but noticed catalysis control wasn't accessible.&nbsp;
<br />
Tried to reinstall 15.12 again and got an error message.&nbsp; <br />
anytime I boot now I get the device is not function correctly in device manager and the catalysis control center tells me there is No&nbsp;AMD driver or the drivers are corrupt on the system weather I use 15.12 or a previous version.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing I do seems to be fixing
 this issue including RMAing my video card.&nbsp; Is there something I may be missing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ran sfc /scannow that made windows&nbsp;unbootable after restart&nbsp;one if the times I had reinstalled windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Hi. You most likely (almost certainly) will not be able to activate windows with your current key. You'll most likely need to purchase a new license.

            It depends on how Windows 10 was originally configured on your computer.
<br />
<br />	If its a full retail store bought license online or offline, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a retail store bought Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a OEM preinstalled Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is NOT transferable to a new computer or motherboard.

<p>Okay so a couple other replies underneath say that since my original windows 8.1 was OEM and then I upgraded to windows 10 I will have a problem, but youre saying I wont?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Microsoft support to ask and they told me I would be fine but I dont think they heard me when i said my windows 8.1 was OEM originally</p>

            Sorry I should have asked that... they are right OEM you will have issues.
<br />Call MS again and then let them know OEM and see what they can do.
<br />Doesn't hurt to try.

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />(Not applicable to you) 
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />www.thewindowsclub.com/showkeyplus-product-key-finder
<br />
<br />Uninstall the key
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-wind...</a> 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this: 
<br />(Not applicable to you ends) 
<br />Contact Microsoft at <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>  through chat support. They would take control of your PC and activate(might need a proof of purchase) 
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

<p>So I called microsoft support for a second time, and they said I would be okay to do the trasnfer even after I specified it was originally an OEM version of Windows 8.1 then upgraded to windows 10. I should clarify I built the computer from scratch and bought
 the windows 8.1 OEM from Newegg, it wasnt preinstalled. I ran "slmgr -dli" from the command line and it has the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Name: Windows(R), Core edition</p>
<p>&nbsp; Description: Windows9R) Operating System, RETAIL channel</p>
<p>&nbsp; (lists my partial product key)</p>
<p>&nbsp; License Status: Licensed "</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm fairly certain that means I would be good for a transfer, but I'm still not sure. Your help and reply is greatly appreciated&nbsp;</p>

            Oh, so what you have is actually an OEM System Builder Windows 8.1 license. You are more likely to get that reactivated than a royalty OEM license from a Dell or HP. 
<br />
<br />So, your chances are good.

<p>Thanks again Andre but at restart, windows showed me message which reported ungenuine copy...</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Another indication that I forgot to report you at beginning: this serial has been downgraded from a win 8 one. Can this interfere with activation?</p>

            <p>When you say downgrade, did the system originally come preinstalled with Windows 8/8.1 Pro and you used downgrade rights to downgrade it to Windows 7 Professional?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note, you need a unique Windows 7 Professional product key in order to activate Windows 7 Professional.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note that downgrade rights is only available to Windows 8/8.1 Pro, if its Windows 8/8.1 Single Language, you will have to provide your own Windows 7 Professional license in order to activate it.</p>
