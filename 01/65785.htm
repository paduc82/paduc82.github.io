    <title>External Hard Drive Not Launching - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> needurhelp_847  say:</h3>
<h2>            External Hard Drive Not Launching</h2>
                    After using the troubleshooting function to determine why my iomega external hard drive is being recognized but not launching, I received errors that the driver was not found and that there 'may' have been hardware changes.&nbsp;
<p>I have not had problems in the past accessing the drive on my windows 7 overlay for vista 64 bit.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I started using cc cleaner 2-3 months ago and am wondering if I have deleted files that the drive is attempting to access?<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>After returning to disk management, I see that I am receiving a message about partitioning...and also notice that the device is listed generically, and not by manufacturer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I selected master boot partition and attempted to format the drive, only to receive an I/O error.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Bug.</p>
<br />
What next?

            Hello,<br />
<br />
1. The 'safely remove hardware and eject media' is visible in the tray<br />
2.&nbsp; The iomega hdd usb 2.0 drive is visible on the 'devices &amp; printers' tab<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a.&nbsp; On the hardware tab for the iomega drive properties, the 'device status' states that it is working properly<br />
<br />
Despite the items above, a new/additional network drive is not launching in order to view the files on the external hard drive.&nbsp; When looking at the virtual disk manager, the hard drive is displayed as 'unknown - not initialized'.&nbsp; Upon attempting to initialize
 it, a generic error message 'the request could not be performed due to an I/O error' is received.<br />
<br />
When I right click the iomega icon and run 'troubleshoot', I receive the message that 'troubleshooting could not identify a problem'.<br />
<br />
Because the disk drive is not 'allocated', I am not able to manually map the drive.<br />
<br />
This occurs for both usb ports; however, I am able to use the ports to launch other external devices.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I do not have an alternate pc to test this item on.<br />
<br />
Please advise and check your future spelling.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
I was able to launch and view the files on a different PC.&nbsp; Therefore, it would suggest that Microsoft and Lenovo have an issue that needs to be resolved in order for the iomega external hard drive to work correctly with the lenovo ideapad running windows 7
 on a vista 64 bit overlay.<br />
<br />
Please advise.<br />

<h2>            How to push Store Apps to Devices &#40;not users&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run a network of Windows 10 and 7 devices for a K-12 environment. &nbsp;I am looking to push store apps to my devices (not to my users). &nbsp;All of my devices are shared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been able to set up my "Business Store" and select apps to push to users, but I have yet to find a way to push these to devices. &nbsp;All of our devices are domain joined. &nbsp;Our domain is currently 2008R2. &nbsp;All devices are 64bit Enterprise versions of
 Windows. &nbsp;We are a member of MIcrosoft's EES licensing agreement. &nbsp;Each of our users has a company owned Office 365 account. &nbsp;All users in 8th grade and above have email accounts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find that I am able to push the apps to users, but they only get a notification if they have email, and they still have to log into the store to retrieve the app. &nbsp;Since none of my younger users have email, they are not alerted to the app. &nbsp;This ignores
 the struggle of teaching a younger user how to 1. find the store, 2. create a microsoft account, 3. find the business store tab, 4. select and install the app, 5. repeat again tomorrow when they use a different device and have to recreate their profile. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do have SCCM 2012 installed, and this allows me to push "offline apps" but those are few and far between. &nbsp;The "Khan Academy" app in the store would be an ideal candidate to push, it's free, but does not have an "offline" option. &nbsp;How would I push this
 to 100 devices?</p>
                </div>

            <p>Years of watching computer systems get trashed by utilities that claim to fix all problems and make everything faster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trend started with a program called First Aid back in the days of Windows 95, and has been a moneymaker for anybody willing to scam computer users into believing that the utilities made anything better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just ran the online System Checkup from the System Mechanic website.</p>
<p>It tells me that:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;I have 263 registry problems. &nbsp;All of the problems are orphaned entries which are totally ignored. Windows 7 doesn't care if they are there or not</li><li>I have 21 repairable security vulnerabilities all of which Disk Cleanup wil fix because they are temporary Internet files. I get them every time I come to MS Answers or any website.</li><li>It suggests that I should run NetBooster to improve my Internet connection. I am on 20mb download here, and everything works faster than I can follow.</li><li>My hard drive shows signs of physical corruption, and it will not be able to fix it. The drive is in the first stages of going west. It has a read error which gets to the point where SMART can't give a fitness score, but it takes a few months to come back
 after a low level format.</li><li>Apparently, file clutter is a problem. Well, well.. a second mention of temporary Internet files..
</li><li>IE cache is at 50mb.. oh dear.. I have seen way worse</li><li>Waaaaaaah.. two broken shortcuts.. how will I live through tomorrow knowing this</li></ul>
<p>Of the 291 problems found, it says that 284 are CRITICAL and that my Overall System Status is POOR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Too funny. Anybody using this computer would think that it is their birthday. Absolutely everything works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All scare tactics, especially the registry and Temp Internet file claims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Mechanic wants $40 + tax&nbsp;such that they can set me up with problems in the future by removing registry entries, some of which may well render&nbsp;some processes to&nbsp;inoperative, and remove stuff that Windows Disk Cleanup can do for free. Do you consider
 that to be good value?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Re the hard drive problem, I downloaded WD diags for free and run that now and again to check for problems on all of my drives. It tells me that I have NO problems presently. Diags are available for all makes of drive, and always for free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Temporary Internet files can NEVER be completely removed because some are always in use, and I stated earlier, every time I hit a website, I get more or many of the same ones back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just because Dell put it on their systems doesn't make it good. Dell get paid to include this junk on each computer which goes out of their door.</p>

<h2>            modem ADSL light keeps blinking</h2>
                    
<p>once in awhile, my internet will work, but sometimes it stops working and says im not connected to the internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at my router and modem, and the ADSL light on my modem keeps blinking.&nbsp; I try to reset them both, by unplugging them, waiting 10 seconds,
 and pluging them back in.&nbsp; That only works once in awhile, but most of the time, about a few hours each day, i have completely NO connection to the internet, the boxes and my computers are fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've tried my internet on 3 computers that&nbsp;I have in my house.&nbsp;
 Is something wrong with the internet company then or what?&nbsp; I have some telephone company internet, no house phone, just the internet :P.&nbsp; If theres anything that i could do to fix it on my own could someone help me out?&nbsp; I would really appreciate it :).&nbsp;
 Thanks.</p>

<p><span>Hi Trevor Clapper,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What is the make and model number of your modem and router?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since the problem is seen in all the three computers, it would be best if you call your ISP provider and have them check the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, here are few checks you can perform.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Windows
 provides a built-in troubleshooter that can automatically find and fix some common connection problems. Here’s how you run it:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on the Start button and type troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on troubleshooting from the Control Panel search list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on “View All” in the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on “Internet Connections” to start the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Power
 down your ADSL equipment and computer for 20 minutes before attempting to connect again. Make a note of any errors you receive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Reset
 your ADSL Router to factory defaults. Refer the router manual for details.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Keep us posted on the same.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Note:</span></em></strong><em><span> Running the
 computer without firewall or the anti-virus software is a potential threat to the computer; make sure to enable the security software after completing the troubleshooting steps and after identifying the issue.</span></em></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 512 App Bug</h2>
                    Is there any update or fix for this absurd problem. All Apps doesn't show all applications. I know there was a bug limiting Start to showing 512 apps.

            <p>I didn't realize my query had been answered... Actually there are many apps I'm trying to access. In some cases, the app is in the start &nbsp;menu, but doesn't respond when clicked. In most cases, there are apps installed (i.e., their executables and support
 files are on the hard drive in the appropriate place, where they worked in the previous OS) but they don't show up on the start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This bog is being documented and commented all over the internet. Clearly it's a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is when will Microsoft fix it? Since you have essentially removed the ability to customize the start menu in any meaningful way, you have similarly removed the ability to repair and/or adjust it. I can't just drag a shortcut to the appropriate
 place on the menu, or access the folder easily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really, really bad decision here...&nbsp;</p>

            According to 'winver' what build of Windows 10 are you running?&nbsp; My loose understanding - I'm not on that team - is that this was already fixed in the Fall update (1511 / 10586).

<p>
</p><p>According to Get-StartApps | measure, I have 584 apps. And a lot is missing and always has been missing from the start menu search. In example, Windows Update doesn't appear in the search, so I've pinned it on the start menu instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's said it should have been fixed by now... So could it be that I have to do some sort of re-indexing to make search work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly I don't have the time and will to do a complete reinstall, I'll rather just use Start10 or something else that works.&nbsp;</p>

            The most important thing to start with is what version of Windows 10 you are using according to "winver".&nbsp; Windows 10 10240 is more limited here than the later Fall Update (10586).&nbsp; And Start Menu stability in general gets better as you go along, and should
 be further improved in the new Anniversary Update that came out Tuesday.

            <p>Thanks. I am currently on the fall update, 10586.494. I have not been offered the Anniversary Update through the regular Windows Update yet, so I am awaiting that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow I feel that this problem would probably need some sort of re-indexing of the start menu apps even after the 512-app limitation is (or was) raised...? Most discussion threads I've seen on the problem appear to be old and abandoned, so there may be
 some known information I have missed. With a clean reinstall I would most likely not reach anywhere near 512 apps however if there is a way to re-index the start menu apps I would prefer to try that instead. Especially at work, where I'd rather buy a new machine
 than use production hours on reinstalling.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Minecraft Windows 10 Redeem Code Does Not Work - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Minecraft Windows 10 Redeem Code Does Not Work</h2>
                    <p>I have recently found out about the new Minecraft, windows 10 edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I logged in to my Mojang Account and and clicked on the 'claim' button. I closed my browser when it got to the part that you have to log in to our Microsoft Account. (this was before getting windows 10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next day I got the new windows and logged back in to my Mojang Account. this time it had it said 'redeem' but it also said that I had claimed it the day before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on the redeem button and another window opened. It had already typed in my gift code and it was checking it. After a few seconds, while still showing the loading sign, a writing would come under the box where you wrote the gift code. It would say:
 "Sorry, an unexpected error has occurred. The error has been recorded and we will investigate. Please try to redeem your code later."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I have tried to redeem the code for a few days now and it still has not worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!!!!!! please,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Arshia</p>

            <p>I was just like you guys and then I tried this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;reset the App store, open the run bar and type "<strong>WSReset.exe</strong>" and hit enter to reset the Microsoft App store.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;once the app store window pops up, to the left of the search bar is the profile button (stick figure head), click it and make sure it is the same email for Microsoft account that you used when you clicked "Redeem" from your Mojang account screen.
 &nbsp;If it is, skip to step 7. &nbsp;If it's NOT then proceed to step 3.<br />
3. &nbsp;click the email address</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;another window will pop up and say Account with that same email address, click the email again and click sign out.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;now it will bring you back to the App store window and you will see that same profile button with a little +, click it and click Sign in and then click Microsoft account.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;another window will pop up and ask you for your info, just type in the same email address and password you used when redeeming from Mojang account page and click sign in.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;once signed in to the correct Microsoft account, click the profile button again and find "Redeem a code" and click that.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;another window will pop up and there you will be able to enter the code from your Mojang account page, just copy and paste it into the box and then click Redeem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if all went well, it will pop up saying that you are now the owner of Minecraft Windows 10 Edition Beta!! &nbsp;Yay!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope this helps everyone!</p>

            <p>That's easier said than done only because network troubleshooting is extremely complex and advanced. This post was evidently taken from a long discussion somewhere else. In any case, I believe at the time, I was trying to browse my 3 home computers via the
 Network icon in Windows Explore and saw [PC name] is currently unavailable. Below is what finally worked to resolve that, and it had nothing to do with my finding out the&nbsp;<span>In the&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Internet or network address</strong>&nbsp;box

            Windows has never had that ability, so you'd need to download whatever program you used to use to do that.

    <title>Future XP Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sdculp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Future XP Updates</h2>
                    Regardless of what I may do with future versions of Windows, I will keep XP going in one of my computers for the foreseeable future in order to be able to work with data and software which may be incompatible with later versions.<br />
<br />
My hard drives are partitioned so that the OS is in it's own partition.&nbsp; The version is Sp. 3 and all updates are installed.&nbsp; I keep C: backed up with Acronis, Macrium Reflect and EaseUS Todo but there is always that unforeseen situation where a complete install
 is necessary.<br />
<br />
In the case of a clean install after XP is no longer supported, how can I obtain or install the updates?&nbsp; For instance, can the update files, which I assume are $....$ be preserved and installed?&nbsp; If so, how?<br />

            <blockquote>Thanks for all the information.&nbsp; I'll file this away for possible future use.&nbsp; I didn't perform any downloading just yet, because more files will presumably be added to the download before the support actually ends.<br />
<br />
Just to make sure I have the instructions correctly, go to the "Windows Updates Downloader" page, click on "Update Lists", scroll down to Windows XP Service Pack 3, x86 and download the file.&nbsp; Then executing that file should update the machine with all updates???<br />
<br />
Correct?<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />
</blockquote>
Not exactly...<br />
&nbsp; <br />
If you are going to utilize the Windows Update Downloader, you have to follow their directions for use.&nbsp; Which is essentially downloading/installing, running, choosing to get a new Update List (from within the program) and that will open a web browser taking
 you to a place where you can choose the Windows XP SP3 download and it will 'install it' or open it with the Windows Update Downloaded and then you can choose everything or get picky about what you want to download through its simple interface and start the
 download.&nbsp; Then you will go to the download location and you will see a directory structure created with all the downloaded files in it.&nbsp; That ~975MB (right now) is what you would want to file away for future use.<br />

</p>
<p>Perform the steps mentioned below and check if it helps:</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
<p>Flight Simulator X: Using a Joystick</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Step 2: </strong><br />
Usually, Windows vista /7 will find and automatically install the necessary drivers when you plug your game controller into your computer.
</p>
<p>a) Connect the Joystick to the USB port through the adapter.</p>
<p>b) See if it gets detected.</p>
<p>c) Windows should recognize the new hardware and set it up to work properly.</p>
<p>If not install the relevant drivers for joystick for the manufacturers website.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 3:</b></p>
<p>I suggest you to follow these steps and check for the device.</p>
<p>1. In Control Panel, open <b>Game Controllers</b>. To do this, use one of the following methods:</p>
<p>a. Click <b>Start</b>, type<b>joy.cpl</b> in the <b>Start Search</b> box, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>2. Click your <b>game controller</b>, and then click <b>Properties</b>.</p>
<p>3. On the <b>Test</b> tab, test the game controller to verify functionality.</p>

<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!<br />
<br />
To understand the issue better, please let us know the details mentioned below<br />
a)&nbsp;Is this a wireless mouse?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the drivers from the device manager and check whether it helps. To do so, please follow the steps below.<br />
<br />
Click on start &gt; type in devmgmt.msc, enter &gt; right click on the mouse device and then click on uninstall and restart the computer.<br />
<br />
Once you restart the computer then try reinstalling the drivers. <br />
<br />
I would also suggest you to download the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website and install the same on the computer.<br />
<br />

Thank you very much for your quick response!<br />
I am sorry to specify that I am not using a Mouse, rather NoteBook's Trackpad and built-in Keyboard. I can make it clear a bit more in this way when I type something in web browser window or any application, cursor suddenly jumps into some other paragraphs
 If I type something on screen!<br />

            To get a new code you would have to contact the retailer you purchased it from to see if they will exchange it. Otherwise, you can try contacting support to see if there is anything they can do, but generally the only other thing you can do is try to guess
 the missing digits.&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/contact-us</a>

            I know if you bought it from Gamestop you can take it back and they can scan it to see if its been used and if not they can give you another one.

            Check over the card one last time and if you still cant find a code, contact the store or person you brought it from and ask about it. Maybe bring it into the store for them to check, i may of been used somehow.

<p>I'm away from my console at the moment so I can't try it out for sure, but if I remember correctly, if you hover near the top of the screen with your mouse there is a mute button. Try clicking that and testing it again</p>

            Hi kcris62
<br />
<br />Those files must have come from an iPhone or iPad, they are not image files
<br />
<br />An AAE file contains edits made to an image using the Photos app on an iOS device rather than the actual image itself

<h2>            Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens - does not successfully launch for all xbox 360 accounts</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p><p>I purchased&nbsp;Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens for my sons from Xbox Live for Christmas. My sons' xbox accounts do not have xbox live but my account does. After downloading the game Christmas eve, it launched fine for my account but from either of my sons accounts it will not launch. There aren't any error codes in the message.</p><p>At first I thought the game did not fully&nbsp;download properly so I deleted the game from the xbox 360, opened storage and deleted all entries from Games and Apps that referenced the&nbsp;Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens game and then redownloaded the game again. This did not fix the issue.</p><p>I read on the Xbox&nbsp;forums about how to delete the Xbox 360 system cache. So i did this and tried launching the game from one of my son's xbox accounts and it still fails.</p><p>Please advise how i can correct this issue.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Brian</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>

                    I have purchased the FULL version of Windows 7 and want to do a clean install on my computer. I currently have Windows XP but neither the 32bit or 64bit disk will start the install process. When using the start menu-&gt;my computer-&gt;D drive option to start
 the EXE file, the disk is not showing. Can anyone help me?

            Well, I have found the problem and answer. After 4 hours of restarting my computer and trying both disks, I had 2 successful installation starts on the 32 bit that failed halfway through and got the installation process on 64 bit to read but not start
 because of corrupt files. It is very apparent that both disks have bad or missing information and I had to get Microsoft to send me new disks in the mail. It's a bummer that I got stoked to have this installed this weekend and now have to wait "3-10 business
 days" for working disks". Hopefully the windows 7 experience is much better then this since I've been waiting to have the OS since it was announced.

<p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As the dump file is kernel memory dump file. Please note that it records only the kernel memory. This speeds up the process of recording information in a log when your computer stops unexpectedly.
 You must have a pagefile large enough to accommodate your kernel memory. The page file must be on the boot volume. Otherwise, a memory dump cannot be created. Before we provide any suggestions, I would like to confirm few things:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Could you please elaborate the statement: I got a very strange thing my Surface Pro Memory Dump when I turn on it everytime, but It don't happen if I just reboot after turn on?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Are you getting blue screen while booting or while using Windows? </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Which version of Windows 10 are you using? </p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Meanwhile you can try the steps provided in the article:
<span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/bug-check-0x9f--driver-power-state-failure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Bug Check 0x9F: DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE</span></a>
<span>&nbsp;</span>(based on the dump files analyzation). </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We await your reply.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Regards,
</span></span></p>

<p>Hi, Naresh</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, sorry my English isn't so good, so let me explain more detail for you:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. My Surface get blue screen when I turn off it&nbsp;(Just sometime not happen every time)&nbsp;, but it wouldn't happen when I using or rebooting it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.The memory dump just happen after I press power button but before Windows login, it just take more time to check system (Only show Surface logo) than usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3.It wouldn't happen again if I rebooting it&nbsp;immediately&nbsp; or turn off and turn on again, because I check the dump file the last modify time still first time I turn on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.I don't remember OS detail version (Just Win10_Pro_64_1809), I will check it when I come home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever, thanks for your suggest and give me the guide link.</p>
<p>I'm not a IT specialist but I will try to understand more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTY, can you download my Dump file form my share link?</p>
<p>I can upload more if it's very useful for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

<p><span><span>Hi, </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for writing back. I appreciate your time and patience. </span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>In that case, I would suggest you to </span><span>uninstall all the network drivers and then turn off update drivers from Windows update. To turn off the driver update from Windows, please follow the steps mentioned below:
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press<strong> Windows key + Pause Break</strong></span>. This will open system properties.
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">From the left pane, click on <strong>System protection.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select the <strong>Hardware</strong> tab. Click on <strong>
Device Installation Settings</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>No (your device might not work as expected).</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Restart the PC and check if the issue persist.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><ol>
</ol>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Now go to manufacturer’s website and download the drivers from their website. Now install the drivers and it should work fine.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note: </strong>Please download the drivers before and save them on an external drive or on hard drive as you will lose internet connectivity after you uninstall the network drivers. You can also use an external computer to download the drivers
 and then transfer it to this computer.</span></p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The logs were created as there was an unexpected shutdown due to blue screen. You can learn more about it here:

<h2>            Can&#39;t install WinHlp32.exe for Windows 7 Sp 1, getting constant error 0x80073afc</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 7 Sp 1 64-bit Ultimate edition.</p>
<p>Last update installed NONE, Read bellow.</p>
<p>I have been trying for days to install the windows help program and I just keep getting that same error 0x80073afc. Some times I get a dialog box that says&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"Some updates were not installed" "Update for
 Windows (KB917607)" and sometimes the installer doesn't even start and returns the error&nbsp;</span>0x80073afc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the windows update troubleshooter and a clean boot and re-downloading ten times or more the program from&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917607/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917607/en-us</a> and
 still nothing works. I still get the same dialog box or error.</p>
<p>I have read this solution but it didn't work either.&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_update/cant-install-kb917607-winhelp-viewer-error/4ef3709a-987b-4c65-825d-4967b5c90799?rtAction=1399659699239">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_update/cant-install-kb917607-winhelp-viewer-error/4ef3709a-987b-4c65-825d-4967b5c90799?rtAction=1399659699239</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Naturally I have my windows update turned off because it has ALWAYS caused me a lot of problems, it ALWAYS sends me to a never ending loop "Preparing to configure windows..."</p>
<p>When I try to update windows manually I ALWAYS get this errors: 80073712 80070643 and 9C57 and it fails to install any update at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be really appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks for the idea.</p>

</p><p>I just try to install all other 75 important updates but for some reason it also generates errors. (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">80073712 80070643 and 9C57) I honestly don't get windows update, they want us to install them, but they

</p><p><em>Assuming Win7 (64-bit) SP1...</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious] <em>diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting my post: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase <em>the computer?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Did Win7 64-bit come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it, did you do a clean install of Win7,
<em>or did you upgrade the computer to Win7? </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em> What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed? What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer
<em>since you bought it</em>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">when</span> you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>5a. Is KB2964444 &amp; KB2936068, KB2922229; KB2929961 and/or KB2930275 listed in <strong>
Installed Updates </strong>(<em>not</em> <strong><em>Update History</em></strong>)? [1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>5b. When (exact date, preferably) did you last run the Windows Update troubleshooter? [2]</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. <em>Assuming Java is installed =&gt; </em>Is <strong><em>Java Version 7 Update 55</em></strong> (or higher) installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://java.com/en/download/uninstallapplet.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://java.com/en/download/uninstallapplet.jsp</a></p>

</p><p>7. Is Adobe Flash Player <strong>v13.0.0.206</strong> (or higher) installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>8a. Is Internet Explorer 8 (IE8), IE9, IE10 installed? </p>
<p>
</p><p>8b. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; Glary Utilities; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC;

<h2>            Being Harressed because of gamertag </h2>
                    
<p>First day on Xbox Live was yesterday and I'm already getting harassed about my accent and my gamertag which is also my real name! So it's disturbing when people use my name in that way and to curse me and my accent.I cannot afford a gamertag change.&nbsp;I was
 told to come on here and post by a Xbox Live support member.<br />
my gamertag is Naavaayy.</p>

<p>First thing, welcome to XBL now with that being said there are those people out there who happen to be ignorant and unintelligent. I think for those who make fun of others despite gamer tag, someones race, etc. are people who lack any sort of education and
 have nothing better to do than harass people online, simply because they have no lives or live at home with mommy and daddy in there basement. Unfortunately there isn't awhole lot that can be done, just mute them or block those who are and keep in mind there
 are those who want to make new friends and aren't going to harass you.</p>

<p>If someone sends you a message and you don't want to receive more from them just go to that message then select "block communications" and you won't get any more from that user. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>If they are annoying you with their in-game voice you can select their gamertag then select the option to mute them. You won't hear their voice again.</p>
<p>If you feel their behavior warrants a report to the Xbox Live Policy Enforcement Team, you can file an appropriate complaint against them and the team will evaluate your complaint and act accordingly.

<p>One more tip, you can also submit a bad player review against them. This willl make it harder for you to match up with them again.</p>

<p>Don't mind the people who say anything about it. :) Just Mute/Block them.</p>
