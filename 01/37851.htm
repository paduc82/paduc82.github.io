<h2>            Windows 10 error 0xc00000e9 winload.exe</h2>
                    <p>I own a HP 4600 workstation with 256GB SSD, 8GB mem and 3.0 Ghz processor.</p>
<p>Worked like a dream with win7 prof, 64 bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After upgrading to Windows 10 64 bit, everytime at booting this happens:</p>
<p>blue screen, indicating unexpected error 0xc00000e9.</p>
<p>c:\windows\system32\winload.exe. &nbsp;and the known story about problems with a removable storage device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>system freezes, function F8 and return do not react.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After hitting CTRL ALT DEL the computer reboots with no problems. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried almost all written suggestions, including all Bootbcd commands, but to no avail.</p>
<p>Would you have any suggestions? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear JohnRod,&nbsp;</p>
<p>given the fact that I have posted my question on februari 19, I have gotten used to my little workaround: &nbsp;after switching on my computer I wait until the HP screen appears and then i press CtrlAltDel. after that the computer boots without problems. This
 leads me to believe that there is a kind of timing problem between the SSD I Installed, and the boot process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In reply to your questions: </p>
<ul>
<li>It happens every time I switch on the computer (cold boot).</li><li>I installed a Crucial M4 256GB SSD when I still was running Windows7. It worked like a dream.</li><li>Before upgrading to Windows 10 I upgraded my memory from 6 to 8 Gb.</li><li>After upgrading to Windows 10, in december 2015, &nbsp;the problems started.</li></ul>
<p>I have read carefully everything written on this subject in this forum, and have tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>switching off &nbsp;fastboot in the energy settings</li><li>Checked for Driver updates for the hardware (AHCI 1.0 serial SATA controller)</li><li>Checked for driver updates for Microsoft Storage controllers ACPI X64-PC</li><li>disconnected and reconnected all USB connectors one by one, with cold boots in between. &nbsp;nothing worked.</li><li>After first installing the SSD, I found out I could not enable AHCI in the Bios. With &nbsp;AHCI in the Bios enabled, the computer would not boot. &nbsp;I was told &nbsp;AHCI is important for a SSD, but it requires editing the register. So I edited the register, as per
 instructions I found in the internet, and was able to enable AHCI ánd boot the computer. But that was before upgrading to Windows 10.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;So, everything to no avail. &nbsp;I keep thinking that there is some kind of a "timing problem" where the boot process does not properly see the SSD. &nbsp; &nbsp; What do You think?</p>
<p>Kind regards, </p>
<p>Pieter&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I find the way to fix it !!! I try to use older windows 10 version . That's from Jan 2016 &nbsp;! Then , I update for the last version of windows 10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It &nbsp;work perfect with me ! I don't know why :))) Version 1511 (OS build 10586.679) I think you should to try that version! Now , I'm updating to the last version to check Winload problem . It's oke with version 1511. Waiting for me to check the last version

<p>
</p><p>I'm not good in English . I just find the way to fix it. Thanks&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Edited&nbsp;<br />
After updated to the lasted version (version 1607&nbsp;(OS build 14393.447) ! My computer is working without Winload.exe ! It's Work&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Step 1 : Find and Download Older Windows 10 version ( (Under) Version 1511 (OS build 10586.679)) and install or ghost (When finish ! we can shutdown and power on to check winload.exe problem ( I have tried in 3 PCs HP xw4600 and it work ))<br />
</p>
<p>Step 2: After install new windows 10 . Check for updates in Setting to update the last version . Sometimes It just update driver but It don't update to the last version of windows ( continue step3 )&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Step 3: If your computer don't auto update. You search Windows 10 upgrade assistant =&gt; update to the last version!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Good luck&nbsp;<br />

    <title>OneNote Integration with Outlook Calendar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote Integration with Outlook Calendar</h2>
                    <div>
<p>One incredibly useful feature to have would be to integrate OneNote pages into Outlook Calendar, with or without Cortana. I'm assuming this is possible for you guys since you acquired Wunderlist. (P.S. I'm submitting this suggestion to Windows Feedback and
 Wunderlist separately). [This is for both phone and PC, but I can't select both, so...]</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>I'll give you an example.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>Say, you tell Cortana, "Hey Cortana, I need to make a list of Medicines to buy to complete by the 30th of this month."</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>So, Cortana asks the items on the list, and makes a page in a section called "Reminder lists" in the user's OneNote Notebook. This is also affixed to a calendar event that Cortana Makes, on a calendar of the user's choice (I think making a separate calendar
 for this isn't beneficial). Now, one can append and modify the list from OneNote, and change the date from the calendar.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>As we complete tasks on the list, we can fill the check-boxes in OneNote. Probably Cortana integration could come in there too. I could say "I've finished Aspirin 20 tablets from list Medicines to buy" and Cortana would tick the checkbox.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>Now, on the day, we have a reminder about our list from Cortana or calendar, with three options: Snooze, Show, Completed. If we select "Completed", all the checkboxes would get checked, and the list is marked as complete. If Snoozed, it shows up again.
 If asked to show, the items which are remaining on the list alone are shown.</div>
                </div>

    <title>Usb Mouse Report Rate Frequency &#91; Win 8.1 &#93; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blebadef lurdan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Usb Mouse Report Rate Frequency &#91; Win 8.1 &#93;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have Windows 8.1 64 bit and would like to install the update KB2908279.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the update process does not succeed.&nbsp; The error message states that it is not applicable to my computer, as I have illustrated below.<br />
<br />
The current system wide mouse report rate setting of 125Hz introduces much greater mouse pointer latency to the workspace than in previous versions of Windows.<br />
<br />
The Hz report rate value is essentially the resolution of the mouse.&nbsp; I have a standard usb mouse that works at 1000Hz in WindowsXP SP2, and now in Windows 8.1 64bit it is limited to the dumb 125Hz setting.<br />
<br />
That is the reason I would like to install the update KB2908279, in order to find out if I can get some rightful functionality.<br />
<br />
A user friendly control panel interface would allow easy adjustment of the report rate value for all the people with a higher resolution mouse that can go well beyond the 125Hz Windows 8.1 setting.<br />

<h2>            WIndows 10 Pro &#40;64 bit&#41; - UK Version</h2>
                    I recently purchased Windows 10 Pro (64bit) from Amazon.&nbsp; After installing it I found out it apparently is an international (UK) version.&nbsp; I want to know if this version has all the features of the US version (or if it has some limitations).&nbsp; If this UK
 version does not have full functionality, how can I install the US version without having to reinstall all other applications?<br />

<p>Hi Tony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Windows 10 Pro (64bit) UK version should have all the features of the US version. There will only be a slight difference in the localization such as time and date format and spelling in the user interface (color vs. colour). Since you are using the
 Pro version, you should be able to change the system language and default keyboard to English (US) should you desire. For more information, you may refer to the following link:

            <p>There are several ways you can fix this: </p>
<p>You can copy the files from a Windows XP SP2 computer and then Windows Remote Desktop should work again.
<br />
a. mstscax.dll</p>
<p>b. mstsc.exe</p>
<p>Copy the files in safe mode otherwise windows will just recreate the files even if you replace them or delete them
<br />
<br />
Or you can download an update from the Microsoft download site and it will get your Remote Desktop working again.
<br />
Update for Windows XP (KB969084) - The Remote Desktop Connection 7.0 client update enables you to use the new Remote Desktop Services features.<br />

<h3> danae72  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I click inside Start Menu&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For the past 2 days, I can't click on anything in the Start Menu. The Menu itself opens fine, but nothing inside is clickable. It is fine if I restart the computer, but within an hour or so (sometimes even sooner) the problem returns. The only problem so
 far, at least that I've noticed, is with the Start Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have only just noticed that if I open the Start Menu and it is unresponsive, I can use the arrow keys and it unblocks, and then the mouse works as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried sfc scannow and reinstalling windows apps, but that didn't work. I also updated my drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions? I would prefer NOT creating a new user account and lose all my customization. Same with refreshing. That will be absolute last resort for me.</p>

            <p>I want to wait a bit before trying this. Last night, the start menu remained useable and I want to see if it keeps up. The computer had been in use and has been restarted since the last troubleshooting attempt, so either it took a while for one of them to
 kick in, a windows update snuck in (I don't think so and haven't checked) or it's just taking longer to freeze out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will come back if issue remains cleared, or to report result of last suggestion if problem comes back. I will likely wait a few days to be absolutely sure if it keeps working.</p>

            <p>Okay, this morning was the first time the start menu contents weren't 'clickable' but something else strange happened seemingly related to it. When I tried to open Links, the menu would only open in miniature at the top left corner of the screen. Also, right-clicking
 on icons in the system tray was more hit and miss (usually miss) on if it would open the context menu. Then when I wanted to restart my computer is when I found I couldn't click inside the start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I try the last suggestion, I want to make sure this will not alter my computer/files in any way. Reinstalling the apps caused a massive headache, what with program defaults being changed and errors along with it.</p>

            <p>It won't alter your files in any way. The <strong>DISM</strong> command will only perform a more thorough scan on your computer than the previous command you've ran which is the
<strong>System File Checker Tool</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> While the running DISM command, you will notice the process will seem stuck at 20% or 40%. But it's a normal behavior. It may take a while and the operation will finish as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted with the outcome of this troubleshooting step.</p>

<h2>            Volume defaults to 50&#37; of what it is set to using taskbar.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a problem with my sound that I cannot seem to resolve. Although I am able to turn the volume up on my task bar (to 100, at the loudest), my laptop (or Windows?), by default, seems to be resetting my volume at 50% of that. For example, if I set the
 volume in the task bar to "80," the icon on my laptop screen indicates that the volume is "40." If I set the task bar to the maximum of "100," the icon on my laptop screen reads "50," and so on.</p>
<p>My "maximum" of 100 (according to the task bar, yet 50 according to my laptop screen icon) is not very loud at all. I have tried trouble shooting using Windows Fixit, which found no problems with any aspect of my sound.</p>
<p><a href="http://premium1.uploadit.org/painther//volumeissue.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Here is a screen shot</strong></a>&nbsp; of the issue I am experiencing, in case the description above was
 unclear.</p>
<p>Does anyone know why this is happening, and/or how to fix it? It didn't always used to be this way, and I know that I didn't change any of the settings...</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help, advice, suggestions, etc.</p>

    <title>Vista&#58; Disk Cleanup issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> b. maclean  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista&#58; Disk Cleanup issue</h2>
                    When I run Disk Cleanup, under the "Disk Cleanup" tab, in the "Files to delete:" box there are several file types, such as "Downloaded Program Files", "Temporary Internet Files", etc. to select and/or view.<br />
<br />
Problem: Under the "Downloaded Program Files" it shows "0 bytes", but when I press the "View Files" button, it shows several files within the actual folder. Also, under the "Temporary Internet Files" it shows "8.07 MB", but when I press the "View Files" button,
 it shows no files within the actual folder. Also, under the "Offline Webpages" it shows "65.5 KB", but when I press the "View Files" button, it shows no files within the actual folder. The "Recycle Bin" seems to be working correctly, at least the number of
 bytes matches what is actually in the Recycle Bin. The "Temporary files" seems to be not working also because although it shows 0 bytes, via Explorer I have seen several&nbsp;temporary files that still exist.<br />
<br />
It seems that the items are not "pointing" to the correct folders. A similar thing seems to be happening in Internet Explorer when I try to delete files using its "Delete ..." button, under "Internet Options". When I delete the "Temporary Internet Files" and
 then verify that it has actually happened by going to Desktop\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Temporary Internet Files, I see several (hundreds) files that are still in the folder.<br />
<br />
Any solutions? Thank you.

            Thank you very much John for your reply.<br />
<br />
I have done what you have suggested and there still seems to be a problem.<br />
<br />
FYI:<br />
More info, I have a Dell M1730, with Vista Ultimate. I now have 3 administrator accounts: Administrator, Brian, and Brian MacLean. I have checked all three accounts&nbsp;using both Explorer and the Disk Cleanup utility to see what each is "pointing" to. All 3 seem
 to have the same problem. When I open Explorer to look at the "Temporary Internets Files" and when I open&nbsp;Disk Cleanup&nbsp;to view&nbsp;"Temporary Internets Files", I see that, regardless of the account being used,&nbsp;each is "pointing" (looking at/showing) to something
 different. I believe this is not correct, but just to be sure, could you check your system to see if in fact that both of these utilities are "pointing" to the same "Temporary Internets Files" file folder.<br />
<br />
I have seen this same problem several years ago&nbsp;in XP once and manged to get it working correctly without re-imaging the system, but I cannot recall exactly what I did to fix it.&nbsp;Ironically, I have checked all of the folders around this folder to be sure&nbsp;that
 they are all&nbsp;"pointing" to the same folders and they are. I have taken a few screen-shots, but I have no way of attaching them to this reply so that I could show you exactly what I am seeing.<br />
<br />
Since the "Administrator" has this problem too, is it possible to delete this profile and recreating it. If yes, how?<br />
Then I was going to delete the other two accounts and then recreate one of them.<br />
If this doesn't correct the problem, then I will have to re-image the system.<br />
<br />
Also, what is the correct way to totally remove an account along with its profile, etc.<br />
<br />
Thank you again for your assistance.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Congratulations</span>.&nbsp; I think you took the right way out. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>87 pending ?</strong></p>
<p><strong>FYI</strong></p>
<p>My recommendation would be to install the updates in batches, such 5 at a time,
<strong>exclude hardware/driver updates.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Avoid installing a combination of Microsoft Windows and Office updates at the same time</strong>.
</p>
<p>Also, try installing the small updates first. </p>
<p><strong>Avoid installing things like .NET Framework and SQL Express Updates</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Restart each time you install the updates (its a chore, but it guarantees a more reliable experience</strong>).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try starting out with Microsoft Office Updates for programs such as (Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing, try downloading the updates then install them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When prompted to restart, disconnect from the Internet and restart your computer.</strong></p>
<p>Proceed with installing the additional updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the computer continues to become non-responsive, try the following:</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>You can reset Windows Update components by running the Fixit 50202 on this page.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, if there's malware present, it will continue to reset the connection to the update servers:</p>

<p>&lt;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</a>&gt;
</p>
<p>Suggest you download and save the Fixit. </p>
<p>Then configure the system to Clean boot prior to running it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista/Windows 7</p>
<p>&lt;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>&gt;
</p>
<p>Once the Fixit has been downloaded and the system booted to the Clean state, check to see that the native Windows firewall is now On if a 3rd party firewall was being used previously.
</p>
<p>Now run the Fixit and choose the Default mode. </p>
<p>Restart once it's done and see if the system can connect to the update servers.
</p>
<p>If it can not, then run the Fixit again and choose the <b>Aggressive </b>mode.
</p>
<p>Restart when it's finished running and check for updates.</p>
<p>I suggest before shutting down and installing any updates, disconnect from the Internet first.</p>

            Hi Jose, and Thanks for the help.
<div><br />
<div>Here's what I found:</div>
<div>Repeated attempts to install the&nbsp;KB898461 package failed... and the system would not move past this point to do further updating.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When i checked 'Programs' in Control panel and checked the box 'show updates', I found that the update existed already. &nbsp;Since the system kept trying to install it, I assume the one on my computer was corrupt, or incomplete.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I removed it using Control Panel and then tried to install the&nbsp;KB898461 package again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Success.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The system then moved on to the 87 or so updates pending...</div>

<h2>            How do I delete contacts that I don&#39;t know from &#39;People&#39; list</h2>
                    <p>I have half a dozen random people that my 'people list' on Windows 8 has added to my contacts.</p>
<p>All of them say they are a friend on Facebook - but I have never heard of them before. &nbsp;I have found them all on Facebook by searching for them but I cannot remember ever having seen their pages before.</p>
<p>Because they are apparently 'facebook connections' the 'people list' will not allow me to delete them.</p>
<p>It is rather irritating as my computer keeps telling me when their birthdays are etc.... I really just want to delete them - does anyone know how to override the 'facebook connection' bit so I can do this?</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

<br />
<br />Click Recovery then click Get Started under Reset this PC
<br />
<br />ImageSince we are performing a clean install, I will be selecting the option Remove everything, if you don't want to do that, you can click Keep my files
<br />
<br />Reset offers two types of clean installs:
<br />
<br />Just remove my files - this option is quicker and recommended if you just want a fresh start and you plan to keep the computer.
<br />
<br />Remove files and clean the drive - if you plan to giveaway or resell your computer, this option ensures the computer is cleaned properly. Its takes a bit longer, but it is recommended if you plan to no longer use this computer.
<br />
<br />Since I will be using this computer, I will choose the first option.
<br />
<br />Click Reset to begin
<br />
<br />Windows 10 will restart

<br />
<br />Choose your country, language, keyboard layout and time zone then click Next
<br />

<br />
<br />If you want to customize your privacy settings, you can do so now. Please note, you can always do this after setup (Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy). For now, lets use Use Express settings
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 restarts
<br />
<br />Don't be alarmed, this is just temporary
<br />
<br />Setup your username, password and a hint then click Next

<br />There you have it, a clean installation of Windows

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Hi Alice,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><span>As you have stated that on your windows 8.1 while trying to install an updates that your old optional updates are missing or removed.
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><span>To answer to your query that it might be possible that your optional updates get installed and are store in Installed Option in Windows. If not, then there are some optional update if you don’t update them within a certain
 period of time they get removed or deleted.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><span>I also want to let you know that </span></span>&nbsp;the installation of updates there would be certain changes made to the system file settings. As the system file settings are changed its effect would also reflect here on Installed
 Option in Windows update.</p>

<h2>            How to use File History to recover files from failed hard drive - Please help&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>My Original Hard drive failed, I have a file history backup on an external drive. &nbsp;I can see all of my files are there with the long&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">(2015_01_09
 04_57_38 UTC)</span>&nbsp;UTC code. &nbsp;I don't want to copy and past as all the files would keep the UTC extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a fresh install of Windows 10 on the new hard drive. &nbsp;I had a local account on my PC and my "new" hard drive PC configuration has a different username as I am using Microsoft account. &nbsp;I changed my PC name to match before my hard drive failed but the
 username is different. &nbsp;I tried changing the user folder name from the first few letters of my Microsoft account to my old username through many steps and the process was frustrating and it didn't work and I had to reinstall Windows 10 to fix it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would prefer not having to change my new user folder name to match the old name of the user file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried going to file history and the option to recover did not work as it would not find the external drive or the original backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I setup a new file history to try and trick the computer to find my old file history but no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need help in recovering my files (70,000 photos) from my old file history backup. &nbsp;I can't believe that this can be so hard (or user error). &nbsp;I wish that Windows 10 had an option to just recover from an older File history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>I've completely formatted my PC and reinstalled the same copy of Windows 10. I even bought a disc which i'm going to use to reinstall it tomorrow to see if it's a faulty download or something. But was hoping somebody might be able to point me in the right
 direction. Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us try these two methods and check if it helps in resolving the issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1.</strong> <br />
Perform a startup repair and check if it helps.<br />
Follow the articles for h elps on startuo repair.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7</a><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Startup-Repair-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Startup-Repair-frequently-asked-questions</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2.</strong><br />
You are required to perform a clean boot to find the service that is causing this and then disable or remove it.<br />
Here is the procedure to do it:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Clean Boot Troubleshooting:&nbsp; <br />
1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; User Account Control permission.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; password, Or click Continue.<br />
2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup items check box.<br />
4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
5. Click OK.<br />
6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the issue is resolved check which third party is causing the problem, referring the link given below:
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
8. Also you need to uninstall and reinstall the problem software on your computer.<br />
<br />
Once you have found the conflicting service, stop it. Boot to the computer and stop it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Stop this service now.<br />
a.&nbsp;Open the Control Panel in the Start Menu.<br />
b.&nbsp;Select Administrative Tools in the Control Panel. <br />
c. Open Services in the Administrative Tools window. <br />
d. Select the service and then click Stop in left column of the main window of the Services window.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Reset the computer to start as usual </strong><br />
<br />
9. After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
10. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.&nbsp;
<br />
11. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.

<p>Good day</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to purchase it for the Xbox one. As mentioned by Brad you might be able to get some of your old worlds downloaded to your One.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are going to purchase the game i would suggest you get the Bedrock Edition. With that you can play with gamers that play on Windows 10, mobile and Nintendo Switch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Ralfio,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your issue. Unfortunately, the game Minecraft has a Xbox 360 version and an Xbox one version. You will need to get the Xbox one version, however if the 360 worlds are saved to the cloud you might be able to recover some.
 On the game it does ask if you got 360 save want to use. As far as add on they most likely will not work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>
<p>
