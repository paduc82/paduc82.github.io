    <title>This camera is in use by another application. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicolegray  say:</h3>
<h2>            This camera is in use by another application.</h2>
                    <p>I have recently encountered a problem when attempting to broadcast my webcam over Tinychat. When I select the "Start Broadcasting" button my webcam activates, light turning green, however I get the error message "This camera is in use by another application."
 I can use my microphone, but it seems something is blocking my webcam from use otherwise. I have not had this problem until I upgraded from Windows 8 Pro&nbsp;to 8.1 Pro.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>System</strong></p>
<p>Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU E4500 @ 2.20GHz</p>
<p>RAM: 2.00GB</p>
<p>System type: 32-but Operating System, x64-based processor</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My webcam is a Microsoft LifeCam VX-1000. My LifeCam is fully supported by my windows and system. I have no other issues with it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried each of the following with no success:</p>
<p>1. unplugged webcam</p>
<p>2. reinstalled device and drivers</p>
<p>3. rebooted</p>
<p>4. performed a clean boot</p>
<p>5. closed any programs and apps that could be hijacking my webcam via the task manager</p>
<p>6. customized security levels for my trusted sites</p>
<p>7. inspected Adobe Flash, add-ons, and ActiveX Filtering</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am at my wits end. My webcam works with Skype, and works with Google Chrome. I downloaded Chrome in an attempt to isolate whether it was my device itself or my Internet Explorer. I entered Tinychat and was successfully able to broadcast my webcam via Chrome.
 I am not sure why Internet Explorer 11 is giving me such a hard time when Internet Explorer 10 did not. Any help for this aggravating issue would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

            <p>Hi Nicole, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like Windows compatibility center suggests that Microsoft LifeCam VX-1000 Webcam&nbsp;is not
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Microsoft%20LifeCam%20VX-1000%20Webcam&amp;vendor=Microsoft&amp;Locale=1033%2C3081%2C4105%2C16393&amp;BreadCrumbPath=microsoft%20lifecam%20vx-1000%20webcam&amp;LastSearchTerm=microsoft%2Blifecam%2Bvx-1000%2Bwebcam&amp;Type=Hardware&amp;tempOsid=Windows%208.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
compatible </a>with Windows 8.1. This could be one of the major cause of the issue as Internet Explorer could not make use of the device functionality.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to disable Enhanced Protected mode and check for the issue.</p>
<p><strong>How to disable</strong> <strong>Enhanced Protected Mode:</strong></p>
<p>a. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap Start, and then type <strong>
Internet options.</strong><br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, <strong>
move</strong> the mouse pointer down, click <strong>Start</strong>, and then type<strong> Internet options</strong>.)<br />
b. <strong>Tap or click</strong> Settings located under the search box to the right of the screen. Then, tap or click the
<strong>Internet Options</strong> icon located under the search results.<br />
c. In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> windows, tap or click the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab. Locate the check box
<strong>Enable Enhanced Protected</strong> Mode*.<strong> Tap or click</strong> to uncheck the box.<br />
d. Tap or click the <strong>Apply</strong> button, and then tap or click <strong>
OK</strong>. <strong>Restart</strong> Internet Explorer and check to see if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> These restrictions may cause issues with your browsing experience when using Internet Explorer. By disabling Enhance Protected Mode, your performance in Internet Explorer may improve but could leave you at risk for possible attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to change the security settings in Internet Explorer and check for the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I'm sorry, none of that seemed to address my issue. I do not even have "Enable Enhanced Protected Mode" selected in the Advanced tab. What has Internet Explorer 11 changed that makes Internet Explorer 10 capable of making my webcam work? Compatibility
 issues seems a bit unlikely to me, why would Internet Explorer 11 suddenly ditch compatibility with a Microsoft Device it previously had no issues supporting? The rest of my&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;has no compatibility issues, even&nbsp;Google Chrome does not.&nbsp;I have added Tinychat
 to my "Trusted Sites" and I have even toggled between adding the server verification to the address.

            <p>You`re not alone I am having this same issue with my LifeCamStudio and Tinychat. It will connect with my toshiba webcam even though I told it to connect with my lifecam and it will confirm that it has connected to the life came but then once I finally broadcast
 it`s broadcasting with my toshiba webcam so I disabled my toshiba webcam but that did not help. once I connected with my lifecam it would be stuck showing the load Icon on my video. So when I go to video settings to connect to my cam again it would give me
 that stupid error message. I think this issue has something to do with the Update Tinychat has added because before the update my LifeCamStudio would connect just fine...</p>
<p>This issue needs to brought to the attention to them that admin tinychat</p>

    <title>UUID Error and undetermined fix&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aslanpaul  say:</h3>
<h2>            UUID Error and undetermined fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So really what I am wondering is what went wrong and how to prevent in the future, a UUID error.</p>
<p>Initially from looking up the problem, I have a general idea of what a UUID is, as well as the RPC involved with winlogon processes and group policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing that separates my case from the usual is: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
The UUID error usually happens for new users when setting up, while <strong>my problem
</strong>occurred out of the blue after 6 months of perfect use.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Six hours go by (School), the UUID error is still showing from when I first noticed the problem in the morning (I can still log into my desktop mind you, but internet is not operational), so I decided to take some steps to resolve hoping to dear god I wouldn't
 have to re-install windows or configure the scary registry key in which I have no experience in formatting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-System Recovery: Settings crashed every time I tried to enter System Recovery,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the interesting part of it; I run a quick 2 step memory diagnostic out of the starting F12 options,</p>
<p>and at the end I connect to the internet from the Windows logon screen, and poof, like that, the problem is gone, like it was never there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is windows saying the only workaround is to modify that highly specific registry key,</p>
<p>or other sites telling me to re-install windows (Which is the solution to almost anything).....</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>My Question: </strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Since I am a repeat logger, and this error occurs really only for new users, what caused this? Why did this happen, out of nowhere?</li><li>How was this resolved? I ran a simple diagnostic and it's fixed instantly.. that or the internet fixed it which I doubt since Group Policy is local via registry. And windows telling me that the only way to fix this is to get specific with the registry (that
 is one scary place).</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I know, why not be "Happy" with how this miracle of what could've been a disaster? Well I want to know what happened, so I can prevent it, and I want to know how to fix it in case it happens again, and deal with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks! - Aslan Paul</p>

<p>But I can't change to it, it says the name is available when I check but when I try to change it gives me an error over Xbox live saying that it's taken, so what can I do?</p>

<p>My local GAME pricematch with regards to games, not sure about consoles though. They were offering an extra 33% trade when trading in a console towards another, alas, not sure whether this offer has finished now.

<p>I'm pretty sure the Halo 4 console offer ended on the 13th? I think the offer on at the minute is trade in an old style elite for a new one. Either way, Game should price match Cex but my local (Merry Hill) only offered to match trade and not cash prices.</p>

<p>They do as long as there is a CEX store is within a 1 mile radius of your Game store</p>
<p>From there website</p>

<p>i tried this with my local CEX (doncaster) and they looked at me like i'd just sh!t on the counter when i asked for a printed reciept. CEX always give the best trade in price but i find that they rarely have the game what im looking for at that time.</p>

<p>The bugs are the only downside to this game as stated in many of its reviews. I always quickly read through a review before purchasing (with any game). Besides all open world games have bugs and glitches. Everyone knows that.

<h2>            Removing Outlook communications from Start menu search results</h2>
                    
<p>In Windows Vista's Start menu, there was a way to avoid showing Outlook content in the Start menu search results. I can't find an option like this in Windows 7. Is there any way to stop the Start menu from searching e-mails in Outlook?<br />
<br />
I can disable indexing in Outlook, obviously, but I want indexed&nbsp;search functionality to be available within the&nbsp;Outlook application.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

</p><p><span><span>Hi Minju, </span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community Forums.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>I understand that Internet Explorer crashed after installing the Windows Update. Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Please answer these questions to get more clarity on this issue:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>When exactly does Internet Explorer crash?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Which code did you execute when you say “when I execute this code, error occurred”?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue might occur if some system files associated with Internet Explorer are either corrupt or broken.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us follow these methods and check if this helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us try to re-register the DLL files associated with Internet Explorer and check if this helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Follow these steps and check the status: </span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1. Click Start, and then click “Run”.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>2. In the Open box, type cmd, and then click OK.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>3. At the command prompt, type the following lines, and then press ENTER after each line:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>regsvr32 softpub.dll</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>regsvr32 wintrust.dll </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>regsvr32 initpki.dll</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>regsvr32 dssenh.dll </span>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>regsvr32 rsaenh.dll </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>regsvr32 gpkcsp.dll</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>regsvr32 sccbase.dll</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>regsvr32 slbcsp.dll </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>regsvr32 cryptdlg.dll</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>4. Click OK when you receive the message that DllRegisterServer in FileName succeeded.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>5. Type exit. Once this is done, restart the computer and try to launch Internet Explorer.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may perform SFC scan and restart the computer to check if that helps with the activation issue. The
<strong>SFC /scannow</strong> command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions. Once the SFC scan is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>

    <title>Windows 7 activation option not present, and keeps asking for windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 activation option not present, and keeps asking for windows genuine advantage</h2>
                    Hi, my computer (Acer) came preinstalled. After a blue screen error all I could do is total reinstall using the system recovery (install windows from a hidden partition)
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Ever since I did this he keeps complaining about my windows not being genuine. Also at start-up he tries to install a service pack, failes, then removes it again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When looking across the internet I've seen several options. When I try to activate manually through computer &gt; properties I get this:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>Windows activation</i></div>
<div><i>&nbsp;<span> </span>Status not available</i></div>
<div><i>ProductID: Not Available</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div>So the option to activate this way is unavailable to me.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I search I find a program called activate windows but starting this software gives me the following error:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>Code:&nbsp;</i></div>
<div><i>0xC0020012</i></div>
<div><i>Description:</i></div>
<div><i>The interface is unknown.</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div>When I try to run SLUI.exe I get the same error as above (0xC0020012</div>
<div>So after trying that I post this question here what can I do?! Below my MGADT report:</div>
<div>NB: What I find odd is that the sticker on my machine shows a different product key than I see in the third line of this diagnostics report)</div>

<h2>            Error 1603</h2>
                    On an ACER D260 Netbook running Win 7 64, attempts to update Quickbooks 2012, lead me to Error 1603 and the update fails.
<br />
QB operates normally, but is slow to open. <br />
I have the same QB running on another ACER (mini desktop) running&nbsp; Win 7-64 with no issue.<br />
<br />
In reading the past posts on his erro each problem seems to have a different solution.
<br />
<br />
What to do with the QB2012 update? <br />

            I am having difficulty navigating this forum. I know the are at least three replies but I can't see them all.<br />
I got three e-mails with different responses, but when I click on, "Read this reply on Microsoft Community" I only find one and it is always the same one.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Since the original post, I tried the repair from the QB disk copied to a memory stick, running the QB*.msi file . It appeared to be working and stalled with a different error message.
<br />
<br />
I removed QB2012 with IOBit uninstaller, including a scan to remove the registry entries.&nbsp;&nbsp; The started to re-install from the memory stick. The setup.exe file would not run, and did not give any error message.
<br />
<br />
I ran the same QBooks*.msi file and it appeared to be working and stalled at the same spot.<br />
<br />
I could attach a screenshot but can't see how to do that. The error message now is:<br />
<br />
Error 2203.Database:C:\windows\Installer\da17fa.ipi<br />
Cannot open database file System Error<br />
-2147287035<br />
<br />
now I have no version of QB running.&nbsp; and cannot install one. <br />

                    I keep getting an error stating that I need to uninstall Spy Sweeper.&nbsp; It was a program associated with Webroot. An antivirus program I deleted the program and no searches show that Spy Sweeper is still there but I keep getting the error.&nbsp; I looked for
 hidden programs and can't find it.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me how to find and uninstall this program? Thanks.

<h2>            Problems with Windows Live Photo Gallery on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Some time back (certainly less than a year) I installed Windows Live Photo Gallery on Windows 10 with some help from forum. It has been working fine till recently. Now I CANNOT add tags and captions on multiple pics at once, which makes the process much
 more time consuming. Help appreciated.</p>

<br />
<br />Windows Live Photo Gallery along with all other Windows Essentials from 2012 are being shut down now after being discontinued over a year ago.
<br />
<br />I would transition to the Photos app which is even more full featured.

But... Photos does not allow for tags and captions, does it?<br />

            Uninstall Windows Live Essentials then reinstall using compatibility mode to see if t works better.

<br />Use compatibility mode:

<br />
<br />Setting expectations:
<br />We have to be realistic about support for software on later releases of Windows. 
<br />
<br />Does the app take priority over the operating system; or does having the latest version of Windows come first?
<br />
<br />In your case, it looks like the application is a priority. So, you should not be running Windows 10 or even running it under versions where its clearly not supported. 
<br />
<br />The last working version of Windows, Windows Essentials 2012 is known to work in would be Windows 10 1703 or earlier. 
<br />
<br />The right thing for you to do is rollback to your previous version and stick with it. 
<br />
<br />If you need to use this software, you probably are best off downgrading to a supported release such as Windows 10 1703. I still have it working there and have decided to keep the machine at version 1703.
<br />
<br />You could even setup a dual boot for Windows 10 1703 and later versions of Windows 10, since it will not affect affect your license status.

            Not yet.  But many are requesting this.  If you'd also like to express your opinion about this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. You can even click the Share button there to generate a link to your Feedback to post back here for others to vote up or add to it. But Microsoft will not see it here as this is a mostly volunteer-staffed forums where we try to solve your problems.

<h3> steelkiller1947  say:</h3>
<h2>            Zuma Delux game</h2>
                    I bought and downloaded Zuma Delux about a month ago when I bought a new lap top with Microsoft 10 (which by the way I do not like).&nbsp; Everything was ok until there was a Microsoft update after which the Zuma Delux screen got about a quarter of the original
 full screen size.&nbsp; I&nbsp; have tried everything to restore the game to a full screen without results.&nbsp; I have dealt with Microsoft and even had their experts get into my lap top to fix the problem without success.&nbsp; Is there an upgrade of some kind that will restore
 the full screen.

<h3> frootloopspw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Massive recovery issue, windows won&#39;t boot or recognise my recovery media. Please help.</h2>
                    <p>I performed&nbsp;a system restore last night and upon restarting my laptop I was booted straight into the bios with no boot options at all. I then plugged in my usb recovery drive to try and just reset my laptop however I was told my hard drive was locked. I
 then opened up cmd and typed in the bootrec commands of which only the /fixmbr and /fixboot worked. After restarting I am now greeted with "Your pc/device needs to be repaired. The boot configuration data for you pc is missing or containts errors. File EFI\Microsoft\Boot\BCD.
 Error code:0xc000000f" and then it tells me I need to insert installation media, but the issue is NOW it wont pick up my recovery flash drive at ALL. Please help me, I am extremely desperate</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and frustration you have been through. I will be glad to assist you.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer these questions to assist you better.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Have you checked the issue using a different computer? Is it getting recognized in different computer?
<br />
2.&nbsp;From where exactly have you created the recovery drive? <br />
3.&nbsp;What is the size of the USB flash drive? <br />
4.&nbsp;Have you tried to recover using DVD? <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to go to BIOS and set USB as first boot device and check if it gets detected. for more info refer the computer manual or contact the computer manufacturer.&nbsp;Also unplug all external devices except keyboard and mouse. Restart computer.
</p>

</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Be careful when changing BIOS settings. The BIOS interface is designed for advanced users, and it's possible to change a setting that could prevent your computer from starting correctly. Updating BIOS
 should only be done if necessary (to solve a compatibility problem, for example). It can be a complicated process, and if an error occurs, your computer could be rendered inoperable. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions exactly.</span></span></p>

            Hi thank you for that, I managed to get the recovery drive working and it now boots to the recovery screen with the options to trouble shoot. However when I try to reset my pc windows go through the whole process and then tells me it couldn't reset and
 nothing was changed, when I try to fix startup errors it tells me start up errors could not be fixed. I have tried the cmd chkdsk and sfc /scannow but it tells me windows could not perform the operation (or something along those lines). Would I have to reformat
 my hard drive to fix this?

            Make sure to complete all other steps and follow all instructions carefully that I gave you to troubleshoot install above.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else works you can try placing the hard drive alone in another PC to install to it there, move it back.  Windows 10 is remarkably adaptive to new hardware without needing adaptive restore.  If it will start it will swap out all drivers requiring several restarts.  
<br />
<br />You can also Test the hard drive with diagnostics:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>.  Best is Seatools bootable Long Test which works on all models: 
<br /><a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>.
<br /><a href="https://www.seagate.com/manuals/software/seatools-bootable/using-seatools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.seagate.com/manuals/software/seatoo...</a>
<br />
<br />Follow that up with a full Disk Check, from the Command Prompt if necessary:   <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />If the hard drive is failing I'd replace it with an SSD which is the best upgrade you can give your PC - lightning fast, better than a new higher end PC without one.
<br />
<br />Follow the included instructions or a video you find for your model via Google to swap it in and do this Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
