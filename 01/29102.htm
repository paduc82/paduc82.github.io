<blockquote>how to install windows xp on core i3 processor</blockquote>
<p>You don't install Windows (of any variety) on a processor.&nbsp; You install it on a computer that has, among many other components, a processor.</p>
<p><a href="http://michaelstevenstech.com/cleanxpinstall.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Clean Install Windows XP</a></p>
<p>That being said, if what you really mean is that you have a new computer with an Intel Core i3 processor and you want to install Windows XP on it even though the computer originally came with Windows 7 installed, you'll have to determine whether there are
 Windows XP drivers available for all of the various hardware devices in the computer, including the chip set (motherboard), video card, audio card, network adapter, etc., etc.&nbsp; Odds are if it's a brand-new computer, particularly a laptop, there may not be
 XP drivers available.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The assert failed means that some condition that should be met could not be. like for example dividing by zero.</p>
<p>The DCCMigrate.exe is questionable and i would reccomend starting into safemode and run a antivirusscan with software like malwarebytes.</p>

            Hi EFEX Ed,<br />
I don't see a way to reset the duration in the fax software. As stated before, I don't think that is the problem. Have you tried sending them one at a time?It just might be too taxing for the receiver's telephony.<br />

<br />
<p><span>It must be pretty good as you’re posting to the forum. The only way to improve the signal is to climb on top of the bus, but presumably that’s not an option.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Seriously though, you have no control over it, it all depends upon your current location. The signal may well improve by the time you receive my reply.</span></p>

 even Microsoft can't screw this up this badly?</p>

    <title>Reasons why I won&#39;t be using Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r.bassett jr.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reasons why I won&#39;t be using Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Quick to the point, to the point no fakin', in no particular order.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's ugly as **** and I am not offered <em>any</em> options to use the previous style of Windows that I paid for. Not the looks of Windows 7, not Vista, not Vista Basic, not XP, and not even Windows 98/2000. Come **** on, Microsoft. Get off your high
 horse and realize that not everyone on Earth likes your stupid "flat" ****. Also, the icons are still a joke... really, Microsoft? Did I get teleported back in time to an ugly version of 1993?</li><li>On top of looking like pathetic garbage circa 1993 (worse actually, because the icons in Windows 3.1 look pretty good considering...), the lack of contrast between open windows and between elements within windows make using the damned thing harder and more
 annoying than it should be. Hard and annoying, just want I want from my PC experience! :|</li><li>Forced updates on Home Premium. Gotta push them ads!</li><li>That... <em>THING</em> is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><em>NOT</em></strong></span> the Start Menu. Load up Windows 7/Vista/XP and using the real Start Menu, because clearly you have forgotten what it actually does and why people enjoy
 using it.</li><li>Cortana? How about, I couldn't **** care less. Do not want, at all.&nbsp;</li><li>Bing? See Cortana.</li><li>Advertisements in my OS experience? REALLY? Go to hell. Simple as that. Even the potential for this occur is enough to make me angry. My desktop operating system is not a platform to make you rich. So... **** off.</li><li>The settings/control panel are some kind of **** up mashup of butt ugly useless "apps"&nbsp;and normal Windows style windows, yet the experience is completely disorganized, disjointed, all the while offering fewer options and less control over one's system
 than any previous version of Windows. If you thought Windows Phone settings were a hot mess, just wait 'till you see Windows 10 on a desktop! I would face palm, but I don't want to sully my face with any germs I may have picked up from my mouse while touching
 Windows 8... *shudder*</li><li>Removal of Windows Media Player, Ad-free games that have been part of Windows since the 1990s (and others since Vista), and removal of DVD playback. How cheap-**** can you get, Microsoft? Wow!&nbsp;</li><li>All but forcing people to use a Microsoft online account for their desktop, because it's A. Bloody obtuse to install the OS without doing so and B. A major pain in the **** to try and use anything without being nagged to make an online account. Privacy,
 who wants that old thing!? :|</li><li>Multiple desktops: Done better in GTK2 desktops for linux (for at least a decade or so), such as Gnome2/Mate and Xfce.&nbsp;</li><li>The Taskbar is enormous and can't be made any less so. 22 pixels tall is plenty. I use 18px in Xfce. God forbid anyone like something different than what Microsoft likes...</li><li>"Fast boot" really means "hibernate the PC and potentially wreck the hard drive in the process". &nbsp;Is it optional? Nope. Sure, you can make it so your disks never spin down, but how in the hell is that supposed to be OK?&nbsp;</li><li>Microsoft Store: Required to play Solitaire! Know what else is required? A Microsoft account!</li><li>Shell out $119.99 for Windows and what do you get? A bare bones Ad revenue machine that is a complete **** joke compared to the default installation of virtually every modern Linux distribution. You don't even get Microsoft Works, yet virtually every
 desktop install for Linux comes with the full Libre Office suit, for free no less. And then there are the thousands of other great programs available for Linux, all without ever having to sign up or pay for
<em>anything</em>... Microsoft, if you're taking people's money, you need to give them something valuable in return.</li><li>Ribbons, ribbons, everywhere, but not a drop of genuinely useful functionality added in the process. You know, like tabs. WHO NEEDS TABS IN A FILE EXPLORER, RIGHT? NO ONE! :| I just don't "get it", Microsoft. Do you people even use a PC for more than watching
 Youtube?</li></ul>
<p>I could go on, but it's probably not worth my time, because clearly Microsoft only cares about their vision for the PC - what end users want be damned! :\</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: Want me to use Windows 10? <strong>Make it exactly like Windows 7</strong>. Can't be bothered to do that? Oh well, too bad for you and the PC industry I guess. I won't be buying Windows 10 or anything with Windows 10 installed
 on it. Heck, I won't even be taking you up on that "free upgrade", because <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em><strong>it's a huge **** downgrade from Windows 7!</strong></em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I seem angry, it's because I am. Who do Microsoft think they are pushing **** like this on the world? I feel like they are trying to steal away everything that is good about using a PC to replace it with their vision of the perfect Ad revenue generation
 machine. At the expense of the PC industry, no less, who trust Microsoft to <em>
SELL THEM</em> an OS that will sell <em>their</em> products. I don't see Windows 10 being any more popular than Windows 8.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7, which I use every day, is a genuinely <em>good</em> PC experience and it is upsetting that Microsoft gutted that experience to replace it with the putrid feces that is Windows 10; totally not worth the wait, thanks for nothing.</p>

            <p>Everyone is not same brother.I like Windows 10 more than 7.Some do and some do not, its normal.But i think moving on with time is a better idea.They are not forcing everyone you to upgrade, if you want to upgrade then upgrade and if you do not then it is
 your wish.</p>
<p>As long as tabs are concerned, i agree with you.There must be a tab functionality in Windows Explorer.</p>

            &nbsp;I couldn't agree more. Usless new features, forced apps, horrible look. Flat style makes me sick and it hurts my eyes. I was not able to look at the monitor: no shadows, bright and ugly icons and even blurry Device Manager. I was very exited about Win
 10: I hoped MS leanred from the Win8 disaster and made their new OS perfect! It was really great offer to upgrade for free and yes I wanted new OS. But this? After two days of using Win10 I rolled back to Windows 7. So Microsoft: update your statistics about
 the number of win10 users.<br />

            <p>I will say some good things about Windows 10 and some things I don't like about Windows 10. I did upgrade to Windows 10. I had no problem with the upgrade at all. I like Cortana. I think she's pretty cool. I like a lot of the other features, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was one problem, though. I couldn't find a good program to take the place of Windows DVD Maker. I tried several free software programs, but those programs weren't simple to use at all. I purposely chose Windows 7 Home Premium for my Dell laptop in
 October, 2012 while I still had the opportunity to get it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose it because I make a lot of videos and work with graphics. I discovered with Windows 10 that it wouldn't work for the needs I have with video making of old family movies, etc. The DVD player app was okay.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to roll back for now to Windows 7 Home Premium. I've decided to wait a few months and see what improvements there may be in Windows 10. I know that I can upgrade again as long as I do it before July 29th, 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are improvements that are worth it to me, then I will try Windows 10 again ... just not for now.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Am curious about some of your complaints, and can offer a few observations... I am not an employee or even nowadays a regular volunteer on Microsoft products, but have used almost all MS OS since 3.1 (16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit) and have done some mobile
 application building which involves building UI and being exposed to generally all the UI trends over the past 8 years at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, the generally flat appearance of icons, tiles and other objects is not a Microsoft innovation (although the implementation of tiles specifically is). Blame the wildly successful iPhone (iOS) for this, but also for the functional reason that on tiny
 screens shading effects muddy the appearance. Flat objects are clear no matter the resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any complaint about contrast is interesting because if you upgraded you should have retained themes and backgrounds. If you installed new, maybe you're looking at default selections? In any case, since forever Windows like any other OS supports numerous
 methods for adjusting appearance, including high contrast themes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I've seen, the start menu is everything you'd find in legacy start menus... plus tiles. I don't know if it's possible to disable tiles altogether but you definitely have the traditional start menu. Selecting options doesn't fold out cascading sub-options,
 but that's not new. You say you have XFCE experience, then you should know the Win10 "stacked" start menu has similarities to the default KDE app launcher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also don't like forced updates. Although rare, I can remember historically the few times a Windows Update killed the system and required expert technical skill to recover or workaround. Even today, I see Presenters standing in front of a full auditorium
 in the middle of a lecture and all of a sudden his presentation is interrupted because Windows Update kicks in. Until and unless MS fixes this, I'll probably disable WU altogether at times, a very inconvenient thing I have to remember to do and later undo
 manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bing and Cortana don't bother me much and I don't use them today. But, I can envision that one day I may have a different attitude about them so am willing to tolerate them. In any case, this is why I install multiple web browsers on my system so each can
 be configured for a different purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see any advertisements on my system and I've seen a few other people mention them. I wonder where you're getting them from, again maybe because you're not an upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you launch Control Panel (eg type "control panel" in the search/run input), I see exactly what I've seen in Win7 and Win8. Don't know what you're looking at, it's probably not Control Panel. But, it's the "new" Control Panel introduced in Vista, not the
 "classical" organization of XP. Yes, if you're an experienced tech, you'll lament the newer&nbsp;"app" approach which requires many more clicks to accomplish anything compared to the "lean and mean" approach of XP Control Panel apps, but if this is what you're
 complaining about, well... It's been around since 2005 by default in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DVD playback isn't a problem for me. Aside from the RT Video Player (now running windowed), I have VLC installed for this purpose. If you want to run Windows Media Player, it's still there... just not the default now. Rt-click on a file to get the WMP selection.
 But, if you really mean Windows Media Center... well, I think that is really gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People are "strongly encouraged" to use Windows Online Authentication, it's not forced (although you might have to really squint to see how you can configure local authentication). Again, this is consistent with the new multi-device connected world. If you
 use online authentication, then your apps, personal settings and a lot of online data like contacts and mail are instantly available to any other app or device that uses that authentication. This is big business, but also a very big benefit to Users who want
 easy and automatic setup, plus seamless access to same resources on multiple devices like phone, tablet and desktop. So, your complaint is a YMMV. And privacy is always a tradeoff for these kinds of benefits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your reference to Desktops on Linux amuses me. As an experienced user who also has seen Linux Desktops, I'd say you are conveniently omitting the Unity Desktop which has been the default on Ubuntu for several years now, and the original purpose to prepare
 for Ubuntu running on multiple hardware devices. In fact, the Ubuntu Phone is uniquely a Linux OS on a phone. But, as the list of other distros you quote shows, the majority of the world is hesitant about the whole idea of a GUI that works on every platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what you're seeing about a tall taskbar. I'm seeing something not overly tall. I've often seen what you describe on systems with low display resolutions, could be your problem. I haven't looked up Win10 recommended hardware, but it's my impression
 that Win10 probably is tuned best&nbsp; for at least a 1600 pixel screen. This is nothing new, and is why it's a risky proposition to install any Windows on very old hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't played with "Fast Boot" but personally doesn't interest me too much. I already know that Windows introduced parallelism in the boot in Win8 and I can install on an SSD. Beyond that, there are physical limits to what has to happen and I'm not going
 to beat my head wanting something not physically possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surprised about Solitaire in the Store? Boy, you must have skipped Win8...</p>
<p>Speaking of which about Office or Works, I assume you do know that Libre Office can be installed on Windows if that is what you want? I'm a big fan of Libre Office but in a pragmatic sense I recognize if I'm creating something that will be used/viewed on
 another company's machine I would still build it in MS Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for ribbons... Yeah, I'm no fan of ribbons but those have been central to MS apps since... approx. 2007. Unless you haven't used a MS app version 2007 or later, you'd have to at least tolerate ribbons for a long time now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you&nbsp;love Windows 7, then stay with it. I don't think we're looking at EOL support anytime soon, although eventually you will need to adapt to the changing world of OS, and if you want to use Windows you'll probably have to adapt to whatever is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMO the problem for companies like MS with its enormous user numbers is that new Users don't want what you've complained about. The numbers prove it, the ipad, iPhone and android have shown an enormous market for the features you don't want. But, there are
 also enormous numbers of Users like yourself (and to some degree myself as you can see in my comments) that don't want the new stuff and are perfectly happy with previous Windows. It's a conundrum MS tries to resolve in products like Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for making DVDs, choice of app depends on your requirements. Anything can make a bare bones data DVD, but if you're looking for an app that automatically sets up an app with background, menu options, background music, etc. then that might require some
 research. On the other hand, there's a lot of people running around today with elementary coding skills, particularly building websites and as capable as web browsers are nowadays it would be incredibly easy to build a little web app that plays your DVD files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMO.</p>

            <p><strong>it is just this simple</strong>, i upgraded a dell laptop with windows 7 ultimate installed, with windows 10.</p>
<p>at first all seemed painless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>the first thing i tried was free cell, it worked</p>
<p>then i tried the calendar, it did not work</p>
<p>i tried other microsoft apps and they did not work.</p>
<p>then the start button did not work.</p>
<p>i looked for answers in the community, then the apps worked.</p>
<p>the next day they do not, after an upgrade.</p>
<p>the fix earlier does not fix the problem now.</p>
<p>besides all the other comments above, i am talking about software 101 here.</p>
<p>ok we all know that when a new version is released we have to relearned the system.</p>
<p>but for these simple things not to work is hilariously incompetent from a this company.</p>
<p>this problem is not knew to them and there should be a solution on the first page of the site in large print.</p>
<p>i am so thankful that i did not upgrade my business machines to this version and have the troubles i am having with this dell laptop, do they understand the dollars lost with wasted time i would have spent fixing
<strong>a problem they created</strong>. actually this poor laptop has burdened the problem and i am thankful for its sacrifice, for again, if my business machines had gone through what i am thinking now, all of you would have heard me pulling out the rest
 of my computer hair.</p>
<p>so in closing, getting it free, at the moment, is what i always say, "YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR !!!"</p>

            <p>I have to agree with so much of what you say, with some exceptions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I don't know what you're referring to with "ribbons" so I cannot say anything at all about them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I would request that they make the appearance look like Windows XP, not like Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I would add the disappearance of any games in Windows 10 that were there in Windows 7 and all previous versions. I'm sure some will want to crucify me, but I got used to playing some Solitaire or maybe even Mah Johng before going to bed as a way to wind
 down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) There's also the disappearance of any graphics program. Paint may not have been a top quality program, but it was something I used quite a bit, for different purposes. I can find no graphics program in this upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) I'll also gripe about the change from the Quick Launch toolbar to "pinning" something to the taskbar. Yeah, I know that was already a done deal before Windows 10, but I would much rather have the Quick Launch toolbar back. I definitely prefer the way
 that works as opposed to this "pinning" junk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) Why on Earth would MS (I'm beginning to see the correlation between MS for Microsoft and MS for Multiple Sclerosis) have removed the "Recently Used" documents section of the Start Menu in Windows 7. Now THAT was extremely useful, and it's another feature
 that's been killed off by Windows 10 developers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) The fact that I have to right click the start menu to get an option to power my laptop down. What was wrong with left clicking and selecting the option to turn it off? Luckily I'm familiar enough with Windows to try that. I wonder how many people out
 there are trying to figure out how to turn their bloody computer off with Win10!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm going to supplement all the complaints you have.... </p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I use Notepad a lot. I also use Word and Excel. None of those 3 applications show up in the "Most used" section of this alleged start menu. For years, and through different versions of Windows, I have gone to the Start Menu to open up frequently used
 programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I want my operating system to be flexible. At least with XP, Vista, and possibly with 7, there was an option to set the look of everything back to the "Classic" look, like Windows 95 or 98. Why can't there be something like that with Win10? Let me set
 the look back to Windows 7 or maybe even XP (XP was by far my most favorite version of Windows). But MS has taken "full and complete control" of my computer by not allowing me to change the look of anything. Please understand, MS, that I do not want to have
 to figure out where one window ends and another one starts, as I have to figure out in Windows 10. I would like the option to give Windows a bar at the top like previous versions have had. I want to know where to place the cursor when I want to drag a window.
 I don't want to have to hunt and peck for a spot to drag the window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) To Dorky Noob.... I upgraded from Win7, and it most certainly DID NOT keep any themes. Every program I use has been converted to this horrible, plain, drab, non-descript look that they've given Windows 10. And yes, there are settings to change the "theme"
 but I have only 4 or 5 choices, and the colors set in are combinations that would kill my eyes if I had to look at them day after day. Also the "start menu" you refer to is absolutely, 200% NOT the same menu I've seen in any previous version of Windows. I
 don't know what you have but my start menu is atrocious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, that's enough for now. I'm tired of complaining about something that MS will never fix. They want to force people to use a computer the way that THEY want people to use it, not the way that the actual end user wants to use it. So I will either pay
 the money to buy Apple from now on, or this will be what causes me to finally learn Linux and move to that. But MS is doing nothing to want to keep me as a customer.</p>

            <p>I want someone to tell me why I should upgrade to 10. &nbsp;What's it got that 8.1 doesn't? &nbsp;And why are you taking away features in 8.1 that I have grown dependent on. &nbsp;Symbiotic productivity dependent, not just "Gee, that's cute" dependent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I'm not upgrading to Windows 10 because I<em> like</em> my Windows 8.1 Start screen. &nbsp;Am I the only one?? I was an extreme skeptic--charms? tablet screen? &nbsp;Pah!. But when my laptop motherboard with Windows 7 bit the dust in the middle of a screenplay
 with killer deadlines, and I needed a machine NOW, I had no choice. &nbsp;Everything in the stores was Windows 8. &nbsp;So I bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It didn't take me long to like it. &nbsp;No, love it. &nbsp;I now have my Start screen customized for all my projects--of which I have many, with shortcuts all grouped together for documents, research on the Web, productivity apps--and games of course. &nbsp;I upgraded
 my new desktop to match. &nbsp;Those groupings are there for a reason--so I can switch between projects without having to figure out what folder I stashed things in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here's the rub: these pesky reminders keep popping up endlessly, telling me how I can get Windows 10 free. &nbsp;I called support, and they tell me, no, all my customized, carefully arranged settings on my Start screen will have to be done all over again.
 &nbsp;Manually. &nbsp;One by one. &nbsp;Hours of arranging that I carefully crafted over days. I don't have that time to waste. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I upgrade, I'll just have to configure straight to tablet mode and recreate my project groupings on the Start screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, please tell me that I can do configure the groupings! &nbsp;And that I can use the horizontal scrolling that I've learned to love. I saw the videos with the new Start--vertical?! Tiny?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And please tell me that I can use the BIG tiles for more shortcuts--because we don't all have under 40 eyes like the people who designed this stuff. &nbsp;Or even under 60 eyes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So tell me, do you have an app to port over all my Start Groupings? &nbsp;If not, how long will 8.1 be supported?</p>
<p>

            This sounds suspiciously as if the "free" Windows 10 release is a beta release. &nbsp;Give it away free and let the public test it. &nbsp;Thank you for your post. &nbsp;Beta testing is a good idea, but not to people who are not voluntarily being guinea pigs. &nbsp;I'll wait
 until more bugs are worked out.

<h2>            Windows 8 Pro with Media Center will not activate</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I refreshed my Windows 8 Pro with Media Center installation and it has forgotten my product key, when I try to activate in metro Settings it returns "That key didn't work" and when I try with my original Windows Pro key in desktop control panel it returns
 "The product key you have entered will not work with this edition of Windows 8. You must either run Windows 8 Setup or enter a Windows 8 Pro with media center product key (which doesn't exist since upgrade is the only way of getting MC)" and when activating
 with my Media Center key it returns: "The following failure occurred while trying to use the product key. Code 0xC004F061. Description: The software Licensing Service determined that this specific&nbsp; product key can only be used for upgrading, not fro clean
 installation"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So is Microsoft Support my best bet, because if I could fix this manually I would much prefer to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, Yan509</p>

            Is the whole idea of Windows Activation to steer you towards piracy or Linux? Because that's what I'm considering switching to!! And Microsoft support is **** because they said they would help me and hung up! I've had better support from people who don't
 get paid to answer my calls or other&nbsp;voluntary workers (hint hint almost every Linux OS that provides support.) I really wasn't expecting this from a company like Microsoft. I was going to buy a surface but if that brakes god knows where I'll stand... (probably
 in Argos buying a nexus).

Same exact thing happened to me last night!  I just spent 2 hours on the phone with someone from Microsoft, they remoted in and everything. Wasted two hours of my life, they have no solution and told me to reinstall Windows 8 with my original key and don't install Media Center. 



What kind of **** is that?  I'm so looking into ditching Microsoft and going Apple, none of my Apple friends complain about stuff like this. 



Did you ever find a solution?

            Nope sorry I'm in the same frustrated position that you are still, like I say I will find some way getting around this whether it involves Microsoft or not. You would think Windows' own feature wouldn't F**k up ur pc, but apparently it does. I'm pretty
 sure Windows ME could do a better job at activating. I'm not sure whether looking at apple would suit me (since I would 1. Like a CD drive on my mac 2. If I bought an old mac I would like a cd drive that works) but definitely something along those lines...

            actually it looks almost identical to the initial e-mail I got to activate Media Centre way back when so it seems genuine. But as I cant follow the list of things to do, it must already be activated so why cant they send a different e-mail to those who

&nbsp;TO EVERYONE POSTING IN THIS THREAD:<br />
<br />
The Media Center Key is for upgrades only, when your PC is activated with it, it activates against the "email" + Windows 8 Pro Current Activation active.<br />
<br />
You have a few options really when it comes to the "re-activation" of Windows 8 Pro with Media Center (Build 9200)
<br />
<br />
1. Go to the activation hyperlink under "computer" properties, and click the grey "activate" button till it activates. I found a few times and it goes through. Other times, first click worked.
<br />
<br />
2. Call Microsoft and have them provide support as when you buy the upgrade key, or new key you pay for 90 days of tech support also. Get a reference number with call-back on issues that end up in that scenario of "can't be" activated.
<br />
<br />
3. There are black techniques I can't mention here you can find online you can perform. Many different ways to "Activate" against a "Product Key". Find a way and try to activate against your Media Center Key.<br />
<br />

            <p>I spent 5 hours on the phone with tech support yesterday, and 4 hours today. I've had upwards of 12 technicians remote into my laptop, to no avail, even with level 2+ service technicians on the case. I've been hung up on several times, multiple remote connections
 have been abandoned on their end, and an ungodly amount of modifications have been done to my PC including registry editing, third party software, and more restarts than I have the stomach to count. All for what? To be told that they can't fix it and I need
 to reinstall Windows? Unacceptable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should start using pirated Microsoft products. They often work just as well, why would I think that doing things legally would be any better? More power to the hackers and crackers (who can more done than Microsoft's own tech support)!</p>

                    Hello.So my problem is that when i try to change the priority of different connections,it simply doesn't save the changes.<br />
<br />
Example:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Local Area Connection<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ethernet<br />
Now i want to move Ethernet up by simply clicking on the Ethernet and then on the UP arrow.It allows me to do so but after pressing OK,I go to advanced setting again and it hasn't changed.(Works with the Provider Order)<br />
<br />
Never had this problem with windows 7<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Anyone knows a solution?

<h2>            Blue Screen error 0x000009f and computer freezes</h2>
                    I've been experiencing frequent computer freezes and the occasional BSOD upon shutting down and would love some help figuring out how to fix the issue.<br />
<br />
<div>The freezes don't seem to occur at any specific time that I can tell, though they are seemingly more common soon after start up. &nbsp;Sometimes the computer just hangs for a few seconds to a minute, other times it completely locks up and I need to hard reboot.
 &nbsp;I have updated Windows, updated my display drivers, and run multiple anti-virus checks to no avail. &nbsp;The BSOD issue I would assume is connected to the freezing issue, though it may not be. &nbsp;Here are my computer's specs and the minidump file from the BSOD:<br />
<br />

TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />
reference (if you have a little box on Lower Left - Show for All Users then check that).<br />

===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods
<br />
above is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are
<br />
found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Messaging app is specifically made for Skype, like an extension that will enable users to send text-based message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to uninstall app, you need to go to <strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; Apps &amp; features
</strong>then search for <strong>Messaging </strong>and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further help.</p>

<p>Dear Ryan,</p>
<p>I am aware of that procedure and have tried it several times. For your information, The Uninstall button is as unclickable as the Send icon in the earlier versions of Messaging.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think the reason for the issue is that I have not installed Skype, or uninstalled it when it was already installed, whatever. Messaging has started showing things after I have (re)installed Skype.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I unistalled Microsoft Office Home. Starting from this point laptop eather just freezes or freezes and makes buzzing noises after few minutes of inactivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"sfc /SCANNOW" and anti-virus check (McAfee Total Protection) did't show any results. Laptop doesn't freeze in the safe mode. When starting normaly (not over reset after the freezing case) Num Lock button is on and Microsoft Edge pops up.</p>

            Hi,  rinabö
<br />
<br />My name is Mays and I am an Independent Consultant. I would love to help you today.
<br />
<br />What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

<p>OK, it didn't work out. :(&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>After the repairing process laptop freezed for the first time many hours later. Now everything is back to how it was before: Laptop eather just freezes or freezes and makes buzzing noises after few minutes of inactivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can we learn something out of this situation? Would it make sence to repeat the repairing procedure?</p>

            I would recommend you to check your Hard Disk  with chkdsk.
<br />1) On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key  and S key at the same time, then type cmd in the search box. 
<br />2) Right-click Command Prompt, then select Run as administrator. 
<br />3) Type chkdsk /f /r, then press Enter on your keyboard.  
<br />4) Press Y on your keyboard. 
<br />5) Press the Windows logo key and R at the same time, then type mdsched.exe. 
<br />6) Click Restart now and check for problems (recommended). Your PC will restart immediately. 
<br />7) Wait for the scans to finish.
<br />
<br />Diagnose memory problems
<br />Using these steps requires you to restart your computer, so make sure to save any files you may have open and close any running applications before proceeding. Here goes:
<br />1.- Open Control Panel.
<br />2.- Click on System and Security.
<br />3.-  Click on Administrative Tools.
<br />4.- Double-click the Windows Memory Diagnostic shortcut. Quick tip: Alternatively, you can also use the Windows key + R keyboard shortcut, type mdsched.exe, and click OK to launch the tool.
<br />5.- Click the Restart now and check problems option. (The tool also offers an option to schedule a test in the next reboot, if you can't afford to close your applications and restart immediately.)
<br />Once your computer reboots, it will start in the Windows Memory Diagnostics environment, and the tests will kick in the Standard mode right away. In this mode, the tool will run all the scans available in the Basic mode, in addition to LRAND, Stride6 (cache enabled), CHCKR3, WMATS+, and WINVC tests.
<br />You can simply let the Standard mode test your computer's memory, or you can also press the F1 key at any time to open the Windows Memory Diagnostic page to change the scan options.

<p>Dear Alice,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the tip!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run the test two times and no problems with the memory were found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The freezing after few minutes of inactivity remains. Also, once it went into energy saving mode all of a sudden... Any other idea what I could do?</p>

    <title>Cannot update Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wihasa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot update Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am on Windows 10 Update 1607. I have not been able to update to version 1709 yet.
</p>
<p>I've been harrassed almost daily by Windows for months to update and it fails every time. And I do not want to "just reformat".</p>

<p>I've tried a lot of the things that I find when searching for the error messages such as the windows update troubleshooter, SFC, DISM, restarting services, freeing up disk space, Updating audio drivers and more.<br />
</p>
<p>If I try to update via ISO file, i get the error codes 0x8007001F - 0x20006 and the (swedish) error message:</p>
<p>"Installationen misslyckades i fasen SAFE_OS med ett fel under åtgärden REPLICATE_OC"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to update with the Update Assistant, it does different steps for about ~30 min until I get a popup that says that it failed, and then I get the error code 0x8007001f.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to update "the normal way", it takes some time to prepare and then restarts instantly and rolled back what it did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying for 5 months I think I need some guidance rather than keep trying on my own and I would be glad to be pointed in the right direction here.<br />
</p>

<p>Thanks for the link. I had tried many of the steps but not all. I do not want to do a clean install, if I wanted to do that I would have done it a long time ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have some more things to try, such as updating BIOS, pulling the ethernet cable and removing USB devices. I'll let you know if those fail as well.</p>

            None of that worked, I'm pretty sure I've tried every trick in your post (except clean install). I also tried removing all audio drivers and some other drivers (such as bluetooth) but that didn't help. So unless there are any more ideas to try it seems
 that I will basically have to reinstall Windows at some point to be able to update it.
