<p>Dreams, I had a friend in the same boat... played both the objective and run and gun-kill em' all style very well. &nbsp;That did not always sit so well with others and he took a "few" negative reps. &nbsp;The majority seemed to come from other players habitually
 muting him and/or leaving the game because he had a problem with his Turtle Beaches that he could not hear. &nbsp;It was a ridiculous static that was so bad, even myself &nbsp;the rest of our friends in party had to mute him. &nbsp;That mixed with the few reports for his
 gaming skill caused him to go "Avoid Me" status. &nbsp;Check out the two links below. &nbsp;One is an official support link from the Xbox Enforcement Team and the other is an in-depth explanation of the system and how to go in both directions, good and bad, from Major
 Nelson. &nbsp;It helped my buddy out a lot and he is now back to good standing just by playing about as often as you do. &nbsp;Good luck, ma'am. &nbsp;I hope this helps...</p>

<p>Dreams, I understand you're frustrated about this but my reply to you wasn't to "solve" your issue, ma'am...more to keep you informed of the policies and how they work. &nbsp;I'm just a fellow gamer with the "Ambassador" title. &nbsp;I'm no different than you. &nbsp;Are
 you sure about what you were reported/rep'd for exactly? &nbsp;You said you play "mostly" solo so I don't see anyone reporting you there. &nbsp;Plus, the enforcement team verifies the rep level before they move you to it. &nbsp;They don't just blindly stick you there forever.
 &nbsp;The team will actually validate whether you have had any game time with those that poorly rep'd/reported you. &nbsp;You could also try checking with someone at Customer Support to figure out the why/how of your rating (if they can provide it). &nbsp;

<p>Thank you for the reply again. I have been playing BF4 BF1 beta everything's been fine I have been in the green for a whole &nbsp;year....... GEARS4 comes out now I've been doing really well finishing at the top of the leader boards after the match doing well
 and now I notice my profile is in avoid me which is stopping me searching EVEN WITH A LOBBY of 3 randoms I had to beg to play with me. I can't play with or without people........I see it because I'm</p>
<p>Better I'm beating im out playing people then I get complaints. I'm not mad but clearly upset that due to the fact I'm better and outplaying and doing well I've been stopped from playing a game I'm enjoying.......called Xbox support they told me to contact
 enforcement looking into it enforcement is now closed are they trying to wind me up? I made a new account and can find games in seconds but I dnt want to use a new account just yet it's so childish oh well I don't know

<p>Not childish at all... Your gamertag is your identity and your hard earned achievements shouldn't be thrown away so easily. &nbsp;I'd be patient and do what you can to speak with the Enforcement team...send them an email if you can. &nbsp;You and I are about the same
 age so I feel your pain. &nbsp;I get to game a few hours a week so when I want to jam out I don't need any hiccups. &nbsp;Let me know how it goes and GOOD LUCK!</p>

<p>Actually your rep is the way the community rates the presence of the said gamer online and has nothing to do with the enforcement team. A bad rep is not an enforcement act is the way other gamers rate your online behavior.
</p>
<p>To get out of the "avoid me" rep I suggest you to play coop games with a large pool of different gamers. Overall avoid confrontation and smack talk. &nbsp;Keep these few things in mind and with time and patience your rep will increase. &nbsp;

<p>M3tal you make no sense what so ever I'm being peanllised for no fault of my own do your research when it comes to how broken the rep system is it's not a view of how people see you it's a place and tool that can get you banned for being good or complete
 innocences it only happend to me since GOW4 came out I played world of tanks for a few hours.... my background is corporate security so my hours are long I don't have time to grind long hours to get our OF AVOID me so really yes it's a childish feature.........
 it is what it is I'm just disappointed in how bad the system is and in this case been abused

<p>Tears you would have done better to check the link that was send to you through this post in order to understand how the rep works:
<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howto#sub-topic0-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">enforcement.xbox.com/.../howto</a></p>
<p>It's clearly stated: "A change in an account‚Äôs reputation score is not considered an enforcement action and is not indicative of a suspension; it‚Äôs possible to have a low reputation score without violating the Microsoft Services Agreement or Code of Conduct.
 Instead, reputation reflects how the Xbox Live community views a player‚Äôs behavior over time. The reputation system emphasizes a player‚Äôs sportsmanship and overall attitude and is intended to help ensure a level playing field for all Xbox Live members" &nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said good luck in your future gaming! &nbsp;</p>

<p>M3tal thanks for the reply again but you must not be understanding what I'm</p>
<p>Trying to say that link you have posted I aware of it. Goes on to say things and examples of how your rep can drop not one of those is a example of how my gameplay has been going. GEARS4 has caused my rep to go from green right down to AVOID ME the last
 5 months I have been in green well a whole year to be honest. Now avoid me because of gears4 it happened to others when GOWUE came out. And to add to this topic I can't play any gears titles with or without anyone doesn't work and I only own 3 games now. Maybe
 just ride it out as now i won't be online for 3 days </p>

            Hi bboy0001,<br />
<br />
Did you recently made any changes to the computer like installing a software or hardware?<br />
<br />
Are you able to see the battery icon by booting the computer in safe mode?<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Restart your computer and use F8 key.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Under the Windows Advanced Boot Options, select Safe mode and hit Enter.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Once you login into Safe mode, check in the system tray notification area.<br />
<br />
If you do not find it in Safe mode, restart the computer back. Right click on the taskbar and click on Properties. Click on the Notification Tab and check on Power. Save the changes by clicking on Apply and close the window.<br />
<br />
If the Power option in the Notification tab is grayed out or disabled, then execute the following command and check if you‚Äôre able to see the battery icon on the taskbar.<br />
<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Press Windows Button + R which opens a Run box.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Type cmd in the box and hit Enter which will open the command prompt in an administrator mode.<br />
<br />
Now type:<br />
<br />
<strong>powercfg.exe /globalpowerflag off /option batteryicon</strong> <br />
<br />
then:<br />
<br />
<strong>powercfg.exe /globalpowerflag on /option batteryicon</strong> <br />
<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Close the command prompt. Log off from the computer and log back in.<br />
<br />
If the above steps are of no help, then try executing explorer.exe from the task manager.<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Right click on the Taskbar and click on Task Manager.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Go to Process tab.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;End the "explorer.exe" process<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Go to Applications tab<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Select "New Task..."<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Type "explorer.exe"<br />
<br />
This should bring the battery icon back on to the computer.<br />
<br />
Please update me after trying these steps by posting your results back.<br />

<p>Hey Linas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out. We understand you have been experiencing some data syncing issues when trying to play FH4 on your PC even after quite a bit of troubleshooting. If you haven't already done so, make sure this isn't network related by running a
 connection test through the Xbox App. Simply launch the Xbox App, head down to the "Settings" section of the app and scroll over to the "Network" tab. This will begin a detailed test of your connection to our servers and will indicate any errors which may
 be causing the Forza data download problem. our <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-on-windows/social/server-connectivity-xbox-app-displays-blocked" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Server Connectivity page</a> will provide some simple troubleshooting which usually solve the majority of connection problems. Let us know how it goes! :D</p>

<p><span>I don't have a clue how they mod stuff.&nbsp; I've wondered but that's all.&nbsp; Personally, I've never needed them.&nbsp; I played the game alone until level 35 and played co-op with friends after that and in all the DLC too.&nbsp; It's tons
 more fun with friends and a lot easier.&nbsp; Plus, you don't have to worry about fighting over weapons and stuff or someone dropping a modded weapon and messing up what weapons you have.&nbsp; Someone made a thread about that the other day.&nbsp;

<p>How to get your Shield and Shotgun in the "Mood" ... well I am sure the Shield and Shotgun would love a good night out on the town, a great dinner and maybe a movie or to go out dancing at a club.</p>
<p>A lot of drinks might help the 'Mood' but beware full the shield might block the jealous rampage from your Shotgun.</p>
<p>now on the Modding side... there will be no Modding for you, since you can't perform a simple spell check, if you modded you would just mess up your own save game, and then you would be asking how do you 'Mood' you character... and that is another story
 because Lilith might like to get in the Mood but I doubt Brick would calm down for you if you tried to get him in the 'Mood'.</p>

            Hi tawandanyakudyara 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />First do a reboot and see if that clears it up.
<br />Was this a folder in onedrive?
<br />What is the path to the folder if you right click and go to properties and location tab.

            Hi Tawan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Use the handy Take Ownership right click shortcut installed from here:
<br /> <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was determined to fix my problem.&nbsp; The ARestore file created by Norton was saved to my Maxtor Touch 4 external drive. So&nbsp; it occurred to me to look for drivers for the Maxtor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wound up on a Seagate website which had an app that then required .Net Framework 4 to determine the drives needed for my particular download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the lengthy .Net Framework install and Maxtor driver updates I was able to open the ARestore file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pleasantly amazed myself :)&nbsp;as trust I've no "True" understanding of what all I really did from a technical standpoint.&nbsp; I'm just glad I followed my gut and somehow wound up at a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feeling happy,</p>
<p>

    <title>why won&#39;t manage wireless networks list any networks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianmcclellan  say:</h3>
<h2>            why won&#39;t manage wireless networks list any networks</h2>
                    I can connect to the internet just fine. My computer sees available networks and allows me to connect, but if I try to open "manage wireless networks"&nbsp; the page is blank.&nbsp; nothing shows up. The status bar shows that there should be 5 items.&nbsp; I cannot delete
 or change any saved wireless settings. I really need to fix this because the password for my wireless network was changed and now I cannot update it.&nbsp; any suggestions?&nbsp; (I know that I can search the registry to delete the saved settings, but I would rather
 just fix windows if possible)<br />
<br />
<br />
After playing around I found that I can right click on the ssid in the list of available networks and click on properties.&nbsp; That at least lets me get in and change the saved security settings, but I cannot delete the saved entry, and the list still doesn't
 load.<br />

            I haven't made any changes to my system recently, but I don't know how long this hasn't been working, because I almost never try to open it.<br />
<br />
Method 1: Not helpful, the problem isn't that I don't know how to connect, or my wireless is turned off.&nbsp; The wirless network works just fine, I am connecting wirelessly now.&nbsp; Windows will just not display the list of saved networks.<br />
<br />
Method 2: valid suggestion. Already tried, it found an error and fixed it successfully, still have the same problem. Ran the scan again no errors detected.<br />
<br />
Method 3:&nbsp; Drivers are up to date, and what do the wireless drivers have to do with it?&nbsp; I'm not letting the drivers manage my wireless networks, I have enabled the windows wireless zero configuration, and windows is managing the wireless connection.&nbsp; It uses
 the drivers to connect through the wireless card, but that isn't the problem.&nbsp; The problem is the fact that windows isn't displaying the settings saved by windows.&nbsp; It even says that the information is there but nothing shows up on the screen.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your suggestions, but none of them will fix my issue.<br />
the only thing i can think of is that something is entered wrong in the registry, but I have no idea where to even start looking for that.&nbsp; Any further suggestions would be appreciated.<br />

<p>This can be caused by a corrupted Outbox, deleting it will not cause any problems, as follows:</p>
<p>First of all close Outlook Express. Using Windows Explorer, navigate to your store folder which, if you haven't moved it, is a hidden folder located at C:\Documents and Settings\username\Local Settings\Application Data\Identities\{GUID}\Microsoft\Outlook
 Express and delete Outbox.dbx. You may have to show 'hidden' files in Folder Options &gt; View Tab to see it.</p>
<p>Open Outlook Express and a new, empty Outbox will be created by Windows. If you receive an ‚Äòin use‚Äô message, boot to Safe Mode (tap F8 at switch on) and delete it.</p>

Do the following for the Outbox, and Sent Items after you move any messages you wish to save to a local folder you create.</p>

Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</p>
<p><br />
In WinXP, the OE user files (DBX and WAB) are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Windows Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options Icon | View, or in Windows Explorer | Tools | Folder
 Options | View.</p>
<p><br />
With OE closed, find the Outbox.dbx and Sent Items.dbx file and delete them. New files will be created automatically when you open OE.</p>

<p>I was sending duplicate emails (with attachments) in Outlook and solved the problem by clicking on Tools, Accounts, Properties and Advanced.&nbsp;At Advanced I scrolled down to Sending and removed the check mark that was breaking up pictures larger than 60 kg.
 This worked great for me. </p>

<p>For Outlook Express, <em>your fix is common</em>. But <strong><em>with or without attachments</em></strong> using Outlook Express is usually a corrupted Outbox.</p>

<p>If a new Outbox did not fix it, my next &lt;canned&gt; reply would have been................</p>

<p><strong>Tools | Accounts | Mail | Properties | Advanced. Uncheck: "Break apart messages........".</strong>

<h2>            Rainbow lines on my screen after my laptop sleeps</h2>
                    <p>After the latest Windows update, my screen has rainbow lines when my laptop goes to sleep and I try to open it up again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to rollback my graphic display but it won't let me (it's greyed out and not an option).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rainbow screen goes away when I uninstall the latest Windows update but my laptop keeps updating Windows every night because it needs the update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I now spend the day uninstalling the update and then it re-updates itself the next day and has the rainbow lines again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi melanielo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'd like to clarify if you were really running Windows 8. The operating system is one of our products that has reached its end of support. It means Windows 8 devices will no longer receive any updates. Go to
<strong>Control Panel </strong>&gt; <strong>System and Security </strong>&gt; <strong>Windows</strong>
<strong>Update </strong>&gt; <strong>Change </strong><strong>settings</strong>. <strong>
Turn off automatic updates</strong>.&nbsp; Do the same in case you were running Windows 8.1.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were running Windows 10 however, try reinstalling your graphics driver completely. Go to the manufacturer's website and download the appropriate driver. Then on
<strong>Device Manager</strong> completely uninstall your current graphics card. Restart your device and install the downloaded driver as per device manufacturer's instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

                    I have a 6yr old HP tower model h8-1040. I upgraded to windows10 from 7. My sound stopped. The sound device is on the mother board, but windows cannot find the device or the driver. When I tried to download the driver from HP, they didn't have it. They
 said use "windows update" program as it has older sound drivers in it. there is no windows update program on this PC. Where do i find "Windows Update?"

            <p><strong>David, hackers are constantly trying to hack everything, your PC your Microsoft Account, your Bank Details . . . etc.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is the world we live in and this is why we must use security software on our systems . . .</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>While this is true, you have no control if hackers try to hack your Microsoft Account, that is up to Microsoft's Security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lately a workmate of mine told me that his son's Microsoft Account had been hacked and they bought games on the Microsoft Store. He reported it to Microsoft, they immediately set up a different Microsoft Account for his son and without even being asked,
 they refunded my work mates bank account with the amount that was removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in the long run, you are lucky it was an unsuccessful attempt, but do not worry Microsoft are very good at sorting the issue out and compensating you . . .</p>

<h3> alphonsevaher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stop the Countdown to Goodness auto Querys</h2>
                    <p>So on Update 1709 I found that My computers Network adapter (The port where you plug in the Ethernet cable) Did not work. I tried:<br />
<br />
-Uninstaling the software then reinstaling from fresh drivers after the update.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
-Using a new cable</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Updating and restarting my router, My computer ect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Enabling/disabling the Broken part.<br />
<br />
SO I am now just going to stay on this version of windows. Forever.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now I have gone into regedit to put in No auto update and no auto reboot with logged on users, But my computer Continually and oh so helpfully tells me of my 'Countdown to goodness' that will install new updates. Which wont&nbsp;install. Because I disabled it on
 the registry.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Because I don't want it.<br />
<br />
How do I disable this annoying announcement for good?</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You should backup your files before downgrading.
<br />Applications will need to be reinstalled.
<br />The custom install will archive your files, so you can recover them from the Windows.old folder - make sure you follow the instructions to the letter. 
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.
<br />
<br />
<br />If you don't want to do this, you can wait it out until the next version of Windows 10 1803, is released to see if it works better. 
<br />
<br />Here is how you can upgrade now:

<p>Hello Joshua Her1,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Windows update causing these unexpected Windows Update failures is KB4056892.&nbsp; So far, I have experienced the issue on two laptops and a desktop with only one of those machines, finally, successfully installing the update.&nbsp; All three machines are
 running Windows 10 Home, the desktop locks at restart with a blue fixed Windows icon center screen and self repairs after 3 forced shutdowns.&nbsp; I have temporarily postponed the re-installation of that update and have normal operations on that desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; On the second laptop, it is in complete crisis.&nbsp; None of the repair tools will restore this machine and it has lost almost all functionality.&nbsp; I have tried to use a USB device to restore this unit, but have so far, only used Windows 10 Pro to produce
 a "Recovery Media" drive, which didn't work.&nbsp; While awaiting a reply, I will use the one working Windows 10 Home PC that I have, to produce a USB drive "Recovery Media" and try once again to repair the failed laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If only I knew how to retrieve the Windows 10 Home "Product Key" from this failed laptop, I would wipe and reinstall Windows 10 Home.&nbsp; Any input or suggestions are greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I have read some other references to update issues regarding KB4056892
 and will use your input in further attempts to repair my nephew's laptop and thanks again.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We received reports that the KB4056892 caused problems to the users. And here's the fix that we've found to resolve the issue: you need to install KB4058258 update instead of KB4056892. In order to do that, we need to know if you can boot your PC. If yes,
 go ahead and uninstall&nbsp;KB4056892 then install KB4058258 manually. You can get it directly from our
<strong><a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4058258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Update Catalog</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't boot your PC, then let's try if you can boot in safe mode. Refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how you can boot in safe mode. Once you're able to boot, install the KB4058258 manually. Then you
 can check for your product key using Command Prompt or PowerShell. Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Using CMD</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated command prompt.</li><li>Type <span>
or copy/paste </span>this command: <strong>wmic path softwarelicensingservice get OA3xOriginalProductKey
</strong>and hit Enter. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Using PowerShell</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>On the search bar, type
<strong><span>powershell</span></strong> and select
<strong><span>Windows Powershell.</span></strong></span></li><li><span>Right-click on it and select
<strong><span>Run as administrator</span></strong>. Enter your admin credentials when prompted to continue.
</span></li><li><span>In the PowerShell window, type or copy/paste this command:
</span>powershell "(Get-WmiObject -query ‚Äòselect * from SoftwareLicensingService‚Äô).OA3xOriginalProductKey"<span> the hit Enter.</span></li><li>Your product key should appear. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, then we suggest that you reinstall Windows 10. Refer to the answer of Andre Da Costa in this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/win10-reinstall/d7d543a1-3670-49c2-82ed-0bbaf882d1fa">thread</a></strong> on how to reinstall Windows if you can't find the product
 key. </p>

<p>Thank You Anne Ros,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have tried each of the options you offer, the KB4058258 stand alone update does nothing and with each command line effort, I get a similar error message, as follows in "'s;</p>
<p>"ERROR:</p>
<p>Description + The service cannot be started, either because it is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it."</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; There is a possibility that I am missing the exact phraseology, maybe I'm making errors in the entry by adding or missing spaces.&nbsp; Please send me the proposed command lines with spaces designated by an otherwise unused character, try a "$" (a dollar
 sign), where spaces are required.&nbsp; Also, do you know if there any way to "enable the service" or check for "devices associated with it", which are mentioned in the error messages?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have tried every repair option offered on a Windows 10 Home Recovery disc, but nothing works. Even when trying to reinstall the OS completely, none of the several available partitions will allow the&nbsp; install.&nbsp; I am at my wits end, would love to format
 this hard drive and begin with a clean Windows 10 Home installation, but without a product key, I am at a complete loss as to finally activating Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; My nephew purchased this ASUS PC from the Navy exchange as he returned from a military deployment, but kept no records, receipts or even his registration info.&nbsp; He upgraded it from the original Windows 8, to Windows 10 Home when prompted, but he seems
 to have destroyed all the recovery partitions/options, in many feeble attempts to recover from the KB 4056892 Windows Update crash, (before he contacted me.)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Can you think of any possible way to recover the product key or to obtain a viable code key from any Microsoft sources, etc ... ? Thanks again for the time you invest in helping me to restore this Windows PC.</p>

<p>UPDATE ! ! ! ! !</p>
<p>I finally got this PC up and running and also found the product key using the tools you provided, once it was restored.&nbsp; Still having issues with one Windows update, (KB4074588), but seem to have this machine operating at OS Build Level 16299.248.&nbsp; Any advice
 on this latest failed update or protections from this kind of crisis in the future would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp; Thanks again and if ever I can repay you, I will gladly!</p>

<p>Its become clear that this PC must be wiped.&nbsp; I used the command line method offered, to retrieve the Windows 10 Home Product Key, but I am not confident that it is correct.&nbsp; Please comment on the use of freeware download product "Belarc Advisor".&nbsp; This
 free download seems to have collected the actual Product Key for the installed Windows 10 Home 64x OS upgrade, (along with the product key retrieved by use of the powershell command line method.)&nbsp; When the Belarc software pulled the product keys, the one retrieved
 by your recommended method was marked as the product key for Windows Internet Explorer, please explain!&nbsp; Which do I use on a clean OS install?</p>

                    <p>Windows 7 on a Dell Inspiron 570.&nbsp; Multiple restarts have had no results on fixing this.&nbsp; Have changesd to different screen saver from my originally chosen "blank" and changed back.&nbsp; Ideas?&nbsp; Suggestions?</p>

            <p>&nbsp;It's possible that your power settings are to blank the screen before the screen saver comes on.&nbsp; Try decreasing the time before the screen saver is supposed to come on to 5 min. or less.&nbsp; If that's the problem, you may want to go to the power settings
 and increase the interval before it blanks the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

            Do you have a wireless mouse or keyboard? &nbsp;Some of these devices, notably Logitech branded ones, maintain a connection that repeatedly resets the timer by transmitting new mouse&nbsp;coordinates&nbsp;even if there was no movement.
<div><br />
<div>If this is in fact your case, you can open Devices and Printers from your Start menu, then go into your wireless mouse properties to prevent it from waking the computer.</div>
