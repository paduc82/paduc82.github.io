<h2>            Windows 10 update taking hours</h2>
                    I bought a new computer with Windows 10 already installed. &nbsp;The computer then wanted to do an update to Windows 10. &nbsp;It started updating at 12:00 hrs and it is now 15:00 hrs and it is 15% complete with copying files at 50%. &nbsp;It did not warn me that I would
 not be able to use my computer for the next 24 hours. &nbsp; Totally ridiculous - wish I had stuck with my old computer with Vista.

            Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;It took around 6 hours. &nbsp;It would be good to be warned about the length of time that it will take for such massive updates. &nbsp;I had some work that really needed doing and would have tried to postpone the update until I had done the
 work - if I had known how long it was going to take. &nbsp;I know that you cannot predict exact times that updates will take but it was obvious to MS that it would be a long time.

            UPDATES are taking 8-10 hours in the last few weeks! Leaving me computer-less! I have about 75% free space on this laptop.&nbsp; It's an ASUS, about 4 years old. Any advice??

<p>Having the exact same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just bought an HP and this awful excuse for an operating system is taking hours to update. Right now, I'm on hour 4 and it's still only at 26 percent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as it has updated, I'm wiping my computer clean and installing Windows 7. One of the few decent operating systems Microsoft has even managed to create.</p>

<p>Stop your computer from installing updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft can keep telling you it's for 'security' but that is B.S. Likely just another way for them to get our personal info to pass on to the US government.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop your computer doing automatic updates and you will do better off. I have had zero updates on my Win 10 computers since last September. Don't plan on ever allowing updates again. An abysmal operating system.</p>

<p>I've had my computer, an HP Notebook 15 for about six months with Windows 10. Last night I had the same thing happen. When I saw the update options, I clicked on "update and shutdown." This morning when I turned my computer on, it started updating. It took
 about two and a half hours which is totally ridiculous. The various screens I was getting during the process looked like what it did when I bought the computer and turned it on the very first time. That should have been my first warning sign.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was finally able to get on it, I found my screensaver had been changed. No big deal, just changed it back to the way I had it. Then I found all of my photos I had saved under the Pictures file were all gone. Every. One. Of. Them. Fortunately, I haven't
 deleted any of the photos off the camera yet. They were from a family trip, and had I deleted the photos off the camera, they would have been lost. Updates should NEVER delete user files. I wish I could go back to Windows 8. It was much better and never did
 anything like this. The only reason I'm on Windows 10 is because my previous computer died.</p>

            I gave up after 2 hours, and manually shut down and restarted to restore the previous version of Windows 10. This is totally not acceptable, why do they keep forcing this Update when I do not want, or need it. Everything is fine as it is, why fix something
 that is not broken! At least explain what these Updates are for and why I might need them so badly and then give me the option to chose if I want to waste my precious time waiting for the Updates! And Yes, I tried everything I could to find out what these
 are and how to control the Updates and it is all bull, nothing works as it should!

            off late i am afraid of allowing updates. During busiest time of working the update prompt appears,&nbsp; while you have option to reschedule yet&nbsp; you do not know how important this update is and how much time its going to take. Better if microsoft can tell
 about what updates are being made and how much time the update going to take so that user can decide whether to allow immediately or schedule later .An update taking even few minutes are disgusting and i waited nearly 4 hours for update to complete several
 times. may be enough time for next update made ready.<br />

<h2>            realtek network adaptor not found after upgrade to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>i upgraded my hp envy dv7 computer this morning from windows 8.1 to windows 10. after the update the computer has no network connections. the device manager shows a realtek wireless and lan adaptor is present. however in the network settings neither the
 lan or wireless are shown. if i try to create a new connection the only option i am presented with is dial up. the bios is up to date on the computer. when i either install the realtek driver or try to have windows roll back the driver i get the error message
 "the realtek network controller cannot be found.... if in deep sleep mode plug in the cable"</p>
<p>
</p><p>it feels like the system has left the network shut down as it does when in sleep mode. i have looked in the bios and there does not appear to be any place to enable/disable either wireless or lan.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am stumped.</p>

            <p>EDIT: problem solved using windows update via a shared connection, see my other comment below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same problem but even worse as the network adapter (Realtek 8111D chipset (10/100/1000 Mbit) on motherboard Gigabyte GA-EX58-UD4P) d</p>
<p>oesn't even show up anymore in the device manager -&gt; network adapters... No luck trying to install the latest drivers from Realtek (error using the installer: "The Realtek Network Controller was not found. If Deep Sleep Mode is enabled Please Plug the Cable.",
 installing the driver manually using the *.inf file doesn't change anything: still no network adapter in device manager).<br />
</p>
Glad to see that the Windows 10 upgrade process checked my PC properly before allowing me to go thru, now i have my work PC essentially bricked and I was only able to connect to the internet via my smartphone shared connection: woohoo. With the realtek network
 adapter being popular i can't imagine the number of people without any internet access right now on their brand new windows 10, and the only possible solution i have found here regarding the same problem on the windows 10 preview version was to use windows
 update, but unless i am missing something there is no more windows update in windows 10 RTM: so... Well hopefully they will have fixed that latest mess when i come back from my holidays, then i will have to check why i can't activate my upgraded window 10
 and why Microsoft won't accept that windows 8/8.1 product key which was "genuine" before this upgrade... sigh.

</p><p>So people with the same problem may have to find a way to share an internet connection (using their smartphone if anything else, e.g. Android &gt; parameters &gt; network &gt; share connection &gt; USB [labels may be different as i don't have Android in English]) and
 let Windows Update fixes that issue. </p>

            <p>Win 8.1 Pro/Media Center x64 -&gt; Win 10 Pro x64. Same issue here. System is Gigabyte&nbsp;Gigabyte GA-P55M-UD4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the trick of connecting through the tethered smartphone to get WinUpdates. Spent a lot of bytes of traffic. Got all the updates on. Still Win10 sees no network adapter. Also tried&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">to install the
 latest drivers from Realtek and ended after the message "The Realtek Network Controller was not found. If Deep Sleep Mode is enabled Please Plug the Cable."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw another thread invoking third party VPN software as the issue. There is none here.<br />
</p>
<p>Machine worked fine under 8.1. That network is how it got Win 10 installed.<br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">At somewhat of a loss what to try next, but a Windows 10 PC that isn't on the 'net is about as useless as a plain rock. No Yellow Bangs in Device Manager. Just no hint what its issue is. Can't just leave
 the machine useless until some Microsoft Miracle occurs. These Realtek GBE controllers are not exactly uncommon. Hard to fathom why there aren't more reports of this and/or why Win10 made it this far with this just not working. There are lots of threads older
 than the last week or so on Realtek GBE Win10 issues.</span></p>

            you have to drop back to win 8.1 until this gets fixed. go to recovery and you will see an option to go back to the previous install. it works very well. i dropped back to win 8.1 then tried the upgrade again (it had the same issue) then dropped back to
 8.1 again. i also opened a ticket with realtek who told me that they had worked with microsoft for win 10 drivers but i guess the issue is that at least on mine, the hardware is older and they must have missed something. they said they would be coming out
 with downloadable drivers in the near future.

            <p>I'm generally averse to giving up so much ground gained as this huge update. I could get to the point of reverting to 8.1, but I'm not there just yet. My Plan B is to get a cheap USB-Ethernet adapter and see if Win10 can deal with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also wondering if this is purely a Realtek problem--because Device Manager isn't even showing the hardware in Yellow Bang state. Maybe they've changed how Device Manager works with Win10, but that's what I'd expect if this was purely an issue with the
 Realtek driver. And we did have the report n this thread that a WinUpdate solved this problem for one Realtek 8111D user. OTOH, mine is also supposedly 8111D per Gigabyte.</p>

            After some conversation with Realtek, I went into BIOS settings to look around. Integrated LAN setting in BIOS was enabled. Just as a guess, I DISABLED a setting Gigabyte calls GreenLAN. (The help suggests it has something to do with turning the LAN off
 if activity is not detected at the cable port.) That seems to have done the trick!

            <p>After upgrading my PC to Windows 10, the realtek NIC driver was in a stopped state in device manager - unable to start</p>
<p>
</p><p>Motherboard is a Gigabyte EX58-UD4P</p>
<p>
</p><p>I resolved the issue by downloading the latest realtek driver from station-drivers - listed as a Windows 10 driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.station-drivers.com/index.php?option=com_remository&amp;Itemid=353&amp;func=fileinfo&amp;id=1493</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried updating the device driver from device manager and just pointing it to the extracted folder it didn't work just saying I was already running the best driver.&nbsp; Running the setup file from the extracted folder updated the driver correctly.</p>

            it is interesting. i tried it from my surface pro running windows 10 and the download worked. i will try again to upgrade my laptop to win 10 tonight and see if this driver fixes the problem.

It's 7.4 but seemed to have corrected itself after opening and closing a few times. Thanks anyway. It just seemed like a minor glitch at the time anyway - and I guess it was.&nbsp;

    <title>Xbox One controller from another room&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One controller from another room&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I currently have my Xbox one in my living room, I have used an HDMI extender so I can see the XBox one screen upstairs in my bedroom, the controller is JUST out of range when I am in bed. &nbsp; Are there any methods of extending the range of the controller?
 &nbsp;Cabled is out of the question ? am afraid. &nbsp;I was thinking USB over a powerplug &nbsp;of a remote sender type of setup?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>DHCP Off Causing Lack of Internet Access At Computer Startup - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            DHCP Off Causing Lack of Internet Access At Computer Startup</h2>
                    Whenever I turn on my computer, I notice that it has no internet access.&nbsp; Running the Network Troubleshooter shows that it's because DHCP is off.&nbsp; I have a reason why I want to use a static IP address, though, so this is a problem for me.&nbsp; Whenever I switch
 to manual IP settings without actually turning DHCP off myself, I still get the same problem and the reason is always "DHCP is off for 'Wi-Fi'".&nbsp; I'm using Windows 10 Home Single Language, version 1803 Build 17134.590.&nbsp; What can I do to fix this?

    <title>Simple way to repair corrupted folders in Windows Live Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexcen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Simple way to repair corrupted folders in Windows Live Mail &#40;messages there, but not openable&#41;</h2>
                    <p>This is not a QUESTION, but an ANSWER to a question locked long ago, but might still be bothering users of Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is as follows:</p>
<p>You go into a storage, or other, folder of email in WLM. Let's call it, for example, TAXINFO2016.</p>
<p>All the expected emails appear to be there. That is the subject lines, etc., show as expected.</p>
<p>You click on an email to open it and it opens to the content of a different email than the subject line indicates.</p>
<p>You do the same with other emails and each one opens up the SAME inappropriate email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's&nbsp;a relatively simple procedure&nbsp;I finally used that worked, after trying many complex Microsoft and other procedures that (a) did not work and (b) were reported by many frustrated users to not help:</p>
<p>
</p><p>#&nbsp;Use the WLM export email function to&nbsp;export the emails from the misbehaving email folder to a folder outside WLM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this example you could name that newly created export folder TAXINFO2016-rescue.</p>
<p>#&nbsp;IN WLM&nbsp;create a new email folder with a different name than the misbehaving folder but similar enough to identify it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's say you call it TAXINFO2016-good.</p>
<p># In WLM open that new empty folder.</p>
<p>#&nbsp;Adjust the size of the WLM window&nbsp;to something not&nbsp;occupying full screen.</p>
<p># Open the exported email's folder in a position on screen where you can see the open TAXINFO2016-good folder.</p>
<p># Drag the emails (they'll have names such as 0D944B10-0000002C.eml) from the export folder onto/into the TAXINFO2016-good folder in the WML interface.&nbsp; (If for some reason drag-n-drop doesn't work, use copy and paste.)</p>
<p># In the WLM interface make sure the contents of TAXINFO2016-good are behaving properly.</p>
<p># Close and reopen WLM to make sure that folder is still behaving properly. </p>
<p># In WLM delete the old corruptly indexed TAXINFO2016 storage folder.</p>
<p># ****** BACKUP YOUR WHOLE COMPUTER&nbsp;****** </p>
<p>(What, you mean you don't do whole computer backups? &lt;g&gt;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked for me. It's pretty simple and fast compared to many of the other proposed fixes that were reported to not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One finally related tip:</p>
<p>I had for a year been filing certain related incoming email in one storage folder ASSUMING all was well in that folder because it looked OK.</p>
<p>That is subject lines, dates, etc., all looked as expected. </p>
<p>It wasn't until the end of the year when I needed to refer to one email in there that I discovered the frustrating corrupted index issue.</p>
<p>So if you've got some storage or other folder that's important, take a peek in there and try to open a couple of them BEFORE you need them.</p>
<p>And if you discover the folder has gone bad don't keep dragging new inhabitants into it until it's fixed.</p>
<p>Or at least make a new uncorrupted folder for future filings of that topic. ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>HTH</p>
<p>Alex</p>

<p>Hello Alex ,&nbsp; something that you&nbsp; could possibly help me with?</p>
<p><span>I have a Dell Desktop using Windows 10 MS edge, IE. 3 days ago it crashed and my only option was to use the Dell Reset option to recover my folders and files, I lost all my apps when doing so, I was using Windows Live mail as my email app
 ,now it is gone and I had many things stored in the drafts and such, I cant find them, I did open another&nbsp; account that was available in the windows 10 which is a pop3 account as I wanted to use the same email address I have had for 18 years.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; it is like (......cebridge.net) and&nbsp; many people know this is the way to contact me.</span></p>
<p><span>Is there some way to re-open the Windows live mail account or even find and import my data from the WLM to this new pop 3 account?</span></p>

<h2>            Aero disabled after Platform Update for Windows 7 &#40;KB2670838&#41; installed</h2>
                    Hi, my PC has just re-booted after installing update&nbsp;KB2670838 and since it has restarted Aero is no longer working! &nbsp;I've tried all the usual things i.e.&nbsp;
<div>Run&nbsp;<strong>SFC /SCANNOW - </strong>no issues found</div>
<div>Stopped and Restarted&nbsp;<strong>Desktop Window Manager Session Manager</strong> Service - Service showing as running OK, No Change</div>
<div>Run Aero&nbsp;troubleshooter&nbsp;which reports one issue&nbsp;<strong>Desktop Window Manager Disabled</strong></div>
<div>I've also rebooted several times while attempting repairs</div>
<div>I'm now in the process of downloading the latest video driver to see if that will rectify the issue (I update all drivers on a regular basis as a matter of course)</div>
<div>Apart from uninstalling the update or rolling back to an earlier point does anyone have any other ideas?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>**** UPDATE ****</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Well updating video drivers made no difference, so I uninstalled the update and just like magic Aero has returned. &nbsp;</div>
<div>Won't be reinstalling that update again until they've fixed the error!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Hope this helps.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cheers,</div>
<div><br />

            Hi Palcouk,
<div>I usually try and keep my system as up to date as possible, I do a lot of graphics work so tend to keep my Vid driver up to date to ensure it's working at it's optimum. &nbsp;I'll be a lot more cautious with MS updates in future though! &nbsp;Have to say I've been
 lucky as this is the first update problem I've had since installing Win 7 in 2009. &nbsp;
<div>Uninstalling the update put&nbsp;everything&nbsp;&nbsp;right again by the way :o)
<div><br />
<div>Cheers,</div>

            Interesting, it's clearly listed as optional on my Windows update dialog.
<div><br />
<div>The other question is why Windows chose to automatically install this but not other updates listed as optional.</div>

It definitely&nbsp;installed automaticaly&nbsp;at first&nbsp;not as other optional updates that always need to be selected manually.&nbsp;It&nbsp;seems like they changed it to optional after they started receiving error reports, because after I unistalled it it reapeared in the optional
 updates list but it no longer installs by itself, with the same exact update settings as I had before.</p>

<p>Hello LucasLie. May I ask, where did you purchase the game? Was it through the Xbox Marketplace, another on-line retailer or second-hand hard copy through retailer? Please let me know and we can try to go from there. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Programs not Opening unless restarted</h2>
                    
<p>I will leave my computer on for a couple hours at a time and come back to find that non of my files will open. They will glow as if they are opening and the processing icon pops up nest to the mouse, then both go away and the program never opens.</p>
<p>When this happens, the only program i can get to open is Ventrilo and even when i do, it is not functioning properly.</p>
<p>The other thing that happens is that when i try to open Word it gives me an error message that says there is not enough memory to run this application, which is inherently ridiculous seeing as how i have 12GB or RAM and my desktop app tells me that i am
 only using 20-30% of it.</p>
<p>I restart my computer when this happens and it works after that. I can use it endlessly the problem won't occur, but when i leave it for a number of hours the problem is back.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a driver issue or something of that sort so i will post my computer hardware config as well:</p>
<p>ASUS formula III Rampage</p>
<p>Intel i7 950 quad core</p>
<p>Corsair Dominator triple channel 12 GB</p>

<p>Hello General XIII,</p>
<p>I suggest a clean boot to see if there is a conflicting program that could be causing a problem.<br />
You will Disable all startup items and third party services when booting. This method will help us determine if this issue is caused by a loading program or service.</p>
<p><br />
The steps below will place your computer into a “clean boot”, meaning using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that we can determine whether a background program is interfering.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start on your Desktop<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type msconfig in the Start Search box and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted, click Restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Once the computer is back to your Desktop, check to see if you are still having the problem.</p>
<p>If the issue is resolved by placing the machine in “clean boot” then we have some sort of third party application and or service running that is possibly interfering. To determine which program(s) and or service(s) that is causing this, we would need to
 go back into “msconfig” and start to enable programs and services and reboot until we see which one causes the problem.&nbsp; This can be a long process but is needed to find the conflicting program.</p>
<p>If placing the computer in “clean boot” does not fix the issue or after the troubleshooting is done, follow the steps above “To return your computer back to normal boot”.</p>
<p>KB 929135 - How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>How to set your computer back, to boot normal: <br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Click the Start orb on your Desktop<br />
2. In the Start Search box. Type msconfig, and then press ENTER. <br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
Click the General tab. <br />
3. Click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.<br />
4. When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.</p>
<p>This may take some troubleshooting time so reply back with an update when you get a chance.</p>

    <title>COMPUTER HANGS OR FREEZES AFTER INSTALLING WINDOWS 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zestyts  say:</h3>
<h2>            COMPUTER HANGS OR FREEZES AFTER INSTALLING WINDOWS 8</h2>
                    Windows 8 will freeze upon usage, and even after a fresh installation. My very first time installing Windows 8 I did not have this problem at all, and my hardware has not changed since then. I have no problems in Windows 7, just in Windows 8. After a few
 minutes of using Windows 8, my entire computer will freeze and the only way to get "past" it is to restart my computer. I have my chipset drivers, but that didn't help at all. The problem does not exist in safe mode, but once I boot out of Safe Mode, even
 when I load basic drivers only, Windows 8 will still freeze. I've tried updating my video card drivers, and ccleaner, but that didn't help. I tried writing a 0 to every bit on my hard drive, but that also doesn't help. I tried to use the SeaTools since it's
 a SeaGate, but that didn't help. I have also tried just installing windows 8, logging in to my machine, and just sitting in metro without doing anything else, and it will still freeze, and this is of course coming from a fresh installation. I have tried different
 hard drives, but they still give me the same problem. I have tried different ram, and video cards, but same problem. I ran a disk check, and the troubleshooter that comes with Windows 8, but that doesn't help. I get freezing without installing anything after
 a reinstallation. What bothers me the most, is that it worked the very first time I installed Windows 8. I have also used the consumer preview, the developer preview, and all the other versions of Windows 8. I forgot to mention I'm running Windows 8 64bit
 Professional, and my Windows 7 is also 64 bit Professional. My Windows 7 key is no longer valid because I used it on my laptop, so I can only test things on it for 30 days.

            <p>Hi Zesty, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><br />
Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and posting your query on Microsoft community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
From your issue description, I understand that after installing Windows 8 your computer hangs or freezes.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
I suggest you disconnect all the external devices connected to the computer and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I also want you to use only one video card and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Now let’s try some steps for resolving this issue, which I have described as methods given below.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong> I suggest you follow the article and instructions mentioned in the article.<br />
<strong>Windows hangs or freezes</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2681286" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2681286</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong> Perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps given in the link below to start the computer in clean boot.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> After performing clean boot refer to the article How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot to boot to normal mode.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Hope this information helps you. If you need any further assistance or information about Windows, I will be glad to help you.<br />

            Well, this is where it gets weird because I eventually found what my problem was and fixed it, but it was only during this time where I had the problem. For some odd reason my computer didn't like that my cpu didn't have drivers with it since the chipset
 I have is for Vista, so it didn't install anything on Windows 8. Once I found individual drivers for my cpu that was made for 7, I was able to get it to work on 8. Well, these drivers were kind of sketchy and were made from some random person. Since I fixed
 my problem, my hard drive ended up crashing and I did end up having to install on a few different hard drives (I had to wipe and start over about seven times). Each time though, I didn't need any drivers and my computer worked fine.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>tldr; missing cpu drivers, found homemade ones online, profit</div>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused. I will assist you with this.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To better understand the issue please let us know </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Have you made any recent any changes prior to this issue?</li><li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li><li>Which build is currently installed in your computer?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(13, 13, 13, 1)">This issue may happen due to software conflicts or virus infection.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Follow the steps below to check the issue occurs in safe mode if not perform a clean boot please follow the steps below :</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: Safe mode</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Safe mode starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers. It can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC. For example, if the problem doesn't happen in safe mode, you'll know default settings and basic device drivers
 aren't causing the issue.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: Cleanboot</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would also suggest you to do a clean boot and check if any third party apps are causing the issue.
</span><span>Placing the computer in a clean boot state can reduce software conflicts and help identify the root cause of the issue.
</span></span></p>

<h2>            Error Code 1619 Java &#40;Verify that the file exists&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am attempting to install Java on my computer (Currently running windows 8.1)</p>
<p>At the end of it, I receive the error code 1619.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have researched on how to fix it, what may be causing it etc</p>
<p>I had attempted to install it manually aswell by locating the msi file and running the file like that, When i attempt to i get this error..</p>
<p>"Error reading from file</p>
<p>C:\Users\(name)\AppData\LocalLow\Sun\Java\jre1.8.0_25\jre1.8.0_25full.msic</p>
<p>Verfiy that the file exists and that you can access it."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done these steps and none have worked successfully for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: &nbsp;</span></strong><span>Check the Windows Installer Service.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click Start, type "services.msc" (without quotes) and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Double-click “Windows Installer” in the Services list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On the General tab, make sure the service is started under “Service status”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If the service is not already running, under Service status, click Start, and then click OK.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: &nbsp;</span></strong><span>Unregister and re-register the Windows Installer</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click<span>Start</span>, click&nbsp;<span>Run</span>, type “<span>MSIEXEC /UNREGISTER”</span>, and then click<span>OK</span>.
 Even if you do this correctly, it may look like nothing occurs.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click<span>Start</span>, click&nbsp;<span>Run</span>, type “<span>MSIEXEC /REGSERVER”</span>, and then click<span>OK</span>.
 Even if you do this correctly, it may look like nothing occurs, or you may briefly see an hourglass. After you run this command, the operation is complete.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Try installing the application again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Temporarily disable the computer`s anti-virus program\firewall and check if the issue persists. If no issue occurs, then you might need to check settings within the security
 software.</span></p>

            <p>Hey Yash,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>D3D error usually comes up if there is some DirectX problem on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run the DirectX tool on the computer to check if there is any video driver problem on the computer.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/diagnosing-basic-problems-with-directx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/diagnosing-basic-problems-with-directx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If no issues show up in the DirectX tool, then uninstall and reinstall the game from Turn Windows Features on or off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span><span><font>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></span><span>Click on
<strong>Start</strong> and then type <strong>Turn windows features on or off</strong> and press enter.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span><span><font>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></span><span>Press the Plus mark in front of
<strong>Games</strong> and remove the check mark from <strong>Chess and Mahjong titans.</strong></span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span><span><font>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></span><span>Press ok and restart the computer.</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span><span><font>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></font></span></span><span>Once the computer is restarted, go to same location and place a check mark for
<strong>Mahjong Titans and Chess</strong>&nbsp;and press ok and restart the computer.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Hope this may help you fix the issue. If you have any concerns, please let us know.</font></p>

<h3> _minkzar  say:</h3>
<h2>            DirectX 9 - windows display driver     &#40;my version of vista supports windows arro but does not display it&#41;</h2>
                    My current fourth problem after re installation.<br />
<br />
How do I fix this, apparently I need:<br />
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>•</td>
<td>
<p>1-gigahertz (GHz) 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•</td>
<td>
<p>1 gigabyte (GB) of 
random access memory (RAM)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>•</td>
<td>
<p>128-megabyte (MB) graphics card</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Aero also requires a DirectX 9 class graphics processor that supports a Windows Display Driver Model Driver, Pixel Shader 2.0 in hardware, and 32 bits per pixel.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Which I had.. of course, its the same computer, just been wiped and re installed....<br />
<br />
<br />
What do i need to do?</p>

            Did you install the video drivers? If not, that's your next step. General drivers information:<br />
<br />
Never get drivers from Windows Update. Get them from:<br />
<br />
1. The device mftr.'s website; OR<br />
2. The motherboard mftr.'s website if hardware is onboard; OR<br />
3. The OEM's website for your specific machine if you have an OEM computer (HP, Dell, Sony, etc.).<br />
<br />
Read the installation instructions on the website where you get the drivers.<br />
<br />
To find out what hardware is in your computer:<br />
<br />
1. Read any documentation you got when you bought the computer.<br />
2. If the computer is OEM, go to the OEM's website for your specific model machine and look at the specs (you'll be there to get the drivers anyway)<br />
3. Download, install and run a free system inventory program like Belarc Advisor or System Information for Windows.<br />

            Hi  wp51dos 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Interesting, because it is working here just fine, striked those three keys at the desktop and it created the folder. 
<br />
<br />Are you running the latest version of Windows 10 1809 with all cumulative updates installed?

            Hi wp51dos
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To start with, please execute following steps and let me know
<br />
<br />1. CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to start Task Manager
<br />Locate Windows Explorer in Processes tab &gt; Right Click &gt; End Task
<br />Now at the top File &gt; Run new task &gt; Put explorer.exe and Enter
<br />
<br />2. To test only - Create a New User Account and login with this new User Account to rule out corruption in user profile
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402692...</a>
<br />
<br />3. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            thank you for the reply. I am running the latest version of the Windows 10 (1809 17763.379) . Do you know any way to show which hotkeys are active? Perhaps I or one of the people at work changed it to something else (if so, whatever it was pointing toward

            Hi PM.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Some Updates will sort themselves out in a few days so I'd wait to see.  If not or they are bothering you then here are steps you can take:  
<br />
<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />A running log of Update History with known issues is here: 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619/windows-10-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/446461...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />5) What I'd do at this point if you haven't yet is install latest Version 1809 by installing Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />6) If problems with Updates have become chronic and especially if you have other performance problems, be aware that what we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls Windows while shedding factory bloatware that can cause issues and affect performance, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  If not just ask back anything else you need.  I'll be standing by here to help as needed with any of the steps, and will continue to help until the problem is resolved.

<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.
