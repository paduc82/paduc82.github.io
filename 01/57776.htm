<h2>            How much space will Windows 10 Build 10130 eat&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I want to run Windows 10 Build 10130 on my virtual machine. But I heard that when Build 10049 released, it sucked a hungry 26 GB of your hard disk. But since this is a much later build, how much space will Windows 10 take? And what size hard disk should
 I give it in my virtual machine? I'm wanting to give it 60 GB maximum storage, is that enough?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more thing. I have 8 GBs of RAM. Should I give at least 2 GBs if that is safe? I'm sorry for asking these and I have read the system requirements! I just what like to be sure if that is ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers and good luck to the developers of Windows 10!</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be <strong>25 GB</strong> sufficient for creating new virtual hard disk to install that build. I've installed it on my Oracle VirtualBox by selecting settings of
<strong>Windows 8.1 (32-bit/64-bit)</strong> and it's working perfectly with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can select&nbsp;<em>RAM: 1 GB (32-bit) or 2 GB (64-bit).</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps, Good luck :)</p>

    <title>New USB keyboard not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> psykr0  say:</h3>
<h2>            New USB keyboard not working</h2>
                    I got a new logitech g15 keyboard, when i first plugged it in to the usb port at the back of the computer, it didnt power up until the login screen, that was fine, i thought it could be a bios setting,&nbsp;after i logged in i installed the k/b software, and
 done my usual emails etc....i&nbsp;left the pc about 30min, when i came back the k/b was still powered up and the screen saver was on..which is normal..im running my pc in high performance mode.<br />
i found the keyboard didnt wake the screen, i had to move the mouse, then i realised none of the keys on the k/b work, even the numlock led wasnt on anymore, none of the normal keys or media keys work, i can only get the G keys to work thru the software.
<br />
i&nbsp; restarted the pc..and now the keyboard doesnt power up at all until after i login, which means i cant login when using the k/b.so ive gone to the logitech website and d/l the latest software and installed it, and no improvement<br />
ive tried many different configurations etc, and updating drivers thru device manager etc.<br />
in device manager it shows a HID keyboard device and says its working fine, but its not working at all<br />
under the usb controllers it shows an unknown device and a generic usb hub where the k/b device is located in that submenu. i think it calls it a hub coz the k/b has 2 usb1.1 ports in it, when i uninstall all those disappear, when i reinstall i get a little
 icon saying usb device not recognised, and it goes back to the way i jus mentioned<br />
its very frustrating due to the fact when i first plugged it in the keys worked then after 30min of no activity i come back and it doesnt work...<br />
i hope someone can shed some light on my problem.

            hello !<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting at Microsoft Forums !<br />
<br />
it looks like your keyboard is going in sleep mode somehow, or is not getting enough power. Can you tell us your motherboard make and model ? and a bit about your power supply ?<br />

            <p>Actually.... I haven't even sold my original Xbox One yet. So I'll have two Xbox One's. One where I can use my Kinect with without the need for a Kinect adaptor (original models have a dedicated Kinect port built in)..... and the other for high visual fidelity-ness. Found out EBay Australia is selling a Kinect adaptor for a silly price of AU$249, the amazon doesn't ship to NZ with this product. Microsoft sold it for NZ$64 but is permanently out of stock. And Mightyape NZ last sold one early last month. Kind of been unprepared and was expecting Microsoft being the manufacturer to be in stock which they aren't. </p>

            <p>And while on the subject of Kinect, I just found out my Xbox 360 Slim 250GB console has a dedicated Kinect port. But it's for the 360 Kinect which I've never had. Kinect is a great innovative piece of technology. Greatly cheaper than VR (which costs a couple of hundred dollars, Sony has set a price of RRP NZ$649 for there's). I don't think I'll invest in second hand used Kinect hardware. But I'm glad Microsoft pushed me to get Kinect for Xbox One with the day one edition.

            <p>"If people think Kinect is dead, why is this device sold out??"</p><p><br /></p><p>There's a delineation between being "sold out" and stores merely clearing their existing stock. In some quarters, it's known as a fire sale, where previously top-end merch is heavily discounted in order to clear the shelves. Kinect is about as dead as my beloved HD DVD add-on (aka peripheral) that was also "sold out" when it failed to click with buyers. However, retailers are all too familiar with the ritual of spring cleaning... you have to move old stock in order to make room for new stock!</p><p><br /></p><p>No point in pretending that Kinect was anything other than an experiment that failed. If you're planning to spend big bucks to somehow keep the memory alive, more power to ya, but speaking from painful experience: my beloved HD DVD peripheral has now been consigned to its official "grave" - the packing carton. #RustInPeaceKinect&nbsp;</p>

I don't think I'll invest in second hand used Kinect hardware. But I'm glad Microsoft pushed me to get Kinect for Xbox One with the day one edition. Before people whined about paying an extra $100 and how voice commands was reserved for Kinect users once. </p><p><br /></p><p>Here's the things I've enjoyed from have Kinect for Xbox One. </p><p><br /></p><p>1. sign in securely on my console without inputting a pin or password</p><p>2. not being old school by just being a controller user</p><p>3. playing Kinect Sports Rivals (jet boating) and Zoo Tycoon (feeding animals, I believe Frontier is rolling out an Ultimate Edition of Zoo Tycoon for Xbox too)</p><p>4.

 </blockquote> <p>1:&nbsp; I can sign in just with my controller, don't have to put in a pin or anything.</p><p>2:&nbsp; Controllers will always have their place</p><p>3:&nbsp; Kinect games are pretty much total garbage, yes there is the odd gem like Kinect Sports Rivals, but the vast majority use the Kinect in tiny little ways (like Zoo Tycoon) that after the first few times, just becomes more hassle than enough.</p><p>4:&nbsp; Shame very few people used those QR&nbsp;codes, vast majority of codes I've had in games were all 25 code ones.</p><p>5:&nbsp; Kinect could be used for party chat, but let me tell you its nowhere near as good as a dedicated headset.</p><p>6:&nbsp; Video chat, really? I bought the Xbox for games, not for video chat, but each to their own I suppose.</p><p>7:&nbsp; Voice commands sometimes work and sometimes don't, even worse when your playing a game with a bunch of mates all chatting away and all of a sudden your console thinks it hears one of the trigger words and pauses.</p><p><br /><

            Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to do the Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>This is multi-question post, my apologies if it does not conform to this forum's protocol, I thought it would make more sense, than posting 3 different questions related to the same topic. Hope somebody&nbsp;more intelligent than I, can enlighten my electronically
 challenged brain!</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>My HP p6320y desktop came w/a&nbsp;</b><b>upgraded&nbsp;</b><b>mother-board <u>MSI 785GM-E51 (FX) military class II</u>. It has DDR3 w/4 DIMM slots. According to the manual, &nbsp;I can use it in "dual-channel" mode. What are the pros and cons between DDR2 and DDR3,
 &amp; single or dual channel?</b></div>
<div><b>Right now, &nbsp;it has two 4GB memory modules installed in the 2 first slots (DIMM 1 &amp; 2)</b></div>
<div><b>The manual specifies to be sure not to interchange DDR2 &amp; DDR3. &nbsp;Hence, &nbsp;if I want to max out my ram, &amp; run it in dual channel mode. I need to fill all 4 DIMM slots w/4GB DDR3 memory modules for a total= 16GB RAM.</b></div>
<div><b>Would running my M/board in dual channel mode w/16GB max. RAM make my system perform substantially faster/visibly better? Or could I use the cost of 2 xtra memory modules in a different way to give me a clearly observable bump in performance?</b></div>
<div><b>While were on boosting performance, would upgrading my current CPU (quad core AM3 phenom 2.7Ghz) to something above 3.0Ghz, be worth the effort &amp; produce a observable bump in speed? &nbsp;Or would doing both be over-killing the &nbsp;M/board's potential?</b></div>
<div><b>Finally, the manual explains how to overclock my FSB in 3 incremental stages: 10%, 15%, 20%. Is it truly a hi-risk to ovr./clk. in&nbsp;comparison&nbsp;to the increase gained? Even on the low setting-10%? Would an extra fan counter the heat rise, thus allowing
 a full life span?</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>Thanks kindly for any advice, &nbsp;Alan&nbsp;</b></div>

            <blockquote><b>Hi J.W,</b>
<div>Yeah I've gathered from Tom's Hardware.com multiple posts that Samsung 840 Pro is one of the&nbsp;preferred&nbsp;SSDs. &nbsp;I grasp why it boots up &amp; loads much quicker than a mechanical drive, which is inherently flawed by moving parts that wear-out.
<strong>But&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;its relatively small storage require your O.S to switch to (I assume) a bigger, secondary 1-2TB HDD</strong> in order to load what your looking for, thus partially bottle-necking the speed of the SSD?&nbsp;Isn't&nbsp;the best currently&nbsp;available&nbsp;SSD
 exceed the average posted speed I have read?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>1) Windows and a decent amount of Data files can fit on a single 250GB SSD. There is no bottle neck. I use my larger hard drives for backups, file downloads, a large (46GB) of photos.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Not cetain as to the SSD speed benchmarks you read, post al iink.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So we are talking about a hybrid system? Albeit, still outperforms the best mechanical drives, but appears to me that the full potential of an SSD is limited by having to switch back and forth to obtain data in the larger secondary HDD.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>2) Mine is a hybrid but its far faster than any hard drive solution.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Is it not possible to employ 1 or more additional SSDs (money not being a factor!) so the entire system relies solely on the SSDs? Or would the connection between them be a bottle-neck?&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>3) You can install as many SSD units as you have SATA-III ports, Using a SATA-II port will readuc the data tranfer speed but still far faster than a hard drive (about 2.5x faster)</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>But, I am truly excited about this new direction in HD tech. I'm already imagining a complete system relying solely on SSDs for both work &amp; storage. I have a 1000$ budget which was earmarked to upgrade my semi-factory HP desktop. I have lots of external
 storage to save data, would you&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;a bigger power supply, a overclocked i3 chip, better M/Brd. &amp; graphics card?</b></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>4) Just start with moving Windows from a hard drive to an SSD. Then you can be the judge if you need to upgrade anything else. A 500GB SSD will cost about $550 or a 256GB about $225 if you do some shopping.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Is heat an issue w/SSDs? should I be thinking about liquid cooling or would a really good air ventilation setup suffice?&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>5) SSD unit draw very little power (About 2 Watts or less) and by themselve require no extra cooling. A larger power supply would only be needed if you start upgrading other components like the CPU and Graphics card.</strong></div>

            <p>If your into games then a better graphics card might help, but with the card upgrade you also need to check to see if your existing power supply can handle to new cards power requirements, some cards can demand up to 300 watts of power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just built an i7 2600K, mild overclock to 4.1GHz and 8GB of memory, never bothered to add the extra 2 memory sticks to bump it up to 16GB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My other 17 2600K is also set to 4.1Ghz, but has a 256GB Solid State Drive (SSD) for Windows and 3 other hard drives for data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Z-28, mine was a Chevell SS 327, top speed about 180 to 190&nbsp;MPH overclocked to 7200 RPM. Zero to 90MPH in 1st gear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To sum it up an SSD would be the best performance boost, You just need to invest in a good Image Backup / Cloneing software app to move the Windows from the hard drive to the SSD.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update Problems...Code 80070643</h2>
                    <p>I had a problem with Windows update not working.&nbsp; I decided to completely start over so I went back to it reformatting my disk and installing factory settings.&nbsp; The odd thing is that I get the exact same error I was getting before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem:</p>
<p>When accessing Windows Update I get the message "To check for updates, you must first install an update for Windows Update.&nbsp; Your automatic settings will not change"&nbsp; I push the Install Now button and the window disappears for a few seconds and then comes
 back with the error message "Code 80070643 Windows encountered an unknown error".&nbsp; After reviewing the Update History it is Windows Update Agent 7.6.7600.256 that fails.</p>
<p>Attempted solutions:</p>
<p>I went and tried to get help with this error but none of the following have worked.&nbsp; Also it should be noted that I do not have Microsoft Office installed.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Tried Microsoft Fix It</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I have run the System File Checker.&nbsp; Found nothing.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Made sure all Anti Virus software was disabled.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I saved the best for last.&nbsp; One of the solutions was to repair NET Framework.&nbsp; Couldn't do that because it is not listed in my installed programs.&nbsp; So I went to try and install that and I get "a fatal error has occured" when attempting to install.&nbsp; Tried
 to install NET Framework 3.5 and 4.5 also but all failed.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; When I go to Turn Windows features on or off I see Microsoft NET Framework 3.5.1 but it has a solid blue box and not checked.&nbsp; Two Wondows Communication folders are underneath that are not checked.&nbsp; When I try to check them, it tries to install&nbsp; but
 then I get the message "An error has occured. Not all of the features were successfully installed" I reboot only to find the box is solid blue again.</p>
<p>6. Tried the Microsoft NET Framework repair tool but no success.</p>
<p>After spending hours and hours and&nbsp;still having to reinstall all of my programs since I wiped the drive clean, I am out of ideas.&nbsp; Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Thanks so much for responding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Fix It I have been using is 50123.&nbsp; When&nbsp;I try to run the Fix It that you suggested in your reply under method 1, I get a Code 8004FE2C error saying the program encountered an error trying to contact the server.&nbsp; I guess I could try the "Fix
 It Myself Option"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to insatall the Hotfix you suggested in Method 2 but still get the same messages and error when&nbsp;I check for updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried the other suggestions from the link you provided but not successful.&nbsp; Most suggestions applied to those who were running Microsoft Office.&nbsp; I am not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am willing to completely wipe the drive clean and install using factory presets which is installed on a separate&nbsp;partition of the hard drive.&nbsp; I have already done this once and it did not fix the problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is NET Framework required for Winows Update to work?&nbsp; Should I be concentrationg on getting that installed first?&nbsp; Is there a way I could manually update Windows without having to use Windows Update?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

<p>Hiya!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul from the Xbox Forums Team here to assist with the issue, it looks like resident evil 5 is giving you some issues when launching the game. The best advice I can give to help resolve this issue is to try

<p><br />
Hello cathygrasso,</p>
<p>To have a windows.old folder you must have done a Custom Installation at some point.</p>
<p>The windows.old folder contains Photos, Music, etc from the previous installation.</p>
<p>After a Custom Installation you have to&nbsp;copy your Data over.</p>
<p>You do not say whether you are worried about losing your Data from your present Installation or from&nbsp;the windows.old folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is how to&nbsp;retrieve the Data that is in the windows.old folder:</p>
"How to restore your personal files after you perform a custom installation of Windows Vista or of Windows 7"
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/932912" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/932912</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the other person gave you XP cleanup information, NOT Vista</p>
<p>These are VISTA Answer Forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should assist you with Vista:</p>
"Delete files using Disk Cleanup"
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Delete-files-using-Disk-Cleanup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Delete-files-using-Disk-Cleanup</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read all the options there about deleting Temp Internet Files, Temp Files, etc and&nbsp;Programs that you do not use and also deleting&nbsp;non essential System Restore Points, leaving only the latest one.</p>

<p>In Admin dashboard E3 and Cloud PBX is listed to User.</p>
<p>In **** Admin center under Voice/Voice Users no User is listed or currently licensed for PBX.

<h2>            Windows 10 Crashes</h2>
                    <p>I've had windows 10 for a while now and am generally quite pleased with it. However, it just upgraded itself and now I can't do anything. It crashes as soon as i I log in, I can't even open the start menu before it crashes, greys out the screen and comes
 up with an error message "windows is not responding, it may work again if you wait". I waited...and it didn't work, &nbsp;I clicked 'end program' and it did nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I degrade to get the windows 10 I had before that actually worked or do I have to just wait for the next automatic upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work in film and games so I really need my pc to work again.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>1- I upgraded from windows 7</p>
<p>2- one or both had been unintentionally installed at some point when it was windows 7 but not windows 10 and it has been completely wiped numerous times since then anyway</p>
<p>3- I built the pc and installed the OS and software myself: neither of them were there when I got it</p>
<p>4- I have run neither of them, just uninstalled through the programs list</p>
<p>

<h2>            Lag issues - Compaq CQ56 - AMD V140 dual-core processor</h2>
                    <p>I am having lag issues on my Compaq CQ-56 with an AMD V140 2.2Ghz dual-core processor, 8 gigs RAM, 10/100 LAN&nbsp;and a 320 gig HDD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My desktop/backup computer has Windows 7 Pro and can open programs and web browser tabs much faster than my laptop, despite almost identical specs. The most glaring difference is that my laptop has Windows 7 Home installed by HP and my desktop has Windows
 7 Pro on a clean install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the manufacturer-installed 'bloatware' to blame, requiring a clean install of Windows 7 Home instead of using the Compaq Recovery Console, or is there another way to fix this?</p>

<h2>            Skyrim mods</h2>
                    
<p>So, I recently got Skyrim for PC and I gotta say some of the mods are fantastic. Loving the Moonpath to Elsweyr and the graphic enhancer mods. However, I'm here to say about the M2E mod. It's pretty much a free DLC. It's better than Dawnguard but not as
 good as Dragonborn IMO.&nbsp;</p>

Presuming you have a wireless router at home you need to know the wireless network SSID, encryption type (ie. WPA2 or WPA for example) and encryption key/passphrase/password.</p>
<p>Many routers display the wireless encryption key in plain text. Copy that into the iPad. Check the router users manual or manufacturers support site for help getting into the config pages.</p>
<p>If the router does not display the key you can also see it in the Win 7 wireless properties for your home network. Open the<strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong> and click on
<strong>Manage wirelss networks</strong> at the left. Right click on your wireless network and select<strong>Properties</strong>. Click on the
<strong>Security</strong> tab and check the<strong>Show characters</strong> checkbox. Supply the administrator password to see the key.</p>
<p>More help from Apple...</p>

<p>If you don't have a wireless router you can use a wireless equiped (WiFi) Win 7 computer as a wireless router. Look at using either
<strong>Connectify</strong> or <strong>Virtual Router</strong> that will turn your wireless Win 7 computer (Home Premium or above) into a wireless router.</p>

<p><a href="http://virtualrouter.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://virtualrouter.codeplex.com/</a></p>
<p>There is also <strong>mhotspot</strong>. I have never used it so as always YMMV...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mhotspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mhotspot.com/</a></p>
<p>I have on occasion used Virtual Router to connect my iPod Touch to the internet at locations I did not have wireless (WiFi) access available.</p>

You are aware that these dump files are ~2 to 3 months old, correct? Anyway, we have various different bug checks from the attached DMP files:<br />

<br />
<i>This bug check indicates that the Intel CPU generated a trap and the kernel failed to catch this trap.</i><br />

We can see many tcpip.sys and a few NETIO,.sys calls. These are Microsoft network related calls and routines. We then reach a DirectX Kernel call into a few igdkmd32.sys calls which is the Intel Graphics driver.<br />
<br />
With this said, we likely have a 3rd party source (antivirus, firewall, some 3rd party network app) causing NETBIOS conflicts, and a need to update the video card drivers.<br />
<br />

On one of the many *7F's we have, there are a ton of cfosspeed6.sys calls which is the

We also have a <b>REFERENCE_BY_POINTER (18)</b> bug check.<br />

    <title>Paperport Crashes after Installation of SP2 to Vista - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Paperport Crashes after Installation of SP2 to Vista</h2>
                    I have a Dell E531 system with 4gb ram and lots of HD space.&nbsp; I am using Vista Home Premium.&nbsp; I have been using Paperport 12 Pro on Vista SP1 with no problems.&nbsp; Today I installed the SP2 update to Vista and now the application will not launch.&nbsp; I get an
 error message that Paperport MV extension has stopped working - referring to ppmv.exe.&nbsp; I also get a separate error message with the same information about PdfPro5Hook.exe.&nbsp; The Nuance site recommedned changing DEP to only MS services and functions.&nbsp; This
 did not work.&nbsp; I uninstaled the application, rebooted, then re-installed.&nbsp; It installs fine with no errors - until trying to launch.&nbsp; I then used msconfig to re-boot without the startup items - thus with no A/V and firewall.&nbsp; I then ran the Paperport msi again
 and did a repair install.&nbsp; Same problem.&nbsp; I would appreciate any suggestions.

            Eric,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your detailed and informative reply.&nbsp; Actually I did completely uninstall all of paperport using the method you indicated, as well as using removers such as Revo Uninstaller and JV16 Powertools.&nbsp; These did not help.&nbsp; I did finally get a reply from
 Nuance that worked.&nbsp; They sent me a zip file with new versions of both PPMV.exe and PDFPRO5Hook.exe.&nbsp; After making sure that there were no paperport processes running, I renamed the old files from .exe to .old and then copied the new verasions into the proper
 subdirectories.&nbsp; After this, the application is working again!&nbsp; It took them several weks to answer me (too long) but the reply did solve my problem.&nbsp; The gist of their reply was as follows:<br />
<br />
1. Make sure that PaperPort is not currently running (ensure that the error message is not displayed and the PaprPort.exe process is not running in Windows Task Manager).
<br />
2. Download the PPMV.zip file from the following link: <br />
<a href="http://supportcontent.nuance.com/paperport/12/PPMV.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://supportcontent.nuance.com/paperport/12/PPMV.zip</a>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<br />
3. Double-click the PPMV.zip file and extract the PPMV.exe and PdfPro5Hook.exe files to your Windows Desktop.
<br />
4. Browse to the installation directory of PaperPort 12 (by default it is C:\Program Files\Nuance\PaperPort).
<br />
5. Locate the existing file named PPMV.exe and rename it to&nbsp; PPMV.old . <br />
6. Locate the existing file named PdfPro5Hook.exe and rename it to&nbsp; PdfPro5Hook.old .
<br />
7. Copy the new PPMV.exe and PdfPro5Hook.exe files extracted to the Windows Desktop, then paste them into the PaperPort 12 installation directory (by default it is C:\Program Files\Nuance\PaperPort).
<br />
8. Launch PaperPort 12 and confirm that the application now launches properly. <br />
<br />
I hope this helps others who might be experiencing the same problem!

<h2>            Bug in Task management UI&#58; checkbox greyed out and indented even though still applicable</h2>
                    <p>When editing a task's conditions there is a setting "Stop if the computer switches to battery power", which is by default enabled and greyed out, since the parent setting "Start the task only if the computer in on AC power" is disabled by default. However
 even in that case "Stop if the computer switches to battery power" is still relevant and applied. If one would like to disable that setting, one first have to enable the parent setting, then disable the former greyed out setting and then disable the parent
 setting again.</p>

 it rather conveys the impression that those two settings would be independently of each other.</p>

<p><span>-&gt; With the setting you see below, a task that is started under AC power will continue to run when mains power is lost. It ignores the "Stop" tick box. I tested it with this simple batch file:</span></p>
@echo off<br />

<p>I just tested it with my Surface Pro 4, those settings and script. The result was that the cmd window closed as soon as I disconnected the power supply.</p>
<p><br />
Edit (Screenshot): the settings are like yours but after disconnecting an event gets logged that the task has been stopped because of the switch to battery, additionally
<em>result of last execution</em> displays 0x8007042B.<br />

            We appear to have an intriguing discrepancy. If you will upload to some cloud storage&nbsp;the xml file that your task scheduler created for this test task then I'll compare it with my own xml file. No need to post any translations from German.

<p>Bingo! I was able to confirm your observation. I dare say this is a bug. Microsoft, take note!</p>

    <title>Administrator can&#39;t access folders in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael from ottawa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Administrator can&#39;t access folders in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>I have a new computer and I am the administrator. I set up a new guest account and denied it access to one folder. However, the administrator can not longer access this folder at all.</p>
<p>Even when the administrator account can access the folder none of the files can be played (they are media files).</p>
<p>Is there a way of completely resetting the permissions on the folder so that the administrator can once again play the files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Denying access to certain users or groups is a bad idea because it can have unexpected effects if you are not fully familiar with the way ACLs work. A few days ago I got involved in a thread whose author did much the same thing as you did. So far neither
 of us has found a method to restore access to the folder to which he applied "deny" permissions.</p>
<p>If your neighbour wants to keep you out of his house, does he install a person-detection device that is sensitive to you? Not very likely. He does the opposite: He hands out door keys only to those persons he trusts. You should handle folder permissions
 in the same way: Give access only to groups and users you trust. Forget about the others - since they are not in the trusted group they won't get any access.</p>
<p>You can try this method to undo the damage you did:<br />
1. Enable the Administrator account and set its password.<br />
2. Reboot into Safe Mode.<br />
3. Log on as Administrator.<br />
4. Click Start<br />
5. Type the three letters cmd<br />
6. Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter<br />
7. Run the process as Administrator.<br />
8. Type the following commands and press Enter after each:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; takeown&nbsp; /f&nbsp;&nbsp; Q:\&nbsp;&nbsp; /a&nbsp;&nbsp; /r&nbsp;&nbsp; /d y<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; icacls Q:\&nbsp; /t /c /grant administrators:F&nbsp; System:F&nbsp; "%UserName%":F<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Answer "yes" when prompted "Are you sure?")<br />
(Replace Q: with the actual drive letter on the problem disk)</p>
