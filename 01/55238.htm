<p>Why is typing messages on the Xbox One SOOOO damn laggy?!!?! Like I seriously try to&nbsp;type in my message and I make a mistake because it doesn't realize I "spaced" so my words become 1. I go try and delete some parts, and it just deletes too much because
 its lagging too hard.</p>

<p>For a next gen console to be this far backwards, its just pathetic! </p>

<p>BTW, WHY AM I LIMITED TO 32 PEOPLE PER MESSAGE?!?! I'm tired of retyping my messages to my friends because I have a limit. I understand if its to non friends, that I receive this. Seriously, I spend $50 a month on the service, $500 for the console and I
 now receive limits?? WTF!</p>

<p>Not sure what the lag is you're receiving, I haven't seen it be laggy during typing myself. &nbsp;Try doing a hard reset to purge your system cache and see if that helps at all. &nbsp;If that doesn't maybe try plugging a keyboard in. &nbsp;The system will work with any
 USB keyboard.</p>
<p>As far as your messaging, maybe try setting up a broadcast instead if you're sending it to that many people.</p>
<p>And a side question, what on Earth are you spending $50 a month on? &nbsp;Gold only costs $10 a month if you're silly enough to pay the month to month.</p>

<p>Sometimes the UI lags remarkably. This usually happens to me after restarting the system but has also happened completely out of nowhere and affects the entire UI; not just messages. It's annoying, it needs to be fixed, but as of right now it's a fairly
 minor issue to me.</p>

<p>I am also experiencing lag with the on-screen keyboard, and <a href="http://1drv.ms/QMpBfF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
I have a video of it</a>. I've been dealing with it for a few weeks; it's also happened on and off ever since I got my console. When the issue strikes (apparently at random), it affects all apps, and restarting the system does not fix it.</p>
<p>The issue only affects the shortcut buttons (Y for space, bumpers for cursor, et cetera). If you pay close attention to my video, you'll notice that when a shortcut button is pressed, the corresponding on-screen tile for that function animates immediately,
 but the function itself is delayed. For example, when I press Y, the spacebar animates instantly, but it takes two or three seconds before the space is actually inserted.</p>
<p>The stuff I do on my Xbox One requires a pretty big amount of typing, so this is an infuriating bug. It gets worse whenever I remember that: this is literally the only on-screen keyboard I have ever seen lag in any capacity; and the Xbox 360 on-screen keyboard
 didn't come close to being this spectacularly buggy.</p>

<p>Since the forums seem to be eating my edits without saving them, I'll have to double-post. Sorry.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that even when the keyboard works properly (rare, these days), there's still some input lag. It's just minute enough that it won't affect actual typing, but when I specifically go looking for it, I see it. There's clearly a problem with
 how the Xbox One on-screen keyboard is coded.</p>
<p>The bumpers are affected as well (cursor movement is delayed), so the problem isn't receiving the input or actually inserting a text character. There is some bizarre bottleneck within the keyboard that is essentially breaking the shortcut buttons.</p>

<p>i also had this problem as well, started a few days ago, to fix this problem, do a hard reset, like bigbenx88 said, just unplug your power cable from the console for a min or 2, plug it back in, turn the xbox on and when you get a green xbox one screen,
 you're good to go</p>

<p>I've been experiencing this same issue for a month or so now. It makes sending messages 4x longer than it normally does and than it should. I absolutely hate sending messages on the Xbox One now because of this. I haven't tried the hard reset yet, so I'll
 try that out and see if that helps. Hopefully it does. It shouldn't be something that happens. Makes the system feel sluggish, when it should be a smooth experience.</p>

<h2>            System Tray Appears On The Wrong Monitor</h2>
                    <p>With my SP4 connected to an external monitor, I have that monitor set as the primary, though many times when plugging or booting into the system at home, my desktop icons show on the external monitor as expected, and the system tray icons appear on the SP4
 screen, even though it is set to be monitor 2 when connected to the second screen. &nbsp;The only way to correct this seems to be to toggle the primary display back and forth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SP4 is connected to the external monitor via the MiniDisplay port and active HDMI adapter, since the SP4 dock also doesn't handle the second screen properly (of course).</p>

            Sure can. Try this:<br />
1. Set your environment exactly the way you want it.<br />
2. Reboot the machine into Safe Mode.<br />
3. Log on as Administrator.<br />
4. Rename the folder c:\Users\Default User to c:\Users\Default User.org<br />
5. Rename the folder c:\Users\Phil to c:\Users\Default User (assuming that "Phil" is your profile folder).<br />
6. Give everyone read-access to c:\Users\Default User<br />
7. Create a new account, then log on under this account to test it.<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t view profile and gamerscore is 0</h2>
                    <p>So I recently came home from college for winter break and apparently at some point during the last month all the accounts on my brothers xbox one got signed out. When I signed back in I was able to sync my game data back over but my gamerscore now says I have a score of 0 and I can't view my profile or my achievements.&nbsp; Every time I try to pull up my profile it says "That didn't work, Sorry, Give it another try". I&nbsp;have tried signing out and back in, restarting the xbox, and contacting customer support (who sent me here). I&nbsp;have no idea what to do</p><p><br /></p><p>And another detail. When I play a game there is a message in the lower right hand corner that says "Nice Work! You've Unlocked all the achievements in this game" This is annoying because 1) I haven't and 2) it won't go away</p>

<div>************** JIT Debugging **************<br />
To enable just-in-time (JIT) debugging, the .config file for this<br />
application or computer (machine.config) must have the<br />
jitDebugging value set in the system.windows.forms section.<br />
The application must also be compiled with debugging<br />
enabled.</div>

<div>For example:</div>

<div>&lt;configuration&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;system.windows.forms jitDebugging="true" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/configuration&gt;</div>

<div>When JIT debugging is enabled, any unhandled exception<br />
will be sent to the JIT debugger registered on the computer<br />
rather than be handled by this dialog box.</div>


<p>
</p><p>So how should I enable JIT debugging? This keeps happening when I use Microsoft Edge, so it should be something to do with it. Remember I'm using Windows 10.0! Please help!</p>

<p>Yup. Today I won a high roller wager match, but host disconnected as the final killcam ran. Hopefully I'll at least get my $10000 entry fee back, but I'm still pretty mad about the extra 20...</p>

    <title>How can I set up a default or preferred view for folder search - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leonardodv  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I set up a default or preferred view for folder search results, Build 14393&#63;</h2>
                    How can I set up a default or preferred view for folder search results?
<p>
</p><p>Windows Build 14393 has a default view for the results when I perform searches within folders. With the previous Windows 10 version, Windows would use my preferred search results view. Previously, to establish the search results view was simply to set the
 view for search results after obtaining the search results in that folder. This no longer works. For example, if I perform a .jpg search in a folder, Windows always defaults to "Content" view, "Descending" order. I have never, not even once, selected this
 view. No matter how many times I change the the view of the results, new searches always resolve to default Contents, Descending view.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same thing happens to me - both when I search in Explorer AND when I re-run saved Explorer search-ms searches that were originally in the right order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>eg: this search displays in Content/Descending order even though Notepad++ shows that it is defined to Display/Sort as Xtra Large Tiles/Name Ascending order.</p>
<p>
?xml version="1.0"?&gt;<br />
&lt;persistedQuery version="1.0"&gt;&lt;viewInfo viewMode="icons" iconSize="256" stackIconSize="0" displayName="Search Results in 2004-0409 l 40 Apr0 USA - Nevada - Death Valley - Camp" autoListFlags="0"&gt;&lt;visibleColumns&gt;&lt;column viewField="System.ItemNameDisplay"/&gt;&lt;column
 viewField="System.ItemDate"/&gt;&lt;column viewField="System.Keywords"/&gt;&lt;column viewField="System.Size"/&gt;&lt;column viewField="System.Rating"/&gt;&lt;column viewField="System.ItemFolderPathDisplay"/&gt;&lt;/visibleColumns&gt;&lt;sortList&gt;&lt;sort viewField="System.ItemNameDisplay" direction="ascending"/&gt;

<p>Thanks for that. I found it already but think it might not solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem simply comes down to search-ms files not working correctly, eg:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">1) I define a search. The files originally appear in a default View/Sort-By sequence. Very quick, always correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">2) I re-order the sorting sequence to Name/Ascending and change the display to Xtra Large Icons. All seems fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">3) I save the result to a search-ms file.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">4) Opening that search-ms file in Notepad++ I see, for instance, the correct Sort-By instruction:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;sortList&gt;&lt;sort viewField="System.ItemNameDisplay" direction="ascending"/&gt;&lt;/sortList&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">5) I run the search but it still displays in the <strong>
original</strong> default View/Sort-By sequence - <strong>not</strong> the one I gave it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that a Windows 10 bug..?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>To compound my confusion:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Sometimes the search-ms file starts to work properly if I re-save it a few times - although the contents still look exactly the same...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?<br />
</p>
<p><br />

<p>Thanks for the suggestion. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a setting up a new user account - and tested this on my laptop too - and the problem remains the same in all cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you could try this on your own machine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I define a search. The files originally appear in a default View/Sort-By sequence = Content/Descending.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) I re-order the sorting sequence to Name-Ascending and change the display to Xtra Large Icons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) I Save the result to a search-ms file.</p>
<p>4) Generally after the first Save the screen flickers and immediately refreshes to the correct Xtra Large Icon/Name-Ascending View/Order. If the search-ms file displays correctly that first time it will continue to do so.<br />
</p>
<p>Sometimes after the first Save the screen flickers and immediately refreshes to the wrong&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Content/Descending View/Order - again, once it has done this the search-ms file will continue to do so.
 If I Re-sort/View and Re-Save that query it will generally refresh to the correct order and remain that way in the future - although sometimes I have to re-Order/Save two or three times for this "fix" to happen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Additionally I have also discovered that<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;if I simply rename a search-ms file through File Explorer without actually opening the search-ms file -</span>&nbsp;even if the search-ms file had returned
 the <strong>CORRECT</strong> View/Order up to that point (ie the one I defined) -&nbsp;it will ALWAYS subsequently return the
<strong>WRONG</strong> View/Order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open/re-sort and re-Save that newly named search it acts just like a new search - ie 1-4 above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem obviously occurs at the point a search-ms file is Saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that Windows saves a list of folder views into a list- often people complain that this is too short and folder views are notoriously unstable. And I know it is easy to change folder View options through File Explorer and to extend them to
 sub-folders. I know of no way to define sort order by folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Search-ms files seem to be treated as "folders" (although they are not actual folders) but it is not possible to extend Views to sub-folders in File Explorer because the option is greyed out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possibly Windows also maintains a list of search-ms file View/Order definitions outside the files themselves too, because the View/Order can change but
 in Notepad++, CtrlA, Copy then paste into Excel and len() to find the string length).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some error is occurring when Windows writes to that View/Order definition file during a search-ms Save and my problem would be solved if:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Ignoring the odd way searches/saves behave I could simply change the default search-ms&nbsp;View/Sort order to Large Icons/Name-Ascending within my register. Searches would then always return the way I wanted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that this is NOT about changing the display of <strong>normal</strong> folders within File Explorer through the register, but
<strong>only</strong> of search-ms files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) Someone could fix Window's search-ms Save to write the <strong>defined</strong> View/Order into the list, not the
<strong>default</strong> one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>c) Someone could fix search-ms file to refresh use the actual definition within the file itself rather than some outside instruction list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>?????? anybody...</p>

<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. Let me help you with your concern of getting error messages on your Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please make sure that your default browser is Internet Explorer. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<font>I suggest that you re-configure your account so that it will re-establish proper synchronization with the system. Kindly visit the article below on how you can properly configure your account on Windows Live Mail.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, check your computer’s Internet Connection. Verify if Internet Explorer is offline. Kindly follow the steps below:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Some of the Daily Challenges freeze-up the screen and I have to shut - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greasyorchid209  say:</h3>
<h2>            Some of the Daily Challenges freeze-up the screen and I have to shut the games down and reboot it.</h2>
                    <p>Screen freezes have been occurring for the last 2 weeks in some games of <u>Microsoft Mahjong</u>. It does not happen on every game every day, but during the solving the game&nbsp;will suddenly freeze and will again freeze up after it has been rebooted. I have paid for the last 2 years to eliminate the ads and would like to again this year, but I am not going to pay for games that are not working correctly. I have this problem with <u>Microsoft Solitaire Collection</u> also. &nbsp;I do not have any problems with&nbsp;<u>Microsoft Jigsaw</u>. Please let me know of any suggestions you may have to correct this problem. Thank you!</p>

<p>Option 1: If Windows 7 came preinstalled on your computer, you can perform a factory reset:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<span><span><span>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to
 boot into when you start your computer by pressing a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>------------------------------------</span><br />
</p>
<p>
<span><span>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>For Samsung, press F4 at power up.. </span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>For Fujitsu, press the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>For Sony VAIO, restart and press "F8" or "F10" repeatedly until the "Advanced Boot Options" screen appears.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Option 2:</p>
<p>If you have a Windows 7 install disc, you can format the drive using the following instructions:</p>
<p>To format the drive:<br />
<br />
1. Insert the Windows 7 DVD</p>
<p>2. Restart your computer<br />
3. When asked if you want to boot from your DVD drive, do so.<br />
4. Choose your language, click Next.<br />
5. Click 'Repair your computer'<br />
6. Select operating system you want to repair.<br />
<br />
7. Click the Command Prompt<br />
<br />
8. At the command prompt, type: FORMAT C:/<br />
<br />
Hit Enter on your keyboard<br />
<br />
Type Y for Yes<br />
<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
Wait while the drive is formatted.<br />
<br />
Type EXIT to close the prompt and click shut down to turn off the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have Windows 7 reinstall media, you can download and create a bootable copy from http://windowsiso.net&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How can I de-install Microsoft Office Home and Student so can re-load it onto a different computer&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased Office Home &amp; Student 2007 on 9/1/2009.&nbsp; I installed it and everything was fine until my hard drive crashed. The person fixing my computer is advising me to ditch the computer because it is about 6+ years old.&nbsp; The problem is, how can I de-install
 the Home/Office so I can re-load it onto a different computer.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
When I purchased&nbsp;the software it did not come with a disk. I just went to the microsoft website to get the software downloaded.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi JohnHolmes019,<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Did you make any software or hardware changes on your computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Let’s follow these methods &amp; check if the issue persists:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) You may boot the computer into ‘safe mode’ and check if the issue persists. It will start Windows XP with a limited set of files and drivers.
 Startup programs do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed, follow the steps to boot the computer in safe mode:</span></p>
<p><span>i.
<b>Restart</b> the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>ii. Start tapping
<b>F8</b> key.</span></p>
<p><span>iii. You will get
<b>Advanced Boot Menu Option</b> window.</span></p>
<p><span>iv. Select the option
<b>Safe mode</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information, refer to this link:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>A description of the Safe Mode Boot options in Windows XP</span></a></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>b)<b>
</b></span><span>You may configure the computer in clean boot state and check if the issue persists.
</span><span>It will start Windows XP by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs and helps to eliminate software conflicts.
</span></p>
<p><span>The following link has steps showing how to perform clean boot:
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</span></a><span><br />
<b>Note:</b> Please ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following the section ‘Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state’ from the article: How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state:
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</span></a></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b></p>
<p><span><br />
You may uninstall Turbo Lister program from </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Add or Remove Programs</span></a><span>
 &amp; reinstall it again. Thereafter, check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Hope the information helps.</span></p>

<p>I assume you are talking about the Programs and Features section of the Control Panel?<br />
<br />
Does this program have its' own uninstaller.exe that is accessible via the Start Menu?&nbsp; If it does, you may be able to right-click on that and select the "Run As Administrator" option and get rid of it via that way.<br />
<br />
See if Revo Unistaller can shift it.<br />
