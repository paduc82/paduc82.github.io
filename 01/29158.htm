<h2>            Windows 10 update caused my scanner to stop working</h2>
                    Bought a new Dell laptop 6/2018 - with Windows 10 home/office installed.&nbsp; Connected it to my Epson XP960 printer/scanner and all worked fine.&nbsp; Microsoft just installed Windows 10 update (1803, plus a patch to it) and now the message says "scanner not connected
 to computer" or words to that effect.&nbsp; Not true...my control panel confirms the XP 960 is installed, and I can print documents.&nbsp; So I know the connection is valid.&nbsp; I'm certain it's a Windows 10 issue.&nbsp; What is it and how to I correct it?&nbsp; Seems like every
 new Windows 10 patch is not, in fact, a fix but instead a new problem.&nbsp;

            Hi John,
<br />Have you checked that your driver for ESPSON XP960 are updated?

<p>Oh yes.&nbsp; Installed driver software upgrade - no change (printer works fine, but scanner does not).&nbsp; Next uninstalled entire Epson XP 960 software suit, then re-installed it - no change (printer works but scanner does not).&nbsp; Remember, everything (the printer
 AND the scanner) worked just fine until Microsoft installed the patch to its Windows 10 software. So I have done everything possible on the Epson scanner/printer side of things.&nbsp; I have also attempted to scan using Windows fax and scan - that, too doesn't
 work.&nbsp; I get essentially the same "idiot" message - there is no connection between the scanner and the laptop.&nbsp; Of course, I know isn't true since the printer works and the computer control panel "sees" the XP 960 and recognizes it as my preferred printer/scanner.&nbsp;
 Windows' update has screwed up something, plain and simple.</p>

            Epson Event Manager is installed?
<br />If that's so , there is some report of your problem?
<br />Seems that the connection between your PC and your printer is OK, but it isn't so for the scanner (even if they are one thing togheter).
<br />Just to be sure, have you tried to connect the printer with another USB port?

            Epson Event Manager is installed (and uninstalled and reinstalled).&nbsp; However, it will not launch - again, I get the "scanner isn't connected" message when I attempt to launch EEM.&nbsp; Yes, I've already tried connecting the printer to another USB port - that
 doesn't fix the issue either.&nbsp; It is a Microsoft Windows 10 update-triggered glitch, plain and simple.

            Well then you could try resetting the Scan app. To do so:<br /><br />1. Go to Settings<br />2. Select App<br />3. Search for Scanner Microsoft<br />4. Click on Advanced Option<br />5. Reset App<br /><br />Then try using the scanner.<br /><br />If that doesn't work, There is the possibility to do a Clear Startup offline Windows 10, Keeping App and File

<p>You gave an interesting suggestion.&nbsp; So I went to "settings" and looked for the Scanner Microsoft app.&nbsp; Of course there is no such app.&nbsp; Now, there IS a Windows Scan app.&nbsp; It was already installed, but I installed it again and attempted to run it.&nbsp; Well...one
 that app opened it DID acknowledge that I had an Epson XP 960 scanner.&nbsp; However, after attempting to run the scan, up popped a message that said my Epson XP 960 scanner was incompatible with Windows Scan.&nbsp; Whaaaaaa?&nbsp; I mean, that scanner was compatible before
 Windows 10 installed its most recent "fix" patch to the 1803 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You suggest I try a "<span>Clear Startup offline Windows 10, Keeping App and File."&nbsp; I don't know how to do that.&nbsp; So....</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Any other thoughts?</span></p>

<p>Ended up calling my laptop manufacturer (Dell), who said "We can't help.&nbsp; Call Epson."&nbsp; So I called Epson and talked with the CSRs (who were in Manilla, PI).&nbsp; After two hours of troubleshooting everything imaginable, they ended up erasing and replacing registry
 information (something I am incapable of understanding, much less doing).&nbsp; We then downloaded, anew, the most current image driver.&nbsp; Now it works.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked Epson's CSR why I had this issue.&nbsp; They didn't want to volunteer anything, but I ultimately dragged out of them their suspicion that the registry information was corrupted during the uploading of the Windows 10 patch.&nbsp; Bottom line here: Epson burned
 two hours of tech support help to fix a problem for which Epson had no roll in creating.&nbsp; Now that's good customer service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All is good now.&nbsp; My advice for anyone who has a similar problem: Check with your printer's tech support folks.&nbsp; They likely are tackling this Windows-triggered issue on a recurring basis.</p>

    <title>System causing High CPU Usage - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            System causing High CPU Usage</h2>
                    I have been noticing in the past 2 days that my CPU usage has been greatly increased to above 80% constantly. I started googling this issue and people were saying to download process explorer to see what is causing the issue. The main issue for my computer
 is a driver, specifically the DirectX Graphics MMS. The file is called dxgmms2.sys. This has been causing my CPU usage to increase. The thread ID shown in process explorer is 760. If there is a fix for this, that would be great. Thanks.&nbsp;

                    <p>I have a HP Laptop with windows 10 home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run windows update it always fails when installing - Feature update to Windows 10, version 1607</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Home give no indicate what has failed but I have removed almost all installed applications and data to ensure there is over 5GB free space before the install but it makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find a reference to error code&nbsp;0xC190020E in the system log, followed by an information message saying an update had been successful and then another error:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>The shadow copies of volume C: were aborted because the shadow copy storage could not grow due to a user imposed limit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the update screen it then shows the update as being available to install again.</p>

<p>how much space is needed ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I start out with 6.5 GB free and that is after removing everything except the most essential apps. end up with 1.5 GB free. I clear out all temp files and start again with the same result. (Notebook only has 32GB C Drive)</p>

            <p>The space you need depends on the size of the update that you will install. You may check the download size to verify.By the way, when you cleared out your temporary files, have you restarted your computer? If not, try to clear your temp files again, then
 restart your computer. After that, try to install the update again.</p>

            <p>Hi Vanessa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm facing the same problem on a tablet with a 32G eMMC HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 1,5G free space available on drive c:\ as well as&nbsp;an empty&nbsp;16G USB stick (the upgrade program asks for another&nbsp;storage device with more than 10G free space&nbsp;since 5.66G free space are needed for the update). After chosing the empty USB stick as
 drive, the download and then the upgrade preparation process start. After a while the upgrade process is stopped and the system reports errors (according to setuperr.log&nbsp;0xC190020E).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are only 2,19G used on the USB stick. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you provide some solution or suggestion?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>v</p>

</p><p>I probably tried about 15 times, cleaning out temp file, restarting, looking for errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I was given the option to use another drive and this time it worked. Early on in the cycle I had also taken the option to use another drive but it still failed. &nbsp;Then for 10-15 attempts I did not get the choice about using another drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lack of information and control during this whole update made for a frustrating process. Next big update I will probably skip and ditch the laptop</p>

<p>similar situation: HP Stream laptop with 32GB eMMC. trying to install Creator update, did not have enough space (8.5GB). Went on rampage, deleted restore partition, Windows.old, all recovery points etc. removed all apps (office, chrome, skype etc) that I
 can reinstall later. wanted to get this over so that I dont have to go through this again</p>
<p>
</p><p>says enough space, all checks passed, 30minutes to download &amp; update. and then this error hits.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>have done half a dozen attempts, reboots etc. same story. noticeable variations from other folks on this thead:</p>
<ol>
<li>I do not get option to use any other drive, external disk. if that option existed, I would not have risked my computed by deleting partitions and apps!!</li><li>the laptop is on autoupdates, and fully uptodate. however, see this message on retrying&nbsp; that says its on build# 14393, while latest is build#15063. not sure what I can do to get my laptop to this build? checked on websites, my laptop should have shown
 (and is on) latest builds but the updated detects it Windows 8.1 build! wondering how it passes the first check??<br />
</li><li>I am not able to create a recovery disk either, this is probably due to extensive deletions I have done. its amazing that 32gb is not sufficient for basic OS need, and updates. I have another 128GB card that takes care of file storage but system demands
 c:\ drive!</li></ol>
<p>UPDATE: I did a clean install, that's a predictable 3 hours of work than trying massive cleanups. one of replies on pagesize might be handy Jan'2018 on next major update</p>

<p>
</p><p>That's what I used to get the Creators Update.&nbsp; Follow the link and then download and use the Upgrade Assistant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW have you tried switching some of the OS storage uses (e.g. TEMP, PageFile) to your other device?&nbsp; Some things are not allowed to be moved to a different volume (such as unfortunately %ProgramFiles% and C:\Users\) but I can't imagine why it would not
 be OK to play with things like those other, more transitory ones, at least temporarily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you can look for clues about storage use in (one of) the setupact.log files.&nbsp; Perhaps you would be able to devise a workaround that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, there is another even more drastic way of keep storage use down.&nbsp; I don't know if anyone in your situation has tried to do anything like this:&nbsp;

            I tried several times to install the Creators update on my small Acer machine which has only a 32Gb drive.&nbsp; Each time the installer was happy with the 8.5Gb free until near the end when it always failed with the helpful comment "Something went wrong" error
 code 0xc190020e.&nbsp; I had already removed what I could to make space so....&nbsp; what I tried was changing the windows managed virtual memory pagefile to a fixed one of min 256 max 1024.&nbsp; Restarting the machine I had an extra 1.5Gb free, making 10Gb.&nbsp; I ran the
 update installer again and it all succeeded smoothly. I later removed windows.old and restored the managed pagefile.&nbsp; Hope this helps someone.

<h2>            Shorter Oxford English Dictionary does not install &#34;This program can&#39;t start because neko.dll is missing&#34;</h2>
                    <p>OT: neko.dll dissappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>On Windoze 7, I had the SOED (Shorter Oxford English Dictionary) working, then all of a suddy it won't open. When i try to reinstall from the disc i get: "This program can't start because neko.dll is missing from your computer, Try reinstalling the program
 to fix this problem." Easy to say, of course, but where can i find a safe download? Went to Micromush site - search returns no results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried the following to no avail:</p>
<p>"When you install software that uses the neko.dll dependency, the software should automatically register the file for you. In some cases your DLL file may not register properly, and as a result, will provide a "neko.dll not registered" error. Fortunately,
 you can use a built-in utility called "Microsoft Register Server" (regsvr32.exe) to re-register your neko.dll file.</p>
<p>How to re-register neko.dll from an elevated command prompt (<strong>Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8</strong>):</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Start</strong> button.</li><li>Type "<strong>command</strong>" in the <strong>search box... DO NOT</strong> hit
<strong>ENTER</strong> yet!</li><li>While holding <strong>CTRL-Shift</strong> on your keyboard, hit <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li><li>You will be prompted with a permission dialog box.</li><li>Click <strong>Yes</strong>.</li><li>Type the following command: <strong>regsvr32 /u neko.dll</strong>.</li><li>Hit <strong>ENTER</strong>. This will <strong>UN-REGISTER</strong> your file.</li><li>Type the following command: <strong>regsvr32 /i neko.dll</strong>.</li><li>Hit <strong>ENTER</strong>. This will <strong>RE-REGISTER</strong> your file.</li><li>Close the command prompt window.</li><li>Re-start the program associated with neko.dll error."</li></ol>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Have you tried using the in game Xbox 360 menu? You should be able to add and then invite your friends using the Xbox 360 built in menu in the actual game by simultaneously pressing the View and Menu button on your Xbox One controller. (The two next to the
 white Xbox button) I'm not 100% sure if the Xbox One Guide will invite your friends at all using a Backwards Compatible game.</p>

<p>Unfortunately they've setup the Xbox One a bit weird where if you add a friend, they won't appear on your Xbox 360 friend list. You have to press the start and select button and the old Xbox 360 guide will pop up. From there you can add your friends and
 invite them to the game.</p>

<p>There are many posts on the forum regarding problems with various devices using older AMD graphics.</p>
<p>If the driver doesn't install then the graphics will be correct. If the driver does install there's a good chance the display will be messed up. If it is messed up you need to roll the driver back or use Update driver, select Browse computer and then Let
 me choose etc. Select an earlier driver version.</p>
<p>You should keep auto update of drivers turned off for now and hopefully MS will fix the update.</p>

                    I installed Windows 10, but decided to reinstall Windows 8.1, which I prefer. My control panel shows that Windows 10 is showing as pending....can I delete this as I don't want it installed?&nbsp; Unsure if it will auto install or not.&nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp;

            You may have to select "Check for updates" under windows 7 to find the New Windows 10 update.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not use the Windows 10 Upgrade&nbsp;Icon if you are trying to upgrade from windows 7.

            Windows 7 to Windows 10. After repeated tries with a continuing "working on it" screen, I went to control panel, windows update, saw the upgrade had failed several times, selected "Check for updates" and the upgrade was loaded into the dialogue box and
 I was able load and execute the upgrade within the control panel with no problem.

<p>I have been holding <strong><em>(mod edit)</em></strong> offline &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>(mod edit)</em></strong></p>

<p>I can also make him lag</p>
<p>I love it</p>
<p><strong><em>(mod edit)</em></strong></p>
<p>his gamer tag is&nbsp;<strong><em>(mod edit)</em></strong></p>

<p>please someone check into this kid I've spent 100$ on tech coming into my house and replacing stuff that was probably fine and I missed out on a week of my xbox live....</p>

<p>The only way to report this to the Enforcement Team is to report the bad conduct from your console. None of us here can contact the Enforcement Team, they only take reports filed from the console as they don't accept hearsay. For instructions, go to

<p>6.Review the information here and when you’re ready, select File Complaint again.</p>

<p>However, if he is performing a Denial of Service attack, Microsoft's options are very limited as the hacker is using non-Microsoft tools over the open internet. Even if they dropped the BanHammer on the hacker, the cyberharassment would continue. Therefore,
 I do also suggest you contact your ISP, get the IP logs showing where the attack comes from, and report it to law enforcement, as this is a federal, state and provincial felony.</p>

<p>A "NoFind" solution suggested in MS #292504 is not an option as it disables Search function in Explorer all together.</p>

<p>buen dia , mi consola no tiene chip , la compre hace poco y pague dos meses de live para poder disfrutar de los beneficios que da el ser gold, bien los dicen aqui no somos ricos para poder comprarnos todos los juegos que qusieramos, por esta razon compre
 un juego usado llamado mass efect 2 , pero antes de jugarlo pregunte primero y me han dicho que como es usado corro el riesgo de ser baneado , es esto cierto ? no me gustaria que todo mi gasto y esfuerzo se fuera a la basura por comprar y jugar un juego usado
 ......espero puedan resolverme mi duda , pues no he podido jugar este juego hasta no estar seguro , muchas gracias de antemano y de verdad me da gusto que haya un espacio para poder expresarse</p>

<h2>            Windows 2016 Server RDWEB - Office 2016 RemoteApp &#40;access via Windows 10 Pro&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Remote Desktop Host Session setup using Windows 2016 Server and install Office 2016 Standard on to the server. I configured RDWEB on the server for client that are using Internet Explorer in Windows 10 Pro&nbsp;to access all RemoteApp advertised via
 RDWEB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that when I launch any Office Application (e.g. Word, Excel, etc), the windows of the app is in maximize state but it is not in full screen where there is a small gap on top and left side of the windows. The windows looks a little bit off and
 I can see the status bar is behind the task bar of the client machine (screenshot).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other RemoteApp such as Internet Explorer, Paint, and all other 3rd party application works fine and get a full screen without the gap when maximize the application window. The only issue is with all Office 2016 application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I have tried to fresh installed all the component (Windows 2016 Standard Server, Office 2016 Standard and Windows 10 Pro) to avoid any other probability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue does appear if I'm using the same setup / configuration but with Windows 2012 R2 Server as Remote Desktop Host.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate some help&nbsp;from the&nbsp;expert here.&nbsp;Thank you. :)&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Trying to create a basic Storage Space. No parity, mirroring, or anything. Just a bunch of disks. All disks are functioning normally and have been formatted etc. When I add them to the pool and create the storage space I get the error I've screenshotted
 below, "Can't Delete Storage Space".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it trying to delete the Storage Space in the creation process?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to create the Storage Space successfully?</p>
