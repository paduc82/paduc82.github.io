<h2>            Cannot change region</h2>
                    
<p>Dear MS support!</p>

<p>The problem: I cannot change my xbox account region.</p>
<p>Once I managed to change my region from hungary to usa. (By the confirmation email, it happened on 2013.01.18, so it's more than 3 months now!) Experiencing some drawbacks, I decided to move back my region where I live, so I want to set my region to hungary.</p>
<p>The corresponding webpage says nothing useful information, do not tells the real reason just fails.</p>
<p>It is very frustrating, please help me resolve this matter! Let me allow to migrate back my account!</p>
<p>I hope you can fix this in no time!</p>

<p>Were either of you ever actually in the USA??</p>
<p>Conditions that prevent you from changing your region</p>
<p>You won’t be able to change your region if any of the following conditions apply:</p>
<p>•You changed regions within the last three months.</p>
<p>•Your account is currently suspended (for example, if the credit card on one of your subscriptions has expired).</p>
<p>•You have an Xbox 360 Entertainment For All contract.</p>
<p>•You are a minor (as defined by applicable law) in your current region and will not be a minor in the region that you want to change to.
</p>
<p>•You are currently not a minor (as defined by applicable law) in your current region and will become a minor in the region that you want to change to.</p>
<p>If none of the above apply then I would suggest you put a call into Xbox Support and see if they can help you</p>

<p>There's been issues with XBL members changing their regions to take advantage of current promotions in a different region, the fact that you never actually once downloaded your profile to the USA may be something. I created a Japanese account because I was
 wondering once how an American kid got a Japanese gamertag. Anyway I was able to make the region change fine (and this was when I couldn't even read the webpage, I just went to where it said too on my US gamertag lol) but this was all before the recent account
 changes for what I mentioned above. I would try again to see if there are any error messages, then contact support for your region. &nbsp;Also have you changed your Microsoft Account in the last 3 months either?

<p>Thanks for the suggestion, but no luck so far. I've contacted MS support, they said my account is successfully migrated back to my original region, but in fact it's not. I see no changes on my xbox or wp. If I go on the xbox site to "my account" / "billing
 contact information" I still see that the "Country / Region" is US. And of course, the account migration page shows the usual error "There’s a problem completing your move right now..." I will try again the support, it seems that is my only option. Baaaaah.</p>

<p>I changed my region because i live in Belgium and when i download games, ( for instance, fable 3 ) it's automaticly in france. It's so frustrating. So i changed my region to the Nederlands. Problem is, I can't download fable becaus i'm not accually in the
 nederlands. And now i have to wait 3 mounths till I can change it back. </p>
<p>I'm angry now</p>

            Hello, you are able to set up Windows with multiple HDDs. First of all, you will need to install a copy of Windows on one HDD. Then, you may plug in all the HDDs via SATA or IDE. Then, you are able to go into disk management and start creating volumes and partitions. Hope this helps!

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New - this Drive is usually listed as Disk 0
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Hi Bijob.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I would unplug all the drives except the Windows drive during install, follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Afterwards, plug in the other drives, format them in Disk management:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/248980/how-to-partition-and-format-your-hard-drive-in-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/248980/how-to-p...</a>
<br />
<br />To save space you can move the User folders to the other drive:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-users-folder-location-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-u...</a>
<br />
<br />I would also save a System Image backup and file backup to the other drives.   Follow these steps to create a System Image backup stored externally so if Windows ever becomes irreparable you can restore C in 20 minutes and be up and running:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            ATI Radeon 4300&#47;4500 Series Drivers</h2>
                    Hello! I'm running Windows 10 on the Dell Studio 540s and this moring, after months of being at 1920x1080 resolution, my PC decided to revert to 1024 x 768. I've tried updating the drivers but that hasn't worked, and I've uninstalled and reinstalled the
 drivers but that isn't working either. If you need more information please ask, but if you could help that would be fantastic!

<p>Apparently they've made a bad mistake about the ads. For some players (of a certain region I suspect) the ads appear on all daily challenges while for others the ads don't appear at all, depriving us the bonus 30 seconds for the hard Origins levels.</p>

    <title>Building XP virtual machine on a Mac - need advice - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david dahle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Building XP virtual machine on a Mac - need advice</h2>
                    Background:
<div>I've had a Mac for the last 5+ years but I still have a few Windows programs I want to hang onto. Previously, after migrating over to the Mac, I had successfully built an XP Pro virtual machine and had no issues with it, but because of the impending end
 of XP support, I sold my copy of XP Pro and hopped on the Windows 7 bandwagon. Even though my Mac has 4 gigs of RAM, Win7 Pro proved to be a massive resource hog (CPU, RAM, and disk space), so much so I eventually took the opportunity to reacquire the last
 PC I built before I jumped over to the Mac world, mainly to get my hands on the copy of XP Home Edition I loaded onto it before selling it (having initially retained the XP Pro license / media for the virtual machine on the Mac). I ditched the Win7 virtual
 machine and built a fresh XP Home virtual machine and ran into the wuauclt.exe / svchost.exe 100% CPU problem.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Again, I realize that Microsoft is going to be ending all support for XP in just a few months, but I would very much like to build and get this XP virtual machine running properly and fully caught up on updates at which point I can simply turn off the
 networking functions and just use folder sharing between the Windows and Mac environments (the main program I am using in this case is Microsoft Streets &amp; Trips).</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using VMWare Fusion - latest public release. My Mac has 4GB of RAM as previously mentioned and is plugged directly into a combination router / modem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The XP Home Edition CD and key I have are at SP2 level, and I know I will need to get SP3 downloaded after building the virtual environment.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, my questions:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) What do I need to do or watch for as I build the virtual machine to ensure that Automatic Updates works properly and doesn't just peg the CPU at 100%?</div>
<div>2) Are there individual hotfixes that should be applied between the initial SP2-level install and the SP3 package?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would also be interested in any suggestions to make a Windows 7 virtual machine less demanding on a Mac's system resources, even though I prefer getting the XP virtual machine up and running.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I appreciate any meaningful assistance that can be given.</div>
                </div>

<h2>            storage temperature ranges for Surface pro 3 i5</h2>
                    <p>I was wondering what the safe operating and storage temperatures are on the surface pro 3. I need to know because I need to leave it in my truck in the heat sometimes. Apple has the macbooks posted, and the storage temperature limit is 113F, would the surface
 be similar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>also, I can't get to live chat in surface support. after type out my question and select my device (which it shows has tech support until 2017) The blue live chat link come up and says click to start chat. It never does anything. It's been like this for
 a while, really annoying.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To answer your query, the power state of the Surface device makes a difference when storing or transporting a unit, as well as turning on and running it. However, the minimum conditions are not dictated by the battery but by the processor, also known as
 the CPU / Central Processing Unit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>My P.C. was upgraded yesterday to a new version of Windows 10. The version I have is Windows 10 Home version 1709. I received help during an online chat from a technician and he advised that all my old files would be put into Windows old, I have tried to
 find them using several different suggestions from the community without success. There isn't any sensitive stuff in the files, just mainly pictures and personal stuff but I would like them back....so if anyone can help , thank you</p>
<p>

            Hi,
<br />The stuff gets moved to Windows.old only when either of these two scenarios happen:
<br />1. You did a custom Install that removed everything including apps.
<br />2. Your user profile was not migrated correctly.
<br />First of all, can't you find your pictures in your User profile folder? If no,
<br />Please see in the following folder:
<br />C:/Windows.old/Users/&lt;Your username&gt;/ and see the respective folder.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.       
        </p>

<h2>            Extension cord for Surface Pro keyboard</h2>
                    Is there an extension cord for the Surface Pro keyboard? &nbsp;I would like to place the screen at eye level when sitting at my desk, but have the keyboard at a normal typing position. &nbsp;I assume there might be a bluetooth keyboard for some of the newer models,
 but I was wondering if Microsoft or someone else may be producing a short extension cord for this purpose.

<h2>            How to delete libraries in Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to delete the library folders permanently. I don't want them. Instead, I like creating folders and saving the data in those folders. I've been searching for this in several websites. But, I only found a trick to hide them in Windows Explorer. That's
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And after hiding them, they are still available whenever I am browsing for files during uploading anything.</p>

            You can right-click and remove each library, then hide the explorer section entirely by right-clicking a blank area and turning off the "show libraries" checkbox.&nbsp; Then the library definition files, as well as the category in the navigation pane, will
 be removed.

<p>===============================================<br />
The freeware "iWisoft Free Video Converter"<br />
can split a .WMA audio file.</p>
<p>(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
iWisoft Free Video Converter<br />

</p>
<p>Or maybe Movie Maker would be worth <br />
a try.</p>
<p>Import your .WMA audio file into Movie <br />
Maker and in Timeline view...drag it to <br />
the Audio/Music Track.</p>
<p>Play the video/audio by clicking the <br />
"Play" button under the view screen.<br />
<br />
You will see the Playback Indicator <br />
(vertical line) advancing across the <br />
timeline. <br />
<br />
Click the "Pause" button at the point <br />
where you wish to split and type...<br />
Ctrl+L or click the "Split" button at the <br />
bottom of the view screen.<br />
(you can also make adjustments by<br />
dragging the Playback Indicator)<br />
<br />
Make as many splits as you want and <br />
remove the unwanted clips by right<br />
click / delete.<br />
<br />
Leave the segment you wish to save <br />
on the timeline...and save as follows.</p>
<p>To save as a .wma&nbsp;audio file...<br />
Type...Ctrl+P (or go to...File / Save Movie File)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to open the Save Movie Wizard /<br />
Choose...My Computer /<br />
Next /<br />
Enter a Name and a Save Location /<br />
Next /<br />
Tick...'Best Quality For My Computer'<br />
Next/<br />
Wait while the&nbsp;.wma audio file&nbsp;is saved /<br />
Finish...</p>

<h2>            typing in File Explorer starts searching automatically</h2>
                    <p>Hi!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have encountered a problem. A few days before this was not in PC. The problem is when I type any number to go file name easily, it starts searching in search options on upper right most corner. it should not have do this as before when I used to type file
 name lets say 100 (for example in folder shown below i have some power point files, folders and pdf files, it highlighted 100-wyas-to-keep-kids-busy.pdf and after that it moved to other files having100-wyas-to-keep-kids-busy.pdf In the start of file name and
 I quickly used it. now what it does is instead of doing this whatever i type writes in search box in upper right most corner and starts searching. I searched it on this website, but I could not find it...
</p>
<p>so help regarding this will be appreciated.... </p>
<p>for your convenience i have uploaded video on the google drive... file desired.wmv is required as it used be before...</p>
<p>the link of desired.mwv is&nbsp;</p>

            <p>After posting here I again went to folder option and observed the reset for view and restore default for advance setting.<strong> I thought it might work</strong> so I reset folder view and applied restore for advance setting as shown in rectangle and hexagon
 respectively. Glad to see it has worked.... </p>
<p><strong>Thanks a lot for guidance</strong>...</p>

<h2>            Windows store isn&#39;t available at the moment. Please try again later.</h2>
                    <p>I have not tried installing anything from the store in a while, and when I went on it today, it loaded for about 5 seconds and then showed the message 'Windows store isn't available at the moment. Please try again later.' I have tried everything that has
 been suggested to me, including using a store troubleshooter program, correcting the date and time, clearing the store cache and disabling any proxy servers, however the issue persists. After a few times clicking 'try again', it shows the message 'We weren't
 able to connect to the store. This might have happened because of a server problem or the network connection might have timed out. Please wait a few minutes and try again.' It also shows the numbers 0x80004005 in brackets next to this message. I have checked
 my network (I am on a secure wireless Wifi network), yet I still haven't found a solution.</p>

    <title>Wrong Windows 10 edition installed after hardware repair&#59; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raymartsantamaria  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wrong Windows 10 edition installed after hardware repair&#59; can&#39;t activate nor reinstall correct edition</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I'm having trouble activating my copy of Windows.</p>
<p>Prepare for some lengthy text lmao</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some background, my laptop had Windows 8.1 Single Language pre-installed, of which I have the product key for.<br />
<br />
I upgraded to Windows 10 Single Language for free using the Get Windows 10 app within the promo time period. Apparently, Windows 10 was activated with a digital entitlement, but for some reason this was not linked to my Microsoft account?<br />
<br />
Fast forward to around September 2016, my computer's hardware broke down and I needed to have it repaired in a store. However, the store installed the wrong edition of Windows 10 Pro, not Windows 10 Single Language. The product key used by the repair shop was
 then linked to my Microsoft account.<br />
<br />
This year, the product key used by the repair shop to install Windows 10 Pro expired, and I needed to reactivate Windows.<br />
<br />
I contacted Microsoft with the issue, and it was then that I was told that the wrong edition of was installed, and that I needed to do a clean install of Windows 10 Single Language.<br />
<br />
I downloaded Windows 10 Single Language and now am being asked for a product key. I used the product key stored in my computer, but the setup app wouldn't accept it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my digital entitlement wasn't linked to my account, I can't activate it with that. I can't use my Windows 8.1 product key either for some reason. I checked all my old emails from Microsoft from the time I upgraded to 10 from 8.1, but nothing there
 helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've googled EVERYTHING I could think of but nothing comes up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm kind of at a loss as to what to do next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

            If you have a Recovery Disk, boot to the Recovery Disk and you will find the Recovery Environment (which is what I think you mean by Recovery Manager).&nbsp; If it can be reached from the keyboard, the keyboard combination is specific to the manufacturer and
 perhaps the computer itself and you will have to contact them (or check the documentation that came with the PC) to find it.&nbsp; Often it is F8 during the boot process (the same as for safe mode and other recovery options) but yours could be something entirely
 different.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!

    <title>Cannot burn DVDs after upgrading to Windows 10 Pro x64bit. Please - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nla&#64;mmr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot burn DVDs after upgrading to Windows 10 Pro x64bit. Please help.</h2>
                    <p>I already upgraded my Dell Vostro 5560 into Windows 10 Pro x64 from Windows 8.1 Pro x64 in the evening of 29th July 2015 from Myanmar.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two days after upgrade, 31st July, I tried to burn Windows 10 ISO image onto DVD and I can't burn from both Windows built-in tool and Nero.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My DVD drive works perfectly with Windows 8.1 Pro and also I can read CD, DVD and write CD and DVD in Windows 8.1 Pro. I think the problem is with the upgrade of Windows 10 and I don't want to downgrade it also. My DVD drive is HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GUA0N.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any possible upgrade to my DVD drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firmware?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drivers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. Please find and give me the latest upgrade firmware or drivers for my DVD drive. Thanks.</p>

            <p>If your DVD drive came with a CD installer for the driver, you might want to try the basics first by reinstalling the driver. If you get a pop-up about compatibility issue with the driver, visit the manufacturer's website and check if they have updated driver
 for Windows 10 or at least the latest version that works with Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, if you have the encircled items below under Device Manager, right-click and uninstall them all. Then Reboot your PC.</p>

            Not helpful, I have none of those options (ATA Channel) installed under device manager.&nbsp; Systems sees the device, attempts to format and then I get an error msg saying Windows cannot complete the format.<br />

            Well, I figured it out.&nbsp; Instead of formatting the disk like I was used to doing in Win 7 and using the USB/Flash Drive option, I now just use the CD/DVD option and it works perfectly fine.<br />

<h2>            &#91;Solved&#93; Xbox 360 Controller won&#39;t connect to my Windows 7 x64 PC properly</h2>
                    [SAI followed the instructions. installed the software, plugged in the wireless dongle, then started the controller. I tried to sync the controller to the wireless dongle, the dongle will flash for a few moments and the controller has it's little spinning
 light show, they will connect for a moment and the controller recognizes that the dongle is there, but none of the quadrants light up, and the controller goes back to having all 4 quadrants flashing. I have repeated the process a few times now, and I keep
 having the same results, I even tried downloading the Windows 7 x64bit specific drivers with no luck. How can I get this controller to work?

            I actually figured out my problem. I had installed MotionJoy a while back so I could use my PS3 controller to my PC. Well I had uninstalled the software, and figured it would remove it's components on it's own. It didn't. I still had MotionJoy drivers
 installed somewhere. All it took was for me to update the drivers then switch them to the Microsoft licensed XBOX 360 drivers, it was quite confusing though, considering the name of the drivers "MotionJoy Virtual Xinput device for Windows", to me it sounded
 as Microsoft had just used MotionJoy's drivers, I figured maybe they had some sort of deal for it, but I was wrong. So anyway, problem solved. Thanks anyway Vijay, maybe someone will find your reply useful in the near future.<br />
