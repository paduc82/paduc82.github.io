<p>That happened on 360 when Rock Star servers were acting up. &nbsp;Just don't play story and it usually recovers. &nbsp;Cause I use to be saved and with servers bugged showed the cinema of the early heist. &nbsp;After letting servers get back on track it go back to the
 old save. &nbsp;Maybe servers filling up with new players? &nbsp;Cause digital GTA5 is $40.19 now. &nbsp;I bought it today. &nbsp;Still downloading it. &nbsp;But if you played more on story mode you could of overwritten on the game save even with it bugged. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Actually story mode doesn't carry over from 360 to XBOX1. &nbsp;Just your online character carries over. &nbsp;Cause I just bought GTA5 Friday. &nbsp;I got the opening sequence of them robbing the vault and racing away in the snow.</p>

<p>^^ &nbsp; I don't think that has anything to do with what the OP is asking about.</p>
<p>OP -- Provided you've been playing while connected to Xbox Live, all of your saves are saved in the cloud. &nbsp;You can delete your save off of the hard drive, boot up the game and it should sync to the Cloud. &nbsp;I guess that's worth a shot.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Rollback Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bo parmar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Rollback Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have an HP Stream 7 tablet and recently upgraded to Windows 10. I upgraded from 8.1 and have been experiencing problems with the upgrade and decided to revert back to my previous version. I tried to use the rollback feature through recovery but I keep
 getting an error message saying the files needed are missing. I also tried to start a recovery through the system reboot, holding the power and volume down buttons, but an error message keeps coming up. When I upgrade to Windows 10 I didn't have enough disk
 space so I used a micro sd card for the download. My tablet performed much better when it was running on windows 8.1 and I just want to go back to my previous version. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Similar problem with Nextbook (purchased last January). I did not have enough space on hard drive to save the win8 so I saved it to my 64 GB SD card. During the recovery process it alternates between the Nextbook splash page and "Restoring your previous
 version of Windows". It's been running for three days.</p>
<p>Do I shut it off and then reboot? The recovery options link did not list any viable options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I started the Rollback various parts of win 10 stopped working and the last straw was when mail stopped working. When I'd try to delete a spam email (no option to added to spam folder/filter), Mail would close. I will not be able to recommend WIN
 10 despite the improvements from win 8 and I've been using Microsoft Windows since before 3.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a Toshiba win7 laptop that I upgraded to WIN 10 and the rollback worked fine for that/this one. This machine is the only current machine I have that is working otherwise I'd phone support instead of the community bulletin board. Does Microsoft
 have such a number?</p>

<h2>            NEED EVERYONE&#38;&#35;39&#59;S HELP</h2>
                    
<p>I've been playing GTA for years and years. I am currently ranked 5th globally in Free For all. My original Gamertag was xXx Mr S3RB xXx. I've got so many haters on GTA because of my high ranking and because I win most games. A couple of months ago, I changed
 my Gamertag just for a few days, because My friends and I were playing undercover on unknown gamertags in a clan matches and we didn't want the opponents to know who we really were.. After our clan matches &nbsp;I went to go change it back to xXx Mr S3RB xXx &amp;
 it was already taken. It got taken in a matter of hours after it got released. The tag was only used that one day when i changed my Gamertag and the person who took my name sadly has not been online ever since the day he took my name. The account has two achievements,
 its on silver and is in active. I would do anything to get it back as it was my Original Gamertag ever since I got my Xbox. I don't think its fair that someone just takes my GT on purpose because they don't like me. My current Gamertag is GeNeSis x BoSS. Please
 if there is anything Microsoft or anyone can do, help me out here !</p>

<p>Well, I've never heard of that happening before, wanting to change your GT for just a little bit part. But you should have known better to change your GT in the first place, even if it was just for a little while. If you wanted to game under a different
 alias, you should have just made a new GT, found a 48 hour card, and did it that way. It makes me wonder though, who would have known that you changed your tag if you didn't tell anyone (but the people you were playing with)? I really don't think you're going
 to get it back, unless that person changes his/her gamertag to something else, which then returns your gamertag back into the pool of unused tags.</p>

<p>Sooooo Genesis x Boss. Did you modify your Gamer score before or after you changed your Gamer tag? &nbsp;It is kinda hard to unlock online only achievements with NO time stamp.</p>

<h2>            How Wndow 7 Home Premium English support Big 5 or GB code display if they are not unicode code&#63;</h2>
                    I would like to know to set Window 7 Home Premium English to support to display Big5 or GB code if they are not unicode. I can do it in Window XP and Window Vista in extra lanugage setting in control panel, but it&nbsp;cannot do so in Window 7.

 dear soul if you ever adventure into the dark web. So i did a system restore deleted all files and Programs fresh start right nope it took forever for my pc refresh HUM wonder what was going on in the background Collecting perhaps one is just to say. any ways
 after the reset my pc got hacked mouse moved and no not a mouse issue my ran error reports and so on. so screw that I reformated under the cd windows ten deleted all my partions well that took seven attemps because all my files where looked down in a admin
 protocall so i could not access my files or modifi the user settings if that was not bad enough there were odd partions set up on my drives. so finnaly got every thing to work after hours of tweaking. then my to my weird knowlege my pc turned on last night
 byitself wondering hum again my task are wacked and whatever so i ran check on my mother boad lan by wake is disable and after further researching microsoft set the time in scheldule to turn on at 4am. freaking loosers i did nothing wrong to be harrsed like
 this. here is my document&nbsp; Here is my Hack error reports. </p>

<h2>            Xbox App - Cannot connect to console</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>First of all, I have looked through the sticky threads on here and still to no avail. So please don't think i've not done my research before posting this.</p>
<p>I am trying to stream to my windows 10 laptop. It worked perfectly from day 1 but no more. It says it cannot connect to the xbox and when I click 'Add new device' it doesn't even find my Xbox.<br />
<br />
I have rebooted the router and xbox (and laptop) numerous times (including hard reboot of both). I have also set a static IP to my Xbox and even tried forwarding the ports to it but still nothing. If i search the IP address it still finds nothing! Which is
 really wierd. I am running the laptop on the 2Ghz wireless connection and the Xbox is hard wired to the same router (exactly the same as when it worked to begin with).<br />
<br />
My xbox is showing Open NAT and up around 160Mb download and 12Mb Upload and all devices are set up within a couple meters of each other (same room), so I'm certain there isn't an issue with connection.</p>
<p>I have also checked for windows updates and also selected the Xbox app in the store and can't see anything to indicate I need an update of the app.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I wondered if that was the case DaGingr. But I am noticing that my NAT settings keep going to "Moderate" even though I have all my ports opened and it is hard wired directly into the only router in the system.</p>
<p>Really annoying. But at the moment I'm not sure if its my ISP or the console that's causing the problem. It's a bit strange how many threads on here saying it "Used to work and now it doesn't". Surely its an Xbox problem?</p>
<p>Any advice Microsoft?</p>

<p>On another note, have any of you&nbsp;tried running the&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update troubleshooter</a>? If not give it a shot, see if any problems are fixed, and if so reboot your computer, power cycle your Xbox One console
 (hold the power button for 10 seconds or until it turns off), boot the console back up, and see if you can do the Add a Device and connect.</p>

<p>I was in this exact same boat... It worked flawlessly for a couple of weeks (love the streaming feature, btw). The with no changes to the network configuration it stopped working. Rebooting systems, modems, routers didn't seem to have any impact.</p>
<p>The step that it started working after (I tried a few things in sequence, so I'm not completely sure this is what did it) was to run the Windows Update troubleshooter as eG x Thee Elf suggested. It found one error described as "Service registration is missing
 or corrupt". I had it repair it and restarted the machine. While the machine was restarting I did go ahead and do the xbox power button for 10 seconds again, so I guess it is possible it just needed like a 5th reboot? But most likely it was the update troubleshooter
 that fixed the problem.</p>
<p>Hope this helps somebody :)</p>

<p>&nbsp; Okay I know this is going to have no help on your currant situation but I have been looking for some help and instead of starting a new thread I decided to chime in on this post seeing as you guys have a fair ammount of achievements and are probably alot
 smarter than myself. </p>
<p>&nbsp; This is my problem. I am an older gamer and am also a real *** when it comes to ipads, smartglass, etc and my 11 year old daughter knows alot more than myself. But I have been gaming for a very long time and I am interested in getting to know a little
 more to catch up with todays tech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;But I cant seem to figure out how to play the games on my PC and get the achievements for them on my xbox one? I noticed alot of my friends are recieveing achievements for games like solitare, etc and the played them on the PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp; How exactly do I do this? Is is complicated? If so, please disregard. I dont want my wife and I to get to the point where we cant use the PC. lol</p>
<p>&nbsp; I someone has some time to help me it would be greatly appreciated. If you dont have the time I fully understand.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;P.S.--I have also noticed while reading some threads that alot of people are losing there gamer tag and accounts trying to do this. If this is possible I dont want to lose my account and all my achievements so If there is anything really important to know
 please alos help me. Feel free to add my gamertag on xbox one. THX in advance</p>

    <title>Very Strange Behavior after Windows 10 Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joyful-pastor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Very Strange Behavior after Windows 10 Update</h2>
                    <p>Help! After updating one of our PCs to Windows 10, we have encountered several "strange behavior" challenges. We have been looking for solutions via the communities on Microsoft and NVIDIA and elsewhere, but cannot find the "right" answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Strange Behavior #1</strong> -- The display is producing very inconsistent results. Some functions of Windows do not display anything at all (such as the "Apps &amp; Features" option in Settings &gt; System &gt; Apps &amp; Features). The icons sometimes show up
 for the installed programs. Sometimes the list actually shows up. Sometimes nothing at all shows up. Sometimes the list of prompts and values to Search, Sort, and Filter do not show up. Sometimes they show up, but there is "ghost" text all over the list of
 values in the drop downs. This "ghosting" effect can be seen in several other areas of the UI, but it is also very inconsistent. We have tried uninstalling and re-installing the latest drivers from NVIDIA, but this has not helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Strange Behavior #2</strong> -- All of the Office 2013 (client installation) applications are completely broken. Every time we attempt to launch any of the components (Outlook, Word, Excel, etc.), the system states that the application has stopped
 working and that Windows will close it and notify us if a solution is available. We have attempted to run the "sfc /scannow" command (with Administrative privileges) and it returned no errors. We have downloaded and run the OffCAT utility to examine each application.
 While it reported a few issues with the applications, no solid solutions were offered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line is... at the moment, this perfectly functioning Windows 7 Pro administrative machine is now a completely dysfunctional Windows 10 Pro boat anchor. We need to know if there is a way to correct these two issues. If not, what is the process for
 backing out Windows 10 and going back to the tried and true Windows 7 Pro configuration we had only a few short days ago?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very frustrating and sad. One of our laptops (a newer Win 8.1 Pro device) updated very cleanly to Win 10 and had given us hope that upgrading this older (though fully confirmed by Microsoft) Win 7 machine would upgrade smoothly. Not so.</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>To resolve this issue you may try the following steps:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>First, try uninstalling and re-installing Office 2013 completely.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check if re-installing resolves the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If not then you may reset Windows 10 and check if it resolves the issue. Follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may refer to the following Microsoft Article which talks about creating bootable media like a DVD for installing/re-settings Windows 10. The following article
 shows how to download the tool which helps in creating the bootable media, and how to run the tool:
</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now use the Windows 10 DVD to reset Windows 10. While resetting the Windows 10 using DVD you may choose an option which allows you to keep all your files and information.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let us know if you need any other information or assistance.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you.

            <p>Thank you Mohan, but frankly this is not a super helpful response. We could certainly have done these things all by ourselves and without any technical guidance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you likely are aware, starting from scratch with either Office or Windows is not a trivial process. With Office, there are many trails of data that might not easily be saved and restored (custom dictionaries, email signatures, etc.) if we uninstall and
 re-install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Likewise, uninstalling Win 10 and re-installing from scratch is a potentially labor-intensive and risky process regarding currently installed applications. Ideally, Microsoft would have made it "easy" to get back to Windows 7 (or 8, depending on where one
 is before upgrading).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worst case, we will do one or both of these things, but that should be a "last resort", not a FIRST response to a concern like ours.</p>

            <p>We've solved our own issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Strange Behavior #1</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;-- The display is producing very inconsistent results.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>SOLUTION:</strong> Manually install updated NVIDIA drivers. Though we've had to do this more than one time following a Windows 10 update or two, this does work. We're hoping that Microsoft figures
 out how to stop "stepping on" or overwriting some of the files associated with those drivers to eliminate the need to re-apply the fix every few days/weeks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Strange Behavior #2</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;-- All of the Office 2013 (client installation) applications are completely broken.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong> Remove old versions of Office (not done by the Office 2013 installation) as well as some add-ons/plug-ins. Where needed/desired, re-install the add-on/plug-in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This did not require a fresh installation of either Office or Windows and did resolve our issues. So... to Mohan and all other Microsoft support staff, the correct answer is not always to wipe things clean and start over. That has -- unfortunately -- often
 been the Microsoft position on issues like these when, with a bit of actual troubleshooting and trial and error, there's almost always a better way.</p>

            <p>Hi NINAJACK115,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've uninstalled all of MS Office 2003, you might still have add-ons or plug-ins installed that MS attempted to "re-connect" for you when you first installed Office 2013. We had an "automatic BCC" add-on as well as a Google connector add-on. We basically
 stripped it down to a bare Office 2013 install and then repaired that, as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once we could open Office 2013 apps (Outlook/Word/etc.) successfully, we started re-installing the add-ins that we believed were still needed. Start slow. Check between each uninstall and re-install to see if you can identify your culprit application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck! :)</p>
<p />

            Thank you. I don't own the Office 2013 disk, it was a download from a Home Use Program.&nbsp; At this point I'm afraid of losing my files.&nbsp; Where do I look for add-ons or plug-ins?&nbsp; I appreciate your advice.

            <p>We also downloaded Office 2013 (from Office365). We had the same concerns about losing files and did not want to do that. We did make sure we had a full backup before making any program changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find your add-ins, there are a couple of options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the File tab.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the "Manage Add-Ins" button in the center section of the screen. This will give you a list of some that may be slow or already disabled.</li><li>Make note of those and then click the "Close" button.</li><li>Now click the "Options" menu choice on the left.</li><li>Near the bottom of the Outlook Options navigation menu on the left, click "Add-Ins". This gives you a more comprehensive list of the add-ins that are installed.</li><li>Make note of those and then click the "OK" or "Cancel" button (cancel is fine if you've made no changes).</li></ol>
<p>If you noticed any add-ins that you can uninstall and re-install (i.e. you downloaded them yourselves or bought a piece of software to add-in to Outlook), now would be the time to uninstall them (using Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features). One example
 we had was an add-in that synchronizes Outlook across multiple PCs. For us, that was one had to be uninstalled and re-installed before Outlook worked as intended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still... one of the bigger "helps" was to remove Outlook 2010 completely from our machine. That seemed to be the larger problem than the add-ins.</p>

<br />
That really does not help, because you do not say WHAT you had tried.<br />
<br />
At the risk of being redundant, here are my suggestions :<br />
<br />
1. Uninstall the " normal " way. Go to Programs and Features or Add and Remove, and uninstall.<br />
<br />
2. Install Revo Uninstaller and use it to uninstall :&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Revo-Uninstaller/3000-2096_4-10687648.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.cnet.com/Revo-Uninstaller/3000-2096_4-10687648.html</a><br />
<br />
3. Do system restore. Pick a date ( if you can go that far ) BEFORE you installed iolo system shield as your restore point.<br />
<span><span>Start button &gt; search box, type system restore &gt;press Enter key &gt; uac prompt &gt; click Choose a different restore point &gt; Next &gt; select the date as your restore point, click it &gt; Next &gt; Finish<br />
Sit back and wait. The machine will re-start when it is done.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try going back to a previous Windows point to repair.
<br />Follow the steps below to restore your computer to a previous date using a restore point:
<br />
<br />1- Type recovery in the search box of the taskbar and choose Recovery (Control Panel).
<br />2.- Click on Open System Restore.
<br />3.- Click on Next.
<br />4.- Select your restore point, and click Next.
<br />5.- Click on Finish.
<br />
<br />The computer will reboot and present a message on the desktop confirming that the restoration was successful.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

            Hi Wes.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />F8 is not how to access Safe Mode any longer.  If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode this way:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also at any time enter the Repair Mode by one of these illustrated methods to try to System Restore, use the Command Prompt to perform repairs, or if necessary Reset Windows 10:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />1) Try to Re-register the Start Menu:  <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/re-register-start-menu-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/re-register-start-men...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Right click Start button to open Task Manager, show More Details, then choose Processes tab, scroll down to Windows Processes, then further down to Windows Explorer.  Right click to Restart, click OK.  Restart PC.
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />4) Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />5) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Cast to Device Error 0x80040154 Samsung TV Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently got a major windows update, and since then I can no longer cast videos from my PC to my TV using cast to device. I get the message "unexpected device error HRESULT: 0x80040154".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried a lot of things such as reinstalling windows media player, turning off and on my TV and PC, disabling and enabling firewall, removing my TV from devices on PC and re-adding it, disabling and reenabling my home network/streaming options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help please.... I don't know what to do next. And when I google that error code nothing comes up relating to unable to cast to device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Might be your network card. Driver got updated which made it incompatible now. <br />Go to search type device manager and open it. <br />Go to your network card right click it go to properties. Go to driver tab. <br />See if you can roll it back. <br />If not update and see if that works. <br />If none of that works then I would uninstall and hide the updates that you last installed. <br /><br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/3183922/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-windows-update-from-reinstalling-in-windo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/318392...</a>

            Hello thank you for the reply. I tried updating network card and restarted but it still doesn't work. I would rather not uninstall the windows update as this was a major update that was forced to install I didn't get a choice and it took about 2 hours
 to complete, I think it amy have been the creators fall update which I had postponed from last year. No doubt if I uninstall the update it will just force itself upon me again, is there anything else I can try to get cast to device working again while staying
 at this version of Windows?

</p><p>I downloaded the app for my PC and my TV appears in the app but when I click on it it just says "oops something went wrong". There must be a connection issue between my PC and TV but I don't know what since I had it all working on problems at all before

            Let's rule out system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the status of the apps troubleshooter did not detect any issues (if tried), I suggest you to check if similar issue occurs on another user account. Create another Microsoft administrator user
 account on the computer by referring to </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/getstarted-set-up-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Set up accounts</span></strong></a><span>&nbsp;article.
 This is only to determine if the issue is OS specific or user account specific.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The corrupted user profile does not function normally such as not launching
<strong>Start menu</strong>, <strong>Cortana, Search bar, Store </strong>and other
<strong>Windows applications</strong>. In such cases creating a new profile and checking for the same will help in identifying if the is specific to corrupted user profile or the OS.</span></p>
