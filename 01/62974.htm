    <title>Windows Live Mail 25 Recipient Limit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hhomefs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live Mail 25 Recipient Limit</h2>
                    Any e-mail that I try to download from my online e-mail provider that has over 25 recipients will not come down into Windows Live Mail. &nbsp;The mail will stay on the server and not marked as Read. &nbsp;There is no error message any longer, but there used to be.
 &nbsp;Now it just ignores it. &nbsp;Where is that limit coming from? &nbsp;My internet service provider doesn't do any limiting.

            <p>No.&nbsp; In fact I didn't use real people.&nbsp; I sent e-mails with recipients as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[MyAddress]@GMail.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That downloaded fine.&nbsp; Then I tried:</p>

</p>
<p>That downloaded fine.&nbsp; You can see the pattern I'm sure.&nbsp; All the way up to </p>

<p>[MyAddress]@GMail.com,

*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, ..., *** Email address is removed for privacy ***,
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That downloaded fine.&nbsp; That makes 25 recipients - me and 24 NoOnes.&nbsp; Then I tried:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[MyAddress]@GMail.com, 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***,

*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It didn't download, nor any either numbers of recipients over 25.&nbsp; And the e-mail in the GMail server shows as Unread where all of the other downloaded ones were marked as Read.&nbsp; To make things extra interesting, if I put all of the NoOnes in BCC the e-mail
 will download, regardless of the count.</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried Crtl CVZX on a USB keyboard and it works.</p>
<p>So does that mean the type cover is spoiled? but the regular buttons without the "ctrl" function still works, and "ctrl+A" could select all as well.</p>
<p>What went wrong?</p>

<p>Thank you for updating us, Yappp.&nbsp; If the keyboard shortcuts work on a normal USB keyboard, then there may be a problem with the Type Cover keys. You can try doing a reset to see if that would fix the issue. If after the reset, the issue persists, you may
 need to have the Type Cover replaced.</p>

<p>Resetting lets you choose whether to keep your files or remove them, and then install a fresh copy of Windows and device drivers. Doing this will help you determine if the keyboard is faulty. Click this

<h2>            Problem accessing my account cause of security proofs&#63;</h2>
                    I've had the same account for almost 4 years and never had a problem.. I tried signing in one day and it said "Problem with account go to live.com/support" and so I did. I never set these security proofs and the email they have provided for me doesnt match
 up with any of the emails i have, so I tried the "can't access your account" button, and after I filled out the questionnaire it said it would send an email to the email address I put down within 24 hours. Waited a few days nothing, tried again. A week, nothing,
 tried again. And then a month, nothing tried again. Now it's been about 2-3 months and I never got an email, and when I called, all the team told me I could do was to do "can't access your account" button and I told them I already tried it and they said try
 it again. I tried the "chat with ambassador" button, wait time said less than 1 minute, and I waited about 15, and got nothing. I'm really starting to get POed because I've put a good bit of money into DLC/Arcade games that

<p>Hey, so you said the password works. Can you still log into that account through xbox.com? If so you could try updating your security information there and see if that helps.</p>

                    <p>Original title: Netgear WGPS606 compatibility.</p>
<p>Hi, I use a Netgear WGPS606 wireless print server. To get Windows8 correctly working I had to reinstall and hence now need to reload the Netgear drivers but Windows8 prevents this with a 'The Operating system denied access to the specified file'&nbsp;any ideas?</p>

            Click "more information" then click "run anyway". I still haven't gotten it to work though as it does not detect the print server...even after turning off the firewall.

<h2>            LifeCam HD-3000 Installation Failed</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I can't install Lifecam HD 3000 on a Win XP PC with all the updates in order.<br />
A fault message pops up during installation tells it failed without and specific reason, and gave the following link: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953691<br />
<br />
I have gone through all the steps on that link, but doesn't help.<br />
<br />
I have checked others who had the same problem, but no help, links below I checked<br />
<ul>
<li>https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itprohardware/thread/9b07dba1-2b28-47bd-9423-e4db4b8b5a6f</li></ul>

<li>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953691</li></ul>
<br />
I have also tried in failsafe mode with network enabled, logged in as admin, but with the same fault.<br />
<br />
Why can't we manually download the complete installation SW?<br />
(The SW "LifeCam3.60.exe" one can download from<br />
<ul>
<li>https://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/lifecam-hd-3000 &nbsp;</li></ul>
is not a complete SW package, it contacts MS and download more stuff and that part is what fails, one can see the connection in a firewall program it downloads about 5 Mb which is about ~10% of the progression bar until it fails, so obviously the whole package
 it wants to DL is over &gt;50 Mb)<br />
<br />
Please if possible give me a manual download link for the complete SW, or tell where to find a generic webcam SW from somewhere else, if not please give some advice how to proceed, many thanks in advance.<br />

            <b>Hi I solved it, please read on as it might help you too!</b><br />
<br />
When I opened up this thread I had been trying for 4 hours to solve this **** and apparently a lot of people have problems with the installation procedure.<br />
<br />
When I installed the program, I noticed in the beginning in a tiny window which shows the progress, it showed a folder it had created that had a random name consisting of numbers and letters such as: 56eb37a890142, go and find it!<br />
<br />
In that folder it creates sub-folders, where one of the sub-folder has the name "windowsinstaller"<br />
<ul>
<li>Drive:\56eb37a890142\windowsinstaller\x86\windowsxp-kb942288-v3-x86.exe</li></ul>
<p>(Your path may differ, but mine was created on a different driver/partition than my Windows driver.)<br />
</p>
<br />
During the installation process, I didn't proceed through all steps (actually I just left the installation in the middle of the process as is, if I remember there are 3 steps, first the unpacking, the other 2 steps appears in a new window, and I didn't remember
 now did I do the 2nd step as well, however, it is the 3rd step that fails but in this hack you don't go there)
<br />
....instead, after the 56eb37a890142 folder was created, I went to the sub-folder and installed the
<br />
<ul>
<li>windowsxp-kb942288-v3-x86.exe</li></ul>
<p>After this file was installed, Windows automatically forced closing programs and re-started, after restart I went back to the</p>
<p>56eb37a890142 random folder, and double-clicked on the following file</p>
<ul>
<li>setup.exe</li></ul>
<p>All of a sudden the installation went through, obviously something is wrong with the installer, I suspect it doesn't apply the windowsxp-kb942288-v3-x86.exe update, or somehow fail to do so.</p>
<p>One more thing about the random folder "56eb37a890142", I have a weak memory of it, if the installation failed, the folder would be deleted, so one might have to make a copy of it.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Edit: </b>I checked up the Windows installer "windowsxp-kb942288-v3-x86.exe"
<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;this is a "Windows Installer 4.5 Redistributable", it can be downloaded separately from the link here below, one could try this instead of the above described procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=8483</li></ul>

    <title>Driver installation failed for USB composite device &#40;MIDI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexh 846  say:</h3>
<h2>            Driver installation failed for USB composite device &#40;MIDI controller&#41; in Windows 7</h2>
                    I'm having trouble with a newly purchased USB device.&nbsp; When I plug it in, a message pops up saying&nbsp; "Installing device driver software" then a few seconds later it says "Device driver software was not successfully installed".&nbsp; The details aren't the same
 every time.&nbsp; Usually it shows up as "USB Composite Device" and just shows a red cross with the word "Failed".&nbsp; Sometimes it comes up with the name of the device (Icon iControls) and tells me the device is unplugged.&nbsp; The behaviour is similar to this issue:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2742516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="KB2742516">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2742516</a><br />
except that the device I'm using is a MIDI controller, not a USB hub, and I haven't used either of the hotfixes linked from that article.<br />
<br />
I'm using Windows 7 SP1 64 bit on a desktop PC with an AMD Athlon processor.<br />
<br />
I've tried the hotfix at KB2742516 (above link) but the installer pops up a message saying "The update is not applicable to your computer".<br />
<br />
In Device Manager, after checking "show hidden devices", I can see the device listed under Universal Serial Bus controllers as a USB Composite Device, greyed out.&nbsp; The device status is "Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer. (Code
 45)".&nbsp; This is while the device is still plugged in: it is lit up, showing that's it's drawing power from the USB port.&nbsp; Unplugging it and plugging it in again makes no difference.<br />
<br />
Under "driver details", the device manager shows the file C:\Windows\system32\drivers\usbccgp.sys with version number 6.1.7601.18328.&nbsp; This file was updated on 27th November 2013.&nbsp; When I click the "update driver" button, it searches for a few minutes and tells
 me that the driver is up to date.&nbsp; I've run Windows Update and installed recent updates yesterday.<br />
<br />
I've tested the device on a friend's computer and it works fine.&nbsp; It's only on my PC that it fails.<br />
<br />
I've tried using a different USB cable, and connecting to a different USB port, with no change.<br />
<br />
I can use other USB MIDI devices with no problems.&nbsp; This is the only device that doesn't work for me.<br />
<br />
I've contacted Icon customer support, and they've verified that the device is class-compliant (plug and play) and should work with the built-in Windows USB drivers.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any suggestions on how to get this working!<br />

            Hello Neha,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I tried both methods.&nbsp; It didn't resolve the problem.<br />
<br />
I tried method 1 twice, first without the device connected and then with.<br />
<br />
The output of the troubleshooter both times was "The troubleshooter made some changes to your system.&nbsp; Try attempting the task you were trying to do before. Problems found: "Hardware changes might not have been detected".&nbsp; Detected&nbsp; (picture of yellow "warning"
 triangle)."<br />
<br />
For method 2, I'm not sure exactly what you mean, as there is no Windows 7 driver for my device: Icon technical support have told me that it should work with built-in Windows drivers and I shouldn't need to install a driver file manually.&nbsp; I found a file called
 "i-Series Driver for Windows XP-V101.exe" on the disk that came with my device.&nbsp; I tried installing this in compatibility mode following your instructions, and it didn't make a difference.<br />
<br />
Can you suggest any other methods I could try?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help.<br />

            <p>Hello again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your efforts in looking for a solution.&nbsp; Unfortunately it's still not working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all six methods in KB2654149.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1 (disconnect and reconnect) made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For method 2 (install hotfixes), the installer popped up a message saying "The update is not applicable to your computer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3 (install latest updates) made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For method 4 (reinstall USB controllers), after rebooting I saw a message listing which drivers had been reinstalled.&nbsp; Next to&nbsp;"USB Root Hub" was a rotating cursor and the text"Searching preconfigured driver folders..." It seems that everything except my
 new MIDI device still works normally.&nbsp; The behaviour of the MIDI device is unchanged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 5 (disable USB selective suspend) made no difference.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the suggestion.&nbsp; It is good of you to spend so much time helping me with this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the Clean Boot did not resolve the issue, and neither did installing the driver again in compatibility mode.&nbsp; Nothing has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did notice something else interesting today.&nbsp; If I have Device Manager open when I connect the device, I see a new USB Composite Device appear, and then disappear about two seconds later.&nbsp; If I'm quick enough to right-click and choose "properties" before
 it disappears, it shows the device status as error code 10, "This device cannot start", and then the status changes to code 45, "Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer".&nbsp; I don't know if this information is useful.</p>

</p><p>I'm sorry to report that this didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I backed up the registry and then deleted the UpperFilters entry (data="ksthunk") from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\4D36E96C-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318 corresponding to device type "Audio and video devices".&nbsp; There was no LowerFilters
 entry.&nbsp; I also looked for the "USB host controllers and hubs" device type (36FC9E60-C465-11CF-8056-444553540000) but this one didn't have an UpperFilters or LowerFilters.&nbsp; Then I rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell, the behaviour of my system is unchanged.&nbsp; Audio and MIDI devices that were working previously are still working, and I still get the same error when I plug in the new MIDI controller.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to perform a <strong>
SFC Scan</strong> and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Refer to the following link given below.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.

</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion.&nbsp; The SFC scan took about ten minutes and displayed the message "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."&nbsp; It hasn't made any difference: the MIDI controller still doesn't work.</p>

<h2>            How to open an Image in Photo Viewer through Command line.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I want to open an image in Photo Viewer through command line. I have tried the below command and some other possible combinations too.<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\System32&gt;rundll32.exe "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Photo Viewer\PhotoViewer.dll", ImageView_Fullscreen %1<br />
<br />
*** Where 1 is the path of the image.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately after running command nothing happened. I have tried some other possible combinations too but no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other way to did the same. I am on windows 8.1 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            NBA 2K12 - My Player &#61; Horrible game.</h2>
                    
<p>How did 2K sports botch this part of the game so horribly. in 2k11 it was one of my favorite parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now the skill point system is ridiculous. Its too expensive to upgrade your player and try to make your self better. This defeats the purpose of a upgrade path. Im not going to put in an entire seasons work just to have a decent mid range jumper and nothing
 else.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Im sure this level of detail is great for the seasoned vet that does nothing else other than play NBA 2K12 but for the average gamer its too time consuming and just not worth it as the pay off is nowhere in sight. 2K has really polarised their target audience
 with this! FAIL!</p>

<p>My Player is great. Association is broken. Why are teams shooting 75% in the first 3 quarters and then 25% in the 4th quarter? Every away game so far does this. Playing defense has no effect. I've had 3 people guarding guys when they take a shot and it still
 goes in. lol!! It's horrible. NBA 2K11 is so much better. Why do my player not run or get back on defense? I hit the turbo and my stamina bar starts to go down and the play continues to trot at the same speed. lol!! Completely broken. It wasn't like this in
 NBA 2K11. I still play 2K11. My player is terrible in 2K11 and Association is terrible in 2K12. My players move like they are running in molasses have the time. It's ridiculous. Response time between the controller and player is horrendous. I push the analog
 and the player takes 2-3 secs to move. What a joke. </p>

<p>@ Hom3y Da Klown. You guys know that this Forums page was originally set up to have a singular point for constructive criticisms dont you? Thats why its good to be able to give feed back and the developers can actually fix problems and improve gameplay.
 How about you think about the games you play rather than just being a fan boy. </p>

<h2>            Lego World DLC codes</h2>
                    <p>We purchased the new Lego Worlds game for our XBOX One.&nbsp; We were expecting to receive DLC codes for/with it however there was nothing.&nbsp; No clue where to go in search of them....... I searched the XBOX sites as well as as Microsoft but have not found anything.&nbsp; My grandson is wanting especially the Classic Space DLC. Finally called XBOX and she could not tell me anything as she was unable to find any info as well.&nbsp; Please help me with this ASAP if you would.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p>Ciao QuiCkz AleX,</p>
<p>grz x il benvenuto e x le info !!!</p>
<p>Circa i giochi SEGA ero a conoscenza di alcune realise ma non di quella Dreamcast !!! Che tra l'altro mi rende molto felice visto che la ritengo la &nbsp;( Dreamcast ) una delle macchine piu' belle mai realizzate alla quale credo la Microsoft debba molto !!!</p>
<p>Tuttavia mi rammarica il fatto che non ci sia uno spazio per le richieste dedicato agli XBLA , sono fan SEGA ma Crazy Taxi e Sonic ADV ci sono gia' come XBLA &nbsp;, e infondo credo che piu' che per le collection sia meglio puntare sui Games singoli in formato
 XBLA , &nbsp;dove sono Sega Rally 2 ( si c'e' Sega Rally OnLine ma non vale quanto Sega Rally 2 !!! ) Dytona USA &nbsp;, Fighting Viper, Decathlete, Ferrari 355 Challenge, &nbsp;giusto per citare qualcosa....Cio' nonostante che dire del primo Metal Gear Solid del quale e'
 stato fatto anche un bel adattamento per Nintendo GC, per inciso anche Sonic ADV e' uscito sia per DreamCast che per Nintendo GC !!! In ogni caso ci sono un sacco di altri bei giochi che varrebbe la pena di poter vedere come XBLA non sei daccordo !? :)</p>
<p>Non ho capito una cosa circa le Game Room....Io la scarico come Demo e poi la compro, e poi i vari pacchetti si comprano e vengono integrati nella Game Room !?</p>
<p>Ti ringrazio ancora,</p>

</div>
<div>then it asks for email/password for MS account (screen/form looks corrupted too)</div>
<div>http://img856.imageshack.us/img856/787/uavx.png</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 Media Player Won&#39;t Sync AT ALL</h2>
                    <p>I cannot get any Sync functions out of Windows 10's media player.&nbsp; I can't even access "Set Up Sync".&nbsp; It's like some policy is blocking any and all avenues of syncing music or anything else from Windows Media Player.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The only message shown is "Connect A Device", but when I connect a device it's as if the Media Player doesn't sense that a device has been connected. I never had this problem with Windows 7.

            thank you for your replay but the problem was in none of those, problem was related to privacy, and it turns out that office online privacy is bad, you cant turn them off individually, only all off or all on, and i am not happy with what office online
 can access, please report this further on to who is dealing with privacy issues.

    <title>HP Color LaserJet CP 2025 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HP Color LaserJet CP 2025</h2>
                    <p>I've owned this printer for a number of years and never really had any major issues until recently.&nbsp; It started with the printer not recognizing a request to print a document.&nbsp; I Uninstalled the printer and then reinstalled, this seemed to correct the problem.&nbsp;
 Then it stopped printing in color when needed and only prints in B&amp;W.&nbsp; I again Uninstalled and reinstalled and it corrected the problem briefly, then reverts back to printing B&amp;W.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 on my desktop.&nbsp; Does or has anybody run into this type of problem and if so, how to correct it?</p>
<p>
