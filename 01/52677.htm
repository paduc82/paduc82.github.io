    <title>Protected Content Migration window wants a password, but won&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> floydlawrence  say:</h3>
<h2>            Protected Content Migration window wants a password, but won&#39;t accept the password it is asking for.</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from Vista 64-bit to Windows 7 64-bit.&nbsp; I used the Easy Transfer program to save my settings out to my wife's computer hard drive prior to doing the upgrade.&nbsp; I have now used the Easy Transfer program to move my settings back to my Windows 7 install.&nbsp;
 It appears that everything has transferred appropriately, but I have a window open that says "Type the password for your old computer&nbsp;&nbsp; Protected content was recently transferred to this computer.&nbsp; Type the password for your user account on the old computer
 listed below to update the content protection on your new account."&nbsp; The password on the new account and the old account are the same.&nbsp; However, when I type in the password I get a message "The password is incorrect."&nbsp; I have checked, rechecked, rerechecked
 and still no success.&nbsp; Can someone help me understand what exactly this window might be looking for?&nbsp; Also, what will be missing if I just cancel out of this box?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Floyd</p>

<p><span>Hi Floyd,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers community.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Before we get started trying to troubleshoot your issue can you provide some additional information to help us fix the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What types of files are you trying to access ?</span></p>

</span></span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span></span><span>Is it happening with all the files you created the backup and restored ?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you perform a upgrade or custom install of Windows 7?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Check if you have windows.old folder in your hard drive?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you set any password while creating a backup?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
</span></span><span>If you have any Security software, you may try disabling security software and check if you can access those files.</span></p>
<p><span>Also try accessing those files in safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span>To use a

<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple
 operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears. </span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the arrow keys to choose
<strong>Safe Mode in Windows Advanced Options</strong> menu appears, and then press ENTER.

Easy Transfer issued the "Your Transfer is complete" notice. The reports about what was transferred and lists of programs are accessible. My old desktop is back, along with icons for various programs and files (e.g., PPT, XLS and&nbsp;PDF files). I've checked a
 few of the document files, and they display ok. So, as far as I can easily tell, I do not have a problem with access to all files or to any specific files.<br />
<br />
The answer from Umesh looks like the start (not the end) of the solution. Here are answers to the questions he posed, for my case:<br />
<br />
a. I'm hoping for access to all the files that were backed up from my old computer&nbsp;account using Easy Transfer.<br />
b. The "Protected Content Migration" prompt has appeared spontaneously at the end of the Easy Transfer reload operation. It does not name any particular files for which access needs authentication. It simply asks for the "password for your user account on the
 old computer listed below to update the content protection on your new account." That password is well known to me, but does not satisfy the request. [I've tried re-entering, checking caps-lock, etc.]<br />
c. I performed a custom install of Windows 7, as I upgraded from my old 60Gbyte drive to a brand new 160Gbyte drive as part of the migration.<br />
d. A great many folders and files are on my new hard drive, apparently successfully reloaded by Easy Transfer. None of the folders on my new hard drive is named windows.old.<br />
e. I don't recall either&nbsp;setting a password for the backup file when it was created or entering&nbsp;a password&nbsp;when I started the Easy Transfer reload from the external hard disk, but I understand this is required in any case - and I have (as noted) succeeded in
 recalling a great deal (all?) of the material to my new internal hard disk. By default, I would have used the password for my old computer account login (the same password I've tried to use for the "Protected Content Migration" password request).<br />
<br />
I do&nbsp;not have any special security software installed, beyond whatever came with Win7 and with Norton Internet Security 2010 (which I installed first thing after loading Win7 and its updates).<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what/how&nbsp;a Safe mode boot-up will help. Is the intent to re-run an Easy Transfer recovery while booted in Safe mode? I'm glad to try it, but want to make sure that this is the intended step before I dismiss the "Protected Content Migration" dialog
 and reboot. I have the same question that Floyd posed originally: "...what will be missing if I just cancel out of this box?"<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.<br />
<br />

            Interesting, I am seeing the same issue on a system for multiple users.<br />
<br />
The system is shared, and both users get the prompt and "password is incorrect", yet it seems each can access their documents, pictures, and music.<br />

<p>I also experience the same issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The series of questions as a response from the Microsoft Support is COMPLETELY pointless.</p>
<p>We do not know what types of files that the Easy Transfer is trying to grab.</p>
<p>It is obviously not happening with all the files, only the account protected ones.</p>
<p>We are targeting to access the protect files in the OLD computer. &nbsp;Who cares if the Win 7 is a custom install or upgrade!</p>
<p>And as for SAFE MODE. &nbsp;By the time I get to the safe mode, I would have already dismissed the message and rebooted the computer.</p>

<p>I just finished using Easy Transfer across a home network, from my old Vista PC to my new Windows 7 PC.&nbsp; At the end of it I had the same issue where I was being asked for the password on my old computer, but when I typed it in I was told the password was
 incorrect. Out of frustration&nbsp;I tried typing in every old password I could think of, and finally typed in the current password on my old computer, followed by a '1' - and it worked!!</p>
<p>I don't know if it was a fluke, or an older version of the password, or what. But it might be worth trying if you are having this problem. I'd be interested to know if it works for anyone else as well.</p>
<p>To be clear, if the password on your old computer is "password", try typing in "password1". It worked for me...</p>

            <p>I found out that there is no resolution for this issue but, I found 2 ways of recovering your files:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. You can slave the drive and use a third-party data recovery software or</p>
<p>2. You can 'unhide' the 'Protected Content Migration' files in Windows Explorer. I found out that the 'password' 'unhides' those files for you and restore all your settings automatically, if you can figure out the password that it is asking you to provide.
 You can painstakingly do this yourself, manually and remove the 'Hidden' file\folder attribute and the 'Read-only' attribute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I'm seeing the same problem with Windows Easy Transfer from Windows 7 to Windows 7. Protected Content Migration window comes up and won't accept my password. I'm assuming it requires the original password for the account, but I have no idea what that was

            I'm having the same problem. I click on the icon in the taskbar, Edge starts to open, and then abruptly closes. This occurring after the Start menu and Cortana disappered. Was able to recover them by going back to a restore point. The Start Menu is fully
 operational, however, Cortana just Listens without responding and Edge just opens and closes (I suspect Cortana, even though using Google for my searches, needs Edge to be working).

<p>I had the same problem and tried all the suggested options, but none of them worked.&nbsp; Someone posted they had found a problem with the Trusteer Endpoint security software written by IBM and supplied by various banks.</p>
<p>I uninstalled Trusteer Endpoint and Edge now works, but when I tried to reinstall Trusteer Endpoint, it wouldn't install using Edge as it said I wasn't using a supported browser.&nbsp; Looking at the list of supported browsers, Edge isn't on it, but IE, Chrome
 and Firefox are.</p>

<p>Are you booting from the XP disk? If not restart the computer and boot from the XP install disk.</p>

<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How To Revert Back To XP/Vista<br />
<br />
If you have a restore partition (check your manual) you can use that, or if XP/Vista disks were included with your computer you can use those. If you don't have either contact the OEM computer manufacturer and ask them to send you an install disk for your computer
 - they may or may not do it. If they agree to send you one they may charge a small fee.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have the Windows.old folder - Reverting Windows 7 back to a previous Windows system:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/971760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/971760</a>
<br />
<br />
Windows.old on your C: drive - Usually, but not always, after installing Windows 7 you will have a Windows.old folder on your C: drive that contains data from the previous Windows installation. Open Windows Explorer and under "Computer" click on the C: drive
 - if the Windows.old folder is there you should be able to revert back to XP/Vista.<br />
<br />
If it's not there, make sure you can see the Windows.old folder:<br />
&nbsp; 1. Click Start, type:&nbsp; hidden<br />
&nbsp; 2. Click "Show hidden files and folders"<br />
&nbsp; 3. Click to select "Show hidden files and folders"<br />
&nbsp; 4. Uncheck the next three items:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hide empty drives<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hide extensions from known file types<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hide protected operating system files<br />
&nbsp; 5. Click OK and look for the folder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Note: after you are done go back and recheck "Hide protected operating system files." If you want to change the other settings back do so.)<br />

    <title>Problem adding an existing XBOX Live account to a Family Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kellydarker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem adding an existing XBOX Live account to a Family Account</h2>
                    
<p>My sons existing Xbox Live Gold account has lapsed. I have recently purchased the Gold family pack&nbsp;with the thought in mind to add my son to this when his subscription ended.</p>
<p>Now it has lapsed, I recovered his gamertag onto my xbox containing the primary family licence.</p>
<p>I went to add member to gold family pack and selected his profile.</p>
<p>I input his email and password correctly which took me to a screen explaing that I would be in control of his account etc.</p>
<p>I selected accept and I got an error message stating 'can't sign in using your Microsoft account. Please try again.&nbsp; If the problem continues,go to
https://account.live.com'</p>
<p>I promptly did this and can sign into his Microsoft account through my laptop.&nbsp; So I am confused as to why I am getting this message through the xbox.</p>
<p>All connections have been checked so i know it is getting a signal from the router as I can go online.</p>
<p>Is there something I am doing wrong, could it be a setting issue etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please can somebody offer some advice and help.</p>
<p>Many Thanks</p>

<p>If his account lapsed, it might be Suspended for a Balance Past Due. To verify if that is the case, suggest you contact a Billing Agent. You can choose Option
<b>1</b> after finding your country's support line: See <a href="http://tinyurl.com/XBLnumbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://tinyurl.com/XBLnumbers</a> ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but a faster way to speak to a Billing Agent is to go to <a href="http://xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://xbox.com</a> - sign in there if you can - then go to <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us?xr=footnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?xr=footnav#0:2:5</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on <b><i>Request A Call</i></b> and type in a few lines explaining your issue and you will get called back quicker than if you waited in queue on hold.</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestions.</p>
<p>After thinking about it I remembered that when I set up my sons Live account &nbsp;I had to set up a parent account as he is under 18. &nbsp;Because I was not using Live myself I set up a non descript account which I never used.</p>
<p>When I set up the family account I used &nbsp;a different profile. &nbsp;This meant that when I tried to add him to my family account it could not be done as he was already registered as afamily member to my other account. &nbsp;Obviously you are not allowed to be a member
 of 2 families.</p>
<p>To rectify it I disassociated him from the original account and add him as a family member of the Familyaccount. &nbsp;This allowed me to add him onto the new live account :-)</p>
<p>Its a shame that Microsoft do not have better alert messages to advise people why he could not be added. &nbsp;If a message told me tis then I would have been able to sort the problem out in 5 minutes rather than 5 hours........</p>
<p>I hope anyone having a similr issue find this info helpfull.</p>

<h2>            CHKDSK appears to be frozen</h2>
                    <p>I was receiving errors on my external hard drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, I am attempting to run CHKDSK.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a 2 TB external formatted for EXFAT so that I can use it both here and on my apple computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started CHKDSK around 1:30 AM and it is now 7:30 and
 it is still running. &nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot tell if it is stuck or still running. &nbsp;&nbsp; When I did a check on my C drive, it did take a similar amount of time. &nbsp; The disk in question is blinking.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The messages so far are:</p>
<p>A Media error has been detected.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bad sectors may be present on the volume.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The volume will be checked for bad sectors.</p>

            <p>Hi Sharon,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for not replying to your query in a timely manner.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you still need assistance then refer to the below instructions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What is the make and model of the external hard-drive?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the utility they provided to check the hard drive health. Also, this is to inform you that while we run check disk it might take time depending on the size of the files the hard drive contains. It will take less time for small
 size and vice versa. Since it also found bad sectors it will attempt to rectify the errors. The amount of bad sector it found plays a role in taking time to complete the action. Hopefully, you have backed up your files and you have a known good backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to get in touch with the hard drive manufacturer as you might need to replace the hard drive.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hi, Xerox has not released a WIn10 (or even Win 8) driver for the Phaser 6200. I tried to install their Win7 driver, but it went into an infinite loop of requesting that the driver be loaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an older PC that I upgraded from Win7 to Win10. The old Win7 driver still works. So I figure that there must be a way to install the Win7 printer driver on my new Win10 system -- any ideas? I didn't see a compatibility mode selection when I followed
 your procedure above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Larry</p>

            I asked Xerox if they were going to write a Win10 driver &amp; they said nope, too old. So I told them my next printer would NOT be from Xerox. I found a pretty cheap HP color auto-duplex printer, which I could even get with both a copier and a scanner.<br />

<p><span>Hi Valerie,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One of the methods given below should help in getting iTunes to install on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>See if running the setup file of iTunes in Administrator mode helps in completing the installation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s how:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-Click
 on the setup file of iTunes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 “Run as administrator” from the option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Install from Built-In administrator account.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn’t work, enable the built in administrator account and</span><span>try
 installing the program from that account. The built-in Administrator account is an account that has full access and permission on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By default, the built-in administrator account is named Administrator, and is disabled.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong> If you enable the built-in Administrator account, it is recommended to create a password for it to help keep
 it secured.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to enable it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go
 to start and type “cmd” without the quotes in the search field.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-Click
 on cmd and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the elevated command prompt, type “net user administrator /active:yes” without the quotes<span>&nbsp;</span>and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Close
 the elevated command prompt.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Log
 off, and you will now see the built-in Administrator account log on icon added in the log on screen.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>Click on the Administrator icon to log on to the built-in Administrator account</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To disable the account, type “net user administrator /active:no” without the quotes and press Enter in the step c above.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Netflix Color Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr. boyd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Netflix Color Issue</h2>
                    When watching netflix on 8.1, there appears to be a color issue where deep blacks have a red hue. The overall images appear to have strange (off) coloring as well. If the video is allowed to time out, the text displayed has a redish/pinkish hue rather
 than being normal white. The track bar appears almost maroon in color rather than the normal red. It's the exact issue on this locked thread: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1_pr-pictures/netflix-color-skewed-silverlight-issue/f843cb21-9890-490b-9114-6905e6a06ac2?msgId=87a6a40a-e6b0-41c0-855d-a3532800a58e
 though I tried the suggestion of disabling stereoscopic 3d, there was no change at all. Everything else displays properly, the white on this page, other reds, other blacks are black, etc. This is a brand new computer, running fresh install of windows 8.1,
 watching netflix on the firefox browser, all drivers updated.&nbsp;
                </div>

            Okay I've solved the issue, which is in fact related to Stereoscopic 3D an the Nvidia card.<br />
<br />
I'll give a brief step by step of what I did in case anybody else runs into the same problem. Please note that turning off Stereoscopic 3D in the Nvidia control panel, refreshing the page and even restarting firefox did nothing to remedy the issue.
<br />
<br />
Step 1: Verify you have an Nvida card with the latest drivers which supports Stereoscopic 3D (if not this process will not help you).<br />
<br />
Step 2: Go to netflix and start watching any video you noticed was effected, let the video play in full screen.<br />
<br />
Step 3: Press Ctrl + T (the keyboard shortcut for activating Stereoscopic 3D for the active application).<br />
<br />
This should result in turning off Stereoscopic 3D for the currently running active application (Silverlight for Netflix) giving accurate color and image display. I hope this helps someone.<br />

                    <p>Occasionally I need to Fax documents to people who refuse to accept any other form of electronic communication (e.g. US Banks).&nbsp; I therefore tried to install my old MT5634ZBA-USB Fax MODEM onto my Windows 10 (1803 17134.523) laptop.</p>

</p><p>So what is going on here and why won't the core Windows 10 INF files and drivers install properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also reached out to Multitech, but since all the components in use here are core Windows 10 and Multitech only needed to supply a specific INF file for Windows 7 I'm not hopeful they will help.</p>

<p>There is no "setup" since this is a USB MODEM it is auto-detected in Device Manager using PnP and the INF file selection from the identified Device ID then attempts to install the Microsoft components it identifies, but this is failing.&nbsp; The only other option
 that I have also tried was to use:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Action -&gt; Add legacy hardware</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I select "<strong>Search for and install the hardware automatically (Recommended)</strong>" the driver it chooses is the same components as the PnP, and if I try "<strong>Install the hardware that I manually select from a list (Advanced)</strong>" using
 "<strong>Don't detect my modem; I will select it from a list</strong>" I can select the Manufacturer as "<strong>MultiTech Systems</strong>", but my modem is not listed I only see:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The MultiTech MODEMs only ever used the Windows Drivers no matter which version of the operating system they ran on.&nbsp; The difference was that in Windows 7 Mutitech provided a specific setup information (.INF) and a security catalogue (.CAT) file that could
 be used to provide the specific detail.&nbsp; Very old MODEMs were connected through a serial port and therefore it was only the registry specifics of the MODEM personality and capability that needed to be provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 Microsoft provide "mdmcpq.inf" which explicitly matched the Device ID of the MODEM as can be seen from the snippet relating to this device:</p>

<p>All the base links to the associated drivers to provide the USB to serial interface to the driver are defined in "usbser.inf".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst there are plenty of extremely dubious sites out on the Internet offering to provide device drivers many require installing some potentially dangerous executable to download software.&nbsp; As many of these sites just spread virus software I stay well clear
 and only take information from either the manufacturer or Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned earlier the only available ".INF" and ".CAT" files available from Multitech were for Windows 7 and cannot be used on Windows 10.&nbsp; I am starting to suspect that there is a bug in one or more of the Microsoft ".INF" files in this installation
 tree that is causing the error, but the error message is not documented on any Microsoft site I've searched to explain exactly what has failed that causes the error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Device USB\VID_06E0&amp;PID_F104\5&amp;711e76&amp;0&amp;5 was not migrated due to partial or ambiguous match</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spent quite some time looking at:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/</a></p>

            Unfortunately I do not have such modem and cannot examine the problem itself.
<br />And please note the links to Answers go to old discussions with old versions of Windows 10. Windows is changing year on year an may be modem is not compatible with latest version.

<p>Well I finally know which part of the driver stack is no longer functional.&nbsp; After spending hours&nbsp;reading through the "Hardware Dev Center" details I determined that a log of the device install procedure exists in c:\windows\inf\setupapi.dev.log.&nbsp; In my
 case this clearly shows that the problem lies with "usbser.sys":</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the whole installation process succeeds but the driver fails to start the device.&nbsp; I then found:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://pete.akeo.ie/2011/03/troubleshooting-usb-device-development.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pete.akeo.ie/2011/03/troubleshooting-usb-device-development.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Which details what the driver is trying to do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<strong>CM_PROB_FAILED_START means that your driver loaded, passed through DriverEntry, passed through AddDevice, and then failed during IRP_MN_START_DEVICE.</strong></p>
<p><br />
In layman's terms, this means that the issue occurs during the USB transfers that Windows issues with the device, after the driver has been setup and the device instance has been (re)created."<br />
</p>
<div>
<p>So it would appear that Windows 10 did a total re-write on "usbser.sys":</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/dn707976(v=vs.90)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/dn707976(v=vs.90)</a></li><li><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/usbcoreblog/2015/07/29/what-is-new-with-serial-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/usbcoreblog/2015/07/29/what-is-new-with-serial-in-windows-10/</a></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>and in the process managed to change the way the device initialisation worked thus breaking loads of USB Communication Device Class (CDC) components.&nbsp; Clearly whatever the driver is doing now it is not operating in a backward compatible manner and clearly
 Microsoft have not tested their own "in-box" supplied "INF" files on the devices that are clearly identified by the "Device-IDs" that identify the component.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to find a not very satisfactory workaround for my laptop using a USB to Serial Cable and a really old Multitech&nbsp;MT5600ZDX serial modem, which worked perfectly;&nbsp; this did at least allow me to get the "Windows Fax and Scan" working.&nbsp; It would clearly
 be advantageous if Microsoft drivers actually produced a human readable description of the Hex error codes emitted by the drivers and wrote them to either the "Event Log" or "setupapi.dev.log".&nbsp; It is anyone's guess what "<strong>problem status: 0xc000000e</strong>"
 actually means and why the new driver felt it needed to fail the device when Windows 7 allows the device to start; IMHO this type of behaviour is not progress it is just lack of testing in Windows 10 to ensure that code re-writes don't break things and some
 form of regression testing is carried out.</p>

<br />
Thank you for your reply. <br />

1. I was downloading games and meanwhile shifting some personal&nbsp;files from C drive to D drive.<br />
2. It happens when I'm trying to cut and paste file onto Desktop, using a mouse control. If I do cut and paste with keyboard command, it works fine.

<h2>            Xbox One Screenshots &#47; Screen Recordings Missing&#63;</h2>
                    This is the 2nd time this has happened to me, but all my screenshots and screen recordings on my local drive on my Xbox One were deleted. &nbsp;All the data I have on Xbox Live is still there, but none of my local content. &nbsp;Has this happened to anyone else
 here? &nbsp;And if so, found a way to retrieve that data? &nbsp;Does the Xbox delete content over time a certain period of time? &nbsp;Though that would be weird that my local content would expire but not on Xbox Live. &nbsp;I also store my captured content on an external hard
 drive, not sure if that matters. &nbsp;This is very irritating, I wish Xbox Live would give us more space to store these things.

<p>I have tried the following:</p>

<p>Windows 8 reset</p>
<p>sfc /scannow</p>
<p>dism /online /cleanup-image /checkhealth</p>
<p>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</p>
<p>installing it in clean boot, both via windows update and from download center.</p>

            Follow below methods<br />
<br />
<p><span>Method 1-</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1-</span></p>
<p><span>You need to identify the KB article numbers of the updates with the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the steps-</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on the “Windows key+X” on the keyboard and select “Control Panel”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Now, select “Windows Update” and click on “View update history”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Make a note of the KB article number of the updates and let us know by your next post.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>You can also try to install them manually.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2-</span></p>
<p><span>I would have you check if you have a stable internet connection. Sometimes the updates might fail to download and install due to an unstable internet connection.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2-</span></p>
<p><span>I would have you run an online virus scan (full) since some errors with Windows Update can occur due to virus as well.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link-</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></span></p>
<p>Note: The antivirus will try to Repair Bad Sectors on the hard drive damaged by viruses. Data present on these sectors might be lost in the process. Proceed at your own risk.</p>

            <p>Thanks Mithilesh for your reply!</p>
<p>Some&nbsp;clarifications:</p>
<p>- The update I fail to install is KB2871690 as stated in my previous post.</p>
<p>- I have tried to install it manually several times. Since I received the message "failure configuring windows updates reverting changes" for the automatic update. I have manually installed all updates, except for KB2871690, which fails in the&nbsp;installation
 step every time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The internet connection is wired and very stable.</p>
<p>I also ran the Microsoft Safety Scanner, provided in your link. Result: no detected viruses at all.</p>
<p>I have also tried all troubleshooting tips in the link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still no luck with KB2871690, any more suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for the link! I red it through and the only thing I hadn´t tried yet&nbsp;was renaming the Software Distribution folder. So I did, but after reboot, I still have the same issue.</p>
<p>After I have browsed every forum I can think of and tried all suggestions, I personally think that I have three remaining options here:</p>
<p>1. I hide this particular update (KB2871690). Try to forget all about it and hope for the best.</p>
<p>2. Contact the store from which I bought this computer less than half a year ago and ask them to help me. They actually state on the receipt that they have one year free support for pre-installed software.</p>
<p>3. Buy myself a Mac.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other hints?</p>

<p>I have managed to&nbsp;install over 50 updates manually. The KB2871690 is the only one that fails every single time.</p>
<p>Regarding this new link, the first thing they mention is how to install and use Windows update, but it´s already installed in Win 8 and is&nbsp;exactly what I´m using to try to install KB2871690.</p>
<p>The rest in this link seems to be applicable for earlier Windows versions than Win 8.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
To turn on Automatic Updates yourself, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Open Windows Update by swiping in from the right edge of the screen (or, if you're using a mouse, by pointing to the lower-right corner of the screen and moving the mouse pointer up), then tapping or clicking
<strong>Settings</strong>, tapping or clicking <strong>
Change PC settings</strong>, and then tapping or clicking <strong>
Update and recovery</strong>. </li><li>Tap or click <strong>Choose how updates get installed</strong>.
</li><li>Under <strong>Important updates</strong><b>, </b>select the option that you want.
</li><li>Under <strong>Recommended updates</strong>, select the <strong>
Give me recommended updates the same way I receive important updates </strong>check box, and then click
<strong>Apply</strong>. </li></ol>

<h3> illuzioner  say:</h3>
<h2>            disable blinking cursor in windows 8</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
How do I disable the Blinking Cursor in Windows 8? &nbsp;<br />
<br />
In previous versions of Windows I could just change cursorBlinkRate to -1 in &nbsp;regedit, but that doesn't work in Win 8. &nbsp;It still blinks in Notepad, Word, etc. (yes, I rebooted :)<br />
<br />
How do I disable this thing?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
p.s.<br />
<br />
Someone had previously suggested the following, which was not even possible as the option does not appear:<br />
<br />
"1. Point to the top-right/bottom corner of the screen and click Settings from the panel that appears.<br />
2. Click Change PC settings from the next panel, go to Ease of Access and turn off Tab through webpages and apps using caret browsing.<br />
3. Go to Start menu, open any app and verify. "<br />

Microsoft you did a pretty good job ballancing out Xbox 360 Exclusives, but when you came out with the Xbox One you made 2 Critical Error's that now cause me to leave the Xbox&nbsp;One. First, you did well to listen to your consumers (Because what is a business without their customer's?) by allowing Backwards Compatibility (Which is why I&nbsp;chose Xbox One to begin with, I&nbsp;was much against Sony as a Company for this disrespect towards their previous, loyal Customers (and Consumer's)&nbsp;of the PS3. If you spent 1,000 dollars on a PS3 System via online gaming, add-on's and more, if you got a PS4 you could do nothing about carrying over ANYTHING YOU LEGALLY BOUGHT! It was a shame, but I&nbsp;had a strong ill regard for Sony after this. I switched from Xbox 360 to PS3 when I&nbsp;found it more affordable to not have to pay for Xbox Live, but when I&nbsp;got the Xbox One I&nbsp;expected more suppo

buttery customer. I appreciated the creamy texture, while savouring
the realistic flavour. Then my cousin told me that margarine was only
1 molecule away from plastic and some emulsion paints. That it was
only manufactured to fatten chickens and not really fit for human
consumption. Needless to say, I returned to real butter pretty
quickly. My life is now complete. I have complained to the relevant
dairy and distributors, yet typically they have just ignored me.</p>
<p>I just get the feeling I am
just another statistic on an annual spreadsheet.</p>

<p>I've been playing the demo for the last few days, and it made me buy my own copy.&nbsp; I can't wait till it arrives in the mail.&nbsp; Before I played the demo, I thought about Reach as "ho hum, just another Halo game, this franchise is getting old."&nbsp; If I had the
 chance to play the demo before it was released, I would have purchased the game on day one at $60 instead of $40 today, which makes me wonder why they didn't release the demo until now.</p>

<p>Economics, probably. Reach had the Beta for it that came with ODST, plus Bungie and Microsoft knew they'd sell tons just off of the built-in fanbase alone. Now that they're porting Reach to be downloadable, producing a free demo to potential buyers combined
 with a price reduction to buy it online is a way to sell the game to another audience who might have balked at the price or "style" of the game the first time around.</p>
