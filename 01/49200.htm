    <title>Windows update and killing the network adapter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidk03  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows update and killing the network adapter</h2>
                    <p>My update list shows KB4338818 waiting, and the more info lists this update as having an issue which kills the network adapter.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, why would anyone elect to install this KB knowing it will kill the internet?&nbsp; Right now, for that issue alone, this KB item is not installed on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are (manual) workarounds listed, and therefore why hasn't MS embodied them in the KB so this issue just "isn't there"?</p>

<p>Sometimes Microsoft gives you Updates for 3rd Party Hardware: Graphics, <strong>
Network Adaptors,</strong> etc.</p>
<p>You should only obtain the latest Drivers for them from the actual Hardware Manufacturer's website, as Microsoft normally does nor have those latest Drivers available as Microsoft relies of the 3rd Party Hardware Manufacturer to supply them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can do a System Restore to go back to before it was installed (which is NOT the best way to remove an Update) or follow this method:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"Remove an Update&nbsp;- Windows 7"</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/remove-update#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/remove-update#1TC=windows-7</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So that this does not happen again:</p>
<p>When you&nbsp;have found the problem Update from the list of updates that is presented&nbsp;&gt; you then right click on the problem update &gt;&nbsp;select the Hide&nbsp;Update Option &gt; and it will not be offered to you again</p>

<p>Here is how to chanage update settings, if you find it necessary to:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Either of these two update Settings will give you the chance to see what you want to install through Windows Updates;</p>
<p><strong>Download updates but let me choose whether to install them</strong> - If you select this option, Windows will download updates to your computer, but not install them automatically. If you want to install the updates then you must install them manually.
 You should only select this option if you have a reason for not installing updates automatically. Only advanced users should use this option.</p>
<p><strong>Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them</strong> - If you select this option, you will be alerted when there are new updates available to download and install. You can then choose to download and install the updates
 that you wish. This option should really only be used by people who know exactly what updates they need or those who have limited access to the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But remember you normally only have problems with 3rd Party Hardware Drivers. The other Updates are&nbsp;to enhance&nbsp;your System's Performance and Security</p>

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>Thanks for your effort and the reply.&nbsp; But I already follow those suggestions - it was in the process of checking more info from a "let me choose to install" option that led me to the known issue with the KB I listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your response suggests that you may not have read the KB listed.&nbsp; Could I recommend that, because this question turns on what MS says in that document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This KB is apparently applicable to all versions of windows - no exceptions or variations were listed.&nbsp; And this KB also apparently caused a number of other issues, which have since been remedied - as listed in the updated KB.&nbsp; The network adapter issue
 is only listed with possible manual workarounds.&nbsp; So if it happens, you are dead.&nbsp; The only option is to uninstall the KB,&nbsp; processes you listed.&nbsp; Revert to the restore point created during update, which I have done in the past - usually in safe mode, is probably
 less complex and quicker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my comment stands - why would I install this update if MS knows it's going to kill the network adapter (what the KB says under known issues with this update) - the very thing which enables the internet.&nbsp; Until I get a reasonable answer to that, this
 is one KB I won't install, even tho MS may think it fixes other issues - a certain fail against a possible future problem just doesn't rate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I was after - hopefully - was more information on, or a link to, a method of identifying just which network adapter would stop working (I may not have it in my platform, but I am not going to find out experimentally), or (desirably) an automated fix
 rather than the ponderous methods the KB lists.&nbsp; Do you or MS Answers have that sort of info?&nbsp; Or is the current status quo the best that's available right now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>I follow the same process - wait about 3-4 days after patch tuesday, then check for updates, and review the 'more info' published for each one, which is basically a link to the KB article about it, before installing or sometimes refusing to install.&nbsp; Often
 that info is so bland as to be uninformative.&nbsp; But for KB4338818, it had this to say (a section from a screenshot)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e43ee2a2-c16f-439f-9dc2-9e78f8e4b622?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e43ee2a2-c16f-439f-9dc2-9e78f8e4b622?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>and that symptom statement is why I've raised this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I guess you have no definitive answers either.</p>

    <title>Skype Issue w&#47; Bluetooth devices on Samsung Galaxy S8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harishkumar01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Issue w&#47; Bluetooth devices on Samsung Galaxy S8</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having issues with getting Skype to work with my Bluetooth devices ever since I got my Samsung Galaxy S8 (SM-G950U).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a JBL Go Bluetooth Speaker and&nbsp; Bose QuietComfort QC35 Headphones that I use with my phone daily. When I connect my phone to either of these devices, the audio output from all the apps EXCEPT Skype, go to the speaker/headphones. When I make calls
 on Skype(with my QC35 connected to the phone, for example), the sound gets routed from the phone speaker. The only option I have, to change the audio output, is to the phone's earpiece.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used my headphones with my old phones(iPhone 6, Samsung S6&amp;S7) and never had issues with using Skype over bluetooth on them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate any help I can get.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>It appears the issue is with the device you are using, like you said it worked well on your old devices. As a workaround, you may try uninstalling and reinstalling Skype. Make sure to clear the data and restart you device before reinstalling.</p>

<p>Hi @Julie_S1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell, it is not a device issue because the bluetooth devices work perfectly fine with all of the other apps used for communication(Phone, IMO, Google Duo, WhatsApp etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initially thought that the problem was with the device too. However, the folks at both Samsung and BestBuy(where I got my phone) tried troubleshooting and concluded that the problem was with the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also uninstalled/re-installed it multiple times and in the end it still didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Harish</p>

    <title>How do I unlink the Windows Media Player Library and the Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ardath rekha  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I unlink the Windows Media Player Library and the Windows Explorer Library&#63;</h2>
                    I've discovered that any time I tell Window Media Player not to access a directory, Windows Explorer stops letting me see it when I look under the relevant media.&nbsp; Why is this happening?&nbsp; I don't want WMP nosing around my files but I still want to be able
 to <strong>get</strong> to them!&nbsp; And any time I try to reset Windows Explorer so that
<strong>it</strong> will look at those folders, Windows Medial Player immediately re-catalogues them.&nbsp;
<strong>I do not want that happening</strong> .&nbsp; I need to either get them to behave like separate applications, or I'm deleting WMP and replacing it with
<strong>anything else</strong> .&nbsp; How do I stop this?<br />
<br />
Seriously, practically everything else about Windows 7 is awesome, but the Media Player is a bundle of fail that keeps acting like a spyware program.

<p>Hey Ardath Rekha,<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Here's a little insight on how the two libraries work together.<br />
<br />
Windows 7 makes use of Libraries to give a consolidated view of related files in one place. Windows Media Player (WMP) 12 integrates nicely with the new Libraries in Windows 7, so all of the music contents you see in Windows Media Player i.e your "music library"
 will literally come from your Music library in Windows explorer. And so is the case for Videos and Pictures. When we add any location to Music, Videos, or Pictures library in Windows Explorer, those locations get added to the WMP Library since Windows Media
 Player 12 shares the same configuration of library location as that of Windows 7 Libraries.<br />
<br />
You may however change the way WMP library gathers its contents from the computer.<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp;Go to Organize &gt; Manage Libraries.<br />
2.&nbsp;Select any one of the library which you don’t want Windows Media Player 12 (WMP 12) to monitor.<br />
3.&nbsp;Right-Click on the library location and select Remove.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Do this for other libraries.<br />
4.&nbsp;Next, click Organize again and click 'Apply media information changes'.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Additionally, configure the following settings.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Click the Start button, click All Programs, and then click Windows Media Player.<br />
2.&nbsp;If the Player is currently open and you’re in Now Playing mode, click the Switch to Library button in the upper-right corner of the Player.<br />
3.&nbsp;Go to Organize -&gt; Options -&gt; Library.<br />
4.&nbsp;Uncheck everything except for "Maintain my star ratings as global ratings in files".<br />
<br />
Once this configuration is done, see if you notice any change in the way WMP behaves.<br />
<br />

<p>There are several reasons why you might be seeing this error. To nail it down, we need to know some details:</p>

<p>Santosh, there is no connection between mail accounts and the Windows Live calendar service. Removing a mail account will achieve nothing other than permanently deleting the account folders and all the messages in them. In the best case, they will be downloaded
 again from the server - a potentially costly exercise - and in the worst case it will lead to an irrevocable loss of data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have multiple mail accounts; here are the first dozen:&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Which one would you suggest I remove? </p>
<p>
</p><p>The calendar service is accessed by the Microsoft Account the user signs in with. This doesn't have to be one of the mail accounts that may be set up in the program.</p>

            <p>I was on the phone for over 2 hours or more with tech from Microsoft in the Philippines and</p>
<p>he took remote control and could not fix this same problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; He gave me a reference number</p>
<p>and said a level 2 tech would call me today.&nbsp; I just hung up a few minutes ago with level 2 tech and he</p>
<p>did not even try and told me to wait a few weeks and see if the next update will solve the problem??</p>
<p>I am disabled and this has me worn out. Why does this company not take more effort on fixing this.</p>
<p>I don't want to change email but I might just go to Gmail.&nbsp; I am so tired right now as I take medicine for pain</p>
<p>for years now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Blessings, Tim </p>

            I just "signed out" of WLM on the home tab of WLM, sign-in icon at the top far right. Now I don't get the error message. I do not use the calendar anyway but use Google's calendar which sends reminders to my email. I guess I will have to update my contacts
 in WLM manually since all my other contact lists sync with each other. Apple products all sync together and Outlook.com will sync to my laptop running Windows 10 as long as I use Windows Mail. &nbsp;I prefer the look and format of WLM, however. Apple devices don't
 have so many complications and bugs.

            If I sign out I lose all my contacts/addresses and this is not a fix. &nbsp;Microsoft changed something. &nbsp;I fired up my old computer that sat idle for a month. &nbsp;When I checked by Windows Live Mail (same build) I suddenly now &nbsp;get the same error on the unused
 computer. &nbsp;Apparently the problem is on the Microsoft side. &nbsp;It looks like the program tries to go out and connect to something, then times out to the error message. &nbsp;But, what do I know, I'm just and end user.

            I do not lose my contacts nor any of my email messages when I sign out, but if I add a new contact or change info on a current one within WLM, it will no longer sync with my outlook.com account on the web. Or if I enter new contact info in my contacts
 on Outlook.com, it won't sync with WLM. &nbsp;But at least I no longer get the irritating error message about being unable to connect to the calendar. I use Charter email but still have a Microsoft account; same email as my Charter. &nbsp;This is a Windows7 computer
 but on my Win 10 laptop, the same error just began appearing when I open WLM. It is something Microsoft changed, I agree!

            Same thing here. I have 1 pc (3 users), 1 laptop (2 users). They all have that issue with the calendar. I'm at this point now where I'm taking the WLM off, and just using Google Calendar and syncing it to my android phone. I spent too much time troubleshooting
 with no success. I guess it's heading there eventually. They should just get rid of WLM altogether and make Windows Mail and Windows Calendar work better.

<h2>            How can I be &#34;denied access&#34; to a server when I am being referred there by the &#34;Settings&#34; subroutine&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have some concerns about the files I wish to keep&nbsp;<strong>very </strong>private in my computer. But, the last several times when I go to the "Settings" section and it refers me to the "Get Help" hyperlink -- when I click on it, I get this:</p>
<p>

<p>Reference #18.b6ce33b8.1518188549.a69c1884</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice that they are similar, but not identical -- and I'm referring to the website the link was trying to send me to,&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> the reference number.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is especially troubling is the "on this server" notation. I've checked with my ISP and they can find nothing wrong that would cause this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What worries me is that this account&nbsp;<strong>is an administrator account.</strong> There should not be anything that I'm have to have permission for. So, I've obviously put a block in place that I didn't
 mean to -- although how I could block MYSELF is an interesting question. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I;m running Windows 10 Home, Version 1709. The browser is Chrome, but that should be irrelevant. This happens when&nbsp; click on a link in the "Settings" app, so it's happening from a Microsoft application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any idea what is amiss?</p>
<p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Are you getting this on any other links besides these which are not operative?
<br />
<br />If so:
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running the built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best. 
<br />
<br />Enable the Built-in Hidden Administrator (emergency only) account to sign into to see if it happens there.   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>
<br />
<br />If not, create a new Local Admin Account to sign into to test there as well. <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br /> If no problems then move into that account and when ready delete the old account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Windows 7 update causing issues with hardware - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> riverrunner 48  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 update causing issues with hardware</h2>
                    
<p>I have a brand new build with Asus P8P67 Deluxe motherboard and Sandybridge I7 2600K Cpu with Coolermaster Half x Case, and Windows 7 Ultimate operating system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I do Windows 7 update there is an update that screws up the computer (Accusys Inc - Storage - Acs - 6xxxx). The reason for this posting is to inform Microsoft this update is screwing up the computer with this combination of hardware and would helpful
 for others who are trying to resolve this issue to know about it and that Microsoft would stop offering this update for this build.</p>
<p>How I resolved the matter was to restore to another time/date. ...Uninstalling through Device Manafer does not resolve the issue because after you reboot back up the issue is back in the device manager with the Exclamation mark...</p>
<p>When you first build the computer there is no issue iits just from this update. Microsoft you can help thousands of people who are expriencing this problem by stop oveffering this update. Tks. and I hope this was helpful.</p>
<p>*original title - Don't know where to post this to contact Windows 7 Update*</p>

    <title>Windows 10 - Cannot Sign In via Microsoft Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike_twins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Cannot Sign In via Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>I have tried pretty every possible solution I have found on this site and others, to no avail. &nbsp;Anywhere in Windows 10 where it asks me to "Sign in with a Microsoft Account", it does not work. &nbsp;This includes the Microsoft Store, as well as other areas on
 my PC, such as in the "Your Account" area under Settings &gt; Accounts or "Get Insider Builds" in the Windows Update &gt; Advanced area. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any time I click on the "Sign in with a Microsoft Account" link, a popup window appears briefly on the screen before going black and disappearing. &nbsp;I do not ever get the opportunity to enter my Microsoft account information because the pop up window doesn't
 open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm that the "Microsoft Account Sign-In Assistant" service is running (the was a solution proposed elsewhere that seems to have worked for some users. &nbsp;Beyond this, I don't know what else to try that I haven't tried already. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>I tried both suggestions with no success...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: &nbsp;"Create a new user account". &nbsp;I was unable to create a new user account. &nbsp;This may be a further hint as to what the problem is - when I navigate to Family and Other Users &gt; Other Users, and then click on "Add someone else to this PC" I have the
 exact same issue as where I try to "Sign in with a Microsoft Account". &nbsp;When I clicked this button, a popup window appeared very briefly before going black and then disappearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: &nbsp;"Clean Boot". &nbsp;I went through a clean boot and was still unable to "Sign in with a Microsoft Account" in any of the usual locations. &nbsp;I did notice that a couple of the anti-virus services (AVG Technologies free edition) were still running. &nbsp;I
 proceeded to delete all AVG related programs and restart, but once again it did not solve the problem.</p>

            I tried the suggested solution but it did not correct the issue. &nbsp;My issue is not the same as that described in the link. &nbsp;The user in the link could not sign in because it wasn't recognizing his password. &nbsp;My issue is that I never get to a sign-in prompt
 to even attempt to enter the password. &nbsp;The window that would otherwise contain the fields to enter my User ID and Password shows up very briefly, turns black, and then disappears without ever allowing me to attempt to enter my Microsoft account info.

            I ran the troubleshooter at the link provided. &nbsp;The only problem that was detected was "Microsoft account required - switch to Microsoft account", which the troubleshooter listed as "Completed". &nbsp;However, I went to the Store and attempted to download something
 and once again my problem remains. &nbsp;I click on a download, it prompts me to select an account. &nbsp;I click on "Microsoft account". &nbsp;A pop-up appears briefly before going black and disappearing. &nbsp;

<h2>            WIndows 10 &#43; Office 2016 &#43; Multiple monitors &#61; User Interface Nightmare</h2>
                    <p>I recently started at a new job, where I have a HP computer running Windows 10 at 2560x1440. &nbsp;My desktop monitor is a max of 1920x1080.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, Microsoft Office (Powerpoint, excel, outlook, etc) seems to be completely unable to scale its user interface across these two monitors. &nbsp;I have no problem with this with any other program, it's only office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I have my main display set to the laptop, and drag an Office window up to my desktop display, the user interface is absolutely massive. &nbsp;When I set my desktop display to be the main desktop, and drag a window down to the laptop screen, the user interface
 is tiny to the point of being unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've played around with "change the size of text, apps, etc" slider as well as fooling around with resoultions for both screens and literally cannot get this to fix itself. &nbsp;The ONLY fix I've seen, which is not a true fix in my mind, is to go into the manifest
 files for each program and change dpi awareness to "false" from "true" so it looks the same on each monitor, but then the issue I have is that the fonts are blurry and pixelated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any fixes? &nbsp;There are a ton of threads online, but literally no fixes, and it's driving me insane. &nbsp;I've never had this issue with any other windows device I've used with multiple screens, going all the way back to Windows XP</p>

<p><em>"won't run on some systems without a disc inserted"</em><br />
<br />
Only on some systems ? Requiring the disk to be in the drive is <em>not</em> something unusual, assuming you
</p>
<p>are using a disk based version of the game.</p>
<p>Recent disk based games that activate via Steam, etc. often don't need the disk (but there many are exceptions),<br />
but all older games such as Crysis require the disk for the disk check (to verify the copy protection system).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are three patches for the original version of Crysis,<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> but I expect the Maximum Ed. would be pre-patched,</span></p>
<p>as re-releases often are. v1.2.1 isn't really necessary as it only has to do with crashes during on line play, which</p>
<p>is probably not happening any more.</p>

<h2>            Direct3D not available</h2>
                    I bought a brand new laptop with nVidia GTX 860M GPU and any applications that I ran would dispay an error about DirectX. I then ran dxdiag.exe and I saw that Direct3D is not available. I tried re-installing the drivers and it didn't work. How do I enable
 Direct3D?

<h2>            How to re-install the VBscript Host for Vista&#63;</h2>
                    I am running Vista Ultimate. I am trying to download a driver that supports hardware that streams video to my TV. When I try to download the driver, I get an error message saying the following: "VBScript engine is disabled therefore installation can not
 continue". Please enable VBScript engine before installation". I've tried to correct the problem by entering "regsvr32 vbscript.dll" in the Command Prompt, after which it says I've succeded, but I get the same error message when I again try to download the
 driver for my new hardware. The support guys for the product the driver is for, have suggested I re-install the Windows Scripting host from the Microsoft Download center but there is no product I can find there that is called "Windows Scripting Host" or "VBscript
 Host". Does anyone know what the exact name of the thing I should download to re-install the VBscript Host?

            Thanks to everone who replied; the problem ended up being old pieces of McAfee still lurking in my system, though I thought it had been long removed as I now use Norton. Unfortunately, the reason I wanted to download the driver in the first place was to
 use my new Warpia Stream HD hardware which wirelessly streams video and audio to my TV though a USB port on my PC and an HDMI port on my TV. The original problem was that I could not get my PC to recognize my TV as an external monitor, or extend my desktop,
 or mirror my monitor.After finally being able to download the driver (which Warpia support thought would solve my problem), I was disappointed to see that my PC still will not recognize my TV as an external monitor. I know the hardware is good, and I know
 I have connected everything properly because I was able to get the arangement to work by simply subsituting a laptop running XP for my desktop which runs Vista (and is the machine that has not worked in this arangement. I have in the past ho

<h2>            Microsoft Visual C&#43;&#43; 2015 Redistributable problems</h2>
                    <p>I'm running a pre-owned pc that has been recently system restored. Upon trying to play certain games, I get an error message concerning the 'Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried deleting all of the&nbsp;Microsoft Visual C++ programs via Control Panel and re-installing them, both via Windows Updates and directly as downloaded files, (and have restarted between each step every time) but the installation gives me an error and
 does not complete. I've attempted to do the same in Safe Mode but have had no success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            I don't understand what I am supposed to do there since that only tells me that If I need help with audio, video and hardware driver issues while playing a game on Windows 10 that I'm in the right place(Gaming on Windows 10). But this question is already
 in Gaming on Windows 10 section so I'm not sure what you are suggesting me to do.

            If you have opened the console there is nothing that can be done to assist you at this point. Discussion of self repair is not allowed on the forums.

    <title>Xbox one Achievements didn&#39;t unlock and minor bug&#40;&#63;&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox one Achievements didn&#39;t unlock and minor bug&#40;&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>so I may have this in the wrong forum. Not sure, but I'm on a tablet so apologies in advance.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Anyway Im having a couple minor glitches(?) or bugs or something with my Xbox one S.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>1. After/during the free play weekend of Steep, I had a few achievements that didn't unlock. Baby Steps and The memory remains achievements remain locked and as it was a free weekend and I do not own the game, I cannot replay to unlock them. Also I would think the only way to unlock those two would be to delete the save game and restart...&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>2. When I load up my achievements board (the one that ranks your friends by gamer points earned that month) it still says February 2017 with an option to view January but no option for March. It still says 17 days left properly. When I checked my settings, it lists the correct date.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks in advance for any and all help.</p>
