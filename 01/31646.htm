<h2>            Windows 10 1804 - EXE don&#39;t start</h2>
                    <div>
<p>We are developer of a software for the financial market in Germany with several hundred users on windows systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The software has been developed for more than 10 years with Adobe Flash AS2.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To allow access to the Windows file system, we use the SWF-Studio software from www.northcode.com confection to get a full-fledged desktop application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oure software is now no longer running on the newest Windows10 Update.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The compatibility settings do not help.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>With the previous version of Windows 10, there were no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also interesting that the EXE file created only with Adobe Flash CS (without the use of further tools for providing / packaging the software as an EXE file) can run with the latest update.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>So it has to be somehow SWF studio, or?<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The software is still running wonderfully under WinXP, Win7, Win8 and older Win10 versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need our Software-Package for tests, please let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for a quick response.</p>

            Hey Georglsert,
<br />
<br />It's my guess that the foundation of your software, Adobe Flash, may not be supported any longer, since its compatibility is certainly broken in the recent version of Windows 10 1803. I downloaded SWF Studio to make sure, it's happening to me as well when building an executable under a movie.
<br />
<br />I'm afraid if you wish to continue using that software and transition onto better technologies in the meantime, you should move back to 1709.
<br />
<br />Hit Windows key + I, then navigate to Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery (left pane) &gt; Go back to the previous version of Windows 10 (right side from the left pane), click Get started, and follow the prompts. This should work provided you are within 10 days of the update.
<br />
<br />Here's a interesting read if you're up to it: <a href="https://forums.adobe.com/thread/2476487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forums.adobe.com/thread/2476487</a>

<br />Sorry that I can't be of any more help from there.

<p>I am having the same problem.&nbsp; Many customers all over the world. I have tried to find a work-around without success.&nbsp; We sent an email notification to our customers and we have received a number of responses in which customers say that they are not willing
 or able to roll back Windows and our software was not working. One has installed Windows 10 with the 1803 update and there is no roll back available.&nbsp; All these customers are waiting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to find a way to make it work.&nbsp; I have tried creating an SWF-Studio exe Unbundled and without Flash.&nbsp; I was hoping that the problem had something to do with Flash being embedded in SWF Studio.&nbsp; This did not fix anything.&nbsp; It worked prior to the update
 but not after.&nbsp; None of the SWF Build parameters seem to make a difference.&nbsp; I have also tried to have Windows check compatibility or run in Windows 7 compatibility mode but that does not work either or give any information.&nbsp; The only work-around that I can
 see at this point is to create a server, run the swf in the browser and create php files to do what swf-studio did for me (allowing for the storage of data).&nbsp; That is more work than I can do in a day and will no doubt generate new support issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;We are in the process of upgrading everything to HTML5 but we thought we had a little time.&nbsp; Hardly seems fair to support an approach for 20 years then suddenly make it stop working without any warning and without offering any support or information as
 to why this is happening.&nbsp; I had a very unpleasant call with Microsoft where they refused to help.&nbsp; Claimed that they do not support 3rd party software and would not or could not give me any information or help me guess why SWF Studio was being blocked.&nbsp; Wish
 Tim was available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anybody has found a way to make SWF Studio apps work after update 1803 please post.&nbsp; My customers will be very happy to have a solution.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Can you please provide me a workaround details - as the fix is already know&nbsp;? I'm registered user of SWF STUDIO and have written and asked for a help to Northcode support as suggested in link almost a week ago - but unfortunately had no feedback email. In
 the meantime my clients are continuously urgently asking for any fix to software that stopped working after recent win 10 update...</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi, Jaroslaw!</p>
<p>Hope that the new version of Studio. that fixed the problem, will be soon released and that you have a response from Northcode. I only know that Tim iz working on. In the meantime the only solution is to return on previous version of Windows 10 (1709). Formerly
 I did so, but&nbsp;my clients were not all successful.</p>

            Hi Charles,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I understand that you are facing issues regarding&nbsp;Trusted Devices.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Are you using same Microsoft account in all devices?<br />
2. What happens <br />
when you trying to get a Windows 8 Store app?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You should only designate a computer as a trusted PC if you're using a <br />
private computer. Use the below link to Remove and re-add all trusted devices. <br />
This should help you in adding a device as trusted.</div>

</p><p>Well, if it's not too bold of me, since Najashanti hasn't shared info, I'll share mine, since I'm having the same problem, and it's driving me nuts. My system summary and event log:<br />

<br />
https://1drv.ms/f/s!Aomj_fVe-Y4kgijwKm2iE96J2tu-<br />
<br />
<br />
(While we're at it, yes, I have tried many things to try to fix this problem on my own. I've updated my drivers using Device Manager, the Intel Driver Update Utility, and manually. I've downgraded my drivers to the manufacturer-provided ones. I've cleanly re-installed
 Windows three times. I've switched wifi off and on from the BIOS menu. I've tried the Windows networking troubleshooter dozens of times. I've uninstalled several Cumulative Update 1607-related downloads, such as KB3193494 and KB3194798. I've hidden 1607 updates
 using the Wushowhide tool. I've adjusted the wifi adapter power settings. I've uninstalled various programs reported to be causing this problem, such as Intel Smart Connect Technology. Etc.)</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, do you happen to know what WiFi card do you have? There's a chance that you did not installed the correct drivers needed on your computer.<br />
<br />
Download the proper driver from the manufacturer side and install it in compatibility mode. You may also try to contact the manufacturer and see if they could offer any further help.</p>

            <p>Something else I might be able to check is the install file for your adapter.&nbsp; You would need to use the Device Manger to locate the 7260.&nbsp; Then right click and select properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the Details tab and hold the mouse over the Property options.&nbsp; You should be able to scroll to an entry called "inf section".&nbsp; If you can give me the exact reference I will try to compare your install options versus mine.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1, Family Safety website and local accounts</h2>
                    <p>Is there really no way to use the Family Safety website anymore with local accounts in Windows 8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 8, I could tie my kids' Microsoft accounts to their local accounts and the website made it easy to monitor and modify settings for Family Safety. Now, this does not seem to work unless we all log in with Microsoft accounts? Even the kids?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks to me like the only way to manage it now when local accounts is to set it up separately on each individual computer that they will use. This is definitely a step backwards if this is the case.</p>

            <p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You and your children will need to have a Microsoft Account to setup Family Safety on your computer. I would suggest you to refer to the following Microsoft Help article and check if it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/security-privacy-accounts-help#security-privacy-accounts-help=windows-8&amp;v0h=win8tab1&amp;v1h=win8tab4&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/security-privacy-accounts-help#security-privacy-accounts-help=windows-8&amp;v0h=win8tab1&amp;v1h=win8tab4&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In Local Account we will not be able to manage the child accounts. In Microsoft Account we can keep track of each and everything that you have restricted and given access to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further reference, you may refer to the following Microsoft Help article.</p>

            <p>I understand they are needed in 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I don't understand it wasn't required for my children to log into a Microsoft account with Windows 8.0 and we could still manage Family Safety settings through the website, but we cannot now that we're using Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having my 5 and 8 year old children log into Windows with an online Microsoft account is unacceptable to me. I don't like doing it myself and I'm certainly not going to have my kids to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, it worked fine with Windows 8.0. The Family Safety requirements for 8.1 and attempting to force people to use Microsoft accounts to log into Windows has really hurt my opinion of Microsoft.</p>

            <p>Hi Kevin, Windows 8.1 does support Windows Accounts that don't have&nbsp; a Microsoft Accounts tie with them. May I asked what&nbsp;have you try? There are a couple of ways that you can manage a Windows Account that are not ties to a Microsoft account, the only prerequisites
 are: 1)&nbsp;The parent's (you)&nbsp;Windows Admin account&nbsp;as to be tied to a Microsoft account. 2)&nbsp;The Windows Account you want to manage online&nbsp;has to be a "Child" account type. I believe in Windows 8.1, Microsoft introduced an account type called "Child" in addition
 to the&nbsp;Standard and Administrator account types.&nbsp;Below are a couple of ways to manage a Windows Account that does not have Microsoft Account ties with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Existing Windows Account:</p>
<p>- For any existing Windows Account that you want to manage make sure you set them to "Child". To do this, on the PC, search for
<strong>Your account settings </strong>and select it from the results, click on <strong>
Other accounts, </strong>select the account in question and click on Edit, then select Child.</p>
<p>- Now on the PC search for "Family Safety" and select it from the results.</p>
<p>- Click on <strong>Manage settings on the Family Safety website</strong>. When prompt to sign into the Family Safety website, enter your credential and verify the child is added to the family.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/792625ff-1a8b-4040-885d-523d05b1acbc" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Creating a new Child account without adding a Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>- On the PC, search for <strong>Your account settings </strong>and select it from the results.</p>
<p>- Click on <strong>Other accounts</strong>.</p>
<p>- Click on <strong>Add an account</strong>.</p>
<p>- Click on <strong>Add a child's account</strong>.</p>
<p>- Click on <strong>Add a child's account without email</strong>.</p>
<p>- Enter a <strong>User name</strong> and <strong>password </strong>for this child.</p>
<p>- Click <strong>Next</strong>.</p>
<p>- Click <strong>Finish</strong>.</p>
<p>- Click on <strong>Manage Family&nbsp; Safety settings online </strong>and sign in using your Microsoft Account, and verify the new child is added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Concerning the 1st prerequisite, is there a way to tie a Microsoft account to my local Windows Admin account in a manner similar to what Windows 8 allowed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8 allowed a Microsoft account to be associated with a Windows local account and thus, the Family Safety settings seemed to be manageable from the website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 8.1, they only thing I seem to be able to do is convert my local account to a Microsoft account and use that exclusively. I don't care to do this. It just makes me uncomfortable to have my computers administrator accounts be Internet based. Since
 there seems to be no other way to associate my local account anymore with a Microsoft account in Windows 8.1, the family safety website now cannot be used.</p>
<p>
I did see the Child account setting when I created their accounts, so they are set that way and I can manage them locally okay. However, I miss being able to set web filters for both kids at the same time and it's annoying that the settings don't replicate
 to other computers like they used to with Windows 8.
</p><p>
</p><p>The other Windows 8.1 that require or allow a Microsoft account seem to do so on an individual basis, so one possibility would be to have the Family Safety settings allow one to be specified that way as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's no way to do this apart from switching my account to a Microsoft account, then I suppose that's something I'll have to do without. I hope Microsoft will reconsider this in a future version, though. Not everyone is comfortably or willing to use
 a Microsoft account for their everyday account for Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your responses, I appreciate it.</p>

            <p>To avoid family safety my children just log into their windows account and then change their account to local, which means they then have uncontrolled access to the internet etc. Is there any way round this?

<h2>            Xbox Game Share broken</h2>
                    
<p>Everytime i game share with my bud, it kicks me off the license transfer. It always gives the error code: you can only switch up to one console, and up to 3 times a year. Like xbox, fix the issue with it so it doesnt kick people off. They game share because
 they can and yet you always have something broken. If you can fix it, then please do.</p>

<p>If the system indicates that you have changed it 3 times in a year and If you want that counter reset then you will have to contact support directly as they are the only ones that can do it. &nbsp;Keep in mind since there is a 3 change per year limit they are
 not obligated to do it but definitely worth a try. <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            I wrote at least 2 or 3 time a month during the period when the offer was made. I was always told to keep checking my email. It never came. Then after a year I was told the offer had expired. I am only writing now due to health problems that prevented
 me from using the computer, plus I was frustrated and angry for being lied to. I would like you to keep your promise to give me a free upgrade to Windows 10. You probably won't, but I had to write anyway. My next computer will probably be an apple, depending
 on your response. Thank you for the consideration I know you will give this matter.

            Hi Dennis.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I have not heard that the prolonged grace period for activating a Clean Install of Windows 10 with the WIndows 7, 8 or 8.1 Product Key has ended.  
<br />
<br />You can save a System Image backup (so you can easily go back in 20 minutes) 
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>
<br />
<br />Then wipe the drive to do the Clean Install in this link, skipping the Product Key during install:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />After install try inserting the Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 Product Key to see if it still works.  
<br />
<br />If not then you'll need to buy a license or restore the image of the old install you made..  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

            As an older gentleman who is far from computer literate, your response might as well been written in Aramaic. Thank you (?) anyway.&nbsp; I'll be giving this computer to my nephew and he can do as he pleases with it. As for me, my next computer will be an Apple
 because they are much easier to use. Windows 8.1 was a disaster in my opinion. Thank you for your response and attempt to explain whatever the hell you were trying to explain.&nbsp; Peace&nbsp;

            I'm sorry that you didn't even have the interest to ask a single question to try to understand.  As I said I would have done whatever was necessary to help you until you had what you need, just as I have done for tens of thousands of others who want to work with me and prize learning.  
<br />
<br />If your nephew wants to continue here then I will help him, too, if he prizes learning.  Doing the Clean Install in the link is one of the best educations in a PC one can have, because it shows you what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.  I've helped millions do these installs over the past ten years and no one has ever failed.

            You might accidentally ignored or blocked the offer.
<br />
<br />You can still get the upgrade for free, its not blocked if you have an installed and activated Windows 7 or Windows 8 license.
<br />
<br />You can download it on your computer running Windows 8.1 too. But, if you want something simpler, then you could download the Media Creation Tool then just upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Upgrade this PC now if you want to upgrade right away,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you donâ€™t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Anniversary Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />If you want to perform a new install or just keep your files click Change what to keep. Once you have chosen the desired options, click Install to begin.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />Thatâ€™s it, the Windows 10 Creators Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1709 or 1703 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:

<h2>            Freecell has stopped recording wins but not losses </h2>
                    
<p>I have 2 PC's both running Windows 8.1.&nbsp; One PC is working fine in regards to how Freecell works.&nbsp; The other one has a weird problem.&nbsp; It has stopped recording my wins on the Xbox network.&nbsp; When I start up the Solitaire Collection application which includes
 Freecell,&nbsp; it shows me that I successfully logged into the XBOX network and correctly gets my latest stats.&nbsp; I know this because if I win a game on the good PC,&nbsp; that win gets reflected back on my bad PC.&nbsp; However when I win a game on my bad PC,&nbsp; the pop up
 that comes up correctly includes the game I just won.&nbsp; However when I tell it I want to go "home" and then I scroll to the right to see my statistics,&nbsp; the win is not reflected there.&nbsp; If I lose a game,&nbsp; it does get properly reflected in the XBOX stats.&nbsp; This
 just started today.&nbsp; I have not done anything to the PC in regards to installing something.&nbsp; It looks like something got corrupted so I uninstalled the Solitaire Collection, rebooted and re-installed it.&nbsp; Same problem.&nbsp; It did not go away which really surprised
 me.&nbsp; The only thing I have not tried is resetting my stat counters and see if the wins start getting recorded again.&nbsp;&nbsp;I prefer not to do that.&nbsp; Anybody have any other ideas on what I else should try to fix the problem?</p>

            <p>Hello ChosenFuture54,</p>
<p>It does sound like file corruption, so let's try a refreshed install of the game. You can do this by adding one step to how you've done it in the past. After you uninstall the game and restart your computer, press the Windows Key+R and type wsreset.exe in the dialog box that opens and press Enter. This will refresh and reopen the Windows Store app and you can download and install a refreshed version of the game. </p>

<p>Similar Problem on my Windows 8.1 Machine. For a few days Microsoft Solitaire Collection only stops recording stats for FreeCell and Pyramid on the Xbox Network.
</p>
<p>Reinstallation as described in the Microsoft Solitaire Collection FAQ has changed nothing.</p>
<p>Microsoft Solitaire Collection Version is 2.3.1406.1149</p>

<p>Hello MonsieurV3rt,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Tried your suggestion of uninstalling the Solitaire collection, &nbsp;rebooting, &nbsp;entering the command wsreset.exe and re-installing the Solitaire collection. &nbsp;Same problem. &nbsp;I reset my statistics and that did not work either. &nbsp;I checked my
 good PC and that one is still working. &nbsp;My bad PC is also still correctly picking up the status from the wins on my good PC. &nbsp;There must be a very subtle corruption on my bad PC or there is a very subtle bug on the Xbox network. &nbsp;I think it is the latter now
 that 2 other folks have chimed in and stated that they have the same problem.</p>

<p>Thanks! &nbsp;Here are a couple more symptoms of failure for the development team: &nbsp;1) For some time (minutes to hours) after resetting my statistics, after winning each came, my stats are 1-0 with that game's time as my record time. &nbsp;Then, after an interval,
 my statistics revert to where they'd gotten stuck when I first noticed this issue.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It started working today. &nbsp;I did not do anything to fix it. &nbsp;It has been about a week since I last played so my guess is the dev team implemented a fix in the last week. &nbsp;Can you confirm this?</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Something is still wrong. &nbsp;Although it is recording my wins, &nbsp;it also recorded a loss that I did not have. &nbsp;The sequence is as follows. &nbsp;I reset my statistics and played 6 games of Freecell (Klondike) and won every game. &nbsp;After I won the sixth
 game, &nbsp;it recorded the win the but also a loss so that my record is 6 and 1 when in fact I never lost a game. &nbsp;Please let the dev team know they still have an issue to fix.</p>

            <p>In that case, the installation of Windows 7&nbsp;is (and was)&nbsp;non-genuine.</p>
<p>If you want to continue to use Win7 you'll have to purchase a genuine Full Retail&nbsp;license from a reputable store, and use the Key from that to make your system genuine</p>
<p>Your other option is to order a set of Recovery disks from the manufacturer, and install that - you can then upgrade again to Win 7 using an Upgrade license.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Jigsaw- Can&#39;t use my coins to buy new selections</h2>
                    <p>I have been playing Microsoft Jigsaw for several months since I bought this computer. I have been able to earn coins and download several selections to continue on to new puzzles. Recently, I have several coins so I tried downloading 3 different new selections.
 They took my coins, but did not download the selections. It just sits there and does nothing. I am very disappointed, because it took my coin, but didn't give me my selections. Very unhappy with this. I am so....glad that I didn't purchase it with real money.
 I was transferred 5 times by Microsoft support and still didn't take care of my problem. No one seems to care. This program should still work. I want my coins back or at least down load my selections. Technical support would help, but no one will. Please get
 in touch with me to get this issue taken care of. Sounds like a new mac computer will be in the future. I have never heard of anyone having crazy issues like this.</p>

I agree with considerate_guy, <span>
we currently don't have the option to&nbsp;change the output of the file that will be produced&nbsp;in Windows Live Movie Maker.&nbsp;</span><span>Y</span><span><span>ou
 can submit this as a feature request by going to the&nbsp;</span></span><span><a href="http://feedback.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://feedback.live.com/</span></a></span><span><span>&nbsp;page
 and then&nbsp;select</span></span><span><span> "</span></span><span><span>Windows

            <p><span>That is very annoying, because apparently the Playstation3 is supposed to support WMV video files and it even offers a specific option on the System

 the audio codec, the movies from the "Windows Live Movie Makerâ€ play without audio in the PS3. It seems that PS3 just supports WMV - VC-1</span><span>ï¼ˆ</span><span>WMA

 the windows 7 version is brand new and not an addition to one that was already there.

<p>You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers.</p>

<p>Option 1:</p>
<p>If the COA sticker is damaged, then you would need to use the recovery partition to reinstall Windows 7, this will exempt the need to use the product key to activate your Windows 7 instalaltion.</p>
<p>Option 2:</p>
<p>If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee. This will exempt the need
 to use the product key also.</p>
<p>Option 3:</p>
<p>If the neither options 1 or 2 is possible, then you need to invest in a new retail full version license.</p>

<div>Try restarting the PC, entering the BIOS (before Windows boots) and updating the time and date in the BIOS. Most systems you'll need to press either F1 or F2 within the first 10 seconds of booting.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For exact instructions per your system on entering the BIOS, contact the system&nbsp;manufacturer.&nbsp;</div>

If your motherboard battery is getting weak, then time on that machine&nbsp;will stop every time you shut down your computer and will therefore be incorrect next time you restart your computer.&nbsp; If this is your problem, you should replace your motherboard battery.<br />

            Hi Kathy428,
<br />
<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />Try USB-FDD as a boot option and don't worry, a Windows 10 installation cannot corrupt your Motherboard BIOS. If one option doesn't boot correctly just try with a different one and that's it.
<br />
<br />Regards.

            Hi Kathy, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />Those two options you're seeing are for Zip drives and Floppy disk drives, neither of which are what you're after.
<br />
<br />You don't need to worry about corrupting your BIOS - all you need to do is find the boot up option to select the USB drive you've got plugged into the PC.
<br />
<br />When your PC is starting up, before the BIOS, see if F2 or F12 brings up a boot menu, where you can choose which device to boot from. Your USB drive should show up as an option. Otherwise, you could possibly choose the USB drive as the first priority in the BIOS.
<br />
<br />Please let me know how you go! Thanks!       
        </p>

<br />You should select USB-FDD. If that doesn't help, disable quickboot in BIOS.

            Hi Kathy
<br />
<br />The option to choose is USB FDD (Flash Disk Drive)
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>I do not know where you are looking but in several places Windows displays usernames as ComputerName\UserName</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your ComputerName is <em>BobcatGames&nbsp;</em>so, if&nbsp;your UserName is <em>Gaming PC</em>, your UserName might well be displayed in some places as
<em>BobcatGames\Gaming PC</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check your UserName in any Command prompt or Windows PowerShell window by entering the command&nbsp;<em>net user</em>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This will show a list of all user accounts [both the one you created &amp; the ones that the system created during installation].</p>

            <p>Hey there KITTENSPRINKLES,</p><p><br /></p><p>The Enforcement teams don't use the forums at all and they only communicate through a <a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howto#sub-topic0-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here!">Case Review</a>. 24 Hour communications suspensions and Console Suspensions are not reviewable, however you can find more information in these cases through the communication sent by the teams to the email address associated with your Xbox Live Gamertag. Remember that all suspensions are only enforced when a breach of the Code of Conduct or Terms of Service&nbsp;has happened.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>One of the common myths is that people who report another user for no reason will see that person suspended. This is not the case and in fact is subject to action as well for false reports which you can find more information about Enforcement Myths&nbsp;<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howto#sub-topic0-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here!">HERE</a>.</p>
<p><br /></p><p>If you believe the suspension was in error and&nbsp;if you're eligible, you can submit a case review using the steps <a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howto#sub-topic0-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here!">HERE</a>, however sometimes you're asked to complete a short questionnaire before you can submit a case review. All of the questions refer to the <a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com/home/codeofconduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here!">Code of Conduct</a>, which you should review prior to filing the review. If you fail on the questionnaire during the Case Review, don't worry as you'll be given another chance in 24 hours.</p>
<p><br /></p><p>Hope that helps!</p><p><br /></p><p>_______________________________________________________</p><p><br /></p>

                    <p>When replying to DaveM121 just now in another thread of mine, the size of the screen/font suddenly went huge. I'm unable to show you what the normal size/view is but this snip might help:</p>

            Hi Taffy,<br /> I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.<br /><br />Press Ctrl key on the keyboard with Mouse wheel to down and adjust it which should bring it to normal. Or check the zoom Settings of the page in the browser.

            Hi Taffy087
<br />
<br />If you press Ctrl + the Zero key, does your view go back yo normal?
<br />
<br />In most web browsers these shortcuts work:
<br />
<br />Zoom to 100%: Ctrl + Zero Key
<br />
<br />Zoom In: Ctrl + Plus Key
<br />
<br />Zoom Out: Ctrl + Minus Key
