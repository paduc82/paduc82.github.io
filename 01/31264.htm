<h2>            Restore Points not working</h2>
                    Not only can I not find any restore points but it seems many on this forum are having the same issue. Unfortunately it seems as if Microsoft representatives are just giving people the run-around. You used to be able to go to restore, select a restore point
 and voila, system was restored to a prior build and usually working. I just installed the latest windows update and now my system is jacked and a lot of browsing history is gone (important to me) and when I went to restore... nothing. I even tried just restoring
 to a previous build and nothing happened. So I guess I have 2 questions: where in the hell are the restore points now? They used to be created automatically and secondly is there nothing that can be done about this or are we just screwed? Oh, and I guess number
 3, why can't anybody get a straight answer from Microsoft?

            Hi HDSDad.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you. 
<br />
<br />I've been fighting for preserving System Restore via MVP channels for several years now since some Updates including Version Updates were turning it off.  I've seen that a lot less lately, although Version Updates still remove all Restore Points because they are an Upgrade install which always does that.  So it's important as I write in my tutorials to always check that System Restore is enabled on C with plenty of Disk space (5-15%) configured for it.  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If you want to express your opinion on this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Version Updates till only can be rolled back for 10 days.  This makes it important to keep a System Image backup so if a version Update messes up your install then you can restore it from the stored image in 20 minutes:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>
<br />
<br />And as always the most important thing in Windows 10 is the quality of the install so it can endure the oppressive Updating with the least trouble.  I recommend this Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            When you perform an upgrade or clean install of Windows 10, it deletes older system restore points.
<br />
<br />If you want to go back to an older version of Windows 10, you have 10 days to so.
<br />
<br />If thats what you want to do:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<p>I'm not from Microsoft - nobody here represents Microsoft, this is a community forum - but here are the straight answers you're looking for:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Part 1:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em>You used to be able to go to restore, select a restore point and voila, system was restored to a prior build ...</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, that's wrong. System Restore never worked that way. A restore point is not a backup. Only a backup can restore your computer to an earlier time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A restore point is a collection of essential system files, drivers and registry hives. The original idea behind a restore point was to restore the basic functioning of the operating system, and restore access to the user interface, so you can use Windows'
 own tools to (hopefully) repair a problem you are having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Restore was a good idea when it was first introduced, but fell from grace over time, for two reasons: 1) people mistook it for a backup and then complained when it became apparent that it wasn't a backup; and 2) real backup software became more user-friendly
 and capable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a clean install of Windows 10, System Restore is actually turned off by default. Because, why bother with half a solution when real backup software is available?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Part 2:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em>I just installed the latest windows update and now my system is jacked ... and when I went to restore ... nothing</em>."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, and you're glad. After a feature update, all previous restore points are erased. You wouldn't want to restore an old restore point ... that would mean your computer has a combination of old and new registry hives, and old and new system files. That's
<em>asking</em> for trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Part 3 - the last part, finally:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em>... is there nothing that can be done about this or are we just screwed?</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note from the Finger Wagging Department: If you were backing up every day, as you should be, this would be a total non-event. Just restore a backup from before the update, and it's like Humpty Dumpty never fell off that wall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lacking that, what you do now depends on how you feel about computers. In other words, it's a matter of opinion. So this is my
<em>opinion</em>, and you should know that I'm only interested in solutions that solve a problem now and in the future. No shortcuts for the Bulldog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I accept that not everyone feels the same. Other people want a solution to make the pain go away, so they can get on with their lives. Respect if you feel that way. Here's my way:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are able to specifically identify the problems in your computer, fix them. If not, backup your personal data and start from scratch with a clean install. That way you'll know that everything will work well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But don't bother with that if your computer originally shipped with a different version of Windows and the manufacturers of your hardware aren't supporting their stuff on Windows 10. If that's the case, do a factory restore to send your computer back to
 the way it was when it left the factory.</p>

            I did try that and it didn't work. who's brilliant idea was this? That was one useful tool that worked and worked well. Also used by many it seems. It was also a tool that had been around for awhile and stood the test of time.

            Well I am not glad... I am just a stupid computer user who wasn't aware that I needed to backup daily, I do back up monthly but I thought I always have had system restore to fall back on. There seems to be a lot of stupid mes not happy with this. I seem
 to have enough things to have to go and set up and now here is one more only to wake one morning and backups will be obsolete. And it seems even if you go back and set your system to auto set restore points or even manually set them it doesn't work either.
 These are nice things to find out after the fact, after you have lost data to do a bad windows update. I have been the staunchest supporter of windows 10 until now arguing against people bashing it with rumors such as this incident. I am going to have to rethink
 this. And if you support this, and you sound like you do (so you don't mix&nbsp;

"that would mean your computer has a combination of old and new registry hives, and old and new system files. That's
<em>asking</em> for trouble". Well for one never had any issues stemming from that as I did a clean install occasionally and at least that was at my leisure and I was prepared for it. And I guess you must be right about backing
 up daily it doesn't seem like we have a choice now as the other options that worked incredibly well for myself and others has been taken out of our hands. At least they made sure we were aware of this change so we could adapt and when we contacted support
 they could lie to us about the reasons it was happening and the solutions.</p>

<p>A restore point never held data. You could never restore lost data by restoring a restore point. At its very best, a restore point could make it possible for you to retrieve
<em>existing</em> data, by restoring the basic functionality of the operating system. But only a backup is a backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We still don't know what happened to your computer. How do you know that your data is lost? Unless it was erased or over-written, it's still on the hard drive. The mere fact that your operating system is scr*wed up doesn't mean you can't get your data back.
 Even if you can't boot ... that's just a detail. We can show you how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going forward you really need to backup every day. My backups run automatically, overnight while I'm sleeping. It's not hard once you've learned how it's done.</p>

            System Restore is still available, but you have to create new system restore points. 
<br />
<br />You might have to downgrade manually:
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install

<br />
<br />Step 4: how to recover your files from Windows.old:

            thank you, is there any place I can sign a petition to support restore... haha for my purposes restore was a great solution to most of my problems. I am quite aware that it is not a backup but was a quick 'restore' to fix a bad 3rd party install or a MS
 install. I have a lot of 3rd party and MS software installed and doing a "clean" install every time I have a hic-up is not an easy solution for me. I am a liver, kidney transplant survivor and cancer to boot so time is a little important to me so doing a 'clean'
 install every time, backing up every day (and I understand you can set it all to automate) but that doesn't help the fact that systems slow down while this is going on and every time there is a system/software update it seems to jack these and you have to
 go back and reset. For me restore worked that is all I am saying and it seems that there are a bunch of people out there that feel the same way. I understand that for other people, other things work for them and they always use terms li

<h2>            Random crash dump and blue screen&#59; BCCode&#58; 4E   0x0000004E</h2>
                    Hello Rob Brown,<br />
<br />
Am hopeful you can assist me.&nbsp; Have had 2 blue screen crash dump screens in 3 days time and I am worried about my laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp; Am using Windows 7 (64bit)&nbsp; and&nbsp; have just read the above communication and wondered this:<br />
<br />
You're advocating nirsoft as a means by which a person can capture a their problems for assistance here but when I click on nirsoft it actually takes me to a utility called Reimage.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
Is that safe and correct?&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Using MS Security Essentials and nothing else but F-Secure for browsing Google.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Very nervous to make an error now and lose my laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've got almost nothing on it, other than some photos.&nbsp; No music, movies, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider myself to be overly cautious but somethings obviously wrong.<br />
<br />
Am not savvy at tech lingo but always trying to stay on top of things enough to remain as safe as is possible.<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance for any help and direction,<br />
<br />

<p>them as they will cause issues and fix nothing. Think of them as Snake-Oil.<br />

<strong>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code <br />
<br />
</strong>If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer,
 call the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,

<strong>Cause&nbsp; <br />
<br />
</strong>This error is typically caused by a driver passing a bad memory descriptor list. For example, the driver might have called
<strong>MmUnlockPages</strong> twice with the same list. <br />
<br />
If a kernel debugger is available, examine the stack trace. <br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info<br />
that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other error<br />
information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />

Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party<br />
keyboard and mouse, as well as other major device drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p><br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations<br />
in Windows Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install<br />
drivers which will usually be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new<br />
driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones manually if
<br />
you wish.<br />

<h2>            Improper ejection of an External Hard Drive</h2>
                    <p>My child disconnected my external hard drive (mass storage device) from my laptop by yanking the cord from the USB port while&nbsp; I was working on a file currently stored on that device.&nbsp; Now,&nbsp;I can't reconnect to the device from my laptop.&nbsp; The&nbsp;laptop doesn't
 recognize it.&nbsp; The&nbsp;light on the storage device is still blinking and seems&nbsp;to be running, but when I look in my device manager, the device isn't there.&nbsp; And I can't add it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be appreciated.&nbsp; I've tried shutting down and restarting with it connected and with it disconnected.&nbsp; Nothing is working.&nbsp;

</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community, we understand your concern and we will try our best to help you resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like to know if you have tried insetting another USB device in the same port.</p>

</p><p>I would suggest that you perform the methods that are mentioned below so that we can narrow down the cause of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Connect the external hard drive using another USB cord and check if your system detects it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Connect to another computer and check&nbsp;if the hard drive gets detected.</p>

    <title>Photos app - There are no files of folders in this view. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ludo-poot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photos app - There are no files of folders in this view.</h2>
                    Hi there,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a problem with the photo app on my new Surface pro 2. After reinstalling windows (because skydrive was&nbsp;messed up) the problem appeared.</div>
<div>Whenever I open the app it shows me my Pictures library. But I see no photos and gives me the message ''There are no files of folders in this view.'' When I select the skydrive pictures folder it works normal. And because it cannot find any photos locally
 the live tile function doesn't work either :( .</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I already tried the permissions fix; change the permissions for the system from the library, but those ware already set to allow everything.</div>
<div>And reselecting/ select the whole C: disk for indexing does not work either.</div>
<div>After removing all apps with the command prompt so I could reinstall the photo app, I discovered that the photo app is one of the apps that can't be removed in 8.1. So that won't fix it either.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Who has a fix or tip for me? Thanks in advance!&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            <blockquote>Thank you for replying,
<div><br />
<div>I clicked on show libraries in the file explorer, now it seems I have all the folders twice. One library pictures and one folder pictures in this PC.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Photo app is looking in the picture library that is empty so it is just doing his job. But I can't remove those folders (pictures, videos, documents). I can remove the libraries though. I also can't place something in a library: 'could not find this
 item' is what I get...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So thats a step closer to resolving this problem. What now?</div>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>First, right click on Pictures under <strong>Libraries</strong> - see RED arrow and click delete the Pictures
<strong>library</strong>. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Second, expand you C drive - see BLUE arrow and add a folder named Pix2 and copy a few pictures into it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Third, &nbsp;follow the procedure to restore default libraries at <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows8_1-pictures/show-and-restore-broken-libraries-in-windows-81/ed57b9dd-49d8-4f41-b008-8dd51dcaf76b">

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Fourth, now using library tools, manage, add the Pix2 folder to the library that you created in step 2.</p>

<p>Although "Briefcase" appears as an icon on your desktop, it is actually a folder.&nbsp; You can use Windows Explorer to view the folder and all of its contents.&nbsp; The path is usually:</p>
<p>C:\Documents and Settings\User Name\Desktop\Briefcase</p>
<p>When you delete any file or folder in WinXP, the deleted item usually moves to the Recycle Bin.&nbsp; Open your&nbsp; Recycle Bin.&nbsp; If Briefcase is there, you can restore it to its usual position.</p>
<p>If you have emptied the Recycle Bin, then the previous Briefcase folder will no longer be available - and you will have to create another one.</p>

    <title>Shortcut with custom icon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thanatica  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shortcut with custom icon</h2>
                    <p>I've put a shortcut with a custom icon on my desktop. The custom icon is an ICO file containing 16x16, 32x32, and 48x48 glyphs. When I browser to that file using any explorer window and make the tiles large enough, the 32x32 or 48x48 will show as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I make a shortcut on my desktop with a custom icon pointing to this icon file, it will always use the 16x16 glyph and scale up to whatever the icon size of the desktop is (typically 48x48) , making it extremely ugly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I make desktop shortcut icons use the proper format from an ICO file?</p>
<p>This problem did not exist in Windows 7.</p>

<p>Hi Alaa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can disable the touchscreen driver of your Surface Book so you can use it as a regular laptop. To do this, you can follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the <strong>Windows icon</strong> on your home screen (Windows + X).</li><li>Choose <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Expand <strong>Human Interface Devices</strong>. You will see a list of&nbsp; HID-compliant adapters.<br />
</li><li>Right-click on<strong> HID-compliant touch screen</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Disable</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you ever decide to enable the touch screen again, simply go through the same steps but instead of choosing Disable (Step 5), choose Enable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if there's anything else we can assist you with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Stuck at the Surface</h2>
                    <p>My surface Pro 3, which I've been using for three years now, has developed a strange problem&nbsp; Whenever I power it up it stucks at the screen display 'surface'. I tried fixing the issue by pressing the power off and volume up buttons to no avail. I always
 have to force shut it and restart it at least 3 times before it finally competes the process of starting. The last time I shut it down, this evening, I tried several times to start it but it always stuck at the screen display of 'surface'. Another problem
 is whenever I press the power off button along with the volume key up when the screen shows up a password would be required, and my account password is always rejected as incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly help.&nbsp;</p>

            <div>OK, sounds like your next step is a complete wipe and reimage (sorry). Go to</div>
<div><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (with a different</div>
<div>Windows computer if yours is not working properly)&nbsp; and download a recovery</div>
<div>image for your Surface. You will need a 16GB USB stick formatted FAT32 (use a</div>
<div>Windows computer). Use FULL format and not quick format. Give the volume a name</div>
<div>like surfboot.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Unzip/extract the recovery zip to the formatted USB stick and then-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:</div>
<div>Step 1:&nbsp; &nbsp; Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in (hold down the power</div>
<div>button for 30 seconds).</div>
<div>Step 2:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 3:&nbsp; &nbsp; Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the</div>
<div>power button on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 4:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.</div>
<div>Step 5:&nbsp; &nbsp; When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.</div>
<div>Step 6:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of</div>
<div>the screen.</div>
<div>Step 7:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This</div>
<div>refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 8:&nbsp; &nbsp; Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.</div>
<div>Step 9:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Choose Just remove my files.</div>
<div>Step 10:&nbsp; &nbsp; Select Reset.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process</div>
<div>continues (this can take a while).</div>

<p>Hi,</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may result from missing crucial system files and appears at Windows startup and denies further advance to operating system.</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to perform Startup Repair by creating a Windows 10 Bootable media (i.e. USB or DVD) using

 Once you're ready with Bootable Media, follow the below mentioned steps.</span></span></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Startup Repair</strong> is a Windows Recovery tool that can fix certain system problems that might prevent Windows from starting. Startup Repair scans your computer for the problem, and then tries to fix it so your computer can start correctly.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Insert the Windows installation disc in the disc drive or connect USB media and then start the computer.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Press a key when you are prompted. </p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Select a language, a time, a currency, a keyboard or an input method, and then click

            Hi Robert,
<br />
<br />You can try rolling back to 1709, but honestly your best and probably only option is to reset Windows 10, while keeping your files and apps . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            Sorry, this is widely reported currently. Please see the Microsoft's QA on this:

<h3> rebelagentm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video Card is Crashing Computer</h2>
                    
<p>On three or four occasions, my video card has seemingly caused problems with my system.&nbsp; Two of those times, the screen locked up and distorted.</p>
<p>I have already ensured that I have the latest drivers and BIOS and I have even uninstalled and reinstalled the driver for the video card.&nbsp; I have run memory and hard disk checks using the built-in Windows 7 tools and they did not report any errors.</p>
<p>I have had some other issues with the system which you can see in the threads listed below.&nbsp; The last issue listed here I was told had to do with my CPU and/or motherboard.&nbsp; Could those be the culprit here as well?</p>

<p>Can someone look at the linked dump files and help me figure out what is going on?&nbsp; I have included every dump file from every crash.<br />

<div>Hi rebelagentm,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I read your other two threads. You seem to have an issue with hardware. However, you could do couple more things:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. If you could swap the video card with a different one or put the issue video card in a different computer to test.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Since the issue from your previous posts appears to be from June, if your computer is covered under warranty, you might as well get it replaced by a new one. This definitely appears to be a hardware issue.</div>
<div><br />

<p>Thanks, Azeez!</p>
<p>I built this system myself, so unfortunately, I need to determine which hardware is causing the problem so that I can RMA the correct item(s) to the manufacturers.</p>
<p>I am going to try and test out some of the hardware in another system and see what happens.</p>
<p>In the meantime, any other suggestions, Azeez?&nbsp; Anyone else have any thoughts?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

                    Which Call Of Duty game do you think has the best campaign? I honestly don’t know which to choose, I kinda enjoyed the ghost campaign but I do love story and the multiplayer aspect that came with bo3.

            Ghosts had a pretty good campaign, but Advance Warfare was the better campaign in my opinion. Kevin Spacey was a great antagonist in that game.

<h2>            Brink &#36;19.99 on Amazon today&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone! I just wanted to give you guys a heads up, and let you know that Brink is $19.99 as Amazon's, "Deal of the Day," today. This game has received many mixed opinions since its release. Personally, I think the game can be a blast in co-op, so
 I say go for it at the $19.99 price point while it lasts! :D Here is the link, I hope it works. XD Still getting used to the new forums, so forgive me if it does not.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the information, if the external drive is&nbsp;a USB one, I suggest that you connect the drive directly to the&nbsp;USB port and check if the device gets detected. If you have already tried the above but failed, I suggest that you provide the information below
 which will help us get a clearer image of the issue in hand.</p>
<p>1. Do you get any error when you plug the drive and try to access the same?</p>
<p>2. Can you see the drive under This PC after you connected it?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Can you provide the exact error message if any?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Do you face any issues when connecting other USB devices to the PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Your reply is very important to ensure a proper resolution. Please get back to us with the above information to assist you accordingly.</span></p>

<p>Can you see the drive using Disk Management? It could be that a drive letter has not been assigned to the device and therefore makes it a bit difficult to see in File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have the device unplugged before you start, and open Disk Management. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Plug in the device and observe if an extra drive appears in Disk Management. If it does see if it has a drive letter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;You should be able to right click and select change drive letter if the option is available and the drive has a valid partition, or you can right click on the drive and see if the option explore is available</p>

<strong>1.</strong> Check the memory very thoroughly (memory test methods in the next message).<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Check with Dell Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums<br />
about any known issues. Update the BIOS, chipset, and other major on-board and separate<br />
device drivers (driver update methods in the next message.<br />
<br />

<br />
Bug Check 0x4E: PFN_LIST_CORRUPT<br />
<br />
</strong>The PFN_LIST_CORRUPT bug check has a value of 0x0000004E. This indicates that the page frame number (PFN) list is corrupted.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code <br />
<br />
</strong>If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer,
 call the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,

If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.
<br />
<br />
These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>

<p><strong>Cause&nbsp; <br />
<br />
</strong>This error is typically caused by a driver passing a bad memory descriptor list. For example, the driver might have called
<strong>MmUnlockPages</strong> twice with the same list. <br />
<br />
If a kernel debugger is available, examine the stack trace. <br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info<br />
that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other error<br />
information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002 </p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />

You can disable Driver Verifier<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></a>&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable <br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with<br />
MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can analyze it.<br />
<br />
===========================================
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (Check for BIOS and driver updates.)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model. <br />

If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Don't leave Driver Verifier running as it can cause instability when their otherwise be none. And<br />
it seems the real issue here is hardware.<br />
<br />
BugCheck 1A, {8886, fffffa80034a6640, fffffa80034a4e70, 100}</p>
<p>Probably caused by : memory_corruption ( nt!MiUnlinkPageFromLockedList+19c ) &lt;- non-descript<br />
so it could be a driver however hardware is a very real possibility.<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 1a&nbsp; 0x0000001a<br />
<br />
</strong>Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) -<br />
actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Make sure the vents are clear and that the<br />
fans are working. Even though the temp is OK do not assume heat can't affect the video,<br />
sound or other system functions it those get to hot. Try adding a small fan blowing into<br />
the vents as a test. (Those are mostly for a PC not a laptop.)<br />
<br />
Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before these started?<br />
(Check Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there about the<br />
time this started) Main likely culprits are Video driver, other major drivers, memory, and<br />
antivirus/antispyware/security products could be at fault as well as drive issues.<br />
<br />
Use the troubleshooter below and refer to the&nbsp;previous message for drivers and memory when<br />
you get to those sections and then return back to the troubleshooter as needed. <br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Check memory and ALL hardware possibilities as indicated above and in the previous troubleshooters.<br />
Keep in mind that memory tests do not detect all issue such as the tiny speed differences between<br />
memory modules that appear to be identical. So it may be necessary to swap the modules in and<br />
out in different combinations and patterns (see memory test methods in the previous reply).<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> <strong>Check with Dell Support and their forums</strong> - especially to see if there are known issues. Be sure
<br />
you have the latest <strong>BIOS</strong>, <strong>chipset</strong>, and <strong>
other drivers</strong>. Double check the<strong> Bluetooth drivers</strong> are the
<br />
latest. If you are using any Bluetooth devices power off&nbsp;- remove them - power back on and use the<br />
system to see if it is more stable. That is an educated guess and the BT may not actually be involved.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>You need to update to Windows 7 SP1 however doing so when you have a possible hardware issue</p>
<p>is very risky as it could crash in the process. So just keep that in mind to do when you have a stable<br />
system.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You don't open .DLL files which are dynamic link libraries which support programs. Possiby the program you<br />
need to view the x-rays&nbsp;is on the CD and if not check with whoever provided the x-rays.<br />
<br />
DLL files - DO NOT ATTEMPT to open them<br />
