<h2>            Hori steering wheel not recognized</h2>
                    
<p>I bought the Hori wheel for Xbox One because it's endorsed by Microsoft as an official Xbox One peripheral (at least that's how I understood it). It works okay with Forza, yay! Problem is, I don't like Forza, I bought the wheel to play Need For Speed Rivals
 and any other future driving games I buy and NFS Rivals won't recognize it!</p>
<p>Not only that, when I go to Settings, Devices - only my wireless controller shows up. It's like the Hori wheel doesn't exist. Yet, start up Forza and it works fine?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spoke to support on here earlier and they told me to try some things to reset the console but they didn't make any difference. What's the deal? At this stage I'm about ready to put the thing back in its box and return it to Amazon for a refund. Very irritated
 that a peripheral Microsoft have endorsed doesn't even show up in settings!</p>

<p>Ah, okay, I just found something! Apparently NFS Rivals doesn't support steering wheels on any platform! A racing game that doesn't support steering wheels? Genius!</p>
<p>Okay, I guess I'll hold onto the Hori wheel for a bit and see how it works on the next driving game I buy, which will NOT be from EA.</p>

<h2>            Netflix contrast and picture blown out &#40;HDR&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Since the most latest update for Netflix I've noticed the picture and contrast is blown out.<br />At first I though they had a poor stream of Madagascar but I've since realised this problem affects the App as a whole.<br />They probably did this to address the fact the the app UI is, or was rather dark while in HDR mode but this update is 10x worse there is too much contrast and way too much brightness, picture is blown out like I say and in some cases this also leads to pixilation.<br />If someone was really finding the browsing and navigating UI to dark in it's previous form they could have just changed the HDR mode on their TV or turned up brightness while browsing, on my TV I would usually change it form "HDR Bright" to "HDR Vivid" a quick and simple fix. HDR Vivid also being the best for viewing non-hdr content on Netflix in my opinion. But now this update has messed all that up. <br />Thanks Netflix, you really know how to update your software.<br /><br />If only you could go back

            <p>Update: Last time I used the Netflix app I didn't seem to experience this problem. So it's not a bug that happens all the time. <br />Although to be noted is the fact that I've never experienced the problem I've mentioned before the latest update. It feels a bit like it could be caused by the HDMI splitter and not the app,</p><p>but I'm not entirely onboard with that Idea as I've said this problem hasn't reared it's head prior to the latest update.<br />Really not sure what the is the legitimate cause of this it really is quite strange.<br /><br /><br />I guess I could test using netflix without the splitter (direct to the tv) to see if the problem occurs at all then, if I can be bothered.</p>

<div>Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?</div>
<div>(this includes plug pulling and power buttons)</div>
<div><br />
<div>These can cause corruption in the file system which must be fixed before you do anything&nbsp;else.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If any of those events have occurred (or even if they have not occurred), you should verify&nbsp;the integrity of your file system before doing anything else (especially "trying" things).</div>
<div><br />
<div>It makes zero sense to start trying to copy files around on a hard disk that has a corrupted&nbsp;file system so this must be fixed first using the XP chkdsk program, and fixing that may resolve&nbsp;your issue entirely. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Use the XP Recovery Console to verify the file system on your HDD and correct any problems&nbsp;and then try to boot your system - this may be all you need to do. &nbsp;Or, you are welcome to&nbsp;just start trying things that might work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Boot into the Windows Recovery Console using a bootable XP installation CD.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come a store bought system. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</div>
<div><br />
<div>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Download the ISO file from here:</div>

<div><br />
<div>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;</div>
<div>made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Press any key to boot from CD...</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</div>
<div><br />
<div>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</div>
<div><br />
<div>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>RC allows basic file commands - copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where&nbsp;Windows is installed to try to repair any problems on the afflicted drive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Running chkdsk is fine to run even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</div>
<div><br />
<div>chkdsk C: /r</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;It may take a long&nbsp;time to complete or appear to be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is&nbsp;</div>
<div>still flashing, it is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount to&nbsp;be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards sometimes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will&nbsp;not be present.</div>

<p>No - all it does is use the Windows disk checking program to verify the integrity of the NTFS file system and attempt to repair any inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Whenever you see a file missing or corrupt kind of message, you should always start with a chkdsk /r first.&nbsp; Many times, that is all you need to do.</p>
<p>It could be that a file is really missing or corrupt, but you should not just start trying to replace the file reported as the first thing to do.</p>
<p>It does not make sense to start trying to copy/replace files on a system with a corrupted file system until the file system integrity has been restored.</p>
<p>If you still have the problem after the chkdsk /r, then you can continue to work on the problem.</p>
<p>In your other post, you said this:</p>
<p>when i boot my computer receive an error message about a corruted file. what should i do.</p>
<p>To get the best help and advice, try to be more specific about exactly what the message says.&nbsp; There are lots of files and lots of messages, so if your XP is complaining about a certain file, we need to know exactly which one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that we cannot see your screen from here, so you have to tell us exactly what it says.</p>

<p>Do, or do not. There is no try.</p>

    <title>Wifi setting problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> soooverpowered  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wifi setting problem</h2>
                    I'm using windows 10 build 1803, and recently I found out that the wifi tab inside settings app is not showing anything except for the option for hotspot 2.0 networks and I'm unable to access to the options for changing to metered connections, etc. Is
 there a way to fix it? I would prefer not to reinstall windows as I have a lot of softwares with large data and it would be a pain to do so

            Hi SooOverpowered,
<br />
<br />Is your WiFi actually working?
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />
<br />Expand out the Network Adapters section
<br />
<br />Does you WiFi device have an exclamation mark beside it?
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd and choose Command Prompt 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />ipconfig /flushdns 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt 
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to Network and Internet 
<br />
<br />Click the Network Reset button 
<br />
<br />Wait for your PC to automatically restart after 5 minutes       
        </p>

            It sounds like a Windows Access Rights problem. <br />
<br />

<div>
<b>(optional) How to fix Access Rights problem</b>
<p>Sometimes the problem has been that Windows has had problems granting the right access to files, folders and the registry. The following tips provide some workarounds.</p>
<p>As you go from XP to Vista to Win7 certain operations require higher access rights to perform. These access rights are “higher” than even those granted to the Administrator ID by default. These “elevated” rights are accessed by way of
 the UAC confirmation dialog which is invoked when you select to “Run As Administrator”.</p>
<p>In theory, any one of the following tips should work.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The process is: run one of the fixes, run each affected Office app, reboot TWICE (sorry, I don’t know why, but there appears to be some “Voodoo” at play here. We do it because it works!) TWICE (sorry, I don’t know why, but there appears to be some “Voodoo”
 at play here. We do it because it works!), try the office apps again to confirm the fix worked.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro will not print in colour - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> presentmoth7186  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro will not print in colour</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Microsoft Surface Pro 4 which is not printing in colour on my HP Deskjet printer. I have completely uninstalled the printer on device manager and reinstalled it with no success, as well as updating Windows 10. I know that it is not an issue with
 the printer as I can print in colour with no issues from my phone. When exploring printer properties, I cannot see a setting where my printer would be limited to greyscale only as there are no colour options. Any advice?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, PresentMoth7186,
<br />
<br />1. Remove cartridge(s) from the printer
<br />Clean the print heads with a cotton swab doused in a small amount of alcohol.
<br />Clean contacts inside the printer before reinstalling the cartridge
<br />
<br />2. Remove cartridges from printer
<br />While the printer is on, disconnect the power cord from the rear of the printer then unplug the power cord from the wall outlet.
<br />Remove USB cable, if present.
<br />Wait for 5 minutes
<br />Press and hold the power button on your printer for about 30 seconds to remove any additional charge.
<br />Plug the power cable straight to a wall outlet without any surge protector or an extension cord then plug in power cord to the printer.
<br />Turn on the printer 
<br />When printer is idle
<br />Insert the cartridges and print a test page.
<br />
<br />3. Open Device Manager &gt; Uninstall Printer drivers
<br />Reboot and Windows will reload the drivers
<br />Check for driver updates

<br />
<br />I would like to suggest you download the HP Deskjet manufacturing driver and install it, you should be able to print in color after that.

<p>Why stop with the Xbox One? &nbsp;If Microsoft gains profit on the Xbox One what would stop them from corrupting their other products. &nbsp;Microsoft has rooted themselves into our society, but the consumers hold the power to reprimand them. &nbsp;However inconceivable
 it would be to get their entire base onboard with a boycott, a small amount of money lost is money lost.</p>
<p>Microsoft, we love you, but we will not tolerate this disgusting, and heinous act of greed.</p>

<p>360 is the only M$ product I use (bar the rare use of win7). One thing I will say in their favour is that they didnt just block anything negative (although clear fanboys do keep hitting page 1 with nothing really added)...I suppose its better to be in control
 of a bad situation than nothing at all.</p>

<p>So this how its going down for me. If Microsoft doesn't get there act together before the release of the new xbox I will be boycotting the new Xbox One. If they try and pull some BS like taking 360 servers offline so people that feel the same as me cant
 still play 360, just to boost sales of the Xbox One, guess what "here I come Playstation." There is no GD reason I should have to have internet just to play campagin mode, or have to have the Kinect pluged in if I don't want to. I'm sure it all seems like
 a great idea but not for everyone. I mean come on what if your internet is down due to weather. I guess there goes family game night for familys, and people like me who take advantage of the weather taking out the internet to get the campagin done. THIS GOES
 OUT TO MICROSOFT "if you think this will bring sales up your sadly mistaken." What you are right about is that we the xbox community want a new Xbox, one that has all the cool features you mention on the Xbox One reveal, but none of the features that have
 been said since or the ones that I listed above. We as a community are very excited, but highly disappointed with the new Xbox One. If this gets fixed before the release I will pre-order one, but if no changes are made then you will have lost another xbox/microsoft
 customer. I'm sure I wouldn't be the last you would lose.</p>

<p>@ Judge Bergan...you have missed the point. &nbsp;By calling for a group of fellow gamers to support a boycott you formally discipline a tyrantic corporation. &nbsp;So if things don't become brighter for Microsoft and it's loyal customers I will start/join a group
 of boycotting, middle finger displaying people that refuse to be taken advantage of. &nbsp;You're welcome to join up with me if a boycott is needed. &nbsp;Otherwise, when you are playing your fee taxed games, and having fun with your omnivision kinect I will be boycotting.</p>

 of your update file. Then, you can compare that with the release dates shown in the console version history here:</span><br />

<h2>            Migrate emails from Outlook 2003 to Windows 7 Live Mail - without using OE6</h2>
                    I upgraded this computer from Vista to 64-bit Windows 7. I have decided to move from Outlook 2003 to Windows Live Mail, but cannot figure out how to export my old emails from Outlook to WinMail. I read online about going through Outlook Express 6 as intermediary,
 but when I tried that, it turns out you cannot install OE6 on a 64-bit machine.<br />
<br />
So I am at a loss. How do I move my old emails from Outlook 2003 to WinMail?

            You're welcome!&nbsp; Outlook Express is part of Windows XP, so you don't have to install it.&nbsp; Here's the outline:<br />
<br />
1. Start Outlook, import the .pst file, close Outlook.<br />
2. Start Outlook Express, import messages from Outlook, close Outlook Express.<br />
3. Copy the Outlook Express store folder to Windows 7.&nbsp; To find its location, click
<strong>Tools </strong>&gt; Options &gt; <strong>Maintenance</strong> &gt; <strong>Store Folder</strong> .<br />
4. Start Windows Live Mail, import messages from Outlook Express store folder.<br />
<br />
I think this will pick up all of the accounts.

    <title>Snipping Tool problem in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loumilrad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Snipping Tool problem in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;After functioning perfectly for about a year, my Snipping Tool, when&nbsp; click comes up with a screen error message&nbsp; composed of a small rectangle with a large red X with the only option to click OK. I've tried using tweaking.com's repair kit which, after
 five or six hours still doesn't show any activity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any and all assistance would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Recover windows 7 from windows 10 on dual boot system - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cliff321  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recover windows 7 from windows 10 on dual boot system</h2>
                    <p>I have a dual boot system</p>
<p>
</p><p>.Windows 7 ( now 10)&nbsp;was on partition D.IT is not the default start system ,that is partition C,Vista.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the recover option provided from windows 10.It started ok &amp; the screen went blank as it was intended to do which was when I realised that I had a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I installed windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I switched the pc on if I just let in run,it started in Vista.If I wanted to run Windows 7 which was almost always,i'd press F8 slowly &amp; get the option of VISTA or Win 7.( I'd kept Vista as back up in case of a possible problems when installing Win.7
 )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back to recovering Win 7 from Win 10. When the pc restarts in the recovery process,&nbsp;if I just let it run it will restart in Vista not in Win 7 ( 10 ).I tried pressing F8 but that just stopped the recovery process &amp; restarted Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see that I need to make partition D,currently Win.10 the default,i don't know how to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said that,when I start up at the moment,i press F8 &amp; get the option of Vista or Win 10.There it does say that Win 10 is the default option but it can't be because if I turn on the pc &amp; let it run,it starts in Vista.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not tech person so hope that makes sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing,when I installed Win 7,it did become the default start system.For a reason I can't remember I had to clean install Vista,it was after this that Vista became the default system.</p>
<p>

            <p>Sorry for the delay in my reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply,i was aware of msconfig,for some reason it has only shown one choice for some time,i used to press F8 on start up to get the choice of two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said i uninstalled my antivirus becausr of a possible confict with Win 10,it uninstalled ok (&nbsp;as normal) i restarted to complete the uninstall &amp; for some reason seemed to lose everything,sorry about this,ive already posted this somewhere else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't get into Vista,drive C or Win 10 on drive &nbsp;D.I used my Vista install disk &amp; got Vista working again,but win 10 will not start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now want to remove it,i can't use the recovery option because Win 10 doesn't work.I've tried formatting the D partition but windows tells me,it can't do it.I've deleted it in msconfig &amp; gone into disk management but again i can't format the partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my windows 7 installation disk,i realise that if i format the D drive i will probably lose win 7 along with win 10,which will be annoying because i'll probably have to reinstall lots of stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more thing.If i were to clean reinstall windows 7 onto Partition drive D,would doing that completely remove Win 10 &amp; win 7 if that is still in there somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a windows image i think it's called,somewhere on a backup external drive,but i don't know exactly how that works,i've never had to use back up before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That i think is my current situation,don't think that i've forgotten anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does a system image include the windows 7 operating system or just files &amp; programs.</p>
<p>

            <p>I asked this question too. Then I did a bit more research and found something that actually worked. It's straightforward too.</p>
<p>1. Click 'start'</p>
<p>2. Type notepad.exe</p>
<p>3. Click File</p>
<p>4. Click Open</p>
<p>5. Where is says File name,&nbsp;and remembering to leave a space between Windows and Live, type the following exactly as it is here:</p>
<p>%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Proof</p>
<p>6. Choose the All Files option (rather than Text Documents)</p>
<p>7. Click lang0409</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A long list appears of all the words you have ever added to the custom dictionary. Correct or delete the ones you don't want, ensuring you delete the spaces afterwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good Luck.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Game Pass stopped working with error 0x803f800e</h2>
                    <p>When using Xbox Game Pass it showed on my screen "(Looks like you need to renew Xbox Game Pass 0x803f800e)" and same online under my account and the billing even showed pending instead of completed. That would have all been fine if my credit card hadn't actually been successfully charged over 10 days previous. I suppose if I used Game Pass more frequently I may have noticed it sooner. I guess the billing and processing side on Microsoft are having some issues so if you have payed for something you may have to jump through some hoops to be able to use it.&nbsp;</p>
