 the computer down or restarting, it would take about 5 minutes before it would finally power off. For most of the five minutes only a black screen can be seen but the computer is definitely still running. The hard drive seems to power off and then power up
 again multiple times during the five minutes as well.</span><br />

 black and it will enter one of these long shut down episodes. All the settings in the power options menus are set to sleep when the lid is closed, power button pressed etc.</span><br />

<span>I seem to have isolated the problem to the Windows 8.1 update. After a few days of these problems I decided to do a 'system refresh' and after that the computer was back to its normal sleeping
 and fast booting state. I then did not install any other programs (apart from the asus bloatware that had installed during the refresh) at all before updating to Windows 8.1 and as soon as I did the shut down and sleeping problems came back.</span><br />
<br />
<span>So, something about the Windows 8.1 update is causing things to not operate properly.</span><br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've updated to Windows 10, close to the start of January, and have been plagued by this issue from the start. &nbsp; It has occurred while doing just about anything, be it idling, gaming, browsing the web, etc. etc.&nbsp; So I haven't been able to recreate it, it
 can do it during a game and then I come back and play that same game for a day with no issue what so ever. &nbsp; I've clean installed windows twice now, ran SFC , memtest (For 3 full passes), taken my ram out to test one stick at a time, reseated video card and
 DDU'd it.&nbsp; I came across the forums today and read a post which recommended to use Verifier, which I did and it gave me no "xxxx.sys" file to work off of.&nbsp; But I do have 2 DMP files and Memory DMP uploaded to OneDrive along with MSinfo32 and a Speccy txt file
 of my system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is to hoping someone can give me a hand with this. </p>

<p>I've already ran the things recommended in that forum you linked already as well. The latest of the 3 DMP files was from running Verifier.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only change was upgrading to Windows 10, I've checked my drivers and windows update has failed to find any newer drivers as well.&nbsp; Only Drivers I've found that I might want to update were my BIOS, but when I contacted ASUS they advised against it but told
 me how to anyways.&nbsp; I couldn't just simply update my BIOS using EZ Flash like they gave me directions to do so I gave up on that because I rather not brick this PC.&nbsp; As for SFC,&nbsp; I did get an Error but it said it successfully repaired it, but I still got the
 BSOD 3 times so far today.&nbsp; Two of the times I had left my PC just idling on desktop while doing things around the house and come back to it sitting at startup, once saying No Bootable Device Found.

</p><p>We appreciate all the information that you have provided us and also for the effort that you have initiated to fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that you are facing this issue due to a hardware defect, mainly your internal hard drive or RAM. To narrow down this, I would suggest that you run Windows Memory Diagnostic tool and check if there are any errors.</p>
<p>1. In the search bar type, <strong>Windows Memory Diagnostic.</strong></p>
<p>2. Click on the tool and select<strong> Restart now and check the problem.</strong></p>
<p>3. Follow the&nbsp;on screen instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, do let us know&nbsp;the error that the tool prompts if any. </p>

<h2>            Why some programs won&#39;t allow you to reduce window width beyond a point&#63; How to bypass such restrictions&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using IVONA Text Reader &amp; Foxit Reader. I've noticed that I cannot reduce the width of their respective windows beyond a point. But this "minimum width" for Foxit Reader is much half of the "minimum width" for the IVONA Reader window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone with similar experiences? How can I reduce these windows beyond these "minimum width" restrictions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to give more screen space to the Foxit Window and lesser space to the IVONA Reader window. Any utilities which would facilitate this? Any registry hack?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to resize my Google Chrome window and even it seems to have this "minimum width" restriction....which is similar to that for the Foxit Reader...</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to stop Windows 7 to automatically resize the window screens, I would suggest you to try the following steps and check if they are helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong><em>Ease</em></strong>, then click
<strong>Ease of Access Center</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Scroll down a bit and click <strong>Make the mouse easier to use</strong><em>.</em></p>
<p>3. Scroll down to and enable the last checkbox in that window: <strong>Prevent windows from being automatically arranged when moved to the edge of the screen</strong><em>.</em></p>
<p>4. Click <strong>OK </strong>and you're done!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we will be glad to assist you.</p>

            <p>Hello Karkanwar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I never had any problem with Windows arranging my windows when they are moved to the edge of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, I want to resize the windows of the respective applications I run. It is while re-sizing these application windows such as that of Google Chrome, Foxit Reader, IVONA Reader, Microsoft Word etc that I want to reduce their size as per my wish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not able to reduce the width of these application windows beyond a point....it's about 1/3rd of my screen width beyond which I can't reduce their width...in pixels, that would be about 455 or 456 pixels (because my screen resolution is set to 1366x768).
 I want to reduce their width even below this many pixles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, I did try your suggestion to tick the "<strong>Prevent windows from being automatically arranged when moved to the edge of the screen</strong>". While it did disable the Windows OS functionality to arrange my application windows when
 I moved them to the edge of the screen, but even so, it didn't help me reduce their width to less than 1/3rd of my screen size.</p>

</p><p>As I said above, the issue isn't specific to any program. This is replicated across all programs...irrespective of whether it was authored by Microsot (such as Powerpoint, Word etc) or, by other vendors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps diagnose the issue further.</p>
        </p>

            <p>&nbsp;Then you're asking in the wrong place.&nbsp; This is a user forum where users help users. If you had Windows preloaded on your computer, it's not the responsibility of MS to help you, but your computer manufacturer's because you have the OEM version of Windows.
 I see from your OP that you do indeed have the OEM version of Windows.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't like it here, nobody's forcing you to stay. Don't let the door hit you on the way out!

            <p>Ranting will do nothing except raise your blood-pressure.</p>
<p>The fix I proposed has worked for hundreds of other posters - and failed for a couple&nbsp;of dozen.</p>
<p>(and MS Support still cannot fix this error in one-one sessions even now)</p>

<h2>            windows 10 installation stuck at &#34;Hello there&#34;-screen. Mouse and keyboard not working.</h2>
                    <p>I tried to install windows 10 from USB last night. However in the morning there was only a black screen with a cursor. Having tried a lot of different solutions from this site which didn't work for me, I decided to reset it. I chose to do the full reset,
 instead of the one letting me keep my files. Afterwards, it asked me if i wanted to delete my TPM (trusted platform module) to which I said yes (after some googling).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then, when re-installing windows 10, my mouse and keyboard don't work in the screen that says: "Hello there. Let's get a few basic things out of the way". I think I deleted all my drivers as well. Does someone know how to get around this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: Asus X205TA EeeBook. 32-bit Windows 10 (but not yet)&nbsp;</p>

<h3> w_c  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade from Vista Home Premium to Vista Ultimate on a 64 bit system</h2>
                    I upgraded a brand new Sony Vaio laptop with Home Premium on it to Ultimate.&nbsp; Since the upgrade, the system will not show when an external HDD is connected.&nbsp; I checked the compatibility list to ensure the drive was indeed compatible and found it was.&nbsp;
 Also when memory cards are inserted to the SD and Pro slots in the front of the computer, the system again does not display the memory cards/sticks as being connected to the system.&nbsp; I do have an external floppy drive that is displayed in the my computer screen
 when it is connected to the computer unlike the aforementioned drives/media.&nbsp; It is also named by letter as drives that are attached by usb or otherwise normally are.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me why the external hard drives and memory sticks do not display under the
 my computer screen so that they can be accessed so information can be taken off of or put on them.&nbsp; The ungrade install seemed to have gone smoothly as there was never an interruption or error givien during the process.<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate any assistance/advice that anyone may have as I have tried everything I know.
<br />
</p>

<p>Hi WC,</p>
<p>Did you check in the computer management &gt;&gt; Disk management whether the Disk drives are getting detected or not?? You can also try to opening the Device manager and uninstall the USB adapter and then restart the computer that will also resolve the issue

    <title>Graphics card can&#39;t be found after upgrading ram memory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tjkroll  say:</h3>
<h2>            Graphics card can&#39;t be found after upgrading ram memory</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded my graphics card a few days ago and then today I upgraded my ram memory from 3gb to 4gb by replacing two of the 512mb cards with 1gb cards. Since I did that, the aero theme went to basic, and in the device manager it says that it has stopped
 the device because it has reported problems. I tried uninstalling the driver a bunch of times, upgrading the driver, looking in the bios to check for any settings that need to be changed, sfc scan in the registry, and a bunch of other methods of trying to
 get it back and running. If someone could give me advice of what to do next that would be great.</p>

            My computer is a hp a1226n. There were errors from both the onboard and pci-e graphics card saying that there is no graphics card connected. The message from the nvidia pcie gcu said, "No Nvidia card connected." so I can't even pull up the settings. And
 yes I have downloaded and uninstalled the software like 10 times. I tried the regedit for both control set 1&amp;2 and still same thing. I tried just putting in the original ram and same thing. This all started when I added two gbs or ram to replace the remaining
 original ram to boost the ram to a maximum of 4gb. Is there anything else in the registry I can do to fix this. I've done a lot with ram in the past so don't worry about me not knowing about what to do.

            Disable onboard video in bios and set default adapter or primary adapter to be PCI-e.<br />
<br />
Don't change TDR values. They are set as they are for a reason by MS. Anything other than that breaks how it is meant to be proper and breaks certification. (Just not how to fix these types of things. :) )<br />
<br />
We'll fix this the right way if the bios changes did not help you.<br />
<br />
Which card and is this 32 or 64 bit?<br />

            I already changed the bios to PCI-E. Then should I delete that TDR key? Plus its doing the samething with the onboard video card too. The thing that gets me is how there is even a screen being produced by the graphics card while the computer doesn't even
 recognize it.

Right click Basic Display Adapter in Device Manager. Choose Properties | Details tab. Change the dropdown arrow to say Hardware ids. Copy/paste results to here.
<br />

Ctrl+a = selects all<br />
Ctrl+c = copy<br />
Ctrl+v = paste<br />
<br />
Don't forget to tell me 32 or 64 bit. <br />
<br />
Hit Windows key + Pause|Break key if you don't know.<br />
<br />
Yes, reset TDR to original setting.<br />

            I tried that but it says&nbsp;the video card&nbsp;doesn't support the graphics which is b.s. because it worked fine before I added the ram memory but afterwards is when it started to act up. I think it has nothing to do with drivers, or any installation. But I think
 it needs some reg values reseted and because I tried even to install a sound card and it couldn't complete the installation for some reason. And if its both the onboard graphics and the adapter, then its obviously got to be something with the system and restarting
 something.

</p><p>The version of Minecraft that you are playing (1.7.0.9) is a Beta version.&nbsp; Did you, or someone on your console sign up for the Minecraft Beta, as part of the Xbox Insiders program?&nbsp; Version 1.6.1 is the current retail release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to go back to 1.6.1 you will have to leave the Beta program, and then uninstall, and re-install Minecraft once you are out of the Beta.&nbsp; See the guide and FAQ here:&nbsp;<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2018/07/09/minecraft-beta-guide-and-faqs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2018/07/09/minecraft-beta-guide-and-faqs/</a></p>

            <p>Dear Support "Engineer".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your copy / pasted canned reply.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To answer your prepared questions:</p>
<p>1. Doesn't help</p>
<p>2. I always have the latest drivers installed (as clearly stated in the original post). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Your suggestions didn't help.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hit me with something better, Please.</p>
<p>I don't care so much about #1, but #2 is really annyoing.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm sorry to confuse you by adding some additional info: </p>
<p>It behaves the same way on Windows 8.1 RTM, and on 4 separate PC's.&nbsp;</p>

            Few days ago was so fed up with this I-scroll-when-I-want-mouse... throw it against the wall. And yes, as with most mice.. it died instantly.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Now using an older Logitech mouse and &nbsp;the Logitech touch pad. And believe it or not... it works much better as that MS rubbish.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>As a developer I sometimes have to run programs like Visual Studio in elevated security mode. The MS touch mouse, albeit MS WHQL certified, does not support scrolling (neither gestures) in elevated mode. Something that is a requirement for WHQL... I believe
 this flaw entitles us to return the mouse as it does not operate according to specifications.</div>
<div>This software flaw is easy to fix (I know how), but MS has not responded to my offer to help.</div>

            <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have an issue with the Microsoft Touch Mouse . It seems it is useless and annoying because you can't work with it all all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mouse keeps scrolling accidentally and you can't keep your fingers on it. The issue gets even worse when used in applications such as Photoshop as it's messing up my entire work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all the drivers up to date and I'm using Windows 8.1. The touch surface was badly designed I'm afraid. It just doesn't work and instead of being a nice product it's an expensive piece of junk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume I cannot disable the touch to at least use it ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Luca</p>

            <p>The reply really was canned... but I did check out the "Mouse/Keyboard not responding" article in the link he provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I had to do with my touch mouse was to turn it off and turn it on. Microsoft calls is "Resyncing".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a Mac with magic mouse and it has worked flawlessly. But its bluetooth.(though both are RF devices)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a phone nearby and a wireless router nearby so I am guess once the computer goes to sleep, the other wireless devices hog the frequency of the mouse/IR reciever. So turning it on and off opens back the wireless frequency again. Just a guess.</p>

<h2>            Kinect controlled smart home</h2>
                    Who else would like to see kinect controlled smart products? Such as dimmable light bulbs,power outlets, &nbsp;door locks,and so on. &nbsp;Idk about you but I don't know how many times I have sat down to watch the tv,with the wife, just to have to get back up and
 turn off the lights. Wishing I could just use my kinect to do it. I think selling &nbsp;a kinect smarthome bundle ($150 for the kinect, a light bulb, and an outlet) would help boost kinect sales and make it relevant again.&nbsp;

<h2>            After Win10 update today PC will not boot - circle just spins</h2>
                    <p>I'm on an Acer with win10 that I upgraded via Microsoft's free offer over a year ago with &nbsp;no issues &nbsp;until today's update. Now I get the 4 blue squares logo with the rotating cog spinning bottom center. Then the logo goes &nbsp;away but the cog remains - forever.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've restarted MANY times with the &nbsp;same results. The F12 key and ENTER key do nothing when shown those options &nbsp;when the big "e" come on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I restart pressing the "C" key, I get a blue screen with many options to fix it but it keeps asking for &nbsp;a password and I don't use a text password, I use an image password. I've even tried using no password and that doesn't work so I can't go back to
 the prior to version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the last restart using the "C" key I got a message on black sscreen (not a &nbsp; pop-up mssg ) that it was preparing to fix the problem when &nbsp;I OK'd that it began a percentage countdown. I left &amp; came back about 15 min later &amp; it's back to the black screen
 &amp; spinning cog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I &nbsp;get my computer back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've been playing " Mahjong Trails" and in # 3 position. Played it last night and I just tried a few moments ago and I can get in. Can you tell why?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been having trouble ever since Facebook said that someone tried to get into my accouant and they had me off facebook about 3 days. Could that have something to do with this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to you solving this problem, because I REALLY do like that game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for taking care of this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hope i did not break any rules. and i hope i chose the right forum because i have NEVER done this before.</p>

            <p>Hi Shirley,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not an issue with MSE.&nbsp; You need to deal with Facebook on this (as hard as I know that is to do).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's an excellent chance that whatever happened to your account either interfered with your game or was not totally fixed or there's something else wrong with your account or perhaps the game.&nbsp; Your best bet is to start here:
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/mahjongtrails#!/help/?topic=applications_and_websites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.facebook.com/mahjongtrails#!/help/?topic=applications_and_websites</a>&nbsp;and see if you can get any help with the game from either the pre-set answers&nbsp;or by searching.&nbsp; Next would be to try General Help:
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/?topic=applications_and_websites#!/help/?tab=discussion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.facebook.com/help/?topic=applications_and_websites#!/help/?tab=discussion</a>&nbsp;where you can post questions concerning your problem.&nbsp; If possible, I might&nbsp;try to uninstall and re-install the game (even if that causes you to lose your points or your
 ranking) - or you can seek assistance from them first as they may be able to help.&nbsp; Or open a new facebook account in the meantime and see if you can download and play the game on that account.&nbsp; Then not only will you be able to play, but you'll know for sure
 it's not a problem with your computer, the game, your browser, or malware.&nbsp; You can pretty much then nail it down to a problem with the other account or the installation of the game on that account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is almost certainly a problem with Facebook and not with your computer, malware, or your browser.&nbsp; You need to deal with them about it.&nbsp; If you have better technical support contact information due to your recent problems, by all means try that to re-open
 the case or get help as direct contact is all but impossible there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sorry we can't help more, but it really is a Facebook issue and you need to deal with them to resolve it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Internet speed is very slow when browsing in Internet explorer and Firefox</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my HP Dv7 laptop from Win 7 to Win 8 Pro. I am experiencing the same slow browsing issues in IE and Firefox. I have removed all add-ons. Speedtest reveals I"m getting 24MB down, which is what I'm paying for. I have reset the router.
 Is this slow-browsing issue being addressed in the upcoming Win 8 updates? When can we expect to see it in the release notes?&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for choosing Windows 8 and for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have mentioned that the Internet is very slow in both Internet explorer and Firefox after upgrading to Windows 8. I can understand that you are having a hard time with this issue. We’ll help you with this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a few questions first, to get a clear picture of the issue;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>When did this issue start? Did you make any recent changes to the computer before this issue started?</p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Have you installed any third party antivirus?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue could be caused due to many reasons like an incorrect internet settings, outdated network driver or due to an antivirus\firewall. I would suggest you to try these steps and check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I would suggest you to check and try the steps mentioned in this link:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/network-connection-problem-help#network-problems=windows-8&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/network-connection-problem-help#network-problems=windows-8&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Internet explorer performance troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the built-in Internet explorer performance troubleshooter and check. This troubleshooter automatically detects and fixes issues with Internet explorer. Refer this steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press Windows key +X, select Control panel</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on troubleshooting and click on the view all option on the left panel</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Run the Internet Explorer performance troubleshooter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:<span>&nbsp; </span>Disable proxy</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have setup any proxy connection, disable the proxy and then check. Refer these steps to disable proxy:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click the Gear box at the top right corner in internet explorer.</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click the Tools button, and then click Internet Options.</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click the Connections tab, and then click LAN settings.</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>Uncheck the option “Use a Proxy Server for your LAN”.</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click Apply and Ok to cave changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 4: Disable Antivirus</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have installed any third party antivirus or firewall software, I would suggest you to temporarily disable and check.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 5: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Safe mode</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Safe mode starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible causes. Refer this link to start the
 computer in Safe mode:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Clean boot</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don’t face this issue in safe mode, then we will have to perform a clean boot procedure to find out which service is causing this issue. Refer this link to perform a clean boot:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> After troubleshooting, reset the computer to start as usual. Refer step 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we’d be happy to help.</p>

<div>Hi munkiechk101,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
a. What is the file extension or file type of the contents in the DVD?<br />
b. Do you get any error message while playing the DVD?<br />
c. Are you&nbsp; able to play the other DVD's apart from this one?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Yes, but you might need to install a program called a DVD decoder (which is sometimes also referred to as an MPEG decoder). Many DVD drives come with DVD decoder software, so check the installation disc.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A DVD decoder is another name for an MPEG-2 decoder. The content on DVD-Video discs is encoded in the MPEG-2 format, as is the content in DVR-MS files (Microsoft Recorded TV Shows) and some AVI files. To play these items in the Player, you need a compatible
 DVD decoder installed on your computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If your computer has a DVD drive, it probably already has a DVD decoder installed on it. However, if you encounter an error message that indicates that you are missing a compatible DVD decoder, click the Web Help button on the error message dialog box
 to determine how to obtain one.</div>

            Yes, you need to install all the drivers, connect the computer to the internet and activate your System.
<div><br />
<div>It can be done either via CD supplied with the computer.</div>
<div>if you do not have it you should be able to download all the drivers from manufacturer's website such as Dell, HP etc,</div>

<p>You can retrieve that date using the following tool I made.&nbsp; It pulls this information from your local history from Skype Classic (7.x and earlier).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.pcdust.com/Downloads/RegDate/RegDate.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">RegDate (.NET 2.0 version) [pcdust.com]</span></a></p>
<p>If you get a complaint about needing Framework 3.5 (and do not want to install it), run the below instead:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pcdust.com/Downloads/RegDate/RegDatea.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">RegDate (.NET 4.0 version) [pcdust.com]&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If no local history is detected, the window will be blank. If you have a backup copy of a main.db file, you can place it in the same folder as RegDate and press Retrieve date to extract the account creation date from that file. Simply do not select a name
 from the list, if present.</p>

... and the e-mail address quoted, above, has been out-of-service for several years.&nbsp; Skype no longer maintains a general or central e-mail address.<br />
