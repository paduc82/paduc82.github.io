Many of these devices such as HP Stream came in a variety of colors with a full copy of Windows 8.1. Attractive qualities include an affordable price and a 11 or 13 inch display. Along with the HP Stream were a variety of 8 inch Tablet devices such as such as the Dell Venue Pro. With the introduction of Windows 10, migrating these devices to Windows 10 might prove difficult because of their low storage capacity, but it is possible to do so. One of the limitations of introductory devices such as the HP Stream or Dell Venue Pro, they come with limited amounts of disk space, sometimes 32 or 16 GB configurations. This makes it difficult to install Windows 10 the conventional way.

    <title>Game Art missing for some games in the My Games section of XBox 360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> entexman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Game Art missing for some games in the My Games section of XBox 360</h2>
                    
<p>Game art for some games does not show the proper image in the My Games list on the XBox 360 and the "recent games" tile on the Home screen. This is a recurring issue of XBox Live that needs to get investigated on the server end and fixed there since the
 problem comes and goes regardless of changes made on the XBox 360 by end users. This issue has popped up quite a bit the last few months. &nbsp;Clearing the cache multiple times does not fix this issue. &nbsp;Nor does checking router settings, etc...This issue seems
 related with dashboard updates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have tried contacting tech support on the forums here, via the XBox support Twitter feed, and online chat. None of these outlets have ever fixed this issue. After time (sometimes weeks) the issue fixes itself. It would be much better to address the symptoms
 and make it so that game art images are always stored on the XBox 360 so the images will always show up regardless of the state of XBox Live. &nbsp;Can someone on these forums help with this or is there a better way to get the right people to look into this problem?
 It is getting really old having the same conversation every month with no resolution.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Bluetooth driver removed from Device Manager after a single restart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greyfield  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth driver removed from Device Manager after a single restart</h2>
                    <p><strong>General info:</strong><br />
OS: Windows 10 Pro<br />
Motherboard: Asus Z87-Pro<br />
Bluetooth Driver: Broadcom BCM20702&nbsp;<br />
Bluetooth adapter: Plugable Bluetooth 4.0/USB 2.0&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>
<p>I am trying to make use of a USB bluetooth adapter, but the driver I installed seems to completely disappear from Device Manager after restarting Windows.</p>
<p><br />
After selecting View&gt;Show hidden devices, a list of bluetooth entries is displayed, but only listing greyed out versions of Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator/LE Enumerator as well as a secondary "Bluetooth Virtual Devices" list that I'm unfamiliar with - also
 greyed out.&nbsp; I have no idea where the driver could have gone, and I'm assuming Windows removed this driver for some reason.&nbsp; I'm wondering why this happens, and if it's possible to stop it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screenshots:<br />
1.&nbsp;<a href="https://i.imgur.com/YKN6Sl1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">After driver installation</a><br />
2.&nbsp;<a href="https://i.imgur.com/u85VVva.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">After driver installation with "Show hidden devices" enabled</a><br />
3.&nbsp;<a href="https://i.imgur.com/a1VScWM.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">After a single restart</a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Extra info:</strong></p>
<p>-I want to clarify that the Asus Z87-Pro comes with an onboard bluetooth/wifi combination adapter (Qualcomm Atheros AR9462), which has been practically useless to me and caused this Plugable dongle to become my last resort for bluetooth capability.&nbsp; I've
 disabled both the bluetooth and wifi controllers in BIOS, and none of that caused an issue with the adapter, bluetooth devices, or driver working properly
<em>before</em> a restart.&nbsp; But I do want to include this info just in case this onboard adapter, even though having its bluetooth/wifi controllers disabled in BIOS, could somehow cause this removal of the Plugable adapter's Broadcom driver after restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-I've tried installing the driver with administrator privileges both on and off, with the same results after restart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-In regards to the possibility of Windows Update fiddling with the OS in the background, I've also tried using the "Show or hide updates" troubleshooter package (found at the bottom of&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3073930/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-driver-update-from-reinstalling-in-window" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this
 link</a>), the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/MHcyM3j.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Pause Updates</a> selection under advanced options, disabling my network adapter to prevent any connection to the internet, and all combinations of these three actions.&nbsp; Not sure if that would've helped at all, but some searches on Google seemed to point to
 Windows Update having a little too much freedom in the background with this latest version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any other info or screenshots are needed, just let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

</p><p>My Dell XPS 13 will not start up in safe mode. &nbsp;I've tried pressing and holding F8 multiple times during start-up, a funny sound will be made, but attempt is unsuccessful each time. &nbsp;I've gone into boot options (F12), but no where does the safe mode option

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that you are able to boot into Safe Mode now by pressing <strong>Ctrl Key</strong>. Ideally, you should be able to boot into Safe Mode&nbsp;in Windows 7 by tapping
<strong>F8 key</strong> at computer startup. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The setting to boot the computer in Safe Mode is set in computer BIOS (Basic Input Output System). You might want to get in touch with&nbsp;computer manufacturer to check the setting in BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do feel free to post on Microsoft Community in case you have any issues/queries while working on Windows.</p>

<h3> csmakaza  say:</h3>
<h2>            CTL3D32.DLL ERROR WHEN INSTALLING DDDL 6.48 ON WINDOWS 7 ULTIMATE</h2>
                    I am trying to install Detroit Diesel dddl 6.48 program on windows 7 ultimate, but it is giving me this error:<br />
<br />
<br />
The file "C:\Windows\System32\ctl3d32.dll" could not be opened.<br />
Please check that your disk is not full and that you have access<br />
to the destination directory.<br />
<br />
The Error occurs at the 78% mark of installation progress when detroit is trying to register the program as shown below.<br />
<br />
Program files\Detroit Diesel\Diagnostic\RegPerm.exe<br />
<br />
This program comes bundled with dddl 7.09 which installs smoothly, but Nexiq says the dddl 6.48 program is also windows 7 compatible, I have tried to change the security settings on ctl3d32.dll to give myself all permissions to it (thanks to Mr Bounty posting),
 but when i try to apply the permissions it says "access denied" How do i get around this problem?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance guys<br />

</p><p>Since the win10 upgrade I experience the embedded&nbsp;video playback issue with Edge, IE 11 and Chrome, however Firefox is not affected.</p>

</p><p>Yes, Adobe flash player is turned on in the settings of Edge.</p>

</p><p>The non playing of embedded video content is most disappointing and if you cant help me resolve this issue I will have no choice but to revert to win 8.1</p>

            Issue still persists, and there were no updates from MS to rectify that. Kinda disappointing. I mean it's not a game breaker for me, but is extremely annoying. And yes everything is updated and flash is turned on. Also, I don't want to use firefox anymore,
 and even much less chrome (as I hate that browser, it's super "flat").<br />
Another issue is gpu drivers just randomly crashing when trying to view embedded videos, sometimes it crashes for no apparent reason. Yes I have the latest drivers installed, so it's not that.

            <p>I write support articles for our website and have the same issue with edge&nbsp;but also with IE11.</p>
<p>Any videos that where "&lt;embed src=" wont work. I've had to change all our video support articles to "&lt;iframe src="</p>
<p>and they're all working ok now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to get it working in IE11 only by adding the site to the compatibility view list. This isn't possible in Edge.</p>
<p>I'm guessing some of the standards haven't been implemented correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand this is an issue with more than just embedded videos but also pdf's, players etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps and perhaps Microsoft can find out what's different.</p>

            Hi minek140,
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, you cannot currently set a custom ringtone on the updated Skype. I would highly suggest that you bring this feature up to the Developers at UserVoice, so that they can work on it as soon as they can:-

<p>Нет проблем! Берешь барабан и дуделку, и пляшешь вприсядку вокруг консоли 15 кругов вправо и 16 влево. На последнем круге поворачиваешься строго на северо-запад, читаешь наизусть "отче наш...". Затем на садишься на 13 маршрут автобуса, отъезжаешь четыре
 остановки (самое главное: не считается остановка, на который ты сел ЭТО ОЧЕНЬ ВАЖНО!!!!!!!), выходишь и отправляешь СМС "Рокстар козлы" на номер 0446. 100% работает!!!</p>

                    For the past three weeks or so, my printer has been reporting a "Paper Jam". For the life of me, I can find no jammed paper anywhere, and restarting the printer makes no difference. Is thisd a software error? Does anyone have any suggestions?

<h2>            Strange outgoing number dispays</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an subscription for unlimited calls to the Netherlands and currently working in Spain for a few months. Also I have an Dutch number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is outgoing calls. Sometimes the outgoing number is unknown and sometimes the number is lik +49 ******** (A number from Germany).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't make an connection for outgoing calls with my Dutch number hosted by Skype. When I try I get an internal error without extra information what is wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love to make outgoing calls with my dutch +31&nbsp;******** number. If for some reason that doesn't work than I would like to call only unknown. Thats wat better then sometimes a german number or the other time a&nbsp;***** number for example. It s*** like
 this..</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help me.</p>

SietseMoes,</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you set up your Caller ID? Is the issue only happening when calling a specific person on Skype? If you have set up your Caller ID and it doesn't work, it might be because it’s not available in your country or it’s not currently supported by the local
 telecommunication provider for the country you’re calling.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Julie_S1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your respons. As I said, the number is from Holland and currently I am in Spain. Both Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setting up a Caller ID didn't work indeed. That would be nice but that is not possible so that's why I want to call unknown. That is at least better than strange numbers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had it with several people and numbers, it seems not to have a logic in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you have another advice for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>

<div>I cannot seem to figure out why this happened. The day before i was using this online game, before it went into&nbsp;maintenance. I tried to get on again after the game maintenance was over, but i got this error.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
</span><span>For those who need more info. This game is called Alicia Online this game also requires you to login on the website page and then click on a "start" button to launch the game. The updates don't seem to be the problem, this is because i have played
 this game during it' beta stages, and it has updated a lot since then, but still worked. Until October 20, 2011. The game had another&nbsp;normal update and i tried to get on the next day, but it would not let me. It&nbsp;contiguously&nbsp;&nbsp;told me the app had crashed, and
 i could not find the source as to why. I did download two things but this was before the update, and even then it still worked. The recent downloads were:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Wolfquest 2,5: Which i know is safe and i have used it&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;times before, it was even created for kids, by the&nbsp;Minnesota Zoo.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Gygan: Now i've never downloaded this before but i had this even when i was playing Alicia and was using it at the same time. It's a simple move downloader, it's free for one movie then you must pay.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now i found something odd about this whole thing. I am using an HP Window's 7 Home Premium laptop brand new and i have been able to play this game since i got it up until this date. Well i also have a ACER Window's Vista Home Premium laptop, that is a
 good 6 to 7 years old. But i tried to play the game on there yesterday and it worked perfectly fine, with the exception of slow down. What i don't understand is why all of a sudden that a brand new laptop would not work with the game when a much older laptop
 could.</div>

            I have checked and scanned my system for any issues, but nothing comes up. And i have updated everything that i needed updating but nothing has worked. I have though seen that for some reason the web page is crashing without me knowing and that the launcher
 is not updating files like it should. I have re installed the launcher multiple times, what i would like to know is why the webpage is crashing. I also have my internet explore updated to the most recent update.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>But i don't understand why this computer would need to be updated when my older computer hasn't had an update for a few years now.</div>

    <title>Win 7, 32 or 64 bit to see Xeon hyperthreading CPUs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tigervideo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7, 32 or 64 bit to see Xeon hyperthreading CPUs</h2>
                    
<p>I have tried 7 in both 32 bit and 64 bit with no luck getting my Xeon Hyper threading processors to show or work.&nbsp; In 32 bit hardware only sees 2 processors, while in 64 bit hardware shows 4 processors.&nbsp; However, in 64 bit the Task Manager-Performance Monitor
 only show 2 processors working.&nbsp; In XP all of my processor worked and it showed up in the Performance Monitor.</p>
<p>Is there hope to get 4 working?&nbsp; Do I need a different version of 7 to see my old processors?&nbsp; I have searched Microsoft and many other Internet sites with no answers the seem to be based in fact.</p>
<p>Hope someone can help.</p>

there are weird work arounds like Disconnecting then reconnect the Internet connection, then it will proceed.. You may want to try it,&nbsp;<br />

<p>Stood up two server 2016 VMs from a sysprepped image. Was updating both at the same time. Both installed, rebooted, and crashed in the exact same point. After come back up, both show this update at 100% downloaded but won't do anything else.</p>

            Hi Eymard,<br />
<br />
<br />
Since you've mentioned that there is a problem with the <strong>Microsoft Update Catalog</strong> website, can you share us your experience with it?<br />
<br />
If you weren't able to download the <strong>KB4019472</strong> update like <strong>
Jean</strong>, you can check this <strong><a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=kb4019472" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Update Catalog link</a></strong> to be able to manually install the said update.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you still can't access the link for the <strong>Microsoft Update Catalog</strong>.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it does the reloading animation after you spawn because you hit the reload button as you got killed or just after. At least that's when it does it to me. This is just basically what I've concluded after it did it to me a few times so my answer really
 holds no credibility, lol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the orginal question, I think I have had that happen to me, where I pull the trigger and the gun acts like it's shooting but nothing happens. It's only happened like once or twice and not recently so I just figured it was lag or something.</p>

<p>@Xurts Yeah pressing x at a certain point could be it, I'll usually press it 2-3 times if I need to get back to a flag.
</p>
<p>You could be right about the the lag too come to think of it. I've not had the Model not shoot for me but I have shot and had no pump action animation. At the time this was due to lag.</p>

<h2>            Old Program Won&#39;t Run on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>So basically, I downloaded this old file from 2004.&nbsp; Long story short, it's in Japanese, so I can't easily locate any additional information on it.&nbsp; There was download information on the web page I got it from, but putting it in Google Translate only turned
 up semi-useful results.&nbsp; The file that I downloaded was an application called "maho_Start02", an when I run it, it creates another application called "Start".&nbsp; When I then run the "Start" application, I get an error message looking something like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb8e66db-e27e-4de6-9c01-da9f3af07f11?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cb8e66db-e27e-4de6-9c01-da9f3af07f11?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I have no idea how to proceed from here, because I know that this isn't an actual language, and I don't know if that's an error within an error or something.&nbsp; I tried running it in compatibility mode for Windows XP (Which should have been the Windows it
 was built for).&nbsp; I don't know if maybe I should take it a step further and set up a VM for XP to run it? Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

            Hi Reilly
<br />
<br />Sometimes, programs are just too old run on modern versions; especially if you are running a 64 bit version of Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Your suggestion of installing in a virtual machine under a compatible version of Windows, such as Windows XP sounds like the best idea.
<br />
<br />Here are steps how to do that:
<br />

            So, after struggling to get the VM to work in the first place, I managed to get the file onto it.&nbsp; However, it still doesn't work.&nbsp; Same error message and everything.

            I installed Windows XP on the VM which would probably have been what it was designed for, since that was the most recent version of windows in 2004.

<br />Are you sure it doesn't require a Japanese version of Windows XP installed?

            I'm not sure, but I also don't know where I would find such a thing.&nbsp; I believe the VM installed a Japanese language pack, though.&nbsp; I believe since I got the same error both times, it's probably not a compatibility issue.&nbsp; So that would seem to be a better
 option, but I would think Windows 10 would have solved an issue like that by now.

            Windows 10 is constantly changing and being optimized for a new generation of applications, either UWP (Universal apps) first introduced with Windows 8 in 2012 and another generation of apps called 'PWA's' - progressive web apps. Also, more modern application development tools like electron are becoming a higher priority for Windows application development. 
<br />
<br />WIN32 is considered legacy, not to mention and application like yours likely has some WIN16 legacy in it which is considered ancient.
<br />
<br />That said, the VM really should have been an ideal solution for this.

<h2>            windows 8 windows media player wont play audio .mp3 files</h2>
                    I have windows 8 and whatever version of wmplayer that comes with it. &nbsp; I have a marketing telephone number that when voicemails are left I am notified via email, click on link and it opens wmplayer to play the audio file- saved in .mp3 format.&nbsp; This is
 not something that I can alter at all. I pay 50 month for this service and no longer can get the messages due to the player being unable to play. &nbsp;&nbsp; I tried downloading a codex package from microsoft sight had an enormous amount of problems with computer shortly
 after and had to restore the computer to the previous restore point to resolve. &nbsp; I just want to hear my messages - I am a computer user not a tech, so if anyone can help I would be very greatful...<br />

<p>You can set the WMP as the default program for running the MP3 files and check if that helps.</p>
