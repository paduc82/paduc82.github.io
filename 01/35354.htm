<h2>            Using Administrator Status To Install A Program In Win10</h2>
                    <p>I built a new pc and installed Win 10. Everything is working ok except for being able to install one app. When I try I get the message "This App Has Been Blocked For Your Protection. An Administrator Has Blocked You From Running This App Etc". I am the administrator
 but it still won't let me install it. I sign in as the administrator and get the administrator screen and I can install it. The problem is that that app is only on the administrator screen. When I sign on the regular users screen there is no icon for the app
 on that screen. I don't want to be able to use it only on the administrators sign in. How can I do this? Your help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS- I have used the app before so I know its safe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PPS- Also, the message says an administrator has blocked etc. I am the only administrator on this machine so how did it get blocked.</p>

            <p>Hi DJ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To troubleshoot the issue, let’s enable the hidden built-in Administrator account on your Windows 10 PC. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>net user administrator /active:yes</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>. You should see the message
<strong>The command completed successfully</strong>.</li><li>Launch <strong>Start</strong>, click the user account tile on the top left of the screen and choose
<strong>Administrator</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Sign in</strong>.</li><li>Locate the software or .exe file that you want to install.</li><li>After you have installed the application, log out of the Admin account and log back in to your regular account.</li><li>Disable the Administrator account to prevent malicious access to your system files. Open Command Prompt, type
<strong>net user administrator /active:no</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

                    <p>My Surface Pro 4 is out of Warranty &amp; I asked MS to replace it because the battery was dead! I have had an MS account for years! I live in Dublin Irland.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They sent me a UPS label to send it in to MS for the replacement. It was sent to Germany!</p>
<p>2 Weeks it came back, hurray! Great Service! opened it &amp; there was sheet of paper printed on both sides in German, however there was a paragraph in English that said it said "The item is being returned because the serial numbers do not match the serial number
 on the repair order!</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS handled the whole process &amp; charged my MS account $450.00. I don't know where MS got the serial number, There is one on the kickstand on my Surface. Where MS got the serial number they is a mystery! It is listed on my MS account but does not give a serial
 number!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't deal with the replacement company because it is all in German!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep trying to contact MS, but all I get is a VERTUAL Agent!</p>
<p>All they say is "READ THE WARRENTY" attached!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I requested a phone call from them, but they would not use the phone number I sent, tried to use both Mobile &amp; LL, no call!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here it is 2 weeks, daily trying to get this sorted out with MS &amp; all I get is a "VIRTUAL AGENT" the keeps giving me the same nonsense &amp; they did not phne me when I said "YES" to a phone!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 freezes on load screen but Windows 7 boots - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 freezes on load screen but Windows 7 boots</h2>
                    <p>So I'm pretty stumped and am looking for a hand troubleshooting. My computer ran Win10 fine before and recently stopped booting. It will either:&nbsp; freeze on the load screen, sit loading forever and get DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION or freeze on the load screen getting
 into automatic repair. I've tried older versions of Windows with no success. However, Win7 loads on the computer perfectly fine. I've swapped out hard-drives and RAM and even put the Hard-Drive in an identical computer where it ran fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could possible issues be/ what steps should I do to troubleshoot? Even if it is a hardware issue I would like to narrow the issue down. I appreciate any and all help.&nbsp;</p>

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to Go back to the previous Build, if it was an upgrade to 1809 - 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Go back to the previous Build
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. I would be happy to work with you to take you though this problem.

            Hi Tyler,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

<p>When trying to boot into Safe Mode it also crashed on the load screen with the Win10 logo that says Advanced Recovery. I've also tried booting Win10 from USB also with no success. I've also Tried booting to 3 previous versions of Win10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that it could very well be a hardware issue that for some reason prevents Win10 from loading but doesn't affect Win7? But what hardware issue would cause Win10 from loading but not Win7?</p>

            I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

            I've done a clean install a few times but still run into the same issue. Is there some kind of hardware fault that would allow Win7 to run but not Win10?

            Can you check if you have dump files?
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use a program like TCP Viewer or Cports to watch for incoming connections and what them connections are accessing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have a firewall? Do you have anti-virus?</p>

            Most free antivirus programs expire at some point.&nbsp; You can just get another free trial but try to uninstall the expired one.&nbsp; Norton is hard to uninstall because a lot of their programs are named "Symantec"

            Hello! I am an Independent Advisor, I would love to help you out!
<br />
<br />Do you have your CPU overclocked? If so the overclock could be somewhat unstable. Which would make even more sense of why you seem to primarily see the issue once it is under load. 
<br />
<br />If there is an overclock I would suggest to tune the overclock down. Or to completely disable the overclock at least long enough to test if this issue exists when there is no overclock.

<p>is not overclock, it's left on the car (it keeps it in 4.2) always tried and standard at 4.0, even trying to lower its power to 3.9.3.8 the same way</p>
<p>and when it hangs in and resets or hand it to me, it has a strange sound<br />

            And you said this is a custom water loop correct? Are you sure that nothing is clogged/corroded?
<br />
<br />Are you completely confident that water is flowing completely at a good rate?
<br />
<br />That sounds a lot like the pump is struggling a lot.

            There are a couple things you could try. 
<br />
<br />You could reset your BIOS to factory (there is a slight risk in this, that it won't recognize your drive as a boot drive anymore). 
<br />
<br />So before doing that I would recommend re-installing your graphics drivers. 
<br />
<br />I also asked about the CPU being overclocked. But just to make sure. The GPU is not overclocked or any of the settings changed either? What temperature does the GPU get to when this happens?
<br />
<br />Is your GPU water cooled as well?

            Did you build the computer yourself? Is there thermal paste/compound between the water block and the CPU? No thermal paste being there could cause the issue we are seeing. 
<br />
<br />The other possibility is that the water block is not tightened enough to be making contact with the CPU/thermal paste. But make sure to not overtighten, just get it a bit snug.

<p>
Is it really possible that a stalled firmware update will make the dock totally unusable which will result in a huge effort to be replaced via a support ticket. You are not serious, or? I already wasted 4 hours reseeting my SP4 and updateing everything possible
 but the dock will not be recognized anymore by ma SP4, allthough it worked like a charm before the latest upate :-(</p>

<h3> jollyfred57  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using files on external hard drive</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there, I have plugged in the (Toshiba SATA) hard drive from a (4 week old) Sony Vaio into another (same model) Sony Vaio (via enclosure/USB cable) and, whilst I can open and read files ok, and have been able to delete some of them, I can't save amendments
 to files (e.g. in Excel) and it won't let me delete system files.<br />
<br />
I have gone into Properties for the drive and changed it so that I have permission to modify all but 'special preferences' - and have tried doing the same in the Properties of individual files - but to no avail. When I try to save amendments to a file, it says
 that the file path doesn't exist (it does) or that the file is being used by another programme.<br />
<br />
I have tried saving under another file name but it won't let me do this either - says I have to contact the administrator.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming that, somehow, I need to get admin/access rights to the (now external) hard drive - but not been able to find out how to do this.<br />
<br />
Any advice gratefully received. Cheers, freddy.</p>

            This really does sound like a Permissions issue and instructions on how to correct this has already been given.<br />
Can you copy the data off of the External Drive and Format that Drive?&nbsp; That should clear up any "Permissions" issue.<br />

<p>Do you have another hard disk you could try? Its possible the Windows 7 install media is defective, is it a digital download or store bought? If its a digital download, try downloading it again and burn it at the lowest speed (although you have noted its
 OEM).</p>
<p>If you have any non-essential devices attached try disconnecting them they might be interfering with setup. You might also want to run a memory diagnostic test using memtest86+ to check if any of your memory modules are defective.</p>
<p>Also, shut down the computer, disconnect it, open the system unit, check if all components memory, video card, hard disk are all connected and secured properly.</p>
<p>Reconnect the computer, start it up again and boot from the disk.</p>

<h2>            Where can I find the actual location for the start up photos&#63;</h2>
                    When I start up my computer in Windows 10, there are several really nice photos.&nbsp; Where were these photos taken?&nbsp; Several of the locations look really nice and I would like to actually visit.&nbsp; Is there any way to find the tag or city/state where these
 pictures were taken?

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having the same issue. I was running windows 8 for several months before and no problem. It has been 2 days that I had to format my computer and reinstall windows 8.1 and it has ever since started to shut down every 1 hour, precisely. I have tried all
 that you suggested and on my System log I can see several errors prompted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what else to do and this is really annoying. Please advise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>

            This is the correct update. The display in WindowsUpdate only displays Important, but this is the correct fix. There is nothing to worry.

However, when I logged into my account yesterday, this option had reappeared. I have again requested the deposit, but would like to know why I've had to request this twice?</p><p><br /></p><p>2. On the 31st May, I redeemed 500 Gems on 2x 5,000 credits. It has now been over 96 hours, but they have still not shown up as pending.</p><p><br /></p><p>3. On the 1st June, I redeemed 1,000 Gems on a 3 Month Game Pass Subscription. However, when I tried to redeem the code, it's saying it's expired.</p><p><br /></p><p>4. On the 1st June, I tried to claim another 5,000 credit reward, but receved the message that I'd already claimed it twice this Month. Since June is a new month, shouldn't this limit have been reset?

            <p>Hello Wise Owl 2000,</p><p><br /></p><p>Since a new month has begun, the site was reset to a default state. Your previous request was still logged, and requesting again should have no affect on your previous request.</p><p>We see that those Credits are currently displayed on your MyStatement and have been pending since June 2nd.</p><p>Regarding your 3 month Game Pass code, we have been investigating this issue with another team, and they report that the tokens should now be fixed. Please attempt to redeem your current code again. If this process fails again,&nbsp;please let us know with another post as soon as possible so we can investigate to see if any errors remain.</p><p>The recent restocking was for June prizes. While you claimed it on on May 31st, they were listed as a part of June. Due to time zone differences, you may have seen the prizes before the exact start of June in your region.</p><p>We did a series of restocks over the last few months. Since the program is ending in your region,

            Hey there, AveiAcinbord 
<br />Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums. 
<br />
<br />Please can you go to the game, right click it and select uninstall. Then go back to the store App, and select Minecraft and install it again onto your computer/device. 
<br />
<br />This should hopefully resolve this problem for you. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps, 
<br />Regards,

<h2>            Sharing games with my nephew</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I hope this is the right forum, if not please redirect me.</p><p><br /></p><p>My nephew wants an xbox one to play games with all of his school friends. The plan is for him to have my xbox when I upgrade and get a new one. Now I'm wondering if it's possible for him to play the games I have on my account, while using his own? He wants his own gamertag. I don't have many games but I&nbsp;have enough that he wants to play and&nbsp;I&nbsp;don't normally get chance to have a go at.</p><p><br /></p><p>If anyone can help with this it would be great, any direction on how to go about it or the type of account sharing would be wonderful.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks all!<br /></p>

When it asks for a gamertag/profile, let him log in with his account. That should, by default, set your new console as his "Home" Xbox. Your original console will remain your Home Xbox. He won't need a Gold account. After you get that set up, just check to make sure that the new console is set to his Home Xbox. The console may even ask if you want to make it your (or your nephew's as the case may be) Home console during the setup process, I can't remember, but at least if he's there it will save a few steps.

<h2>            Skype freezing after video stops working</h2>
                    so while on video call with my girl, my video will stop &nbsp;working at random times. normally you could just turn off video and turn it back on right, except the minute i turn it off skype freezes and i have to restart the program... It also freezes if i
 try to hit any other button. just looking for a solution since i can't send a ticket into anyone it only gives me the option to ask the community.

</p><p>The main purpose of Skype Numbers are to receive incoming calls from mobile and landline numbers and it puzzles me why your calls are not being received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you clarify some questions for me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What version of Skype are you using?</p>
<p>2. On what device are you using Skype?</p>
