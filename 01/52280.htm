    <title>How to transfer files using my headphone jack&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to transfer files using my headphone jack&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I have a really old device that records things and I wanted to see if I could upload my previous recording to my computer. When I searched onlice, I realized that the only way I could transfer it was to use an auxiliary cable. The only problem is
 that my computer isn't recognizing the device as an input but an output. Is there anyway I can make it recognize the device as an input?</p>
<p>

            Hi Techie.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You'd have to get it to recognize the line as an Input Device in Settings &gt; System &gt; Sound.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Kindly refer this about headphone jack 
<br /><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/applejack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://techcrunch.com/2016/09/07/applejack/</a> 
<br />
<br />Kindly follow these steps to record from the recorder:
<br />
<br />If your computer does not have a Microphone jack or In-Line jack, you can use the USB Digital Audio adapter.
<br />
<br />Using a mini plug cable (not supplied), plug one end of the cable to the headphone Headphone jack on the IC recorder.
<br />
<br />Plug the other end of the mini plug cable into the Microphone jack or In-Line jack on the computer.
<br />
<br />On your computer, open an Application or Software which supports sound recording, and record from the recorder to the computer.

</span>of the game application. Suddenly, I accidentally pressed on the 'Auto Adjustment'. Finally, all of my problems had been solved. Thank God!

<p>All this has been tried over and over by hundreds, if not thousands of unsatisfied users. I've downloaded WIN10 at least 5 times over the last 3 years and every time, the network card doesn't work and the video card is not recognised. I've given up trying.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My advice to the op... WIN 8.1 works great. Stay with it. They'll support it for years to come and by the time they don't, your computer will be ready for the junk heap anyways. Don't drive yourself nuts trying all their BS suggestions because not one of
 them will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ah, I feel a little better :)<br />

<h2>            Windows 10, can&#39;t connect to WiFi, stuck in AirPlane mode</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10 and since the upgrade my laptop has been stuck in airplane mode. I cannot connect to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even after I turn airplane mode off the laptop will not connect to the internet. The red light on the wireless quick launch button (F12) on the keyboard is always on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is an HP Pavilion G6 Notebook PC.</p>

</p><p>I need a permanent solution to this problem, not a work around, please.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Arun,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I forgot to specify that I am trying to connect to the internet via Wi-Fi.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have access to an Ethernet cable. Whenever I troubleshoot it, all it says is "a network cable is not properly plugged in OR may be broken".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wi-Fi doesn't pop up as an option on the laptop. It doesn't recognize/ acknowledge any wireless connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Istalling the drivers from the manufacturer site only solved the issue of the f12 button no longer being red. The light on the button is now blue but I'm still unable to connect to my Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used the device manager to update the drivers but it just states that they're all up to date. I really need this issue to be fixed. Any and all help is appreciated.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f14e8840-34d9-4265-baa2-b150326904ec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f14e8840-34d9-4265-baa2-b150326904ec" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba0f1045-076b-4770-a93b-16290c79229e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba0f1045-076b-4770-a93b-16290c79229e" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cc174bec-dcd0-489c-8867-9297358ec8c8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cc174bec-dcd0-489c-8867-9297358ec8c8" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsof

            &nbsp;Has anyone received any useful information regarding this problem as I'm having the same issue and am extremely frustrated. I have only had this computer less than 60 days and it's already useless and then I can't get onto the Internet. I've tried all
 the suggestions and my computer is staying locked in airplane mode. And to suggest in 2017 that someone should have not only an ethernet cord handy but a home phone connection to plug it into is ridiculous.

            I had the exact same problem, spent all afternoon looking things up and trying them, then I found this page and realized I had done every step here also, while in the mean time my laptop has a very old version on Advanced System Care 8.0 (a free version)
 I ran the driver check option and it fixed the problem totally when it was done the big x over the connection icon was gone and it was recognizing every connection all my other computers recognize<br />

<p>That has happened to me, and a lot of people. You may want to go to the Bethesda blog and see if you can contact support there.
</p>
<p>What I just did was to shut off autosave, which helped a little. I haven't had a system freeze since yesterday. Something else may work for you.
</p>
<p>Other than that, if it doesn't resume play in a few minutes, just turn the system on and off again. It's a pain, I know, but it should pick up at your last save point.</p>

<p>How often is the freezing occuring? The days I do play I might get a freeze but nothing to aggravating. I have noticed that the potential to freeze happens when I exceed 2 hours of continuous play (what can I say...time flies when your skyrimming...seriously).
 But coming straight from Fallout Vegas I can say that Skyrim handles errors &amp; freezes 3x better, even after all the patches that FOV had.
</p>
<p>Again I dont know how frequent your game freezes, but definately install the game to your HD, clear memory cache, save often, try to limit the amount of saves you have to around 3 or 4 (not counting autosaves) I read somewhere that an excessive amount of
 saves does increase the threat of game issues. I know on Fallout Vegas I had to disable auto save however I dont find it an issue on Skyrim.</p>

<p>My game freezes every 5 to 10 minutes and has become unplayable, &nbsp; As a last ditch hope im going to turn off autosaves and give that a shot. &nbsp;I have cleared cache and pruned saves. &nbsp; Hoping desperately that the patch will help.</p>

<p>I only get occasional freezes, usually when there's too much going on at one time -- like in combat with multiple enemies while trying to move while trying to switch weapons, that sort of thing. &nbsp;Autosave is still turned on for me, but I delete older saves
 along the way so the total number stays below 20 or 30. For me, MORE annoying than the occasional freezes are the frequent black screens lasting about 1-3 sec. &nbsp;They self clear but it is awkward when it happens in the heat of combat. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Have you overused arrows? A friend of mine overused arrows (he was into archery since the beginning) and apparently, all the arrows you use are scattered everywhere and the game can only take up so many. His game started freezing repeatedly because of this.

<p>Happens to me with autosave on too. I have been researching this and it may have to do with the file size of the save. A person with a 8mb save may not have a problem. However my game having a 15mb save, freezes on loading and autosave.</p>

            You told that the program works in windows xp ,. So in the compatibility tab you have to select windows xp ,.. May be probably&nbsp;windows xp&nbsp;service pack 3 or&nbsp;windows xp&nbsp;service pack 2.

            Sorry i think windows xp compatibility mode is not there for windows 7 home basic.. So either you&nbsp;have to&nbsp;&nbsp;upgrade the system to windows 7 ultimate

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;
<div>another technique is to look at the following link

                    <p>The updated Edge browser included with windows 10 version 1803 fails to connect with Comcast Xfinity Online TV and with the HBO NOW app and yet IE -11, Chrome, Firefox, Waterfox, Opera and Vivaldi ALL&nbsp; can stream BOTH without incident.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems Microsoft cannot legitimately claim it has the world's most modern browser when it's predecessor and major competitors can stream from WiFi servers offered to the general public by entertainment channels and EDGE cannot!</p>

            Hi &nbsp;William
<br />I am Wilfredo an Independent advisor And I'm here to help you!!
<br />How you doing today?
<br />
<br />If this happens to you only with Edge you can try these options
<br />
<br />The first option to try is Reset &amp; Repair Edge
<br />
<br />Windows Key + i 
<br /> Apps &gt; Go down, Select Microsoft Edge and click Reset&nbsp;
<br />If Reset doesn't work, press Repair
<br />
<br />You can check this article for more information
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023560/windows-10-what-to-do-when-microsoft-edge-not-working" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402356...</a>
<br />
<br />If this option does not work, you can also try Reinstall Edge
<br />
<br />I recommend you see this link

<p>Hello Wilfredo,</p>
<p>Sadly none of the suggested remedies worked. I did the reset, repair and uninstall/reinstall per instructions and each time I was alerted to a message reading "Something went wrong, but we were able to correct it and install Edge". It didn't resolve the
 issue. I did notice when trying to watch HBO NOW that I was alerted by that website "Cannot play video. An HCCP issue was detected with your device."</p>
<p>I also would like to mention that the Edge installed in the first two version of windows 10 did not have this problem!</p>

            <p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a brand new Surface Book 2, Core i7, 16GB, 512GB SSD, 1050GTX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pulled it out of the box last night, unsealed it, plugged it in and once booted up it said 0% battery and not charging for both batteries.</p>
<p>- I tried an MS Surface Dock AC adapter, same issue.</p>
<p>- I tried cleaning the pins on the AC adapter, same issue.</p>
<p>- I tried updating to Build 1809, fully update, reboot, same issue.</p>
<p>- I tried deleting the battery drivers, same issue.</p>
<p>- I tried deleting the battery and keyboard drivers, same issue.</p>
<p>- I tried pressing and holding power for 20 to 30 seconds, same issue.</p>
<p>- I tried pressing volume up and power for both 10 seconds, and about 15 seconds, same issue.</p>
<p>- I tried reversing the tablet, same issue.</p>
<p>- I tried connecting a USB C cable to the MS AC adapter and connecting it to the SB2 USB C port while connected to the AC, same issue.</p>
<p>- I tried connecting a USB C cable from my StarTech 4K dock, same issue.</p>
<p>- I tried leaving it powered off and connected to the MS AC adapter all night, same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was only able to get the tablet to charge by connecting the MS AC adapter to the tablet portion directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- When docked, the DGPU (GTX1050) constantly gets discovered and disappears (discovery sound, and appearance/disappearance from the device manager)</p>
<p>- When docked, if it is quiet, I can hear a faint click every time the DGPU is discovered or disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- It is ridiculous that this issue is so widespread and common among new owners.
</p>
<p>- It is even more ridiculous that people who receive replacement units that work have the issue return after an update.</p>
<p>- It is ridiculous that this issue is happening on a "premium" computer that retails for more than 3500$ CDN.</p>
<p>- It is even more ridiculous that the responses I have seen in the myriad of posts about this issue get a canned response from the MS people in this forum that say clean the pins on the AC adapter, power it off and wait, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would expect that one of the most powerful tech companies in the world, who promises a premium experience with the Surface line of products, does not have a solution for a massive, widespread issue, on one of their "premium" Surface products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only reason I am posting this is to let others know that none of the "solutions" provided by other threads is an actual solution and it seems that there is no solution other than hoping a replacement will not suffer this issue.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest getting an extended warranty if you still intend to buy one of these devices even though I am against extended warranties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be returning this unit for credit and moving onto another brand. It is a shame because I have owned a Surface Pro 1, 3, 4, and Surface Book 2 i5, and they all performed well, although I never owned them longer than about 1 year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck to all of you.</p>

            <p>I bought a Microsoft Book last week (through unlicensed channels, so the warranty had already dried up).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The battery was already half shot; it flipped between "0% not charging" and "100% fully charged". Presumably 4 years in isolation drained the battery and though the Book runs while plugged in, the battery is just discharging everything else and it won't
 charge (i.e. it shuts down due to lack of power immediately after being unplugged).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After updating to the most recent Windows version, the Book started going into hibernation every 30 seconds or so. Regardless of whether I was being idle or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A list of things I've done, in no particular order:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- 2 resets (one keeping my files, the next just resetting everything).</p>
<p>- turning off hibernation. This just made it shut down every minute instead of hibernating every minute. I had to speedrun through cmd to turn hibernation back on instead :').</p>
<p>- fiddling with power options. I've done most plausible things by now, including toggling screensavers, changing power settings back to defaults, etc.</p>
<p>- safe mode. It hibernates anyway, safe mode doesn't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While resetting, I discovered that the hibernation starts around 70% into installing Windows. It kept on hibernating through the last few minutes of Windows being installed, and then all the way through Cortana walking me through set-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm despairing because I'm 90% sure the update wrecked the battery even further or something, and... yeah. I don't have a warranty even though I only bought this last week :').</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any advice, please please please drop me a line.</p>

<p>Hi Abygaille,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply, I have had the laptop for just over a year now (so it's out of warranty), but it was working properly until one day I realised that the surface base battery was not charging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to use Microsoft&nbsp;<span>Surface Diagnostic Toolkit and it doesn't seem to fix the problem,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have also deleted the battery drivers and searched for an update to see if the battery drivers were out of date or have an error, to no success,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have re-installed windows again, multiple times,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done a full restart, two button reset, going into the bios (and not changing anything there),</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have (unfortunately) done a manual release of the table from the base and tried to charge the tablet and base separately, I only did this method after the warranty&nbsp;was gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a while, I also realised that the firmware drivers were not working&nbsp;properly and tried to update them automatically as well as deleting them and manually installing them, again to no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also not entirely sure which battery isn't charging, this is because when I did a manual release of the tablet, the tablet battery did not charge, however, when I connect the base and the tablet together battery 1 (the base battery) doesn't&nbsp;charge, however,
 battery 2 (the tablet battery) does charge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I can not start the laptop up when it shuts down&nbsp;due and I have to plug the laptop in. This is a real problem as I now need to always have to carry the charger with me.</p>

<p>FIXED! I pried the screen from the base with a screwdriver, charged the screen directly, then reattached the screen to the base. Now the screen and base both show 100% battery.</p>
<p>Apparently, the battery was&nbsp;charging, but the screen was not, because both batteries had died and weren't communicating.&nbsp; I was I little uneasy about taking a flathead screwdriver to my very expensive computer....</p>
<p>But it saved me $600</p>

            To correct this problem you will need to perform a Repair Installation<br />
<br />
<p><strong><span>Repair Installation:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may reinstall your copy of Vista while keeping your files, settings, and programs by performing a
<strong>repair installation</strong> or an <strong>in-place </strong>upgrade with the following steps: (<strong><span>Note</span></strong>:
</span><span>&nbsp;This does not always resolve all issues, especially if the corruption was caused by a 3rd party program or service, you might need to do a clean installation if this is unsuccessful.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&nbsp;</span></p>

Hello mattb79,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Windows Vista Community site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Modifying REGISTRY</span> settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting
 from the configuring of REGISTRY settings can be solved. Modifications of these settings are at your own risk.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Without seeing the complete log it going to be hard to say yes or no.&nbsp;&nbsp; Side note: always backup regisrty as it may prove valuable to you.</p>
<p>
Try following these step:</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I suggest we run a System File Checker which scans for and attempts to fix corrupted System files. - below are the instructions and have Vista Disc ready:<br />
</p>
<div>

</li><li>
<span>Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Continue</span><span> or supply Administrator credentials

<span><span>&nbsp;</span>In the

</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold">Enter</span><span>:</span><span style="font-weight: bold">sfc /scannow</span>
</li><li>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>You should see the following on-screen messages:</span>
<ol>
<li>
</li><li>
</li><li>
</li></ol>
</li><li>
<span>&nbsp; Once the scan has completed you will receive an onscreen message resembling one of the following:</span>
<ol>
<li>
<span>…found no integrity violations</span>
</li><li>
<span>…</span><span style="font-style: italic">found corruption but repaired it</span>
</li><li>
<span>…</span><span style="font-style: italic">found corruption that it could not repair</span>
</li></ol>
</li><li>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>Please reply with the completion message that you received.</span>
</li></ol>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should resolve your problem.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Let us know if these steps resolve your problem.&nbsp; I hope the information is useful.</p>

<p>How can I view and manage my billing options?</p>
<p><a href="https://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://billing.microsoft.com</a> is a key website to keep in-mind when you wish to review your account's billing and purchase history information. You can check your Microsoft points and
 all the subscription plans which you have had redeemed on your account, including the current one which is active. If you have any account trouble regarding your card details and payment information you can update those details through this website.</p>
<p>For example: If you realize your credit card has expired then you will have to update your payment information, otherwise the xbox LIVE service will detect this and may issue you with a suspension when the system detects an invalid payment option. When you
 add the new card to that website you also have an option there to transfer the xbox LIVE subscription to your new payment method and this will ensure that you do not receive a suspension.</p>

<p>Ist es überhaupt ohne weiteres möglich den Gamertag von jemand anderes zu hacken, auch wenn man ein sicheres Passwort verwendet. Wenn das so geht sollte Microsoft noch mal an der Sicherheit arbeiten.
</p>
<p>Ich habe schon öfters gehört das jemand gehackt wurde und anschließend stellte sich heraus das derjenige seine Daten freiwillig rausgegeben hat, weil ihm jemand Gamerscore oder ähnliches versprochen hat.

<h2>            Battery dead after upgrading to Windows 10&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a Lenovo laptop on Februrary 2015 with Windows 8.1 on it. Since then, I have been applying good practices for extending the battery life such as not leaving the computer plugged to the power when the battery is almost 100%, connecting it again when
 it is around 10%, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since I upgraded to Windows 10 not so long ago I started having problems with the battery. The first week after upgrading I noticed that the battery life was much worse than before. And after that the battery is just not charging and a message indicating
 that the battery needs to be replaced is shown each time I boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure Windows 10 has caused the problem because all this happened within a week and it was working perfectly the week befre upgrading (lasting almost 2 hours).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read that there are lots of people with a dead battery just after upgrading to Windows 10 and this is not a coincidence. I have paid for a Windows license to avoid any problems and issues with the new computer and now Windows have caused one. Microsoft
 is responsible for these problems and they have to give support to the users that have suffered it. If they do not give this support it does not make sense to pay for any Windows license again and I won't do it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help on this!</p>
<p />

<p>Hi Mcordero,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
We understand how you feel about the situation. We're sorry for the trouble this has caused.<br />
<br />
Before we proceed, I need more information to help you better.<br />
<br />
1. Have you installed all the pending updates and driver updates on your system?&nbsp;<br />
2. Are you facing this issue on the Microsoft account or a local account?&nbsp;<br />
3. Have you made any changes to your system, prior to this issue? </p>
<p>4. What is the model of your system?<br />
<br />
I suggest you to sign out from the current user account, restart the system and login to the either administrator account or the Microsoft account to check, if that helps.
</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Windows Update may have updated drivers available that may be relevant to your current issue. Many times, updated drivers are listed in the "Optional" section of Windows Update. Install any pending updates on the pc to check if that helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>This issue may occur, due to some corruption in your computer power settings.</p>
<p>
</p><div>Let's try to remove the charging cord and restart the system&nbsp;without it plugged into the laptop. After the laptop restarts and fully loads up the desktop, re-plug the charging cord into the socket and the device manager automatically reinstalled the correct
 driver and check, if that helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Also, try these steps below and check, if the issue persists:</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>1. Open device manager, by right clicking on&nbsp;the Windows icon.</div>
<div>2. Expand batteries</div>
<div>3. Right click on the Microsoft ACPI Compliant Control Method Battery, select uninstall.</div>
<div>4. Click on the icon below help to "scan for hardware changes"</div>
<div>5. Restart the system and check, if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
if the issue persists, let’s try to refer to the suggestions provided by suat.cini, replied on November 26, 2015, to fix your issue.</div>

</p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>Hi Mcordero,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
We understand how you feel about the situation. We're sorry for the trouble this has caused.<br />
<br />
Before we proceed, I need more information to help you better.<br />
<br />
1. Have you installed all the pending updates and driver updates on your system?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Yes, I have installed all the updates on the system.</strong></p>
<p>2. Are you facing this issue on the Microsoft account or a local account?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I was facing it in a Microsoft account and I have tried with the local account and the error persists.</strong></p>
<p>3. Have you made any changes to your system, prior to this issue? </p>
<p><strong>No, I didn't apply any change before updating to Windows 10 and having the issue.</strong></p>
<p>4. What is the model of your system?<br />
<strong>The system is a Lenovo IdeaPad Z510.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>I suggest you to sign out from the current user account, restart the system and login to the either administrator account or the Microsoft account to check, if that helps.
</p>
<p><strong>I tried this and no luck.</strong></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Windows Update may have updated drivers available that may be relevant to your current issue. Many times, updated drivers are listed in the "Optional" section of Windows Update. Install any pending updates on the pc to check if that helps.</p>
<p><strong>I already installed all the updates on the system.</strong></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>This issue may occur, due to some corruption in your computer power settings.</p>
<p>
</p><div>Let's try to remove the charging cord and restart the system&nbsp;without it plugged into the laptop. After the laptop restarts and fully loads up the desktop, re-plug the charging cord into the socket and the device manager automatically reinstalled the correct
 driver and check, if that helps.</div>
<div>
<p><strong>If I remove the power cord the computer shutsdown and cannot power on again.</strong></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Also, try these steps below and check, if the issue persists:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></div>
<div>1. Open device manager, by right clicking on&nbsp;the Windows icon.</div>
<div>2. Expand batteries</div>
<div>3. Right click on the Microsoft ACPI Compliant Control Method Battery, select uninstall.</div>
<div>4. Click on the icon below help to "scan for hardware changes"</div>
<div>5. Restart the system and check, if it helps.</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Tried and not success.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>if the issue persists, let’s try to refer to the suggestions provided by suat.cini, replied on November 26, 2015, to fix your issue.</p>

<p><strong>The battery do not charge when the computer is off. This may mean that the battery is phisically damaged and will not work again. In fact, I have tried booting with a Ubuntu partition I have in this computer and the battery is not charging either.
 I wan't to highligh that I had this partition since I bought the computer and I have experienced no issue with it. Furthermore, I haven't used this partition in the last 6 months. What I mean with this is that the Ubuntu partition has nothing to do with the
 issue. And if the battery has been damaged, it is obvious that some bad battery management from Windows 10 has cause this as it was working perfectly fine before with Windows 8.1 and just one week after updating to Windows 10 the issue apper. And I am not
 the only user with this same problem so this cannot be a coincidence.</strong></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.<br />
This issue usually arises due to outdated drivers. You may try the following methods and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: Update Drivers</strong><br />
Refer to the following article and update all the drivers available.<br />
How to: Install and Update drivers in Windows 10<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293</span></a></p>
<div>&nbsp;
<p>If you are unable to find the drivers for Windows 10, you may try to install the drivers in compatibility mode with Windows 8.1.
<br />
<br />
Firstly download the driver from your computer's manufacturer website and then install it.
<br />
Refer (Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows)<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</span></a><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> This link also applies to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
&nbsp;One of the new features in Windows 10 is included in the new Settings app. It's called "Battery saver" and as the name implies, it's a feature to help Windows 10 devices to save battery life by limiting background activity and automatically adjusting different
 system settings. This is in addition to battery usage reports for you to understand what is draining your battery.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To access the new battery settings, open the Settings app, go to System, and navigate to Battery saver.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Windows 10 features that your device can't handle won't be shown as an option. If you're running the operating system on a desktop computer without a battery, the Battery saver option won't be available. The same is true for other
 features.</p>

            <p>I was not keen to upgrade from 8.1 to Windows 10 despite persistent reminders to do so. &nbsp;All power to my computer completely died the moment I inadvertently clicked on the yes button and completed the upgrade. &nbsp;Fortunately it was still under guarantee and
 I got a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am on here today because today's update has removed all the applications on the new computer and I am trying to retrieve them by resetting defaults. &nbsp;Not so easy as the default is Cortana which I cannot access despite it being in the promoted as available
 in UK.</p>

            I know from experience that you can create recovery disks from another computer, or use a friend's installation disk, just enter your product key (make sure the verson you install (XP basic, Pro, Home Edition, Etc.) is the same as before or the product
 key wont work).

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Why did you have to format the drive? It's hardly ever necessary, and</div>
<div>it's usually the wrong reaction to a problem.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Moreover, if you do need to format the drive, it doesn't need to be</div>
<div>done as a separate step; it's done for you as the first step of the</div>
<div>clean installation process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&gt; I do not have boot disks. I've found how to download </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>"Download"? Download what? Do you mean "install"?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The word "download" means to copy a file (perhaps a program file, but</div>
<div>not necessarily) from a server someplace on the internet to your own</div>
<div>computer. Please do not mix up that word with "install," which means</div>
<div>to load a program on your hard drive in a form from which it can be</div>
<div>executed</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You typically install a program from a CD, from a diskette, or from</div>
<div>the internet. Only in the last case, the internet, is there any</div>
<div>downloading involved, but even there, it's a two-step process: first</div>
<div>you download it, then you install it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&gt; but it requires floppy disks...I do not have a floppy disk drive, I only have a CD/DVD drive. Can anyone help me or tell me where I can get them?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>No diskettes are required to install. You set the BIOS boot order to</div>
<div>boot from the CD drive first, then boot from the XP CD and follow the </div>
<div>instructions for a clean installation.</div>

            I found the last paragraph re changing the bios boot order to cd very helpful.&nbsp; unfortunately, it didn't solve my problem which is that my xp (on an ABS) hangs up when "Verifying DMI Pool Data".&nbsp; .&nbsp; if i can't get to boot via cd, is there any other remedy?
 install with floppy? (after reseting bios to 1st boot, floppy) which if i can't find one from another computer i will have to "download" it from the web onto a floppy (see earlier paragraph) and then install?&nbsp; thank you. kiki braga

<p>Hello Ethan!</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing this inquiry to our attention here on the forums. I understand that you want to try changing your consoles date or time to be in a different season in game in Forza Horizon 4. I believe the seasons change in the game based on progress
 and then it syncs to what the Forza Horizon 4 servers are running so changing your consoles date and time may not have the effect your looking for. I would recommend checking out

Forza Horizon 4 Community Forums</a>&nbsp;to find more information and options regarding this game. Plus when you're offline the console wont be communicating with Xbox Live so you shouldn't get banned for changing your date and time. It would automatically resync
 the date and time the next time you connect to the internet.</p>

<p>Hey Ethan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't believe you can get banned from online while doing offline activities. once you go back online, the time/date would change back to normal. Since you are not connected to Xbox live while offline, I feel like you should be fine. If you would like to
 pursue information regarding what will/will not get you banned from Forza then you should post on the
<a href="https://forums.forzamotorsport.net/turn10_forum18_Forza-Horizon-4.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            I don't mean to sound like I don't believe you, but do you have a source for it resulting in a ban, or are you more making an assumption. :)&nbsp;

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you go offline where you are not connected to Forza you will be able to swap seasons. Once you connect to the Forza server you will have to go with what the server is set to which is winter. As far as a ban no one on forums will be able to answer with
 positivity. It is modding altering etc but for a ban that would be enforcement, and no one from enforcement reads the forum. As for the post I will be locking due to the question been answered.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 you don&#39;t have permission to save in this location</h2>
                    <p><span>I saw many answers to this question, but all were dealing with earlier versions of Windows so I was
 reluctant to apply any of the suggestions. I'm reading "Windows 8 For Dummies" and still cannot find an answer to my problem there either.</span></p>

<p><span>I bought a new computer running W8 and used Mozy online back-up to restore my files. They were all
 restored to the new computer in C:/Users/MyName/MyDocuments as well as My Desktop.</span></p>

<p><span>I had 31GB of data which includes photos, docs, spreadsheets, etc. Any item I open and edit, then
 try to save, I receive this error message: You don't have permission to save in this location</span></p>

<p><span>Any suggestions?</span></p>

<p>Regards,</p>

            Actually.. this appears to be a simple issue of some of the "user" files being "read only".
<br />
<br />
I had this same issue - and rather than setup security access for "Everyone" to be able to read/write/delete, etc.. I simply took the "read only" attribute off of the areas I wanted access to that were safe.<br />
<br />
Not having problems with "Window+Key" combos.&nbsp; They seem pretty straight-forward to me.&nbsp; But that's another discussion.<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the directory above the one you're having trouble with.&nbsp; (For example, to remove the limitations to your Desktop - navigate to c:\users\&lt;usernamehere&gt;.&nbsp; Then you'll see "Desktop" listed.)</li><li>Right click on the directory you want to "unlock".&nbsp; (In the example I used in #1, "Desktop" is what I want to unlock.)<br />
</li><li>Select "Properties", then un-check the "Read Only" attribute.</li><li>Click "Ok" - and if appropriate, tell it to apply to all files, folders and sub-folders.&nbsp; (This is assumed to be the case if you're doing this here.&nbsp; Otherwise, you would navigate to specific files and folders and unlock them.)</li></ol>
<p>Voila!&nbsp; I have access to the files and folders again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now.. why this happened in the first place, I'm not sure.&nbsp; That's for someone smarter than I to report to all of us.&nbsp; But this did the trick without any changes to security settings (well.. TRUE security settings.. obviously "Read Only" IS a security "attribute").</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helped...<br />
