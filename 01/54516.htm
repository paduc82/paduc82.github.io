<h2>            &#34;No driver files are required or have been loaded for this device.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo B50-30 Touch. Up until now, my full touchscreen capability was working. But the left side is currently non-functional. What might be the cause is that once I went to Device Manager | Human Interface Devices | HID-compliant touch screen driver,
 and clicked on Driver Details, a dialog box pops up and says the following:&nbsp;"No driver files are required or have been loaded for this device." What just happened to my touchscreen feature? Should I disable it for the time being? Any other response is extremely
 appreciated. Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From:</p>
<p>burchland2</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I tried the first method with no avail. Also, I cannot find the touchscreen driver. Can&nbsp;ANYONE help me with that?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try the following methods to diagnose and fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Clean Boot</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate
 software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. To know more, follow the article below:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>’.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Install Windows Updates</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to install all the windows updates including the optional one’s as a lot of fixes are released through the updates. In addition
 to that, a few driver updates are offered in optional updates which help in updating drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>To install the updates, you may follow the article below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2777982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2777982</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Install the latest drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Install the latest chipset drivers available for&nbsp;your system.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers</span></span></a></p>

<h2>            Want to Upgrade from Windows 7 Professional to Ultimate ... is this possible&#63;</h2>
                    I've looked at many Microsoft websites, all of which try to direct me to get Win8, which I don't want right now. I've been having a lot of 'system issues' and though that an upgrade to Win7 Ultimate might help. However, I can't find out where/how to get
 it. No 'official' sales, it seems. Not sure I can trust the sellers on Amazon market-place after reading some of the user comments. Has anyone done this upgrade? All suggestions welcome!

            <p>If you are having system problems, upgrading to Windows 7 Ultimate won't necessarily fix it, you need to resolve the problem that is affecting Windows 7 Professional now before you can upgrade Ultimate.</p>
<p>Could you identify the problems you are experiencing with Windows 7 Professional?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for upgrading to Windows 7 Ultimate, because online Anytime Upgrades are no longer available, you will have to purchase a Windows 7 Ultimate upgrade license.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upgrade version - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Windows-7-Ultimate-Upgrade/dp/B002DHLV8S/ref=sr_1_22?s=software&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351803697&amp;sr=1-22&amp;keywords=Windows+7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u><span>Microsoft
 Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade</span></u></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the license for Windows 7 Ultimate you have access to is either a retail upgrade or full version, you can use the product key and Anytime Upgrade to move from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 7 Ultimate. First, make sure the edition of Windows 7 you
 are upgrading from is already activated (if its not you will run into complications and you might have start all over by doing a clean install). Click Start, type Anytime Upgrade, click the option to enter a key, enter the Windows 7 Ultimate&nbsp;key when requested,
 click Next, wait while the key is verified, accept the license agreement, click upgrade, wait while the software upgrades, (it might take 10 minutes or more depending on if updates are needed), your computer will automatically restart, after restarting, Windows
 7 will notifiy you its updating the computer, the computer will restart one more time automatically and the upgrade will be completed, a windows will pop up notifying the upgrade was successful and your computer is ready to use, click close, you should be
 upgraded to Windows 7 Ultimate your files, programs and settings preserved.</p>

<p><br />
Hi</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Family Pack offer ended several months ago.</p>
<p>Having qualifying versions of Windows on your current systems will qualify you for the Retail Upgrade pricing. The retail upgrade versions come with both the 32bit and 64bit&nbsp;disks in the box.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Application Stuck on Infinite &#34;Please Wait...&#34; Screen</h2>
                    <p>I know I am probably asking a similar question but the cause of this is very specific, I am running Windows 8.1 x64 on a Pavilion Generation 6 HP Laptop and I have recently installed the update KB<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3035583
 for the Windows 10 app to reserve a copy for Windows 10. When I reserved my copy by typing in my email, etc. and it said "we'll take it from here," I eventually put the computer in sleep mode and a couple days later I went back to check on the app and it just
 flat out gave me a "Please Wait..." message that won't change no matter how long I wait. I have also tried reinstalling the update several times and reopening the app and I still get the same result.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f794d0c2-2b2a-4478-b5b2-eca81cddd9bf" /><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to like "reset" the files for this program so that I may reserve another copy again? Because right now I have gotten not confirmation in the System Updates saying I reserved a copy and I also haven't gotten an email saying I reserved anything.
 All I can do on the app is right click it on the task bar, and click "check my update status," which doesn't do anything but give me an infinite loading screen.</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Alvin Gao</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Graphics cards are responsible for managing frame rates in terms of gaming and other GPU-intensive tasks. Some graphics cards have settings that caps the FPS, therefore, the best that I could suggest is to check your graphics card's global settings panel
 to modify, or even remove the capping. Please refer to your GPU manufacturer's website for further assistance with changing the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need additional advice related to Windows, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.

            <p>This forum is for discussions of the forum itself, not for tech support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd start by asking this question in the appropriate Windows support forum for the version of Window you have (assuming that it's a Windows laptop).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the iPod is an Apple product, I'd also search the Apple support forums to see if there are any similar problems/answers there.</p>

            <p>You don't need to "upgrade" to anything because (AFAIK) Bitlocker, which is the disk encryption utility that comes with the Pro edition, doesn't do individual files or folders - it just does whole disks or partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll have to use a third-party utility to encrypt individual files and folders.</p>
<p>I believe that WinZip will do this.</p>

<h3> marcelagonz&#225;lez1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why my Windows 7 Product Key is not valid to activate on line</h2>
                    <p>I purchased (Amzon) an OEM version of Windows 7 (WIN PRO 7 SP1X64 ENGLISH 1 PK DSP OEI DVD LCP) to install in my Mac using Virtual Box (I just need this for some work programs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I tried to activate the Key License, I got the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The Windows 7 Professional product key you typed is invalid for activation"</p>
<p>"To activate Windows you will need to use the automated phone system"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the other hand, I work overseas and I cannot afford using the phone system (that would be a phone call to Australia).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other way to activate Windows? Or any other solution, I would be willing to purchase a new Key if possible. I would not like to download Windows because again, where I am living right now internet is way too much expensive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And even though Microsoft is pushing for Windows 10, I do not want it at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi Gerry, I appreciate you at least responding on this forum. Similar to Dragon01 I do not get any Event ID errors.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I can simply tell you is that I did a clean install of Windows 10 1607 (from a thumb drive created from Windows Media Creator). Everything installed fine and boot/reboot timings were quick. I have a 240Gb SSD as my main System Drive (C:\ drive). I then
 I created a Storage Space with two 1TB WD Blue HDDs, I made this my Data Drive (D:\ drive), and changed the Location of my Libraries (Documents, Photos, Videos, Music, Saved Games) to the HDD Storage Space (D:\ drive).</p>
<p>Having done this, the boot/reboot time has gone from less than 20s to over 1.5mins. Again, no Event ID errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure it was not something stupid I had done, I did it all again with exactly the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only recourse to improve boot/reboot speed is to clean install again and not use Storages Spaces, which seems ludicrous really. And annoying as I spent ages copying back all my Documents, Photos, Videos, Music, and Saved Games over to the Storage Space
 AND spent loads of time getting this to sync with my WD MyCloud EX2. To do it all again is soul destroying. Especially if Microsoft do then acknowledge it is a bug and release a bug fix.</p>
<p>

            <p>I am not sure if this could have anything to do with it but I have just noticed that both my HDDs in my Storage Space have exactly the same IDs. I am not sure whether that is the correct terminology or whether it is serial numbers or some other number but
 they come up in my disk lists with exactly the same identifier: WDC WD10EZEX-8Y20A0.</p>
<p>These are brand new WD Blue disks bought at the same time from same retailer and both have this exact same code. Do you think this could have any bearing on the issue of reboot time following Windows 10 1607 update?</p>
<p>Note: I don't think I have ever seen two disks with exactly the same ID list this.</p>

<p>Thank you for the follow up. Of course, after a night on the table the cover suddenly came back to life. I have no idea which reboot, reinstall of the driver, remove/ put back on, did the trick. Given that it wasn't working when I turned it off I assumed
 all efforts failed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, this morning all is good.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>I have a similar issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an SP4 with the SP4 Touch Cover.&nbsp; I bought them in December 2016 and they have both worked flawlessly.&nbsp; On Wednesday Nov. 21st I worked on the surface before work, then a few hours later got it out to send something that I needed to edit.&nbsp; When I
 opened the screen lock was weird and the screen did not want to orientate, as well as the keyboard and touchpad would not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed, uninstalled, removed the keyboard (at least 10 times).</p>
<p>I have reinstalled windows.</p>
<p>I have cleaned the connection points multiple times</p>
<p>I have done the two button shut down.&nbsp; (keypad and mouse do not work in safe mode either).</p>
<p>I have a SP 2, and this touch cover and the old touch cover both worked great on the SP2, but neither work on the SP4.</p>
<p>I have downloaded and installed all the drivers, patches, updates and still nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few observations</p>
<p>*When I attach the old touch cover to the SP4, the backlights light up then shut off.</p>
<p>*The surface recognizes the newer touch cover whenever it is connected (in system and device manager) &nbsp;</p>
<p>*They keyboard and touchpad for both covers work on SP2 but not on SP4</p>
<p>*When I look at the touch covers in Device manager, I do see an event "Device HID\VID_045E&amp;PID_07E8&amp;Col01\6&amp;302348a5&amp;2&amp;0000 was not migrated due to partial or ambiguous match" and the notes says "Device not migrated"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to BestBuy and am using an inexpensive Bluetooth keyboard/touchpad now, but would LOVE to figure out what happened.&nbsp; The SP4 and Touch cover work perfect for my needs and I am hoping to get this resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help and have a Blessed Day!</p>

            <div>There are unfortunately many people with this issue (including a neighbor and a</div>
<div>friend). For most, the problem occurs after some random Windows Update. My</div>
<div>theory is that it isn't a particular update, but something in the update PROCESS</div>
<div>that corrupts the firmware somehow. Microsoft has not commented on this, nor</div>
<div>have they come up with a fix. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it does not work in the UEFI, no amount of reimaging will fix it. Cleaning</div>
<div>the contacts has not fixed this for anyone. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The UEFI settings can be adjusted only during system startup. To load the UEFI</div>
<div>firmware settings menu:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Shut down your Surface and wait 10 seconds.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Press and hold the volume-up button on your Surface and at the same</div>
<div>time, press and release the power button.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. The Microsoft or Surface logo appears on your screen. Continue to</div>
<div>hold the volume-up button. Release the button once the UEFI screen appears.</div>

<div>Your only official solution is to spend $450US for an out of warranty refurb</div>
<div>exchange. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can also investigate 3rd party type covers that use Bluetooth like</div>

<div>(one of these is for SP4, the others are for Surface 3). I have no firsthand</div>
<div>experience with these but Amazon has a good return policy.</div>

<p>Barb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the information.&nbsp; This is frustrating.&nbsp; My surface is less than 2 years old.&nbsp; The surface (up until this week) has worked great for me, and is perfect for my situation and use.&nbsp; Unfortunately if I decide to buy another unit, it now will more
 than likely be another brand. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a cheap Bluetooth keyboard, and will look into the aftermarket Bluetooth you recommend. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a great day, and again thank you for your time and your reply!</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>You can test if your sound and microphone are working properly with Skype by initiating a call to Echo. Echo is a sound test service which Skype users can call to test their sound and audio settings, and the result is instant!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To call to Echo:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Search for the <strong>Echo / Sound Test Service</strong> contact.</li><li>Call Echo and follow her instructions.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Once the recording session is done, Echo will play back your recorded message. If you can hear your message, then your microphone settings are working properly and you are good to go. You can refer to

                    <p>Hey guys i'm getting a consistent crash with ntoskrnl.exe. I'm assuming it's a driver, and i'm guessing it could be my Ethernet drivers. But i could really use some tech savy support here. I tried updating ALL of my drivers (Everything is up to date). But
 still with no luck.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 and QuickBooks</h2>
                    <p>I just installed Windows 10 and now my QuickBooks 2015 Premier Plus doesn't work. Intuit Support worked on it for over an hour and surmised that&nbsp;QuickBooks 2015 Premier Plus&nbsp;just doesn't work with Windows 10. Intuit is working on a patch that might not be
 available until November. When I went to uninstall Windows 10 the message states that going back to Windows 7 may delete some critical files. What the...??!!! Are you serious? Can anyone tell me if they found a solution to make QuickBooks work with Windows
 10? And, has anyone had real problems in going back to Windows 7 from Windows 10? And, can I install Windows 8 over Windows 10?&nbsp; Please help.</p>

Be sure to check with the System Maker's Support (Motherboard Maker for custom<br />
systems), their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums (if any)<br />
about any known issues. Be sure to update the<strong> BIOS, low level chipset drivers,
<br />
and the other major on-board and separate device drivers</strong>. Those alone may
<br />
resolve some or all of these issues.<br />
<br />
Note&nbsp;using <strong>Win Key + X</strong> and <strong>Win Key + W</strong> (to get to Control Panel, Run, and Settings<br />

Does the system have RAID? If so that is also&nbsp;very suspect.<br />
<br />
This error is usually a driver&nbsp;issue and display adapter (video) driver is the most suspect though
<br />
it could be others.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs, hardware (heat) and major software
<br />
issues&nbsp;can also cause the error. When you get to the driver section of the troubleshooter use my
<br />
generic&nbsp;methods below and then return to the troubleshooter if needed. <br />
<br />
Have you added hardware recently or updated drivers? Be sure to look in Control Panel - Windows<br />
Updates to see if any drivers were updated there. Other lessor possibilities include antivirus/anti-<br />
spyware/security programs.<br />

<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView -&nbsp;set VIEW to Hide<br />
Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without Dump in their names (and BIOS and chipset).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to<br />
show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />
