<p>I cannot use the number keys on my keyboard. I qalso could not use these keys on my previous keyboard. At one time, I could use them. What did I do and how do I change it to use the number keys again?</p>

<h2>            Making Tor Browser as default browser and configuring VPN &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, guys!</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>On Tor Browser</em> <em>as default</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to make Tor Browser my default browser, but when I click on the default browser options, only IE and Microsoft Edge appear. I opened the Tor Browser and go to its settings, and clicked the command that enables Tor Browser to be the default browser,
 but it doesn't work. Prior to this I made IE 11 my default browser (I find Microsoft Edge to be very slow in loading pages), so now IE remains the default.&nbsp; How can I configure Tor Browser as my default?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>On Configuring a VPN</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I subscribed to a free VPN. I configured its settings to launch upon startup and try to make a connection upon startup. This way, I am hoping that all internet traffic would pass through the VPN (Am I correct in this assumption?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I know that I can set a VPN connection in Windows 10 settings or Control Panel. However, I do not know how to do it. There are several boxes that I need to fill up but I don't know where or how to find the appropriate answers. (If I set a VPN connection
 in Windows 10, will all traffic pass via the VPN?) My VPN provider automatically choose the server once a connection is made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping that all my internet traffic will pass through a VPN and through the tor network as a security and privacy measure.</p>
<p>

            <p>Open Notepad, copy the REG file contents from the StackExchange link. Alter the path to Tor's executable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change the path from:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>C:\\Users\\MyUser\\AppData\\Local\\Tor Browser\\Browser\\firefox.exe</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>to the actual path of Tor browser's executable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, in <strong>my</strong> system, the location could be something like:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>C:\\Users\\Ramesh\\AppData\\Local\\Tor Browser\\Browser\\firefox.exe</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Be sure to include the double-slashes as in the source example. REG file format needs double slashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>(If you don't know the path, right-click the Tor browser's shortcut and click Properties. It has the full path.)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the changes are made, save the file with .REG extension, say "tor.reg" in your Desktop. You've now created a .reg file, which when double-clicked, will apply the settings to the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Close and open Default Programs &gt; Set your default programs. It should now list "Tor".</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Thanks for your post. I'm definitely going to try "Tor".</p>

<h2>            Capcom vs SNK 2 EO &#40;Original XBOX&#41; Playable on XB360&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I really want to play CVS 2 EO on 360 and one thing I noticed is that there's no downloadable game on xbox live game marketplace at this point. So I thought it would be best to buy this game from xbox. However I am not sure if it playable or will cause system
 errors on my 360?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ways of playing this game on 360? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            SFC wants SP2 Disk to repair but I&#39;m at SP3.  Is it OK to use the disk&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I do " sfc /scannow" I get the following message "Windows File Protection - Files that are required for Windows to run properly have been replaced by unrecognized versions. To maintain system stability, Windows must restore the original versions of
 these files. Insert your Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 2 CD now".</p>

<p>I had to upgrade to Service Pack 3 in order to install MSE. As I understand it, once you've installed SP3, you can't do system restore back to SP2. I just want someone to confirm that I really should put the Service Pack 2 CD in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            No.&nbsp; You should not put the SP2 CD in.<br />
<br />
I don''t know if you can System Restore back to SP2 or not since I have never used System Restore (except to practice), but allegedly you can
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950249" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">uninstall SP3</a> if you want, but you would lose all
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/946480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">these benefits and features</a> of the 3+ year old Service Pack release.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Now that your question is confirmed, what can you do about it?<br />
<br />
Once you install SP3, any XP installation CDs you have with older SPs are virtually useless for sfc /scannow (by themselves).<br />
<br />
The best option is if&nbsp; you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD with an older SP is to make a
 will have SP3 integrated into it.&nbsp; You must already have a genuine bootable XP installation CD to do this.<br />
<br />
What you will end up with is an XP installation CD with SP3 integrated into it (and you can shelve your old version).&nbsp; That will make sfc /scannow happy, but sfc /scannow is not for fixing issues on a system.&nbsp; sfc /scannow is designed to run
 It is not for fixing problems, unless your problem is your dllcache folder needs to be updated, or your problem is you have to much time and need to waste some of it.<br />
<br />
While it gives one a good "feeling" when sfc /scannow runs without complaining (and you can make it so), it is to unlikely resolve any issues you might be having and is a big, frustrating waste of time (as you can see) - unless your issue is trying to get sfc
 /scannow to run without complaining.<br />
<br />
If you run sfc /scannow to completion and you have all the proper pieces in place, it should find nothing to do.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
However, even if you break your system on purpose and sfc /scannow finds a file in the dllcache folder that needs replacing and replaces it (that IS what it is for), you will not know about it since the only thing you will see in the Event Viewer log is this:<br />
<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64016<br />
Windows File Protection file scan was started.<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64017<br />
Windows File Protection file scan completed successfully.<br />
<br />
Even if sfc /scannow finds something to do, you will never know about it.&nbsp; That is not it's purpose.&nbsp; It's purpose is to populate the dllcache folder.&nbsp; In the above example, sfc /scannow replaced 2 files I corrupted on purpose for a training and testing mission,
 but you won't see anything about it in the log.<br />
<br />
That makes running sfc /scannow even more of a waste of time.&nbsp; If it finds something to do, you will not even know what it did.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a genuine bootable XP installation CD, hope is not lost, but I will let the Microsoft Support Engineers who are
<br />
Here is an recent example of the MSE ineptness and lack of understanding about sfc /scannow (soon to be marked as the Answer):<br />
<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-system/sfcosdll-missing/4836955e-4517-45a8-a19f-85d7d5ecf3f5">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-system/sfcosdll-missing/4836955e-4517-45a8-a19f-85d7d5ecf3f5</a><br />
<br />
I have many times also offered my professional services to teach Microsoft Support Engineers how sfc /scannow works in hopes that they will not suggest it when they have no idea what is wrong with a system or how to fix it.<br />
<br />
Sorry...&nbsp; I had to get in that last shot - again.<br />

</p><p>The account that your using might have gotten corrupted or some of the system files are gone missing, reason why the icons on the taskbar are not visible. That said, we suggest that you run SFC (System File Checker) and use the DISM tool through command
 prompt. Here are the steps on how to do so:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click on <strong>Start </strong>, then click on <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong></li><li>Type in "<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>", then press Enter.</li><li>Close the command prompt by click the "X" at the top right.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Command Prompt (Admin) again.</li><li>Type in&nbsp; <strong>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</strong></li><li>Close the command prompt.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Restart your computer once done to save the changes. Check if the icons are back on the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">link
</a></strong>to learn more about SFC (System File Checker) and DISM.</p>

<h2>            Computer occasionally freezes when performing light tasks</h2>
                    <p>So as of late, my computer has been acting up. I was just chilling, watching some youtube, and all of a sudden, the screen goes black, and I hear an atrocious buzzing noise. After about 45 seconds, the screen comes back on, and I see these groups of pixels
 on the top portion of my screen. I thought, "Well, I'll just turn it off." Seemed to work, but about 15 minutes later, it happens again, except I get a blue screen saying 'Thread Stuck in Device Driver'. I looked around, and have concluded that it may be the
 cause of an un-updated graphics driver, or my BIOS is out of date. This is a custom build, and parts such as the HD, mobo, CPU, and RAM are about a year old. Others have been purchased within 5 months. I am not sure what do do really, so I thought I'd ask
 someone before I go and potentially brick my motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my specs:</p>
<p>MSI Z97 G45 Gaming</p>
<p>Intel i5-4460</p>
<p>8gb of Kingston HyperX Fury RAM</p>
<p>Sapphire Radeon R9 390 8gb</p>
<p>Corsair CX750 Power Supply</p>
<p>Plextor M6S 128gb SSD (for Operating System, drivers are stored here as well)</p>
<p>WD 1T Blue HDD (games)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably does not matter:</p>
<p>Asus DVD-RW DVD drive</p>
<p>NZXT Kraken X31 CPU cooler</p>

            Hey there anon_786,<br />
<br />
I'm sorry for the situation. Ashish gave you a good suggestion checking your video drivers. I'd make sure all drivers and the OS are all up to date plus the BIOS/UEFI of the motherboard.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also I'd check the loads of the system and make sure nothing is hitting 100% usage or going over the recommended operational temperatures. Running a stress test and a memory test could show you if you have a problem with this or if you have any
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms859408.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
memory leaks</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'd also make sure the storage drives are at full health and are not causing any problems. I'd download and run diagnostic tools from the manufacturer's websites and see if the drives pass the tests. For the WD Blue I'd recommend

            After being a little lazy and saying that I would do it later, I decided to do what you and Ashish Sondhi had recommended. I checked my drives for failures, and updated both my bios and my graphics driver; although when I try to update/download the intel
 driver, I get a little warning saying that my computer does not meet the minimum requirements. And I made sure to chose the one right for my cpu. I shall report back in a few days to see if it has worked. Thanks both for helping me with this issue!

            Your parts are well withing the recommended minimum requirements (the parts that you listed). Do post back as if the problem persist the cause might as well be a faulty motherboard and you'd have to resort to taking it to a technician. .<br />

            Well, I updated my BIOS, and checked my graphics driver, and it said it was up to date. And I haven't gotten the crash with weird pixels, but I got the thread stuck in device driver error again. It is kind of annoying, because it is only with youtube.
 Other video players work fine, and I was able to play 4 hours of a video game without interruption. So I am not sure. I know it started happening when I installed the CD drive, if that helps.&nbsp;

Have you tried different browsers? Is the result the same on all of them?&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            I can&#39;t unpair my Sculpt Comfort mouse</h2>
                    <p>I have accidentally paired my mouse with another computer without unpairing from my laptop first. Now, after unpairing from the 2nd computer, my main laptop does not recognize my mouse, but it is still in the bluetooth settings. When I try to unpair, it
 comes up with "Are you sure you want to remove this device?", I click "Yes" but nothing happens. The text box hangs for a while then disappears without doing anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried </p>
<p>-removing it from devmgmt.msc</p>
<p>-removing it from devices and printers (similar results to bluetooth settings)</p>
<p>-restarting laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the update. Yes you can pair and un-pair the mouse multiple times. I would suggest you to place the computer in
<span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">clean boot</span></strong></a><span> to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps
 in eliminating software conflicts. Now try to un-pair the mouse.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: After troubleshooting, see

                    <span>My Dell E2414H monitor has display issues after waking from sleep mode. I am running Windows 10 with an Asus Z170 Pro4 motherboard and a Skylake Core i5 processor (no other graphics card). When starting from a cold start, the graphics appear normally,
 but after the computer goes to sleep, it wakes with stripes of pixelated, blinking color. In this state, the mouse shows up as a square/box that does seem to track across the screen with movement input, but. I cannot seem to reset the error by turning off
 the monitor. Going into the monitor self-test shows clear and legible graphics, but the output from the desktop shows fuzzy with nothing usable. The only way to clear the presumed sync error is to hard-reboot the computer manually. It anecdotally started after
 a Windows 10 update in October 2017. Diagnostics for the monitor and motherboard show that (as of Nov 5, 2017) the drivers are up to date. Any idea on what broke, and how to fix it?</span>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A possible reason why you're experiencing display issues after your computer wakes up is due to corrupted system files on your computer. We recommend that you run the System File Checker. System File Check
<span>is&nbsp;a utility available in Windows 10 that checks for system file corruption. If the issue isn't resolved by performing the SFC, kindly use DISM. DISM is used to troubleshoot errors that SFC can't resolve.</span></p>

Using System File Checker in Windows 10</a> and follow the on-screen instructions. In the event that SFC wasn't able to resolve the issue, click on
<strong>More info on System File Checker</strong> and go to DISM on the thread for the steps.</span></p>

<p>Since the system didn't detect any system issues, can you further verify what was the diagnostics you perform to check the monitor and motherboard's versions? You may want to also check for your video card and motherboard's hardware manufacturer to see if
 the versions that they have available for download is the same as what you currently have.</p>

            Had same issue after latest Windows 10 update. Going to the settings to manually update the driver again worked for me. System&gt;Display&gt;Display adapter properties&gt;Properties&gt;Driver&gt;Update Driver. Hope this helps. Otherwise, some users tried rolling back
 the driver instead and it worked for them.

<p>I am having a similar issue with my Intel HD Graphics 530 Driver which had been updated on 7/24/17. Driver Version: 22.20.16.4749. I attempted to use the roll back driver option, but it was not available on my computer. How do I get an older driver, or will
 Windows have an update for this issue? I have seen this same problem with Display Driver Versions 22.20.16 on many forums. Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You seemed to have the older driver version.</p>
<p>This is where I go to update or roll back the driver. Do you not have this option available?</p>

            So I went to the window you show in the image. It says my driver is up to date. And I have the roll back driver button, but I can't use it. Is there a way I can download the Driver: 22.20.16.4836 and install it?

    <title>New Dell is very slow, but new issues make it unusable - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            New Dell is very slow, but new issues make it unusable</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a Dell 3531 last year. I know it is a weak unit. 4GB ram and 500GB HD. It is not a touchscreen (I did not want one) and came with windows 8. I recently did the free 10 upgrade. When I bought it, I made it a point to put as little as possible on
 it. I have installed: Office, QuickBooks, Chrome, Malwarebytes, and a few other insignificant things. Other than that, NOTHING is on this. All files are on cloud or USB. It defrags weekly and I run malwarebytes maybe once per month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issues: This thing has been a snail since I bought it. Even after the 10 upgrade, its very slow. Examples: opening Excel takes literally 12+ seconds. When I am navigating through windows explorer and I click on folders, there is a slight delay. When I
 type in Word, the words will have a slight delay before appearing. When I right click on objects, there is a slight delay before the menu pops up. I could keep going on, but in general, nearly all tasks are delayed, and the ones that are bigger (like opening
 an application) are proportionally larger in delay time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The newer issue: the system runs SIGNIFICANTLY slow, being nearly unusable, when I am at another person's house. I am not even referring to internet speed here. I mean when I am at someone's house, Excel takes 20 seconds to open. I am not exaggerating here
 and cannot see why this would happen. Internet is literally unusable, no matter what their speed is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall, this is ridiculous. The machine seems bogged down, but there is nothing that would cause this that I can see. My only guess is that I disabled some setting accidentally when I first bought it that is causing it to run slow. At work, I use a machine
 with XP that has far less HD and ram with a lot of garbage on it and it outperforms my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dustin</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Not Genuine</h2>
                    <p>Seems I have a lot of company on this issue. &nbsp;Running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit on a Lenovo X61, which was activated and ran fine for some period of time. &nbsp;Decided to dual-boot the machine with Windows XP, in order to run some older software. &nbsp;Both copies
 of software are legit. &nbsp;However, after setting up the dual-boot, which included some manual config of the boot manager, I've started getting the "Windows not genuine" pop-ups. &nbsp;Have run the MGA Diag utility, but, can make no sense of it. &nbsp;Would appreciate
 if someone can decipher this and help me out on a resolution. &nbsp;Here's the output;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have Medion Akoya and I solved the fn key problem by desactivating Synoptics pointing (go to "show hidden icons" on the bottom right) then we are able to uninstall Synoptics pointing device in "install/uninstall programs".</p>
<p>Restart computer and the keyboard will work again as before Win 10.</p>
<p>I hope this will help you.</p>

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Try resetting the problematic apps:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-apps-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-apps-in-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't works, try re-registering Mail &amp; Calendar apps. Perform these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search. 
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and see if the issue is resolved now. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

                    I just installed Windows 7 onto my 30GB SSD and it says "1.08GB free of 29.7GB" I haven't even installed any other programs...is Windows 7 64-bit supposed to be this big?<br />

<p><span>Hello, txprelude</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 7!</span></p>
<p><span>For 64bit it should be roughly 20GB. More space can be taken up by updates and system restore points created by updates and software/driver installations. You can try running
 disk cleanup to see if this is the case or not.</span></p>
<p><span>You may be able to find others with a similar setup on the Windows 7 Support forums at the following link:

            The 30GB figure, is that GB or GiB, before or after format? And don't forget about the space pagefile.sys and hyberfil.sys use. Clean out your temp folder.<br />
<br />
'Are there any other background programs which might be taking up space?' - Every program you install onto your system drive takes up space, but I guess you know that. :)<br />
<br />
After installing everything I need, disabling hybernation and as always putting the pagefile on a seperate HDD, my Win7 x64 takes up 12.3 GB.<br />

    <title>WINDOWS 10 UPDATE DELETED ALL MY FILES - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> isobelwilkes  say:</h3>
<h2>            WINDOWS 10 UPDATE DELETED ALL MY FILES</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 deleted all my files when the update first happened around a month ago, and after looking online I found my old documents in the windows.old folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>However a few days after this Windows began another update which clearly said 'all your files are still in the same place' yet when I turned my laptop back on my documents had all gone again, and now the windows.old folder is empty</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find the documents using search, and they're not in the recycle bin or another user profile either</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions how to find them? They can't have just been completely deleted by Windows? Thanks!</p>

                    Prior to upgrading to Windows 8 Pro, I ran a compatibility report on my computer (running Windows 7) and Microsoft Accounting 2009 came up under the "For your review" section. It suggested I go the to app website for help.&nbsp; I am aware that both products
 have been discontinued. They both still work however. So, very simply, are they compatible with Windows 8?&nbsp; I cannot find any information.&nbsp;

            Microsoft Office Accounting 2009 will NOT install on Windows 8.&nbsp; Windows 8 will not let you install the version of SQL that loads with Office Accounting.

            <p>In fact Windows 8 WILL let you install Office Accounting 2009 if you ignore the warnings about compatability of SQL Express 2005. Once installed it works fully appart from&nbsp;the multi-user option. I've yet to get this to work and it appears to be a networking
 issue, rather than OA itself.</p>

    <title>Bandeja do Xbox abrindo sozinha - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bandeja do Xbox abrindo sozinha</h2>
                    
<p>Galera, primeira vez que posto no fórum e espero que possam me ajudar.</p>
<p>A uma semana o meu xbox tá abrindo a bandeja no meio do jogo, tipo, to jogando e durante o jogo a tela fica preta e a luz do console começa a piscar como se eu tivesse tocado no botão de ejetar o disco, e depois de alguns segundos vai pra a tela de inicio
 do console mas a bandeja não abre e fica aparecendo a mensagem "abrindo bandeja" e só... Depois que clico pra ejetar o disco ele aparece "fechando bandeja" e logo após aparece "abrindo bandeja" novamente.Só abre mesmo se eu insistir.</p>
<p>Eu não sei o que eu faço... Já mudei o console de posição,já ví vídeos, pensei até em abrir ele... E tá na garantia ainda mas tenho medo de levar numa assistência e eles trocarem as peças por outras vagabundas e o erro persistir ou voltar com erros piores.</p>
<p>O que sugerem ? KKKK'</p>

<p>Duas opções:</p>
<p>op1: ou vc leva na assistencial técnica se tiver na garantia, ou manda para alguma loja especializada caso não tenha mais garantia.</p>
<p>op2: ou seu Xbox tá possuído pelo o capeta, dai só levando para uma espírita ou pai de santo para resolver kkk ' - brincadeira, tente a op1.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<p><span>It is possible that c<span>orruption in your Windows Live Calendar folder in Windows Live Mail is causing the issue. P</span>lease rename your Calendar folder using the steps below:<br />
<br />
1</span><span>. Close WL Mail, and any other WL programs<br />
</span><span>2. Click Start (then Run for Windows XP), paste the following path and press Enter<br />
</span><span><strong>%<span>Localappdata</span>%\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Calendars<br />
</strong></span><span>3. Rename the folder of the account you use to sign in to Windows Live Mail to sync your calendar (ex. rename *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***).<br />
</span><span>4. Restart your computer for changes to take effect.<br />
</span><span>5. Launch WL Mail again.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</span></p>
