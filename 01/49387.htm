<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you can't find a file on your computer or you accidently modified or deleted a file, you can restore it from a backup (if you're using
<span>Windows</span> backup) or you can try to restore it from a
<span>previous version</span>. Previous versions are copies of files and folders that
<span>Windows</span> automatically saves as part of a restore point. Previous versions are sometimes referred to as
<span>shadow copies</span>. </span></p>

<p>Hi Cheryl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you logged in as an administrator?</li><li>Have you installed Webroot Antivirus?</li></ol>
<div>
<p>You might not be able to access the Wi-Fi settings of the system without logging in but we may try to fix the "Your PC is offline" error.</p>
<p>We usually receive this error message if we have typed the password incorrectly. We can also get this error message if&nbsp;we login to the computer for the first time after resetting&nbsp;the password online.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to first check if the CAPs lock is on and try the correct password once again.&nbsp;As you have recently reset the password online, I would suggest you to login with the old password and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>As&nbsp;you have reset the password and if you are unable to login with the correct password, then I would suggest you to check the steps mentioned by AlSevilla replied on February 19, 2013 here:</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade will not start - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dbb008  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade will not start</h2>
                    <p>From Windows 7, I used the "get Windows 10" application to reserve a copy of Windos 10, then chose "Upgrade Now".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I am taken to a "downloading" screen with a spinner but no information. After a few seconds, this window closes and I am just taken to Control Panel &gt; Windows Update, which tells me that Windows is up-to-date and no upgrades are available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I also tried following the "Upgrade Now" link from the Windows 10 website, which had the exact same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how exactly am I supposed to proceed with the upgrade from this point?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the advice. Unfortunately this method also did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried using the Media Creation Tool to start the upgrade, and that failed too with the unhelpful notification of "Something when wrong in determining</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the tips here:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/3f6zml/sorry_were_having_trouble_determining_if_your_pc/</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.askvg.com/fix-something-happened-error-message-in-windows-10-upgrade/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that the registry key mentioned at the end of that article was wrong on my machine and changed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>However, I believe the main problem was that I had a primary Linux partition (sda2) on the drive that was marked as active (i.e. boot flag enabled).</strong> It seems really silly that this stopped windows from upgrading considering that my C: drive
 was on a separate, primary partition (sda1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I booted Linux Mint from USB, ran gparted, then set the partition flags so that sda1 had the boot flag and sda2 did not. (Note: I am not using UEFI so I did NOT have to remove GRUB from the MBR or reinstall the Windows Boot Loader. The upgrade went fine
 with grub in place.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this, the upgrade worked and I am running Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            I bought Fallout 4, there is no Russian localization</h2>
                    
<p>Good afternoon. The matter is that I live in Spain, but arrived from Russia. Therefore on my Xbox One I choose the region - Russia, and free, Gold, games are established in Russian. But when it is necessary to get game, I pass into the region Spain and I
 pay for game with the Spanish cash card, then I pass into the region Russia, and I begin game installation already in this region. Earlier, all bought games were established with the Russian localization, but bought by me, Fallout4, was established without
 Russian, and even without Spanish, completely English-speaking. How it is possible to localize game? I hope for your help. Yours faithfully.</p>

<h2>            Computer crashes PAID support, I think not</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently contacted microsoft support, and I was astounded to discover microsoft expected me to PAY for them to fix my computer that THEIR operating system (windows 10) broke.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is my computer keeps crashing, with errors such as BAD_POOL_CALLER, or BAD_POOL_HEADER. The error files can be found here:&nbsp;https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=6F294D80B5D8B123!5587&amp;authkey=!AOWRv9pEbHd5l9M&amp;ithint=file%2czip</p>
<p>I already asked about how to fix these crashes on this forum and I was told to run verifer, which I haven't yet got round to doing, as I think it takes a while. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyway, this is my question:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft support were going to take remote control of my computer and fix it, but I apparently had to pay. So, can somebody from Microsoft please tell me what microsoft support were going to do, and I will do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

<p>1) While repairing using Windows 10 installation media, you cannot perform any operation on the system. This process will restore the corrupted files in the System.</p>
<p>2) No, by repairing the system, the data's present in the system will wont get effected. Just the corrupted files in the system will get restored.</p>

            It a driver issue i believe. I google&nbsp;L1X63x64.sys and no results back. I had a similar problem&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL that was my network driver. I couldn't load up to the
 start up screen. what i had to was enter advance options, when you start you machine up and the windows logo appears and the load circle appears hit the power button. and shut it down and turn it back on due this 3 or 4 more times. once in go into safe mode
 with networking. try updating all your drivers. I don't know which driver it is but it is one. With my network driver i had to uninstall it from safe mode and reinstall in safe mode then do my restart and that solved my issue</span>

<h2>            O365 user sign issues on AAD Joined HP Thin Client</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP T630 Windows 10 Ent. Embedded IoT x64 thin client machine.</p>
<p>It has been successfully joined to&nbsp;my company&nbsp;AAD.</p>
<p>However at the sign in window when I choose "other user" and input a test users credentials I receive a message that the account and or password is incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is not a network issue, as I have other windows 10 thin client devices (not T630s)&nbsp;on the same network that I can successfully log into with a test user account including the test user account that fails on my T630s.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is occurring on all&nbsp;my T630's and so far&nbsp;only on my T630's.</p>
<p>The obvious answer is that there is an issue with the out-of-the box image on these T630's.</p>
<p>HP does not&nbsp;seem to know what it is, they are working on it but who knows...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone experienced this issue before on any windows 10 device?</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the September 29 update, I now receive the following 4 errors in my event log after every reboot.&nbsp; The Source is "AppReadiness".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Event 10:&nbsp; </p>

<span>
<p>The Appx operation 'RegisterPackageAsync' on 'Microsoft.AccountsControl_10.0.14393.206_neutral_neutral_cw5n1h2txyewy' failed for user 'Qwinn' - . (Error: Install failed. Please contact your software vendor.)</p>

</p><p>I haven't found any other symptoms yet, but I haven't&nbsp;used the system much either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Local Account rather than a Microsoft account, by the way.</p>
</span></span></span>
<p>
</p><p>I was running pretty close to a clean event log (a miracle itself) until this update.&nbsp; Please advise how to resolve.</p>

            <p>I'm getting the exact same errors. Previously had nil errors in event log. This has only happened after the forced&nbsp;Cumulative Update&nbsp;(KB3194496). I did a system restore and errors disappeared but update automatically reinstalled and errors returned.</p>
<p>Please don't reply with standard Microsoft answers of run SFC or create new user profiles etc, these errors are to do with&nbsp;(KB3194496). Microsoft must start to give an option to not install updates automatically in Win 10.</p>

<p>I am going to uninstall the last update [KB3194496] and go from there.</p>
<p>It seems this update, that is causing the errors, is so new that it has not been reconciled as yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All four errors [10 &amp; 214] say 'Contact Your Software Vendor' so obviously MS Windows is the vendor and they want us to contact them about their update....go figure.<br />

<p>I don't know if it's related to the KB3194496 update because I haven't installed this update yet but I have these errors. In fact a lot of errors have appeared after windows 10 anniversary update on my system.</p>

<h2>            Attachments automatically open when opening an email</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>From: </b>TexasSmile</p>
<p>When I open an email in Windows Mail (Vista), if it has an attachment, the attachment opens at the bottom of the email. It still has the paperclip that I can click on and look at the attachment.
<br />
<br />
I am afraid that sometime I am going to open an email that has a virus in the attachment, and with it opening automatically, I will get the virus.
<br />
<br />
Is there a way to set it up so that it doesn't open automatically?<b>
<br />
<br />
</b>Thank you</p>

<p>Attachments don't open automatically, unless it is a .jpg picture.</p>
<p><span>..JPG files are mostly harmless, and for the few that aren't, your antivirus will block it. I'm not sure how to keep images from showing. Try Tools, Options, Read, "Read all messages in plain text".
 Also, Tools, Options, Security, "Block images..." <br />

</p><p><span><span>Hi, </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I understand that you are facing issues with the Flight Simulator game on Windows 8.1. I will try to help you with this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please answer these questions to get more clarity on this issue:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>What is the error message you get while trying to launch this game?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Did you make any changes to the pc prior to this issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Have you installed all pending updates on the pc?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Is the issue specific to this game?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you are unable to launch the game then you can boot the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue persists. When you start Microsoft Windows, typically there are several programs that start automatically
 and run in the background that may interfere with the system. These programs may include antivirus and system utility programs. When you perform a clean startup procedure, you prevent these programs from starting automatically.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow the steps under “<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>” in the article to boot to normal startup.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you are not able to install this game then you may install this game in compatibility mode to check if that helps. Refer to this article to know more.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows:

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for the reply and update.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would encourage you to perform the clean boot step to check if that helps. I t is a very simple step. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that
 occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have the game setup files then you can go ahead with the game uninstallation and then re-install the game in compatibility mode to check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Keep us informed to help you further.</span></p>

    <title>80090304 error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> i sniff cat nip  say:</h3>
<h2>            80090304 error</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Xbox community, i have been having this problem lately with the Xbox's in my house hold. I am one of the three Xbox Live accounts in my house and we are all experiencing the same error. This only started happening recently, i would try to sign into
 my account as usual and it will make me confirm my email and password but then give me the error 80090304 message. I have looked this up on these forums and i do the following as to delete my profile and clear the cashe, then re-download the profile. Again,
 this problem is on ALL three of the Xbox's. The first time i did it, it worked for about an hour but then it kicked me off. Ever since then i have to delete my profile, then restart my internet from the modem, then re download the profile. We have to do this
 every time someone wants to use their Xbox Live. When we get one Xbox Live working, it will work until you turn it off. When you turn it back on again we would have to go through this whole process again (sometimes it doesn't work and we have to restart everything
 and re-download the profiles several times) Is there any possible way to avoid this problem we are having? The internet seems to be working fine because i am using it on the computer all the time and as i type this. Please help it is extremely frustrating.
 Thank you.</p>

<p>HI,</p>
<p>Here is the full article of the issue which you are having. Please check these solutions and follow them as the delete, clear, re-download is not always enough as the issue might be somewhere else.</p>
<p>Error 80090304 occurs when you try to connect to Xbox LIVE</p>
<p>You see the following error when you try to connect to Xbox LIVE:</p>
<p>80090304 </p>
<p>This may mean one of the following:</p>
<p>•The billing information for your account needs to be updated.</p>
<p>•The cache information on your Xbox console needs to be refreshed.</p>
<p>•There is a problem with your connection to Xbox LIVE.</p>
<p>Solutions</p>
<p>Solution 1: Verify your Microsoft Account security information</p>
<p>1.Sign in to your Microsoft account. </p>
<p>Note If you have forgotten your password or can’t sign in using your password, reset your password.
</p>
<p>2.Click Edit security info. </p>
<p>3.Verify your security information. For example, make sure that your Phone number, Alternate email address, and Security question information is correct.
</p>
<p>4.Verify the other information in your Microsoft account. Make sure that the billing address for your Xbox LIVE account matches the billing address used by your credit card company. Also make sure that your Xbox LIVE account payment information, including
 capitalisation, matches the information that is used by your credit card company.</p>
<p>5.Sign out of your Microsoft account and then sign in again. </p>
<p>6.On your console, try to connect to Xbox LIVE. </p>
<p>Solution 2: Delete the profile from Xbox console, clear the system cache three times, then re-download the profile</p>
<p>To delete the profile that’s stored on your Xbox console:</p>
<p>1.Go to Settings and select System Settings. </p>
<p>2.Select Storage. </p>
<p>3.Select All Devices. </p>
<p>4.Select Profiles. </p>
<p>5.Select the gamertag that you want to delete. </p>
<p>6.Select Delete. </p>
<p>7.Select Delete Profile Only. This deletes the profile but leaves saved games and achievements.
</p>
<p>Important Do not select Delete Profile and Items. This deletes the profile and the associated games and achievements.
</p>
<p>To clear the system cache three times:</p>
<p>1.Press the Guide button on your controller.</p>
<p>2.Go to Settings and select System Settings. </p>
<p>3.Select Storage. </p>
<p>4.Highlight any storage device, and then press Y on your controller. (It doesn't matter which storage device you select; the cache will be cleared for all storage devices.)</p>
<p>5.Select Clear System Cache.</p>
<p>6.When prompted to confirm storage device maintenance, select Yes.</p>
<p>7.Repeat steps 4 to 6 two more times so that you’ve cleared your system cache a total of three times in a row.</p>
<p>To download your Xbox LIVE profile, follow these steps: </p>
<p>1.Press the Guide button on your controller. </p>
<p>2.Select Download Profile. </p>
<p>Note If you don’t see the Download Profile option, it probably means you’re signed in to your profile. Press X to sign out.
</p>
<p>3.Enter the Microsoft account that’s associated with your Xbox Live gamertag. If you don’t know your Microsoft account or password, see Find your Microsoft account or password.
</p>
<p>Note If your account is an Xbox LIVE child account, you have to use the parent’s Microsoft account to download the profile.
</p>
<p>4.Select the storage device for your profile (for example, Hard Drive). </p>
<p>Your profile will begin downloading. </p>
<p>After your profile downloads, restart the console and then try to connect to Xbox LIVE.
</p>
<p>Solution 3: Troubleshoot your Xbox LIVE connection</p>
<p>If you are still experiencing the problem, troubleshoot your Xbox LIVE connection. (

                    <p>I'm trying to connect the wireless computer I own to my laptop, but there's an error message saying Windows cannot find a suitable printer driver and according to my computer, it's WSD Print Device. What do I do? Is there somewhere I can download it?</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model of your printer?<br />
<br />
2. Did the manufacturer provide you with any driver CD/DVD for the printer? If not, please contact the respective manufacturer and ask them to provide the drivers online or shipped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check if the model is compatible with windows 7 or not, also if there are any updated drivers made available by the manufacturer of the printer.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Try uninstalling the printer completely from the computer including the driver software. To uninstall device<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1:<br />
</strong><br />
a) Click on Start menu, type in devmgmt.msc to open the Device Manager. <br />
<br />
b) The Device Manager will then display a list of installed devices in the right pane of the console.
<br />
<br />
c) Expand the category for Printer. <br />
<br />
d) Right-click the device and select Uninstall<br />
<br />
e) A dialog box will pop up asking you to confirm ‘Uninstall’. Click OK to proceed.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: While you are uninstalling the printer make sure that you select the option to delete the driver software as well.<br />
<strong><br />
Step 2:</strong><br />
<br />
Also delete the drivers by going to the below given location.<br />
<br />
a) Open Devices and Printers by going to start menu<br />
<br />
b) Select the Printer installed<br />
<br />
c) Click on ‘<strong>Print server properties</strong>’<br />
<br />
d) Go to Driver tab, delete all the drivers listed other than ‘Microsoft XPS Document Write’ and ‘Send to Microsoft OneNote Driver’<br />
<br />
Now try installing the printer and check if that helps.<br />

<h3> matt261  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reset Windows 10 Mail App</h2>
                    <p>I need to reset the history / settings for the Windows Mail app. <strong>I have already removed the app</strong> via the "get-appxpackage *microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps* | remove-appxpackage" command in powershell and reinstalled it via the webstore
 / powershell command. When I start the app <em>after</em> reinstalling, it already has all of my accounts listed which is
<strong>not what I want.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to change my primary e-mail account from "Hotmail / LIVE" to "Office 365" and this is the only way to do that without resetting my entire PC. What folder / registry path / cloud option is holding these credentials so I can setup my mail app from scratch?</p>
<p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Are you using Microsoft account or Local account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Microsoft account, the account will automatically sync with Mail app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even after re-installing mail app you will still see the account which is configured&nbsp;with your Microsoft account as default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can still add another account and sync the contacts to Mail app. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to remove the contacts of the main account, then you can use web interface to login to your main account and you can delete the contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As default Mail app will use your Microsoft account, <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I would like to request you to post you feedback in the Windows 10 Feedback app.</span><span>

<p>I'm an American living in Ecuador, and I'm currently in the states visiting. I am wondering if an Xbox One will connect in Ecuador if I get one. I had an Xbox 360 and it connected fine.<br />
<br />
In truth, I only care about being able to play video games online with my friends. I care nothing about TV channels, etc.<br />

If anyone can answer my question, please let me know. <br />

                    When I download iTunes the program install is pointed to the wrong drive. itunes will then not install and flags invalid drive. How do I change the destination as the installer gives no option as to where I want to install (even when I click download as
 administrator)

    <title>Upgrade Windows 10 with Windows Media center - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donaldbucsi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade Windows 10 with Windows Media center</h2>
                    It seems to me that since so many of us use windows media center that Microsoft would add it to windows 10. Does anyone know how to start a petition to ask Microsoft to add WMC to W 10. Not sure if there are enough of us or if it would have any pull with
 a decision, but if someone would start it up I would sign. I won't upgrade to W 10 with out&nbsp;it&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;will search for an alternative platform that has something similar. If they are a little short on money, I would be willing to pay a Buck or two for it. I
 have been using Windows for 13 years and I'm&nbsp; very&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;satisfied. Some times there is strength in numbers, can we be counted?????

            <p><strong>Is Media Center supported&nbsp;in Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>No. Persons who need to use Media Center should consider carefully before upgrading from their previous version of Windows. The Windows 10 upgrade will automatically remove any installations of Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So what are the alternatives if I need Media Center?</strong></p>
<p>Your best option is to continue running your existing version of Windows with Media Center.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 editions that include Media Center will continue to be supported until January 2020.</li><li>Windows 8 Pro with Media Center will continue to be supported until January 2023.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Will Windows Media Center be available in Windows&nbsp;10?</strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Windows Media Center is not part of Windows&nbsp;10 and won’t be available after upgrading to Windows 10. If you use Windows Media Center, we will alert you during upgrade that Windows Media Center is not available on Windows&nbsp;10. We know that some users use Windows
 Media Center to play DVDs, and we are providing a free DVD playback app in Windows&nbsp;10 for Windows Media Center users.</p>

WMC is not included on Windows 10 if you have WMC on previous windows versions you need to remove that in Windows 10 and include the third party apps like cyber-link power suite or cyber-link power DVD or other like software products

            I did your suggestions, and nothing worked. Then I have an ideo to try it on new account, so I delete and recreated my account, and it fixed.<br />
So the problem isn't on my PC, but on my user account. But thanks anyway 😊<br />
