    <title>Password Screen Refreshing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Password Screen Refreshing</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I posted a thread about this a while back, but it seemed no one got back to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had been using the desktop version of Skype for a very long time, and then one day something must've updated, because instead of auto-logging me in, it wanted my username and password. I put in my screen name, then it moves me to a screen for my password.
 I type it in, press the button, and it doesn't sign me in, i just refreshes that screen. It's been doing this since early December.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling normally and reinstalling, and then I tried uninstalling using REVO Uninstaller to make sure every last speck of it was gone before doing a clean install. It still does this exact thing. I have also tried purposely entering a wrong
 password, or signing in with a different account, nothing. I combined my Skype account with my microsoft account, same thing. I then tried running it as administrator, and running it without my firewall/virus scanner on, same deal. I then searched the web
 far and wide, I can't seem to find a fix for this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this incident first happened, I had to re sign into skype on my tablet, as well, but that went off without a hitch. It seems to only be the desktop version of Skype that's doing this. I used the web version and that worked, but wasn't really convenient.
 I've been forced to get the app off the microsoft store and use that, but I don't really care for it. So I tried a bunch of things and was only able to narrow the problem down to it being just that version of Skype that doesn't want to behave. I just want
 my desktop version to work. =(&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Victoria</p>

                    <p>I bought FIFA 18 Ronaldo Edition, on my account, but the child plays on his own account with a subscription EA (he is added to my family), the problem is that he can not get the idol FUT for rent for 3 matches and 3000 FIFA Points. Tell me what you need to do to activate these add-ons on his account.</p>

    <title>Mystery program keeps trying to open - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mystery program keeps trying to open</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>After a recent windows update, I now have a what looks like a program that keeps trying to open. But it never does. So what happens is the wee circle by the curser that comes on when the computer is working, comes on every 1-2 seconds when typing, it will
 miss letters as I type also In drop down boxes, they never stay open, just close after a second. I cant select the windows topic while writing this because the box closes before I can select. And in the task bar, there is a thin bar that is open when you are
 using that app, it &nbsp;flashes just or a second repeatedly. Also, it seems it may be making my laptop warmer than usual for very light use.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very annoying because it stops my whole laptop to stop working properly</p>
<p>How can I see what is trying to open so I can try to stop it?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>It seems that your computer is infected by virus and malware.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let's try the following steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Step 1: </strong>Run a virus Scan</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run Full Virus Scan using Windows Defender.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/how-to-protect-your-windows-10-pc#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/how-to-protect-your-windows-10-pc#v1h=tab01</span></span></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Run SFC Scan.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>What is SFC (System File Checker)?</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">System File Checker</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Follow the steps given in the below article to perform<strong> SFC scan</strong>:</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Step 3: </strong>If the issue persists, then perform a
<strong>Clean boot </strong>and let's find which program is causing this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would suggest you to place the computer in a Clean Boot state and see if the issue is related to&nbsp;any software conflicts that may arise the issue.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Please follow below the below steps.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1.&nbsp; To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting". Steps applies to Windows 10 as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Disclaimer:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install
 a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your
 computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists.
 If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let us know the status of the issue. We will be glad to assist you further.</span></span></p>

            The design of Windows Live Movie Maker does not currently allow for J cuts (audio starts in prior clip) or L cuts (audio continues into next clip). It only has a straight split (on the Video Tools tab). If you think J and L cuts are a worthy feature addition,
 suggest it at <a href="http://feedback.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">feedback.live.com</a>.&nbsp; I will say that the mantra of WLMM has been to simplify the process of creating video as much as possible, so I expect more advanced features like J and L cuts are not
 on Microsoft's roadmap, but you never know. Personally, I would enjoy having the option.

            <p>Unfortunately not in the latest version of WLMM, at least not directly.&nbsp; The only way to accomplish this in WLMM would be to find a way to extract the audio from your video and use it as your "added music" track.&nbsp; You would take the first 5 seconds of this,
 use it as the "music" with the 5 second photo.&nbsp; You'd also then have to manually trim out 5 seconds from the original video so it picks up where the "music" stops.</p>
<p>In the original Movie Maker (e.g. WMM 2.x or WMM 6.0) you could directly drag a video down to the added audio/music track and then mute the original. You then replace 5 seconds of video with a picture (or perhaps the end of another clip).&nbsp; WLMM will not
 let you use video files as your added audio/music however thus the extra step to convert to an audio file.</p>

<p>I'm unable to delete fonts in Windows 7, I know that I'm supposed to be able to, however when I try it tells me the font is in use and can't be deleted. &nbsp;I've tried all of the suggestions available across the web with no success. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Chloe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is related to the keyboard configuration problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following steps below and see if it resolves the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press <strong>Windows key + spacebar.</strong></p>
<p>2. See if you can toggle between <strong>English keyboard (QWERTY) </strong>and
<strong>German keyboard (QWERTZ) </strong>by pressing the spacebar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you have other concerns.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Update Renders Touchpad Unresponsive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mact26  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update Renders Touchpad Unresponsive</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>i have recently installed Windows 10 on my Asus X450C series and am having some trouble with the touchpad. The cursor is frozen and will not respond to any clicking or movement. What's weird is that is seems to work perfectly fine at the log in screen, but
 shortly after logging in the curser freezes in place and becomes unresponsive. I have tried the the solution of going into Devices-Mouse &amp; touchpad- additional mouse options- and then selecting Enable in the √âLAN tab. This works to the extent that I am able
 to move the cursor around again, but still cannot click anything. The cursor will light up tabs and everything as if it is working but will not left or right click. If I turn the laptop off, it will revert to being frozen when I sign in again (and yes, I did
 select "apply"). I have tried every option out there (besides completely uninstalling windows 10) including the obvious solutions like shutting down the laptop. Please let me know if anyone else has this issue and has a solution.</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello! Thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>i have tried both methods described above but unfortunately the problem still persists. The troubleshooting method found nothing wrong, and I attempted to update the Driver for the √âLAN Input device but it said that everything was up to date.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>

            Hey, I have discovered the solution to the problem. Open up the device manager by pressing the windows key and X and selecting the device manager. Using the tab button and arrow keys, go down to "Mice and Other pointing devices", then hit the right arrow
 key to select the sub heading and hit enter. From the new window, move over to the driver tab and select "update driver". From here, select the "Browse my computer for driver software" option. Then select "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer".
 If you had the same problem as me then your device driver was set on the √âLAN Input device. Instead, select the "Microsoft PS/2 Mouse" and select next. The driver will install and then just restart your laptop and the touchpad should work once again.&nbsp;

<p>Like it doesn't suck enough that I over paid for a xbox one, day one edition with the worthless kenitx. This pile of
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>&nbsp;can't do anything without being unplugged from the wall first.....</p>
<p>Where is the <strong>[Mod Removed]&nbsp;</strong>support Microsoft????? This pile of
<strong>[Mod Removed]&nbsp;</strong>has been out for almost a year and we are still facing day one release date issues!</p>
<p>Every <strong>[Mod Removed]&nbsp;</strong>app/game results in a black loading screen that can only go away by unplugging it from the wall and turning it back on. It doesn't matter how many times I hit the power button, nothing clears it other than unplugging
 it. And after a hour or two the problem comes right back. This is utter <strong>
[Mod Removed]</strong>! I'm beyond ready to shove this pile of <strong>[Mod Removed]&nbsp;</strong>back up the
<strong>[Mod Removed]&nbsp;</strong>it came out of!!!</p>
<p>It's extremely <strong>[Mod Removed]&nbsp;</strong>annoying that I have a <strong>[Mod Removed]&nbsp;</strong>+$500 paperweight and I have to use my 360 to play games and watch netflix. Well soon it will be a ps4, cause this is just stupid... No wonder why they are
 not selling....</p>

<p>Hey xB3RTOx,</p>
<p>This issues sounds like a problem with some corrupted data, and can easily be resolved. Just follow these steps, and it should fix it up.</p>
<p>1) Clear the persistent storage 3 times....Settings----&gt;disc and blue ray------&gt;Persistent storage, and clear persistent storage</p>
<p>2) Perform a hard reset...Turn off the console, unplug all the cords connect to your console, place your finger on the power button for 30 seconds, plug everything back in, and then turn on your console.
</p>
<p>If this doesn't cause a permanent fix, please respond to this thread so I can continue to help you</p>

<p>I m having issues with netflix and amazon as well. &nbsp;Works for a while then it errors out. &nbsp;Not while watching but on a random start-up of the app. &nbsp;My only fix so far was hard reset, but I will try Spyroman's technique and see what happens. &nbsp;It usually takes
 about a week or two for it to act up.</p>

    <title>The built-in SD card reader on my Dell Vostro&#47;Win 7 Pro Laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sexauerw  say:</h3>
<h2>            The built-in SD card reader on my Dell Vostro&#47;Win 7 Pro Laptop suddenly stopped working and is invisible. I don&#39;t know how to troubleshoot it because I don&#39;t know its device name.  Suggestions&#63;</h2>
                    The SD card works OK when plugged in through an adapter into a USB port so it's not a problem with the card. And the built-in reader has always worked OK in the past. But today it's just like there's no reader in the computer even though the card is plugged
 into it. When I use the Device Manager to see what devices there are in the machine there's a long list, most of which have names that don't mean anything to me. I can't for the life of me figure out which one, if any, might be the SD card reader. Even just
 knowing that one piece of information would be a big help to me.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Arc mouse recognized but not working</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Microsoft Arc mouse i got a couple of days ago.....i just got the opportunity to use it today, and when i inserted the dongle the System installed drivers and recognized the device as an Arc Mouse....but when i moved the mouse nothing would happen...When
 i fold and re-open the mouse the green light comes on for 20 secs. and then goes off again...and no blue light comes from the bottom of the mouse.</p>
<p>I've tried installing Intellipoint, to no avail....</p>
<p>Please advice!</p>

            <p>Hi - I actually found the issue and solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is related to the Microsoft power management feature on Bluetooth. You have to switch off Power Management for bluetooth mice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I found out the issue after I returned the device to Microsoft. Given that Microsoft knew of this feature I'm really surprised that:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>It's not mentioned in the user manuals for the Arc Mouse</li><li>It's not mentioned anywhere on the help advice provided by Microsoft</li><li>It's not publicised much at all</li></ol>
<p>I bought a Logitech mouse - which had the exact same issue, and it was then that I realised it was a systematic issue. I kept on digging and came across the answer that worked - turn off power management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm surprised that this is not made more transparent - I see from forums and others that it's a very big issue. Big fail for Microsoft on this one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, hope this helps others!</p>

            <p>There might be a problem with Firefox. Make sure you have the latest version. Download and install Chrome. You can have several browsers installed. Pick Chrome as the default for both email and browser temporarily and see if that works. If it does, check
 with firefox support for news about using it with windows 10. There have been reports of problems with earlier versions of firefox and win 10.&nbsp;</p>

I run this script a few times a week, whenever I don't have work running on my computer. &nbsp;windows update is also very good at deciding to destroy your work when you close a lid to move your laptop.. It then does a windows update when you need to finish the
 work that it just didn't save.</p>

<h2>            Surface Book &#43; Surface Dock &#43; External Monitors &#40;2x Dell S2415H&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Microsoft Surface Book. When I get home, I connect it to a Surface Dock, which is set up with two Dell S2415H monitors (as well as speakers, USB keyboard and mouse). I am having intermittent issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rarely, I will dock the Surface Book, and everything will work correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Often, I will dock the Surface Book, and the external monitors will be detected, but desktop icons will be oversized and clipped off. It is a superficial issue, and if this was the only issue, I would ignore it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, I will dock the Surface Book, and the two external monitors will be ignored. All other peripherals will work correctly. I will attempt to set the Projection mode to "PC Screen Only" and then back to "Extend," but this rarely fixes it. I usually
 have to Restart the Surface Book. Upon booting up, the issue is usually resolved, but sometimes I still have to toggle the Projection mode again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have completed the troubleshooting steps found here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/troubleshoot-docking-station-surface-dock" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/troubleshoot-docking-station-surface-dock</a>,&nbsp;including:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Check monitor compatibility (Dell S2415H is not on either the Known Bad list or the Known Good list)</li><li>Use an active adapter (using the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Mini-DisplayPort-to-HDMI-Adapter/productID.325726600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Mini DisplayPort to HDMI Adapter</a>)</li><li>Install Surface and Windows updates (Done and done repeatedly)</li></ul>
<p>I contacted Microsoft support via phone once before to much frustration and no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate some support on this issue.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi CoryOwens,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you take a little wander through the rest of the forum you will find that you are simply one of many experiencing these sorts of issues with the accursed Surface Dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are all waiting for a solution, but in the meantime, check out some of the other threads on this topic; there is little in the way of truly constructive help and lots of justified whinging, but there are a handful of things you can try that may help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fundamentally we need MS to get their fingers out and get the issues sorted out</p>

<p>I'm afraid that did not resolve the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I select "Extend desktop to this display" option and hit "Apply," a message appeared saying something to the effect of "Display settings could not be saved." I just attempted it again to reproduce the message, but instead, everything went dark for a
 few seconds, and then the settings were reverted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have attempted starting up the surface with the dock already connected, and I have attempted starting up the surface independently and then connecting the dock. Neither has resolved the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tonight, a new development has arisen. One of the monitors is being detected, but the other is not. If I disconnect the "working" monitor, the other monitor is detected. If I close the Surface book, both external monitors work. It's like the graphics card
 is suddenly only supporting two displays, when it supported three displays just earlier today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All of us Surface owners with external monitors are intimately familiar with the multiple monitor display settings because we spend time there every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Presently my external monitors are blank because while they're detected in the display settings, if I try to duplicate or extend to them, it's not allowed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll probably have to reboot a time or two more, then pat my head and click my heels to get it to work again... until the next time I disconnect and get to try this all over.</p>

    <title>Invididual application volume levels change on their own - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ghhgrrrr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Invididual application volume levels change on their own</h2>
                    <p>While using my computer, I can go days at a time without having to deal with this issue, which is what makes it even more frustrating when it does happen, as I don't know the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To begin, I'm on Windows 10, and while using my computer, I'll go to play music via Spotify, play a YouTube video in Chrome, or have a discussion with someone in Discord. Where everything was fine the last few times I'll have done these activities, every
 so often, the volume levels seem to have dropped dramatically. I'll right-click my volume icon in the taskbar, click on "Open Sound Settings", and then click on the option for "App volume and device preferences". Under here, there is the option to have application
 specific volume levels, and even though I'm constantly maxing them all out to 100%, somehow, they will have been lowered to like 10-20%. The frustrating part, is that it's not all of the applications. Just 1 or 2 out of the list, again, usually Chrome, Discord,
 Spotify, for my iCUE software for my Corsair headset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps I've taken to resolve this are making sure that each of these application are all up to date, making sure my device drivers are all up to date, going in to my "Sounds", going to the "Communications" tab, and making sure to check the "Do nothing" option
 under the option for "When Windows detects communications activity:". None of this seems to help, and as I stated previously, I haven't been able to find any kind of commonality between when it happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I had found an article relating the issue to Discord, but it was just referencing the "Do nothing" option I mentioned above. It did also make mention of Attentuation in Discord itself, but I have that feature disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something else I'm missing, or a way to disable application specific volume levels so that I can just have 1 master volume control? That' pretty much what I do anyways, as I max out all my application volumes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p><span>Hi
</span>ghhgrrrr<span>,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It happens that there's a corrupted file inside one of your system folders that is related to your sound drivers that causes the
 sound output inconsistent or not working at all. When a component of an operating system that involve audio devices has been missing or corrupted, your audio output will function in an unusual behavior.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here's what you can do:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1)">Important:
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The first thing to do is to install your device manually, you need to visit the website of the sound device manufacturer to check if there are latest drivers. You may believe that your
 drivers are already updated, but checking the version from the driver download website and comparing it to your driver will make it sure.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If haven't done it yet, we recommend installing it. If the latest drivers are now old or no longer available, you need to contact the audio device manufacturer directly through
 their support hotline for further assistance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>There‚Äôs a built-in utility called
<strong>System File Checker</strong> tool that helps users to perform scanning, repairing, and restoring of missing or corrupted files of a computer. You can visit this link:
 to know how to run this tool.</span></li><li><span>Perform a full system scan by using
<strong>Windows Defender</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Update your operating system to the latest version including the cumulative updates.</span></li><li><span>Make sure that your audio peripherals we‚Äôre plugged in properly.</span></li><li><span>Test your speaker or any sound output devices by replacing them. Try the other device if it does the same.</span></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>There‚Äôs a tool that helps troubleshoot sound issues in Windows. You can visit this link:
