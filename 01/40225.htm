    <title>Windows 10 not recognizing my headset - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 not recognizing my headset</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I have an ASUS Q524U laptop with Windows 10 64-bit. It has a single audio jack input.<br />
<br />
I also have a Plantronics Gamecom headset that has both a headphone and mic audio jack which I was able to use with my old laptop that had several audio inputs (audio-L, audio-R, mic in etc).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After speaking to ASUS tech support, they advised me to get a 3.5mm stereo splitter so that I can plug both audio jacks from the headset into the single jack on my laptop.<br />
<br />
When I tried this initially, the Realtek Audio Panel would pop up with a prompt asking to select my input but it only had 3 options - Mic In, Headphones or Stereo Output. There was no option for Headset.
<br />
<br />
When I selected Headphones, the headphones in my headset worked but the mic didn't. When I selected Mic In, neither worked.<br />
<br />
After viewing responses to other similar queries here, I browsed to the Sound Manager but Windows would not recognize my headset at all when I connected it, so I wasn't able to select it as my default device.<br />
<br />
I uninstalled the Realtek driver and rebooted the system hoping it would automatically update and correct the problem.<br />
<br />
After the reboot, I was briefly able to insert my headset and Windows responded to my headset connection but detected it only as headphones (not as a headset).
<br />
<br />
However, after Windows updated my Realtek audio driver, it no longer did this. So now I can't get Windows 10 to recognize my headset and I also don't have the Realtek Audio Manager, although I have downloaded the software from Realtek and could install it if
 I choose. However, I believe this will only lead me back to where I started. <br />
<br />
Is there any way to get Windows 10 to recognize my headset? Even when I remove the splitter and simply attach the headphone jack connection of my headset to my laptop, I get the automatic sound connection through my headset but no recognition in the Sound Manager.
<br />
<br />
Please advise how I can fix this problem. Thanks.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
We appreciate that you have provided a detailed information about what you have already tried to perform to resolve the issue with your headset. Since you were able to use the headset on your old laptop without issues and have already tried to use the splitter
 and it's still not working properly, we recommend that you contact the manufacturer of your headset. This is for you to verify if the headset is compatible with your computer.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further help with any Windows issue.

            Thanks for your quick reply.<br />
<br />
I got in touch with Plantronics customer support and after they looked up this headset model (Gamecom 377), they told me that it isn't supported with Windows 10 ("it may or may not work"), so I think I will just need to replace the headset.<br />
<br />
My old laptop had a Windows 7 operating system and it worked fine on there, so I'm fairly certain this current headset just isn't compatible with Windows 10.

1. Whever you save a file, regardless of what kind of file it is, and regardless of what program you are using to save it, you are given a choice of where to put it. Usually you are also given a default (almost certainly on C:), and if you don't change it,
 that's where the file goes. So when&nbsp;you get a dialog box that&nbsp;tells you where the file will be saved, use that dialog box&nbsp; (at least some of the time) to change to your second drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Almost certainly you do not have two drives, but rather two *partitions* on a single drive. Putting downloads on a second partition is fine, but putting backups there is not. It's better than no backup at all, but just barely. If the drive fails (or rather,
 *when* the drive fails, you will simultaneously lose the original and the backup. Even if it's a second physical drive,
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">I don't recommend backup to a second non-removable hard drive because it leaves you susceptible to simultaneous loss of the original and backup to many of the most common
 dangers: severe power glitches, nearby lightning strikes, virus attacks, even theft of the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">In my view, secure backup needs to be on removable media, and not kept in the computer. For really secure backup (needed, for example, if the life of your business depends
 on your data) you should have multiple generations of backup, and at least one of those generations should be stored off-site.</span></p>

When I click on disc drives in device manager, it shows 2 WDC WD5000BEVT-A0RT0. The only difference in device manager is the location, one is 0, the other one is 5. I don't know if it is one partitioned hd, or 2 different ones, but it looks more like 2 different
 ones. I will try and choose the other one - the empty one - to download whatever, but I am not sure I can.<br />
Of course, you are right about backing up on a separate drive. I do have one and use it, but it is not always on or there... Ir is just a home computer, but it ends up with a lot of things on, and things you care about!<br />

<h2>            WIN 10 &#124; Won&#39;t Start and auto repair can&#39;t fix &#124; Error Code 0xc0000221</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 did an update Saturday.&nbsp; After the update, my DAC driver was not communicating correctly with my software Roon.&nbsp; After restarting numerous times and plugging and unplugging the USB cable connecting the DAC with the PC, the machine froze.&nbsp; I did
 a hard reboot and the system came back with an error. The automatic repair could not fix the issue.&nbsp; It suggested a restore to an earlier point.&nbsp; The first restore point seemed to be the day of the update.&nbsp; I tried to restore to this point, but the system
 came back it was unable to restore.&nbsp; With that comment, it suggested restoring to an earlier point.&nbsp; I had not had the PC on for roughly a month as I was using a desktop during that time.&nbsp; I selected the next earliest restore point, which was basically October
 1, 2016.&nbsp; It indicated the restore was successful and to reboot.&nbsp; I rebooted and now I have a PC that can't even load up.&nbsp; I get the following bluescreen message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recovery</p>
<p>Your PC/Device needs to be repaired</p>
<p>
</p><p>The operating system couldn't be located because a required file is missing or contains errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File:&nbsp; storport.sys</p>
<p>Error Code:&nbsp; 0xc0000221</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll need to use recovery tools.&nbsp; If you don't have any installation media (like a disc or USB device) contact your PC Administrator or PC/Device manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not receive any of these from DELL but my machine came with Win 8.1 and was updated to WIN 10 as well as all the subsequent releases including the Anniversary edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine is a brick for all purposes right now as it only boots to the bluescreen and the CD/DVD ROM drive won't open at that screen.</p>

 with MS.</p>

            I have been working with Dell Premiere Support for the past week and really am no better than when I started. &nbsp;The only positive is I have a backup of the data. from the hard drive. &nbsp;We got back up to WIN 8.1 which came on the laptop but in trying to convert
 to WIN10 blew up the system again. &nbsp;Then they tried going direct to WIN10 and that went nowhere as well &nbsp;Have another call shortly but I am not optimistic. &nbsp;All because of the storport.sys issue. &nbsp;

            Ended up having to do a full clean WIN10 installation as nothing else work. &nbsp;Luckily they were able to do a data backup of the hard drive which I was able to restore after the clean installation. &nbsp;I was able to reload my software so I am now fully functioning.
 &nbsp;Can't believe the WIN10 update which seemed to corrupt the storport.sys created this much of a problem.

            <p>I just had the same problem. I shut down my computer manually. I then hit the power button to start and also hit the f8 key until the computer started. That got me past the blue screen and gave the option to reset my computer. I am resetting w all files
 intact. Any third party apps will have to be reinstalled. Windows 10 has become a nightmare
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: The reset did not work. After waiting for 45 minutes error message stated that Windows Could not be reset because storport.sys was missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worked with Tech help at Costco where I bought the Dell tried a number of things, NOTHING WORKED!!! I was getting ready to shipped the computer to see if they could fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In desperation I went Old School. I pressed alt,control, delete and low and behold, my computer came to life and gave me the option to use a restore point. I was able to restore my computer. I then used the Command Prompt to run sfc /scannow command. That
 will scan and repair ( if possible) issues in the system that caused the storport.sys to be corrupted or deleted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are three other commands I found on the internet that return your system to good health. It has been 24 hours so far so good&nbsp;</p>

In particular, it does not play nice with other Virtual Machine utilities including VirtualBox itself and VMWare Player if you have it installed. Also, configuring it is not as simple as VirtualBox.

            <p>Thank you for your reply. I did this and found some errors in file system. I have set it to chkdsk /F to fix the problems and shut the laptop down 3 times and restarted but it would not go into chkdsk to fix. I do a chkdskntfs c: and shows c: is dirty. When
 running chkdsk it starts off by saying "Warning F parameter is not specified. Running chkdsk in read mode only. How do I get it to fix the problems?</p>

<h2>            Battery design is 10 000 more mWh than full charge capacity</h2>
                    <p>Battery design is 10 000 more mWh than full charge capacity. Is it normal and if isn't ok, can I fix it without changing the battery?&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will be good to find solution for this, because the battery can run about 2, 3 hours.</p>

<h2>            Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse - How to assign wheel left&#47;right tilt buttons&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just got the new MS Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse and the latest Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center, and there is no way to assign the mouse wheel left or right tilt click. &nbsp;This functionality is clearly shown in the marketing for the device but there is no
 way to assign it, nor does it do anything by default.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So... how do you do it?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Roman</div>

            <p><strong>I managed to make the Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse scroll horizontally </strong>
in Excel using a third-party driver. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I had been using <a href="http://www.highrez.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">X-Mouse Button Control (XMBC)</a> for years already with my previous mouse, because it allowed me:
</p>
<ul>
<li>to remap the middle button to double click and </li><li>to make windows scroll the window that the pointer is hovering over.</li></ul>
<p>I now remapped "Tilt Wheel Left/Right" to "Scroll Window Left/Right", and it works perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next up: try to remap the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows</span> key. No luck so far.</p>

            Unless your device has a built-in GPS, Windows has to take its best guess at where you are, based on WiFi signals. That's not an accurate mechanism for determining your location.

Until you find the resolution, have a look at these 3rd party uninstallers. They are free.<br />
I use Revo Uninstaller myself once or twice but&nbsp;not because I could not find Uninstall/Change options, but because I could not uninstall via Programs and Features.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 stuck on welcome. Cannot start in safe mode. Auto repair with install disk will not work</h2>
                    I am stuck on the welcome screen and have tried. Start in safe by holding down shift and clicking restart, just goes to the welcome. Using repair option from downloaded ISO install, "startup repair couldn't repair your PC". Dell backup and recovery did
 not work. I have tried almost everything short of a new install even a bootable Norton rescue disk that told me my machine had hibernated, restart and turn it off. I could not restart of course.

            Hi HD4Marrk,
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with your Windows.
<br />
<br />Not sure if you have tried any of what I am about to ask you to try, but hopefully you havent and it works for you.
<br />
<br />If your computer/laptop does not start up, start your computer/laptop in Windows Recovery Mode.  
<br />
<br />1.)	Turn on your computer/laptop, as soon as you see Windows starting to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button until it shuts down.  (Do this two times)
<br />2.)	On the third time to power up, Windows should start up in Recovery Mode
<br />3.)	You will see several options System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt select Safe Mode
<br />4.)	If are able to go in Safe Mode, go to Troubleshoot -&gt; Advanced Option-&gt; Startup Repair
<br />
<br />If that doesnt work, keep going through the same process selecting a different option each time. . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not see a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask me any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes the Automatic Repair fails, but the Startup Repair that was mentioned will work... Sometimes it will also fail...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a 3rd option... using the Command Prompt with some boot repair commands...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a trick to this involving your type of Bios in use... Especially when booting from installation media and doing a Repair..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually no problem with the older Legacy Bios, but sometimes...</p>
<p>The main problem is when using UEFI Bios... The repair can fail because the machine is not booted with the installation media &nbsp;specifically for a UEFI Bios machine... This would apply to the Startup Repair as well...</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>UEFI Boot Repair...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Put the Windows installation disc\flash drive, and then start the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Press F9, F11, F12, ESC, or whatever your machine uses to access Boot Options at the Manufcturer's Logo Screen..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the CD\DVD Drive or Flash Drive that starts with "UEFI"... Press any key when "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD ". appears. You may see this for a Flash Drive as well...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If using Legacy Bios, ignore the drives starting with "UEFI"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Select a language, a time, a currency, and a keyboard or another input method, and then click Next.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Click "Repair your computer" on the lower left of the "Install" screen.... </p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Click the "Troubleshoot" or "Advanced" depending upon which appears... </p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Select "Command Prompt". (Capital letters not necessary) </p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Type BOOTREC /FIXMBR, and then press ENTER. </p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Type BOOTREC /FIXBOOT, and then press ENTER. </p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Type BOOTREC /REBUILDBCD, and then press ENTER. </p>
<p>

<p>Fernando,</p>
<p>I think I went through your suggestions correctly. I had try the system restore and before got two earlier dates and neither worked. I could not get it into safe mode using this method even though it looked like it would but again reverted to the welcome
 screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already tried reset with save my data but it would not work and I don't think any data was saved.</p>

            Still starts up as normal but sticks at welcome. I am considering installing a new blank hard drive and just installing a fresh copy of Windows 10. Then possibly using a USB hard drive adapter see if I can retrieve my data.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>It may be that you made the wrong Legacy\UEFI selection when booting from the media... It is sometimes tough to tell...</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That should be enough memory... providing all of it is functioning of course...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you get the memory error again when you retried the Repair ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You want to select the UEFI drive that coincides with the media you are using...</p>
<p>UEFI DVD for a DVD, and UEFI USB Flash Drive for a flash drive...</p>
<p>Your Boot Options may use slightly different names...</p>
<p>
</p><p>How new is this machine... Did it come preinstalled with Windows 8 or 10 ?</p>
<p>The reason I ask is to try to determine for sure whether it is using UEFI Bios or not... Almost every machine with Windows 8 and higher preinstalled is set-up for UEFI Bios...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the repair again and try both the UEFI and non UEFI Boot Device...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should not be getting the "The requested system device cannot be found" message, but I have seen this type of error before... Sometimes it is fixable, and sometimes not...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try selecting "A" All, but it would probably give the same error...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get errors when doing the Repair, reboot and try again... There have been times when I had to run Startup Repair and the BootRec Commands a number of times for it to work...</p>

<div><strong>I'm having a problem related to printing a document made on Windows 7 Wordpad. In the Windows 7 Advanced Appearance Settings I have the Window font color set to teal and background set to black. On Wordpad I have the font set to Automatic. So that
 it would appear as my window setting, teal font on black background,&nbsp;but print black font and white background.&nbsp;With this new wordpad it is not doing that. With the font on Automatic it is printing the the font teal on the black background. Automatic does
 not seem to be working as it usually does. I did not have this problem with previous versions. Is there some other setting or is this a error or program change? I checked on my laptop and the same thing happens. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.</strong></div>

            I think if you just click on any of&nbsp;the other two options (I have a choice of three, including Quick print), that is all it takes to change the&nbsp; printing options.&nbsp; To me, unless you make this change (for every print job) it goes down the "Quick print"
 route, it appears this change cannot be set permanently and has to be made every time you decide to print (with your current Advanced Appearance settings) if you do not want to waste a lot of printer ink?<br />
<br />
So from my understanding, unless someone can come up with a better option, you will have to use your available Printer Preferences&nbsp;for printing in black and white&nbsp;by avoiding "Quick print", every time you print from Wordpad.

<p>Hello budman23, welcome.<br />
<br />
Basically, your computer is saying either it cannot load Windows because it cannot find it or its found it, but something is preventing it from booting into it.<br />
<br />
My suggestion would be to try to boot into Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
<strong>STEPS TO BOOT INTO SAFE MODE WITH NETWORKING</strong></p>
<p>1. Completely power off your computer<br />
2. Turn your system back on and immediately start pressing the F8 key until you<br />
get to a menu similar in nature to:</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt</p>
<p>Last Known Good Configuration</p>
<p>Start Windows Normally<br />
--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>3. Choose the 'Safe Mode with Networking' option<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us know,<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

<h2>            integrated camera not working Windows 10 Lenovo</h2>
                    I have a Lenovo Thinkpad and recently upgraded to Windows 10 Pro. My integrated Camera is not working. I have checked the drivers and they are all updated + the device manager says the camera is working.&nbsp; I have selected "allow camera to work with all
 apps" so it isn't that either.&nbsp; Anyone have a solution for this? I am baffled.&nbsp; Thank you

            <p>@Amit Kumar</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your Reply Amit. However, it did not resolve the issue for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dism "CheckHealth" retured error "87"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dism "ScanHealth" prompted "Insert Boot media"</p>
<p>
</p><p>and Dism "RestoreHealth" took my PC to blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing that I had done Disk Clean up last month in order to free some the required Hard Disk space for W10 on my tablet and I may have inadvertently deleted some Boot files or some other critical files. I was kind of hopeful that Disk Clean up will
 prevent me from deleting any critical files, but perhaps that was a wishful thinking. Now, to make matters worse I don't have any Back-up available from which I could restore and see if that is indeed the issue here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, after wasting my three weekends just on this upgrade, I am still back to square one. And this is frustrating. So much so that I have un-installed Microsoft Office from my tablet so that I can free up more space in case that is the problem here. I can't
 even find my Product Key for Microsoft Office and now fear that now I may have to purchase office once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely Microsoft can release some updates to Windows 7 users to help them deal with the problems encountered in this upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help if you can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks once again.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had this problem. Only issue now is in my update history it shows Windows 10 as installed but when booting it boots with the Windows 7 OS. I don't understand why this is happening. Any help here please? I use an ACER Aspire 5749Z and I initially got
 the same error code as above but then tried again yesterday, I saw that it had&nbsp;downloaded successfully and while on the reboot phase it displayed the returning you to former OS screen after installing up to 6% but when I check the update history page it shows
 that Windows 10 has installed successfully. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks</p>

            <p>Amit,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Do you do the DISM stuff when Windows 10 begins downloading or when it has already started to install (i.e. when the circle with the progress number displays)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I tried the method above and after deleting the contents of the indicated folder and typing wuauclt.exe/updatenow - nothing happened. I proceeded with windows update, but WU did not find the upgrade to Windows 10. I tried to get around this by clicking
 on the upgrade icon presented in the taskbar (the one that shows up after one has signed up and scheduled an upgrade to 10). The panel screen comes up (i.e. Your Free Windows 10 Upgrade is Here!) and I continue with the DISM instructions as indicated. (I get
 an "Error 87: Checkhealth is not recognized" then "Completed running Scanhealth...operation completed successfully" follwed by another "Error 87: RestoreHealth option is not reognized".&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meanwhile, the upgrade window has disappeared in the background; the download has effectively stopped. Restarting the computer has no effect on the process above and windows update continues to find optional updates (as opposed to the W10 upgrade as
 it did before).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Unable to log in to Skype for Business for work account</h2>
                    <p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Microsoft Lumia 950 running the latest Windows 10 mobile OS build 10.0.14393.448. &nbsp;I have successfully added my work account to the phone and my email and calendar syncs perfectly fine. However, I am unable to log in to skype for Business using
 my work account credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried using the manual configuration for discovery address as below but it does not work -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Internal discovery address*:<br />
<a href="https://webdir.online.lync.com/Autodiscover/autodiscoverservice.svc/Root" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://webdir.online.lync.com/Autodiscover/autodiscoverservice.svc/Root</a><br />

<p>The important thing to note is that I am able to use Skype for Business on my laptop and desktop computer running windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>My colleagues use Skype for business for iOS and Android and they are able to log in using the above discovery address but I am not able to log in using my windows phone. I also tried uninstalling and installing the Skype for business mobile app but no luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried resetting my password and it did not work. I also tried switching Wifi and mobile carriers but it does not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message I keep getting is - 'We Can't sing you in. Please check your account info and try again'</p>
<p>
</p><p>The skype version installed on the phone is version 6.3.1558.0. My organisation does use the adfs login. However, I am not sure what that is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help you can provide will be great.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Ruel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your email and apologies for the delay in reply. Finally after a week long research and trying out various scenarios using trial and error, I have finally logged into skype for business using my work account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing, I tried to understand is that my account was perfectly fine and there was no tuning required from my organization as I was able to log in to Skype using iOS and Android which suggested that there is some issue with my windows phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried various scenarios using both skype versions (6.3 and 6.4)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I use Microsoft Lumia 950 which has dual sim, I first tried skype version 6.3 using Wifi, network connection using Sim1 then Sim2 but it did not work and I kept getting the same error message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then did the same process using Skype 6.4 and got the same error all 3 times (using Wifi, Sim1 and then Sim2).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was then trying to see what other options I had. Suddenly it struck me that my Sim 1 was used by 4G sim whereas my Sim 2 was only 3G. Then I realized that my Sim1 was working on a new technology that is recently released here in India (Reliance Jio 4G
 network) that uses LTE technology&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;on 800Mhz (</span><strong>band</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;20)
 &amp;</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;1800Mhz (</span><strong>band</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;3). Whereas
 my Sim 2 only has 3G network. The issue was that the 4G network sim only works when we have it in the first sim card slot so I decided to just try replacing the sim cards</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I replaced my sim cards where I inserted my old 3G sim card into the phone's first Sim slot (I knew it was only 3G and my 4G sim will not work in the second
 sim, still however I tried). This move rendered my second 4G sim useless but I then went online using the 3G network only.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I then tried and skype did not give me any error. However, it kept on showing me busy. After almost 15 minutes, skype automatically opened the browser where
 it asked me to sign in using my work account. After entering my username and password, I had to call verify my account and then I was logged in (Using Manual auto server)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Now skype is working perfectly fine even with my 4G sim and also my Wifi.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>With the above process, it seems like skype 6.3 was totally unsuccessful. However, with Skype 6.4, there was still log in issues with my 4G network and so replacing
 the sim worked for me. However, I am still researching into why it was not logging in using my Wifi connection. There seems to be some issues with how the Lumia 950 connects to the internet using dual sims where the connection method is different for Sim 1
 and Sim2. However, I am still clueless as to why it gave me issues with Wifi. Maybe my 3G sim had the right network settings for Skype to log in which are not available in my 4G sim or even my Wifi connection but still not sure.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>I am really really thankful for your help and support. Your link to Skype 6.4 helped me to finally log in. I am not sure why the windows store does not have the
 updated version 6.4. When I had 6.3, I always went to the store to see if an updated version is available but was never able to find version 6.4. When I used your link, only then I was able to update my Skype to 6.4.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>Finally I am using Skype with your help. Thank you again for your help and let me know if you have any specific inputs here.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>Thanks</span></span></span></p>
