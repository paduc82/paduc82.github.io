<h2>            Laptop turns on Windows doesn&#39;t start up. No hp logo or anything just completely black.</h2>
                    <p>When I turn on my laptop the screen lights up but stays black. I don't get any menus or start up logos or anything. If I press the function keys they don't take me anywhere besides from giving me a message such as "f11...system recovery" in the bottom left
 corner and nothing further. If I press ctrl+alt+del it refreshes this but goes nowhere. I've tried draining the power and disconnecting everything from it but nothing works. Any help would be appreciated. Also I don't have a recovery disk so I can't use that
 method at the moment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not even get the HP Logo splash Screen at Boot, that normally indicates that you have a hardware problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your problem is occurring before you even attempt to Boot into Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Recovery disk would be of no use as you can't get into BIOS to alter the Boot Order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP has Hardware Diagnostics Tools, but they require you to be able to press F2 at Boot
</p>

<h3> brianmosby  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP boot.ini errors&#33;</h2>
                    I still have my dinosaur home PC so I can't find my original Windows XP CD.&nbsp; I get the error message 'INVALID BOOT.INI file" when I start the computer but it never goes into XP.&nbsp; The error message just stares at me on that black page.&nbsp; When I hit the space
 bar it tries to reboot all over again but I end up on the black page with the error message.&nbsp; When I hit F12 during the attempted startup, I get some menu options but I don't know what the heck I'm doing so that hasn't really helped me either.&nbsp; Could someone
 please tell me how to fix this problem?&nbsp; Again, I do not have the Windows XP CD.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for your help!

            <p>Press F8 repeatedly after restart to get advanced menu options, can you enter safe mode?</p>
<p>If you can, check your boot.ini file located in C: </p>
<p>click on My Computer, then local disk C: and your boot.ini file should show right there after all other files.</p>
<p>this is what it should look like for just one OS, (this is mine and I use xp pro)</p>
<p>[boot loader]<br />
timeout=15<br />
default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS<br />
[operating systems]<br />
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS="Microsoft Windows XP Professional" /noexecute=optin /fastdetect</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also use the recovery console and safe mode in my boot.ini.</p>
<p>you can edit your boot.ini by right clicking, choose open, and edit if it does not say like above.</p>
<p>You should install the recovery console and you do not need your installation cd to do that just a working computer and a cd drive, follow the instructions here:</p>
<p><b><u><span>Here's how to<span>&nbsp; </span>make a bootable xp recovery console cd</span></u></b></p>
<p><span>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure what you have (no XP media required).</span></p>
<p><span>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come with a store bought system.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</span></p>
<p><span>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</span></p>
<p><span>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download the ISO file from here:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></span></p>
<p><span>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD (do not install UniBlue or the Ask Toolbar - ever!):</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></span></p>
<p><span>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></span></p>
<p><span>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</span></p>
<p><span>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</span></p>
<p><span>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</span></p>
<p><span>Press any key to boot from CD...</span></p>
<p><span>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</span></p>
<p><span>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</span></p>
<p><span>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</span></p>
<p><span>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</span></p>
<p><span>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/recovery_console_cmds.mspx?mfr=true</a></span></p>
<p><span>A good idea before starting things is to first verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</span></p>
<p><span>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</span></p>
<p><span>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</span></p>
<p><span>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</span></p>
<p><span>chkdsk C: /r</span></p>
<p><span>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear
 to go backwards sometimes.</span></p>
<p><span>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</span></p>
<p><span>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will not be present.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>post back and answer a few questions please, make and model of pc, current antivirus, OS and service pack.</p>

            If your system will not boot, you will not be able to edit the boot.ini file (duh!).<br />
<br />
Like Contributor Elizabeth23 says, what you need to do is get into the XP Recovery Console...<br />
<br />
That link to the instructions assumes your boot.ini is <i>missing</i>, but you can still boot, but that is not the case with you (from what I understand).<br />
<br />
What you will end up having to do from RC is renaming your afflicted boot.ini to something else and then create a fresh boot.ini that is not afflicted.<br />
<br />
Once you successfully get into RC and run the chkdsk&nbsp; /r, we can help you with that part when you are ready.<br />

            <p>I appreciate the suggestions provided but like ElderL said, I can't get to the Windows (blue) screen, so I can't go to My Computer. Neither can I get the DOS prompt so I can't run the checkdisk command..&nbsp; I can, however, get to the advanced menu options
 from pressing F8 during startup but EVERY option I select after that just takes me right back to the error message (black screen).&nbsp; I was able to see the System Error Log and the last error&nbsp;mentioned something about memory size.&nbsp; Is it possible that my 8 year
 old computer doesn't have enough memory to boot up?&nbsp; Maybe someone downloaded something that has to startup when the computer boots....?...?&nbsp; I also tried to run the Recovery Console cd (after changing the boot sequence to cd-rom) but ofcourse it didn't work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>So...while I was in Best Buy purchasing a new laptop cause my 10-yr old needed a computer for her homework assignment, they offered to "wipe my old computer clean" so that I could start all over....WTF!!&nbsp;Anyway, I just need a sledge hammer at this point
 so that my confidential files on my dinosaur computer don't get compromised.&nbsp; Glad I had a hard backup.</p>
<p>I think the only fix would have been to purchase the XP cd and use the directions from Elizabeth 23.&nbsp; But even before this, my computer was locking up all the time and giving me pop-up messages that "Memory Usage is High".&nbsp; "Looks like Another Love TKO"
 as Teddy Pendergrass would say.</p>

            What you ought to do is use the directions from Elizabeth 23 and create a bootable XP Recovery Console CD (no XP media required).&nbsp; Those directions start here:<br />
<br />
<b><u><span>Here's how to<span>&nbsp; </span>make a bootable xp recovery console cd</span></u></b><br />
<br />
Did you do that yet and if you did, what happens when you boot on it?<br />
<br />
If you made a RC CD, did you try it in a computer that is not afflicted to be sure it works?<br />
<br />
Once you get booted on that, you can run a chkdsk /r&nbsp; on your HDD and create yourself a new boot.ini file that is not afflicted.<br />
<br />
If you are/were seeing a message about "Memory Usage is High", that sounds like something coming from some kind of Norton/Symantec product and not from XP.<br />
<br />
You are unlikely to find an XP CD t purchase, but you sure can try. <br />

            <p>Yeah, I created a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD using Elizabeth 23's instructions above BUT I didn't test it on a working computer.&nbsp; I'll do that next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you are correct - that pop-up error message was from Norton but the memory usage comment in the System Error Log was from the computer (from the menu after hitting F12 while booting up).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll let you know what happens when I try the RC cd on a working computer.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the error message prompts you to reinstall the Windows Media Player, reinstallation does not necessarily fix the problem. The error message generally pops up again when
 you try to launch Windows Media player after the reinstallation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>Method 1:</b> To fix the issue, perform the steps listed below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to
<b>Start</b> and click <b>Run</b>.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Typethe following command in the
<b>Open</b> box and then press <b>Enter</b>:</p>
<p><b>c:\windows\inf\unregmp2.exe /UpdateWMP</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The above steps resolve the confusion that your computer was having with version numbers of Windows Media Player and subsequently corrects the error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b> Try performing SFC (System File Checker) scan on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<b>Start</b>, and then type <b>cmd</b> in the Start Search box.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click
<b>cmd</b> in the Programs list, and then click <b>Run as administrator</b>.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the command prompt, the following line, and then press
<b>ENTER</b>:</p>
<p><b>sfc /scannow</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft has released a cumulative update for Windows Media Player 11 in Windows Vista. This update resolves some reliability issues in Windows Media Player 11 in Windows Vista.

    <title>Need appropriate drivers for Windows 7 install - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Need appropriate drivers for Windows 7 install</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I used to run Windows XP &nbsp;with this computer and now I bought a new hard drive (Western Digital 500 gb &nbsp;model WD5000 AAKS Hard drive) and want to install Windows 7 on it since &nbsp;it will recognize the entire &nbsp;drive and my version of xp will not.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I used Windows 7 to format the new drive and then it seemed to take forever to install the program. &nbsp;At 96% of the &nbsp;expanding files , stage two of five, it stopped.</span></strong></p>
<p>The next time I went to advanced repair and tried my abit disc to see if it had any drivers I might need to upload before trying to install again, but my abit drivers are old and don't fit what Windows 7 needs. &nbsp;I go to Abit and I can only get updated drivers
 if the computer has an operating system installed and running... catch 22.</p>
<p><strong><span>If I try to run XP professional, then I'll have to have my new drive partitioned and I bought Windows 7 so I wouldn't have to partition it.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I tried to reinstall Windows 7 again and left the house and came home to an error message:</span>kernal_data_inpage_error</strong></p>
<p><strong>Does anyone have any drivers I might need to download to a flash drive before trying to restart the installation? &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Am I missing drivers and that is why I can't install this program? &nbsp;If not any other suggestions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THANK YOU :)</strong></p>

<p>You can integrate XP SP3 into your original XP CD by slipstreaming.</p>
<p>Create a "Slipstreamed" version of XP that incorporates SP3<br />
AutoStreamer, it's easy to use and for the most part self explanatory.<br />
After you create the CD then do a "Clean Install", see the last part<br />
of my reply.</p>

need to download from your PC manufacture's or motherboard's<br />

    <title>Many &#34;Undocumented Features&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tobykoch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Many &#34;Undocumented Features&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 last week. &nbsp;So far I have found the following "undocumented features".</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;I have to reload the profile for my touchpad after every restart. &nbsp;No matter what, it goes back to the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;My laptop does not shut down completely. &nbsp;The keyboard lights are still on even though the screen is blank. &nbsp;I go to the start menu and select "restart" and then do a shut down at the login screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;Home group doesn't work. &nbsp;Not a big deal but it was convenient sharing printers which are located on different floors of the house.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. &nbsp;On my tablet, I've lost the recycle bin and the icons that used to be on my desktop. &nbsp;And I can't find them to restore them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've joined the community strings that have described the above problems but as of this date, there have been no responses from Microsoft personnel. &nbsp;These problems are not fatal (at least for me) but they are a pain. &nbsp;It's very ironic that all my apps (even
 non-MS ones) work beautifully, but the OS has these "undocumented features". &nbsp;It would be nice to at least get some response saying that the problems have been recognized and are being worked on.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thanks for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To assist you better, I like to know, what is the make and model of your computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>For Computer</span></strong><span>, I suggest you try repairing your computer and check if it
 helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the below steps to repair your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1) Create installation media for windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Refer to the below link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>2) Insert the
<strong>Windows 10 installation DVD</strong> in the DVD ROM and restart your computer.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3) After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "<strong>Press any
 key to boot from DVD</strong>". Press any key. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4) Select the correct time and Keyboard type.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5) Click
<strong>Repair your computer</strong> in the lower left corner.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6) Follow the on screen instruction.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>For Tablet</span></strong><span>, I suggest you to
<strong>perform System File Checker (sfc) scan </strong>and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>System File Checker is a ut</span></strong><span>ility in Windows that allows users to scan for
 corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To perform SFC Scan, refer to the below link:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Steps mentioned for Windows 8/8.1, will work fine with Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope it helps, reply to us with the status of your issue. We will be happy to assist you.</span></span></p>

            At this point, I don't feel comfortable making a boot disc in the hopes it may fix the problem. &nbsp;I will wait until Microsoft comes up with some good solid fixes for all. &nbsp;So far all of the handy hints that your group has come up with haven't worked at
 all.

I would suggest you to create new Microsoft account and check if you are facing the same issue. Also Testing the issue with UAC turned off.<br />

            <p>I have the same issue with my Microsoft Account. The C:\USER\xxx which is assigned to the Microsoft Account shows Security permissions for everything for the MA. But when you go down to the Documents folder the Security does not list the MA, which means
 you default to EVERYONE. This means no access, even though when you logon the Microsoft Account is a "Local Administrator". I currently use "Run as Administrator" to run programs that have a access issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had reported this issue early this Case # 1300346087 and thought I had corrected it by add my MA back in with the proper permissions. I'm sorry to say it is back to no permissions again.</p>

            I rolled back to Windows 7 (where I could save) and then reinstalled 10 with a different MS account.&nbsp; Same problem again with the Documents folder.&nbsp; In C:/Users/My name)/ Documents under the security tab, Everyone is listed first, then SYSTEM, then my
 account.&nbsp; In the other libraries (Music, Pictures, Video), Everyone is not listed, just SYSTEM and my account. If I look in the security tab of the Documents folder in Explorer, it says the file is owned by S-1-5-21-746137067-1532298954-839522115-1003.&nbsp; If
 I try to change ownership, I get an error message that my account can't be found.&nbsp;&nbsp; The tab lists Home Users (New Machine\home users) and WMPNetwork SVC (something to do with Windows Media Player) as users.

            I right mouse clicked on my Documents folder and selected the Security Tab. Then I clicked advanced, this will bring up the Advanced Security screen. Since I didn't see my name I clicked the Add button. This bring up the Permission Entry screen. At the
 top you will see underlined "Select a principal", click on it. This bring up Select User or Group screen, in the large box marked Enter the object name key your Microsoft Account. Click the Check Names button and Ok. This should allow you to select permissions
 for the MA and then click Ok. Once back on the Advanced Security Settings for Documents you need to check the Replace all child&nbsp; object permissions box at the bottom and click apply. I did get a few error message, which clicked Ok to. Once I was done, I spot
 checked a few files, but you should have control back. If anything looks funny just post, I'm always online doing something. Good luck.

<h2>            Driver Issue &#58; Nvidia GeForce 8800GT</h2>
                    I&nbsp;upgraded to&nbsp;Windows 7 64-bit last month and everything was okay until last week.&nbsp; The computer display has a bunch of lines and patterns all over it.&nbsp; When I reboot I get a blue screen and have to start in safe mode.&nbsp; The computer will only boot correctly
 if I disable the Nvidia card.&nbsp; Tried recommended drivers from Nvidia and Windows update with no resolution.&nbsp; I am also having issues with my Norton antivirus at this time.<br />
Thanks,

            Hi Sev1,<br />
<br />
It could possibly be your Norton anti-virus which may be causing Blue Screen issue. Try disabling it temporarily and check if you get blue screen again and in case you do not get a blue screen after disabling Norton, the issue is with Norton and hence you may
 have to contact Norton.<br />
<br />
You may also rollback the Nvidia drivers if possible and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Here is an example on how to do it with a screen shot.<br />
<br />
<p>First you’ll need to open Device Manager. The easiest way is to just type <em>
device manager</em> into the start menu search box, but you could also go through the control panel if you choose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have it open, browse down to the problem device, right-click and choose Properties.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2007%2f06%2fimage72.png" /></p>
<p>Now click on the Driver tab, and then click the Roll Back Driver button.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.howtogeek.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2007%2f06%2fimage73.png" /></p>
<p>You’ll&nbsp;get a prompt telling you that you don’t want to do it, but go ahead anyway. You can always click the Update Driver button to get the latest version again.</p>
<br />
Or delete the drivers by following the same procedure and reboot your computer. Your computer will automatically scan and install Nvidia drivers for Windows 7.<br />
<br />
If the above suggestions does not resolve your issue, I'd recommend you to perform Clean Boot and check if that helps.<br />
<br />
ou can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note </strong>When you perform a clean boot, you may temporarily lose some functionality. When you start the computer as usual, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or you may experience the original behavior.<br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;<br />
Follow the below steps to put your computer in clean boot state:</strong> <br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note </strong>If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer
 unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Click Start button, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup , and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this
 if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.<br />
<br />
5. Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
<br />
<br />
Check the below link for more details on clean boot:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</strong>
<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start button, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab , click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart .<br />
<br />

<p>Azeez,<br />
Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I installed a new bios recommended by my OEM.&nbsp; I also uninstalled/reinstalled Norton.&nbsp; I no longer have the blue screen on start up with the NVIDIA card enabled.&nbsp; I checked Device Manager and could not roll back the driver (option
 greyed out).&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I do however still experience lock up with the computer when I try to play a game (in this case it was Titan Quest).&nbsp; A few minutes into the game the issues start.<br />
I tried the clear boot you mention above and still experience this lock up when trying to play.<br />
Thank you,</p>

<p>Hey Sev1,</p>
<p>Ya something is up with Nvidia updates! It has taken me three weeks of constant restoring from video freeze and crashes to finally narrow down how to stabilize my notebook. I figured out that if you go to 'msconfig' and click on the startup tab, scroll down
 to all the Nvidia drivers and uncheck them then hit apply. Restart the computer and that should fix the Nvidia driver issues.</p>

<h2>            How can I use a disc stylus with a Windows 10 tablet&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 10 tablet. Its a 10.1" full HD screen. I am thinking of buying a disk stylus (pen). This is not an active pen, but with some sort of a nib and a disc that goes under that nib. I haven't ever used any kind of pen with a touch screen before.
 Could you guys tell me how to get such a non-active pen work with Windows 10?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I found the answer. If you are using a capacitive stylus, you don't need it to be paired. I found even the used AAA battery, the top of a ballpoint pen, or the door key&nbsp;works as the stylus.</p>

    <title>How to unmerge folders that have been moved incorrectly&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alex mears  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to unmerge folders that have been moved incorrectly&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, when I first installed Windows 8.1 I wanted to move my user folders off of my C:\ drive's SSD and onto my D:\ drive's HDD. In the rushed process of doing so, I somehow merged my desktop folder with my C:\Users\&lt;USERNAME&gt; folder, and then that mash
 up of a folder got confused and thought it was the contacts folder. The result of this is a folder in my C:\Users folder titled "Contacts" that contains all my user account data including appdata, but stores it all on the desktop as well as in the explorer.
 The location in the properties interface of this folder indicates that my OS is reading it as a desktop, because I get this prompt when I attempt to restore the default location:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d1e1f800-d3b2-4431-8293-4a769a950fde" /></p>
<p>Now of course this directory doesn't exist, because all of my libraries are now on the D drive. My questions are: How do I unmerge my contacts, user account, and desktop folder from eachother? Is it even possible to unmerge 3 folders? What will happen to
 my AppData which I have been told not to fiddle with, as it is stored in this complete mixup of a folder?</p>

<h2>            Thinking about resetting Windows 10</h2>
                    I'm thinking of resetting my Windows 10 because I have several issues with it but before I do, I have several questions about it. When I press reset but keep my files, it shows that a bunch of program files will be deleted. I just want to know what type
 of files will be kept on my computer. Also, when I reset it, does that mean that I will have Windows 10 the way I had it when I first got it but with my files (excluding program files)?

            <p>To resolve all doubts, just do a web search. You'll get all your questions answered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All applications that weren't obtained from Windows Store will be uninstalled, and you'll find an HTML file on your desktop with a list of everything that was uninstalled. You'll have to reinstall those applications and set them up all over again. Hope you
 have your license codes for products that need them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The truth is:&nbsp;<em>everything</em> gets uninstalled, but Windows automatically reinstalls your Windows Store apps. It doesn't re-install your other applications because it doesn't know where to get the installers or if they requires separate licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember: A reset is really a clean install. Your hard drive will be erased. When you choose "keep my files" Windows will backup the contents of your default Documents, Music, Pictures and Videos folders to the cloud (perhaps some additional folders too)
 and then restore them to the same location after re-installing Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end you will have a factory fresh copy of Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Reversing mouse buttons for left hand resets after restarting computer</h2>
                    I've figured out how to reverse mouse buttons (I'm left-handed).&nbsp; However, even after clicking on "apply", the function reverts back to the default when I restart my computer.&nbsp; How do I make the change permanent?&nbsp; I'm using a Logitech wireless mouse, and
 the software included doesn't seem to have a way to reverse the buttons.

Click on Apply, then OK, and the settings should stay set each time you log in.</p><p>I have a Logitech V470 and SetPoint v4.82. I tried the newer version (6.xx), but wasn't too pleased with it. It clashed terribly with my touchpad; sometimes if I inadvertently moved the pointer with the touchpad, it would freeze for a few seconds before relinquishing control back to the mouse.</p><hr /><p>SC Tom</p>

                    Hello everybody, sorry for strange title I wrote but I thought "internet connection drops to limited" topic is just so common that you guys wont just open the thread. Ok. So the problem is almost the same: internet connection goes limited randomly which
 means 'no internet for me' but the circumstances are a bit different because for example now and whenever I use internet I dont get the problem BUT then I start to download games, films etc. I get this problem. Situation: &nbsp;everything before downloading is
 just OK, then i start downloading the speed reaches maximum and then slowly it goes down down and down until downloading stops and then I get limited connection(the problem I am talking about). So I click 'forget this network', then I connect again and it
 repeats again and again(mostly). I always had Windows 8.1 but then I saw microsoft team's answer that for some users 8.1 Windows has 'that connectivity problem' and we have to wait for update I deciced to reinstall windows and bac

            <p>Thanks for answering first of all. I use wifi connection and I download games via Steam and films/games using torrent app, in this case uTorrent. Talking about make and model, I didnt really get the question, you want to now manufacturer or? If so, it's
 Samsung. Talking about those proxy servers the same, I didnt understand and I dont even know what it is so if you could make that question more common to me it would be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried first method but Troubleshooter didnt find any problems. Maybe I need to try again on limited connection, I mean then the problem occurs?</p>

    <title>64bit Stellarium Incompatibility Issues with Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prodigal one  say:</h3>
<h2>            64bit Stellarium Incompatibility Issues with Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I Downloaded and Installed Stellarium (64bit) on my Acer Aspire E1-510 Laptop. &nbsp;The Mouse Cursor IS NOT Visible, yet Clicking The Buttons and Rotating the Mouse Wheel Activates whatever the Cursor is Positioned On. &nbsp;However, because You CANNOT See The
 Cursor Position, there is No way to Know What It Is Positioned On. &nbsp;Also, whenever a Pop Up Window appears, you CANNOT Position the Cursor on any Tabs or Buttons on that Pop-Up Window. &nbsp;I ran the Program Compatibility Tool, and it said Incompatible Program
 Found. &nbsp;This DOES NOT Make any sense! It's a 64bit Laptop, and the Program is for Windows 8 (64bit).&nbsp;

<p>The LINK that is provided in the above Reply to my original post, did not appear as a Link. &nbsp;It just looked like a regular word, and it looked like the link was missing. &nbsp;I have since Clicked on it and Sent a Copy of my Question to STELLARIUM as Feedback.
 &nbsp;I am awaiting response. &nbsp;What I can't figure out is How Can Software such as STELLARIUM offer a Download to WINDOWS 8.1, and then when you Download it, the silly thing won't work!</p>

<p>Already tried all that and Settings are as you suggested. &nbsp;Still doesn't work. &nbsp;It will not Display Mouse Cursor, so I cannot use the Mouse to do anything: &nbsp;The only thing that works is the L,R,U,D Arrows to move the Image. &nbsp;I even selected Report Issue
 To Microsoft. &nbsp;It supposedly applied a FIX, but still without Result. &nbsp;I even have to Click CONTROL + ALT + DELETE and Use TASK MANAGER (End Task) to Shutdown STELLARIUM.</p>

Hi There, &nbsp;<br />
I think I already have that App., and I think it was that App that I have already Run as you suggest. &nbsp;From memory, it found that STELLARIUM was Incompatable, and Applied a (Supposed) Fix; but it made no difference. &nbsp;However, I'll Download It from the Link
 you have provided, and Run It to see what happens. &nbsp;I'll Reply again with the Result.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
ps .. &nbsp;Is there any chance of Issues with Windows 10? ..... If the App doesn't Fix It this time, I may try Installing it on my Desktop with Windows 10. &nbsp;The reason I installed it on my Windows 8.1 Laptop was for Convenience to use when I'm not at home or if
 I'm outside at night.

Okay thanks. &nbsp;That might be my best option. &nbsp;I haven't had a chance to Download that Link you provided in previous reply yet, but I'll still check it out, and if I don't get sattisfactory results, i'll Download it onto my Desktop with Windows 10.

<h2>            Stuck on Windows screen, no mouse or keyboard</h2>
                    So it's on my computer and it kept kicking me off of Google Chrome and a message would appear stating to close apps, restart, shut down, etc.. It was like a drop down menu. it was almost like my keyboard was pressing several keys at a time without me touching
 it. I hit cancel hoping that it is would ignore it. Then it completely froze up so I had to hold the power button down. I rebooted it and my welcome screen comes up with the clock and the date and then in the right-hand corner it's my internet and then showing
 it's on battery power. But it does not show the power button in the right-hand corner like it normally does or any of the icons that I have set up to manually cone up.. I can normally hit the spacebar and the screen goes up words and allows me to log in with
 my 4-Digit pin. However it appears that my keyboard nor my mouse is working at all. I tried to get online and do some research and I found a video that says to do hard reset three times and it will take you into automatic

            Start your PC then just as Windows loads - press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a shut down. Do it 3 times. You may only need to do it twice, but on the third start Windows will boot into the recovery environment.
<br />
<br />You can also hold shift &gt; press restart in the start menu to do the same

<br />Go to Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Option &gt; Startup Repair
<br />This will try to make Windows repair itself.

<p>Ok i did try this method. When i tried the reboot method it gave me the message that it was repair mode, so then it went to a blue screen and said restart or Advanced options. Well if i try to use arrow keys or mouse its like its completely disconnected.&nbsp;
 But my battery lighy is on and the 1st lock button is on (right beside the cap locks indicator light} but I cant do anything.</p>
<p>The other method I would try but it appears my Windows screen is stuck at the login. It pulls up but none of my personalized icons are there nor is the power symbol. It shows date time on left and my battery charging Icon and my wifi icon to the right, which
 does show connected.&nbsp;</p>

            Ok, I understand. Something may be wrong with your trackpad then. 
<br />
<br />Try to turn off your laptop by holding the power button, then take the battery out and unplug it. After that, hold the power button for up to 60 seconds. AFter that, plug everything back in, and try it once more.

            Ok Zack thanks so much. I will try this when i get off work. Thank you so so much. I've done some research on YouTube and it seems this is a known problem something to do with updates to 10 Windows.. Not sure how true that is, but i see there's the methods
 u suggested that i also seen online too. It appears it fixes the issue. I'm just unable to do those due to no mouse or keyboard. So say this last method doesn't work... U think I should try getting a mouse to try to see if i can get it to fix after getting
 into the advanced settings mode?

            It would be advisable to definitely try another mouse to see if that helps.

<h2>            No pen or touch input is available for this display&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Okay, I'm in a bit of a pickle here. I've been going nuts over this. I can't use my stylus pen, nor is my touchscreen functioning. It was working fine one day and the next it just completely stopped.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>These are my device specifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the touchscreen and pen actually stopped working, it didn't shatter or break or anything. Yeah, a few weeks later I did break the display (a few cracks) but the touchscreen had stopped working before that, so I'm not sure whether it's a hardware issue
 or a software thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some other things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried a while ago to fix the issue, I tried to enable and disable the HID-touch compliant and pen drivers (that when I looked at, had this error message:
<em>“Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer” (Code 45))
</em></p>
<p>I read somewhere that you should uninstall the drivers and then restart the device so that they could reinstall, but after doing this they are now nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p><em>(nothing related to pen or touch.)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've posted a similar question in the Lenovo support forums, but it's gone dead, so I'm coming here in search of solution. Please help.</p>
<p>I give my thanks in advance. &lt;3<em><br />

            Hi iiAether
<br />
<br />The original problem with Pen and touch was more than likely caused by Windows Update and the HID device driver for your touchscreen
<br />
<br />You mention that your screen is now cracked, has that been fixed?

<p>No, not at the moment. I'm planning to get it fixed soon. I'm delaying it as of now as daily usage is completely fine, other than the lack of touch-screen capabilities. The only reason I would want to fix the screen is so I can also fix my touchscreen, however
 I'm not sure if fixing the screen would fix the touchscreen.</p>

            Hi iiAether
<br />
<br />Fixing the screen should return the touch functionality. That screen has a matrix of capacitors that are required for the touch functionality. I know the screen did not work before the screen was cracked, but we should be able to gt it working if that screen is repaired . . .

<p>Great, thank you for the tips! I'll be sure to repair my device and get back on this thread as to if it worked or not.<br />
