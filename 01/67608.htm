    <title>Host Process for Setting Synchronization causing flashing screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Host Process for Setting Synchronization causing flashing screen</h2>
                    <p>I have a HP Pavilion Notebook (15-p233TU) and upgraded to Windows 10 this morning. Immediately after installing the screen started flickering and I was unable to click anywhere on the screen. I saw from Task Manager the CPU was running at 100% and the Host
 Process for Setting Synchronization was crazy high. There was no error message displayed at any time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started the computer in safe mode and it seemed fine. I looked at some other posts and saw I should do a clean boot. I wasn't sure if this should be done in safe mode? But in any case the instructions I found for msconfig didn't quite work for me in W10
 and the search didn't give the same results as the example (which was for windows 8.1 but I thought they would be the same). If the clean boot needs to be done in normal mode I cannot do that because of the flickering screen. I tried a repair but it came back
 with an error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a loss at what to do to fix this so I am in the process of reverting back to Windows 8.1 - which hopefully can be done in safe mode otherwise my new laptop is unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate any advice on what I need to do to successfully upgrade to Windows 10. Is this a bug fix that will be resolved? Or what do I need to do before I initiate the upgrade to make it successful?</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi Lani,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Sorry to know that you’re facing this issue, I’ll be glad to assist you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to follow the below method and check if it resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong><span>Try connecting to different video outputs on the PC. Sometimes a change in driver can cause the video to be sent:
</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>To a different Adapter: from integrated graphics to a discrete card or vice versa.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>To a different output: from HDMI to DVI, Display Port to VGA, or any other combination.
</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;Method 2:
</span></strong><span>Try to boot into
<strong>Safe Mode with Networking </strong>or <strong>Enable low-resolution video</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press and hold the
<strong>shift key </strong>while clicking on <strong>Restart</strong> at the login Screen (Bottom right corner).</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select <strong>Troubleshoot
</strong>and click on<strong> Advanced Options</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select <strong>Startup Settings
</strong>and click on <strong>Restart</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>After restarting, choose
<strong>Enable Safe mode with networking </strong>or <strong>Low Resolution Video</strong>.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also check
<strong>Device Manager </strong>and look for <strong>Display Adapters</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>If you see 2 items under Display Adapters, disable to integrated video card (e.g. Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 4200) and restart.
</span><span>If you see 1 item under Display Adapters, rollback the driver or uninstall the display adapter in Device Manager, and enable the option to delete driver software.
</span></p>

            My second attempt at installing was fine and it seems to be working ok now. I'm not exactly sure what the issue was but I made sure my display adapters driver was up to date and probably most importantly disabled Nortons antivirus (my bad for not doing
 more research and doing this in the first place). I tried uninstalling Nortons in the first instance but then the Windows 10 download failed (repeatedly) and I couldn't get BITS working again, so I ended up reinstalling Nortons and just disabling it.

            <p><span>Fix for my Desktop not Syncing OneDrive and my Laptop keeps flashing mouse pointer and traces to Host Process for Setting Synchronization leading to settingsynchost.exe.
</span></p>
<p><span>I have 4 computers. 2 worked perfect on Windows 10 download and 2 have taken me 3 weeks of searching for answers. My search led me to try something that made no sense to me but it works. Once it
 fixed one computer I tried it after a week of trying to solve a different problem on the other computer and it fixed it too. Crazy but it worked for me and I have never had any other issues. Love the new Windows 10 after the fixes. I barely made it past high
 school and I am almost as old as dirt but I figured out a fix for something that is kicking thousands of peoples rears. Whoop whoop.</span></p>
<p><span>Here is what I did:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Right click on the Windows 10 box in lower left corner of screen.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Left click on “Control Panel”</span></p>
<p><span>3. Left clicked on “Internet Options”</span></p>
<p><span>4. Then on Internet Properties screen click on upper tab “Security”</span></p>
<p><span>5. Left click on Green Checkmark “Trusted Sites”</span></p>
<p><span>6. Left click on the “Sites” tab</span></p>
<p><span>7. Then under “Add This Website To The Zone” I typed:
</span><a href="https://www.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://www.live.com</span></a></p>
<p><span>8. Left click “Add”. Then I typed:
</span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com</span></a><span> and clicked “Add”</span></p>
<p><span>9. Re-booted computer.</span></p>
<p><span>That’s it. Fixed everything. Don’t know how or why but it did.
</span></p>

    <title>Games Minimize every 30 seconds or so - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Games Minimize every 30 seconds or so</h2>
                    
<p>Please bear with me. I am going to explain what has been going on and what I have done as best as I can. I have been playing downloaded games from Big Fish for a few years and have never had a problem. I upgraded my laptop to Windows 10 when it was first
 available and still everything worked fine. I bought a desktop computer that Windows 10 came installed on, it is a HP&nbsp;<span>23-r110 All In One computer about 6 weeks ago. Now, the majority of the games I download from Big Fish minimize to the desk top every
 30 seconds or so. I maximize the game, try to play again, and it minimizes yet again. I have tried to contact HP support and was told to ask Big Fish support as it probably wasn't a computer problem. I contacted Big Fish support, was told to try some of the
 options that were in their troubleshooting forum, and if that didn't work to reply to their email. Nothing worked, I replied to their email last week, and still haven't heard back. I am at my wits end because I want to play these games as it is my "relaxing
 time" and now all I do is search for answers online.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I have already updated my driver:&nbsp;</span>Card name: Intel(R) HD Graphics &nbsp; Manufacturer: Intel Corporation &nbsp;&nbsp;Native Mode: 1920 x 1080(p) (59.997Hz). I have changed the game to Compatibility Mode for Windows 8 and XP (as suggested) and that hasn't fixed
 it. I have tried to play the games in Windowed Mode instead of Full Screen and it doesn't minimize, but it pauses instead. I have also disabled most of the startup programs (that weren't really needed at start up).</p>

<p>I don't know where else to go or who else to ask. I am hoping someone here can help me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Hi, what you are experiencing is a thing called the modern app Force quit. (there is probably a better word for it. ) but it is when instead of a whole it crashes and send a error to (who ever) it just quits and when you maximize it, it will not work. although
 I do not for one use BIG fish gamming. (or the other random things HP puts on your pc like wild tangent games etc.) if I were you normally when you have a problem like this where it closes no matter what (even after a restart or other thing) I would install
 it and reinstall it. &nbsp;try if that works and come back</p>

</p><p>I recently mistakenly formatted my hard drive in which included my EFS encrypted files. I have recovered those files using various recovery programs. However savaged files aren't readable. For example, a JPEG would resulted in files are corrupted and unreadable.
 Is there anyway to read these files again?</p>

            <p>Hello Canon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Files and folders you encrypt using EFS can only be decrypted using the Windows login that encrypted the file. Other users on the system will be able to see the files but will not be able to open them, even if they are running as administrator. That means
 that you also need to be careful you do not forget your login, or you will be locked out of your own files.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Based on the above comprehension, I would&nbsp;like to suggest you that if the encrypted files and folders are backed up (irrespective of an external hard drive, DVD or any other portable media), they still retain the encryption (green colour of the EFS
 feature) after restoration.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, if you restore the files in a different user account or PC, you may not be able to access the files without having the backup of the corresponding EFS certificates. On the other hand, if you restore the files in the same user account, the files
 will be accessible but you will still notice that the filenames&nbsp;will be green in colour. When the files are opened in the same user account, the EFS certificates (that serves the decryption key for the files) are already present. So, when you have recovered
 your Windows you might not have the previous user account until recovered from a system image backed up earlier. Therefore, as the certificates are lost, the EFS files are expected to be corrupted or unreadable.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hope this information serves your primary question. However, if you still have the query or notice any misinterpretation of your question, please feel free to reply with the correct explanation.&nbsp;We'll be more than happy&nbsp;to assist you again.</span></p>

    <title>Blurry text in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Blurry text in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have a big problem with &nbsp;blurry text in Windows 10.</p>
<p>I have found that many other people have complaints &nbsp;about blurry text in this version of Windows.</p>
<p>I have bought a new monitor, BENQ GW 2255 with full hd resolution, and &nbsp;expect text to be crystal clear in this new version of Windows as it is most important for reading, and my eyes, but that's not the case, text in this version is disaster.</p>
<p>I have also tried a few tricks, that I have found on internet, disabling dpi scaling, some dpi scaling fixes etc. but it didn't work.<br />
Would you be so kind to reconsider this problem in your future updates, and to find some nice solution for blurry text problem in Windows 10?</p>
<p>Apart of this, I do not have any other complaints, and I've been very satisfied with new Windows 10.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>

 works very well with Windows 10.&nbsp; At least I am very happy with the combination.

<h2>            Windows 10 crashing after sleep</h2>
                    <p>So when my PC goes to sleep or when I put it to sleep and wake it up it doesn't output a signal to the monitor. I found out my MSI Afterburner was the problem because I overclocked my Nvidia Geforce GTX 750 ti. After I typed in my password and pressed enter
 and the computer reboots. Is there a way to fix it or should I have my overclock disabled?</p>

            <p>Hi Jakob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank&nbsp;you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As you know that&nbsp;Overclocking the graphic card is causing&nbsp;the issue, there is no harm&nbsp;in&nbsp;disabling the option and use the computer.&nbsp;Before disabling the option, I suggest you to&nbsp;update the Graphic Card driver by following the&nbsp;steps provided below and check
 if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X key </strong>and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Expand <strong>Display Adapters</strong>.</li><li>Right click on the graphic card&nbsp;driver and select <strong>Update Driver Software</strong>.</li><li>Follow the on-screen prompts to update the driver.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.</p>

<h2>            Accidentally deleted system files&#59; Windows replaced them, cannot restore original files</h2>
                    
<p>I deleted the two files mentioned in this question : http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7security/thread/ce791275-9572-4305-8902-098a706c32e1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon realising my mistake, I tried to move them back out of the recycle bin to replace the files Windows had created as a replacement, but the new files were listed as "in use" by System and I can't do that.&nbsp; So I coped them back as 7B296FB0-376B-497e-B012-9C450E1B7327-5P-0
 (2) and 7B296FB0-376B-497e-B012-9C450E1B7327-5P-1 (2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem is the same as the previous asker's.&nbsp; Windows told me upon restart that I need to verify the legitimacy of my operating system, and that I can either download software to do so or re-enter my product's registration and activation keys.&nbsp; The problem
 is that I don't have these anymore -- my mother threw away the packaging for my netbook, in which I stored my installation and setup booklet which contained the keys, and both numbers on the sticker on the back of my netbook have worn off.&nbsp; I need to be able
 to restore the original files.&nbsp; Can someone help me do this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, you can boot a netbook with an Ubuntu USB flash disk. I have a link for a German site with instructions on how to make one but I'm sure there are English language sites too.</p>
<p>If you are familiar with console commands then you can restore your problem files when booting into Repair Mode with a flash disk. You can find instructions for making a bootable flash disk here: http://mintywhite.com/windows-7/7maintenance/create-bootable-windows-7-system-repair-usb-drive-netbooks/.</p>
<p>All Microsoft product keys consist of five groups of 5 letters or numbers each, e.g. like so:<br />
12345 67ABC 098DE ABCYX 54111.</p>
<p>The message you see might be generated by some subtle change in the registry. If so then you should stop using the machine immediately in order to prevent the registry backup files from being overwritten. They reside here: c:\Windows\System32\RegBack. You
 must save them in a safe place immediately, either when booting into Ubuntu or into Repair Mode. They get overwritten once every few days, perhaps at the next reboot!</p>

            Hi,
<div>Thank you for posting your issue on Microsoft Community Forums.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. What is the complete error message?</div>
<div>2. What is the make and model of the printer?</div>

<div>•Malware infection.<br />
•Driver problem.<br />
•Printer connection problem.</div>

<h2>            My volume driver is 36&#37; fragmented under Optimizing Drives and I can&#39;t defrag it.</h2>
                    <p><strong>I've noticed lately while gaming (and supposedly games only!) that the sounds are heavily delayed with the game itself trying to catch up. I checked drives and saw this:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>

<p>Media Type: Hard disk drive</p>
<p>Current Status: Needs optimization (36% fragmented)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The problem is that every time I attempt to Optimize it. The process occurs for a split second and returns to saying it is 36% fragmented. No matter how often I try to optimize the driver it returns to the same status.</strong></p>

            <p>Hi Marcus,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, to know that you are facing this issue. There might be issue with hard disk. Lets follow these methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: I would recommend you to run check disk (chkdsk). To do so, follow the steps provided below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows Key + X</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong></li><li>At the command prompt, type the following command.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chkdsk volume: /f /r </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>It is not required to Optimize SSD drives. The operating system detects the presence of an SSD and optimizes operation accordingly. For SSD devices Windows 8 disables defragmentation, Superfetch and ReadyBoost, which are boot-time and application
 prefetching operations.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong><span>I would suggest you to update Graphic and audio drivers.</span></p>
<p>

    <title>Xbox 360 slim turns on but wont boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tallguy627  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 slim turns on but wont boot</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>My xbox360 has been working normally until just a few days ago. &nbsp;I turned the console on using the controller and the controller kept flashing as if trying to connect. &nbsp;the console had the middle green light but no light indicating a controller was connected.
 &nbsp;so initially i thought it might need to just resync the controller. &nbsp;tried that and both the console and the controller continued to flash. &nbsp;Then i realized that the console was not booting up at all. I was turning on but would not even display anything on
 the tv. &nbsp;Also, when i shut the console off using the console power button, it would still turn off the controller even though the controller never connected. &nbsp;After that i tried, unplugging the power to the xbox from the wall and then rebooting and unplugging
 the power supply from the xbox itself and rebooting. &nbsp;Still just has the green dot on the power button and it wont boot up.</p>
<p>help please....</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jordan</p>

<p>Try booting without the hard drive in. If you do not have a hard drive or if its still acting up, it may be about to display the red dot (general hardware failure) and will require a repair. To start one head over to

<p>MAke sure all the cords are plugged in snuggly. (Focus mainly on the video cable) If your video cable is not plugged in all the way or its not detected then the console will not boot and will just sit there with the green power light.</p>

    <title>Possible to remove Overlay Graphics on Skype Calls&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Possible to remove Overlay Graphics on Skype Calls&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if anyone knew a way to remove any of the overlay graphics in full screen mode. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm specifically referring to Controls for 'Stop Video' 'Mute' 'Hang Up' on the bottom.... As well as the Timer and 'Show Chat' on top.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
These controls all seem to go away when I am not in full screen mode, and I click away from the Skype Window....trying to do the same in Full Screen Mode.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are a bit distracting when I am sharing video through an AJA U-Tap Device.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi Marc,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, there’s no option to remove the control options when you’re on video or audio call as it was designed to function like that. When during a call you have the option listed below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>&nbsp;Turn your video on or off.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;Turn your microphone on or off.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;Add participants to your call.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;Use the dial pad.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;<a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA10022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Share your screen</span></span></a> during a call (only available on Windows desktop
 and Mac).</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;End the call.&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: For MacBook Pro users, you can also use your Touch Bar during Skype calls to show or hide video, mute or unmute
 and hang up the call.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps.</span></p>

            This is a terrible feature!!! The share your screen floating icon gets in the way if my online language lessons - I can’t read the lesson when I have a floating icon blocking it. How can I remove this icon?

</p><p>I alt tab into a program while chatting. And the overlay appears top right. I click to remove it, and a new one pops up at the bottom.
</p>
<p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t copy&#47;read USB-drives Windows 8</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 8 (64-bit) on my home PC and since yesterday it's impossible to use any form of USB/SD-storage. Whenever I plug in an USB-stick it does read it but as soon I try to copy anything (small or large files) it stops after a few seconds and
 jams the USB-stick until I pull it out. The same happens with my build in card-reader when I plug in an SD-card. I already tried installing the latest USB-drivers for my motherboard, didn't work.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The thing is that there are no problems for my mouse/keyboard/wacom/headphones, all connected via USB.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've checked all my USB-drives on my laptop (also Win8) and they're working fine there.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any idea where the problem could lie?</div>
                </div>

 here. But unfortunately none of them work. The problem is still the same. Nothing helps. Could you please suggest another option?</p>
<p>I try to answer your questions as you posted before the 2 links.</p>
<p>1. I didn't get any error message when connecting USB flash drive.</p>
<p>2. I have tried different brand USB flash drives, including Kingstone and Apacer. All of them show the same problem without any error message.</p>
<p>3. Yes, I have tried to use these USB flash drives in a different computer running XP, Vista and 7, but all of them works fine in another computer. I have tried to use these USB drives in a different computer running windows 8, and the same problem again.</p>
<p>4. My computer is ASUS S550C</p>
<p>5. I didn't make any changes to the computer, except running some updates from windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me to fix this issue as soon as possible. Thank you so much in advance.</p>

            <p>Same problem.&nbsp; The USB works on 5 other computers just fine.&nbsp; Just not <br />
Windows 8.&nbsp; Also, when I click on the file icon, the screen flashes a lot, and goes back to the desktop.
</p>
<p>when I go to devices, the computer sees the flash drive.&nbsp; There was some strange message about "metered" something or other.&nbsp; I am so glad I have
</p>
<p>Windows 7 Pro on my other computers.&nbsp; Windows 8 has been a disaster and continues to be so.

    <title>How to fix sound coming out of speakers and headphones at the same - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oreogam3r  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to fix sound coming out of speakers and headphones at the same time&#63;</h2>
                    My computer's pretty old, I'll admit that. I bought it off ebay with Windows XP pre-installed and I instantly uninstalled it so I could have the pleasure of installing Windows myself (because I'm a bit strange) with an installation disc I had lying around.
 Everything worked fine, until one day I decided to install Windows NT 4.0 and that pretty much screwed up the sound somehow. To fix this when I reinstalled XP, I found a driver that worked perfectly. With XP, I've had no problems with the sound ever since
 I installed the driver; the sound comes through the headphones when plugged in and through the speakers when my headphones are plugged out.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now here's the problem. I've installed Windows 7 Home Premium last night, as it came with a different computer that broke a while ago. It runs perfectly, just a little slow because my computer's old. Obviously, I expected to have to install the sound driver
 again, as I formatted my hard drive before installing 7. So I downloaded the driver from the same place I always do, Realtek's website. After installing it, the sound works fine - but it's coming out through the speakers and the headphones at the same time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried plugging my headphones into the jack in the front of the computer and the back, and it's still having the same problem. There is nothing else plugged into the computer but the monitor, keyboard, mouse and wifi adapter.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows 7 is the only OS by far that has had this problem on this computer. Strangely, on the computer that it came with, I didn't have any troubles. I just plugged it in and badabing-badaboom, everything was
<i>perfect</i>.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I don't understand why it's not working on this computer. If needed, my sound device as listed in the sound options is Realtek AC'97 Audio.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be appreciated!</div>
                </div>

                    <p>I am using windows insider preview build 18908-rs_prerelease 190524-1858. After changing between programs or opening a browser window, my system stops responding to mouse clicks, although mouse cursor is still movable and stops responding to keyboard commands.&nbsp;
 I have updated drivers for AMD FX-9590 and Gigabyte 990FXA-UD5R5 as well as windows update, I still have the same issues. After reinstalling Windows 10 Pro from my licensed USB I still have these issues.&nbsp;</p>

                    I can see calls coming in but if I don't answer there is no record of the call? What is wrong? Setting change? Makes this almost unusable.&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thanks for that, but it's not what I was looking for! I already know how to do that.<br />
<br />
As I originally said, I want to make the 'Details' view the <em>default</em>, so that all new folders show that way.<br />
