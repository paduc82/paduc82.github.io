<h2>            Charged for a subscription renewal early&#59; was planning to cancel</h2>
                    
<p><span>My EA Access subscription was scheduled to be renewed on August 16th. I received multiple emails about it, and was planning on cancelling my subscription tonight to avoid any charges. I then received an email earlier tonight that my subscription had
 already been renewed, even though August 16th is not until tomorrow. I would like to get a refund for the subscription charge and have it cancelled, as I do not want to continue with the service.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp; First&nbsp;go to your&nbsp;<a href="https://account.xbox.com/en-US/MyAccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox.com Account Page</a>. At the bottom of the subscription section is hyperlink named "<strong>See All Subscriptions</strong>". Click this and you should
 be able to cancel the $4.99/mo subscription fee on the next page. As far as a refund goes for the subscription that was already charged, you will need to contact

    <title>Suspicious Outbound Traffic Detected in Norton 360 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Suspicious Outbound Traffic Detected in Norton 360</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Hi, everyone, earlier today went turned on my monitor for my computer I saw a pop-up from my Norton 360 Security suite saying "Outbound Traffic Detected, We have detected a large amount of suspicious activity on your system. Your computer
 may be infected with something that Norton Power Eraser can detect and remove." Then it asks I want to run Norton Power Eraser. Here is a screenshot of it:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.imgur.com%2fkR0Qg8Z.png" /></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">After this happened I checked the logs and I noticed that Norton said that "An intrusion attempt by 66.240.250 was blocked." (There were two of these instances or entries the Security History Window/Popup.) I have circled them in orange
 in the picture below:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.imgur.com%2fGqplohD.png" /></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">There is also an instance or entry in the Security History Window/Popup that says Intrusion Prevention Auto Block has blocked IP: 66.240.205.34 for a period of 30 minutes. (Circled in above screenshot in green) When I clicked on the
 more details option of one of the intrusion attempts, in the IPS Alert section it said System Infected: GhostNet Backdoor Activity 3 (the Second entry or instance was called System Infected: GhostNet Backdoor Activity), and the traffic description was TCP,
 Port 60670.&nbsp;Here is a screenshot of it</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/383cef83-7093-4493-9414-d312dfb7a271" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/383cef83-7093-4493-9414-d312dfb7a271" /></a></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">After this I ran Norton Power Eraser and detected something but I think they are false positives because two of the files were installers for Adobe CS2 that I download from Adobe's website, two were batch files that I made myself, one
 was a Google Chrome bookmarks file and the last one which I think the most suspicious was a registry key for "microsoft. powershell". See screenshot Below:&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.imgur.com%2fBYG9rYp.png" /></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">The registry key is:&nbsp; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\PowerShell\1\ShellIds\Microsoft.PowerShell\"ExecutionPolicy" and the file thumbprint is &nbsp;SHA: Not Available. See screenshot Below:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.imgur.com%2fNNU8mb9.png" /></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">What does this mean? What should I do? What is going on? Is my computer infected? Should I repair the Registry Key? One thing that I think is odd is that in the Security History Window/Popup that there are several entries or instances
 of "ip Address has disappeared from adapter Microsoft Teredo Tunneling Adapter" (then it lists ip address.) Here is a screenshot of it:&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.imgur.com%2fXvqInOT.png" />Is this normal? &nbsp;The software that I have downloaded and installed recently is
 Seagate Sea Tools, Acronis Disk Director, Paragon Partition Manager 14 Free, and I have reinstalled and updated AOMEI Partition Assistant Standard, I have also updated Western Digital Data Lifeguard Diagnostics and tried install Seagate DiscWizard. All of
 the software that I have mentioned was downloaded from the developer's website My computer seems to be running as well at it used to I have not noticed any abnormal performance slow downs except for my wireless adapter. I done multiple antivirus scan recently
 with Malwarebytes and Norton 360 and both of them have not come up with anything. Today I ran a scan with Malwarebytes Adwcleaner it found one threat which was a registry key. here it is: HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools\MSConfig\services\geekbuddyrsp
 . Here is a screenshot of it:&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.imgur.com%2fPKGyYYS.png" /></p>

<p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have mentioned that you are planning to do a registry repair, we'd like to advise you that serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore
 the registry if a problem occurs. To learn more, you can check this article: <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, based on the last scan that you made, it looks like the result is related to a remote support. Have you been assisted via remote support prior to this issue? We suggest that you get in touch with them and verify if its best to remove the said software.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure that your PC is safe from malware, we still recommend that you run a full scan using your preferred antivirus scanner. At the same, we also suggest that you get in touch with your antivirus' manufacturer to get better assistance regarding the
 error message. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other questions in mind. </p>

            Hi Jenifer, thank you for the quick reply, I really appreciate it. I was not planning on doing a registry repair. I just wanted to tell you guys that I had a option of doing it and if I should repair my the registry. I have not contacted Norton/Symantec
 yet because I wanted to see the advice people gave on what I should do about this incident. I also am not super worried about this because I think it is just my antivirus doing its job. I just wanted to see what other people have to say and get multiple opinions
 too.

            Hi Jack,<br />
<br />
Regarding your query, we suggest that you contact your antivirus' manufacturer first to check on the error code just like
<strong>Jennifer Cha</strong> mentioned in her post above. It would be best to check it first before doing a registry repair.
<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back for an update and let us know if you need more help.

                    <p>Happy New Year!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first attempt to sign in this year was a disaster! After entering password, I saw the usual 'Welcome' then 'Preparing Windows ..? which remained for two minutes than "We can't sign in to your account ... The problem can often be fixed by signing out ..."
 Options: Sign Out or Dismiss. &nbsp;Chose Sign Out. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Process was repeated and after attempting to sign-in again received the same message. Tried shutting down and starting up again - same result. This time chose 'Dismiss' then selected 'Settings - Account -' Chose 'You can also sign in with local account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chose new account name but used the same Microsoft account e-mail address and password, and what appeared to be a new account was set up successfully (but it was set up without any of my files and settings, so I then spent half a day re-creating the account
 - loading up all my files from backup on external hard drive, setting up start menu tiles and preferences &nbsp;- set up Outlook for my e-mail address and spent an hour synching all my folders with the e-mail server. Finally everything started to look OK again
 - Ouf! So I went for dinner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I returned I was asked for the password to sign in to my 'new' local account. ......... and after keying it in and seeing the usual 'Welcome' - it was followed by 'Setting up Windows' then ... as above "We can't sign into your account?

            <p>Hi Jennifer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting involved to help me. I took the link and changed my Microsoft account password, then tried to sign in again using the new password. First, I should make it clear that the only option I am now offered is the 'Local' account (which I had
 called 'My Alternative' ). When setting this up - as explained in my last post - I simply gave it the name 'My Alternative' but still used the e-mail address and password for my Microsoft account. Perhaps not surprisingly, the new password was not accepted
 for this account but the old one seemed to be OK - except that I had the usual response after the 'Welcome', 'Preparing Windows' cycle: 'We can't sign in to your account ..'.</p>
<p>I selected 'Dismiss, then 'Settings' then 'Sign in with Microsoft Account'. I then entered the Microsoft account e-mail address and the new password - and got the response: 'Oops, something went wrong. We can't add your Microsoft account to this device right
 now'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise what I should try next</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Ron</p>

            <p>To further troubleshoot, we recommend you try to change or remove your password using your installation media. You may use the installation disk or download Windows 10 ISO file on a USB drive. To get started, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Restart your PC and boot from installation CD/USB.</li><li>Press <strong>Shift+F10</strong> simultaneously to open <strong>CMD </strong>
and execute these commands: <strong>move c:\windows\system32\utilman.exe c:\windows\system32\utilman.exe.bak</strong> and
<strong>copy</strong> <strong>c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe c:\windows\system32\utilman.exe
</strong>(replace<strong> c:\</strong> with your system drive letter). <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f05d1956-470e-4aa6-9a5f-a4aa9720b527" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f05d1956-470e-4aa6-9a5f-a4aa9720b527" /></a></li><li>After executing the command, remove the installation media and reboot your PC.</li><li>On the login screen, click Ease of Access and you should be prompted with the
<strong>CMD</strong>. </li><li>Execute the command:<strong> net user &lt;username&gt; &lt;password&gt;</strong></li><li>If you don't want to set a password, you may leave<strong> &lt;password&gt; </strong>
blank. <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/27f5d4da-d650-4eb0-a769-6390da734e61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/27f5d4da-d650-4eb0-a769-6390da734e61" /></a><br />
</li><li>Close the <strong>CMD </strong>once you are done and go back to the login screen to sign in without password.</li></ol>
<p>Keep us posted with the result.</p>

<p>
</p><p>First, I don't have an installation CD as I downloaded Windows 10 as a free upgrade from 8.1. But last October I had problems so downloaded Windows 10 onto a USB drive and reinstalled. I assume I can use that USB drive.</p>

            <p>I HAVE SOLVED MY PROBLEM!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately my wife's account on the same PC was still functioning OK. Although I could not sign in fully to my account, when offered the choice of 'Sign out' or 'Dismiss' (see previous post for sequence of events), I selected Dismiss, then 'Settings' and
 I was able to change the status of my wife's account to 'Administrator' (potential security issue as I was not signed in but I'm not complaining!). Then from my wife's account, as administrator I added a 'new user' - specifying my usual Microsoft account e-mail
 address. This was accepted. I then signed out from my wife's account and signed in to the newly created account. My password was accepted I was asked to set up a PIN, then Windows went through the usual set-up process for a new account. I then had to import
 all my files from external hard drives, set up and sync Outlook, set up all my preferences and re-record all my passwords etc. But all is now well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>

            <p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to sign in to your account on the desktop in one of the Advanced options for Windows 10. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Restart the computer while holding down the <strong>Shift </strong>key.</li><li>Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Advanced options</strong>.</li><li>You can choose any among the options. It will give you the administrator accounts on your computer. Select the one you are unable to sign in to.</li><li>Enter your password and check if it will also not go through.</li></ol>

            <p>Thanks for this helpful response Ruz San.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It hasn't yet enabled me to solve my problem but I have learned about the Advanced Options start up which was new to me. Here's how I got on:</p>
<p>1. I selected 'Repair Start-Up' , </p>
<p>2. selected my problem account, </p>
<p>3. selected my keyboard, then </p>
<p>4. entered the password (during the previous attempts to solve the problem, you may remember that I had changed the password - which I have since used repeatedly, successfully, to sign into the account from my laptop and my Windows Phone). &nbsp;I was told that
 the password was INCORRECT! So</p>
<p>5. I tried again, using the OLD password - the one which was working on the account BEFORE I hit the problem, and it seemed to accept this and carry on into the process.</p>
<p>6. I was told it could not repair the start up - try another option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SO IT SEEMS TO ME that the start-up process for this account on my desktop system, is still trying to check against my OLD password, but when I try to log in with that password in the normal way (i.e. NOT using the Advanced options) I am told that it is
 an incorrect password,) I am told it is an incorrrect password. Just tried to sign in again in the normal way, in case this had triggered something but NO - STILL NO GOOD:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would welcome suggestions for next step.</p>

<h2>            Computer in a continuous reboot loop after Windows update</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Serious windows update conflicts with driver software after reinstallation</p>
<p>I just performed a clean reinstall of windows home basic on my dell vostro 1400 using the reinstallation cd(I do not&nbsp;have the driver cd).&nbsp; Afterwards I was able to install drivers using another computer to transfer driver software to a usb and from the usb
 to my laptop.&nbsp; I had over 100 different windows updates to perform.&nbsp; At about 74 or 80 there were errors... unfortunately I didn't get those error codes... but they were basically telling me to just install the updates to that point. I did so, restarted my
 computer and attempted to install the rest.&nbsp;The process got as far as restarting my computer and would not get to the login page but continued to restart over and over again.&nbsp; I performed a computer repair through the reinstallation cd which told me that it
 could not find any solutions except to perform a system restore.&nbsp; I did so, I tried the process again with trying to install the first 5 updates( the 5 at the bottom of the list- they were "recommended"&nbsp; and not "important").&nbsp; Anyway, tried it and the same
 thing happened .&nbsp; I am guessing i is one of those updates but in the detail log of the computer repair it said that it may be related to driver software or hardware issues.&nbsp; Any help?</p>

<p>Hi <strong>castillozoe</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dynamic lock is designed to be paired for Windows phones. However, as time goes by it's also became well matched to Android devices. As of now, this is not compatible with iPhone even though it can be successfully paired to a Windows device. Nevertheless,
 making dynamic lock available to all phone models will be a great addition to Windows 10 features. You may submit this idea through

 idea might be added on our future updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have additional questions, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.</p>

<h2>            ASUS X502C Windows setup won&#39;t start</h2>
                    I have an ASUS laptop running Windows 8.1 that I would like to recover after putting it away for a few years. It greets me with an error saying that Windows needs to be repaired because \EFI\Microsoft\Boot\BCD is missing or contains errors. It tells me
 I need to put in the installation media through disc or flash drive. The laptop doesn't have a disc drive, so I plug in a flash drive and it doesn't boot into setup for me to recover it. Pressing ESC for the firmware options does nothing either. Please help!

            <p>Thank you Shylesh for your reponse. Yes, the problem was the AMD video card driver with Win 8. So I uninstalled everything AMD from my computer and reinstalled an older version first. After that I installed the newer version over, which in turn fixed the
 error message (hopefully for good). :)</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>Try these solutions in order. If you give each one a shot and you still can't connect, contact Xbox Customer Support.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Check your network</span></strong><span>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Make sure your PC is on and connected to the same network as your console. You can do this quickly by physically verifying that your PC is turned on and that all the cables are in place, but you can double-check by "pinging" your console from the PC. To ping
 your console, you need your console's IP address.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><b><br />
<strong><span>To get your console's IP address:</span></strong></b>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; a. In the Xbox Dashboard, go to My Xbox and open System Settings.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Select Network Settings, Configure Network.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; c. On the Basic Settings tab, select IP Settings.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; d. Write down the number for IP Address (for example, 192.168.1.9). You can back out of the network settings area, but leave your console on.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>To ping your console from your PC:</span></strong><span>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; a. If it's off, turn on the Windows Media Center PC.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Click Start, Run, then type CMD and press Enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; c. At the command prompt, type PING and the IP address your wrote down (for example, PING 192.168.1.9), then press Enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; d. If you see a series of replies, then your PC "sees" your console. If you see a series of "Request timed out" responses, then it can't find your console.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Again, make sure that both your PC and your console are connected to the same network.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><b><br />
<strong><span>Method <span>&nbsp;</span>2:</span></strong></b></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Check your PC's firewall</span></strong><span>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Your PC may be blocking your console from connecting by using a firewall to filter traffic by blocking ports. You'll need to open certain ports in order to connect to your PC.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Learn how to open <strong><span>firewall ports on Windows 7</span></strong>:</span></p>

                    <p>Recently got a Scorpio and have hooked it up to a 4K tv (Samsung MU7000). Everything 4k-wise is showing as supported and enabled, my TV is registering the HDR when I&nbsp;play 4K&nbsp;content, and games are displaying in 4K HDR and looking great.</p><p><br /></p><p>4K Blu-rays look very poor though. Looking online the only issue I&nbsp;can find is the HDR problem which a fix was rolled out for on Friday (and I have that update), so this is something new.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Have tried a couple of different films and the picture quality definitely isn't 4K, and when switching between a 4K Blu-ray and a regular 1080p Blu-ray it's immediately&nbsp;very obvious that the 1080p Blu-ray picture (probably with upscaling) looks significantly better than the 4K Blu-ray picture. It's not a subtle difference, the 1080p Blu-ray looks much, much better (I've compared with 4K and 1080p copies of the same film).</p><p><br /></p><p>I've done all the troubleshooting tips on here, and the TV Details

    <title>Unable to choose where I want things stored or to choose a default - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to choose where I want things stored or to choose a default photo app</h2>
                    <p>For quite some time, when I go to "Settings" , I am not able to determine where I want to store things. It already says new apps, pictures, documents, music and videos will be saved to "This PC (C:) and an arrow pointing down. But you can't open any of the
 boxes to see where they are stored under the (C: drive). &nbsp;Which is very likely why, when I down load pictures, they end up in all kinds of folders. &nbsp;I am no longer given a choice where I want them loaded to, and it is often so fast, I can't read where the
 "computer" decided it should go. &nbsp;I would very much like to have at least that small say about where my pictures go.</p>
<p>But now, when checking my default programs, there is the typical grey box that says +a default program, but it never accepts any program I check. Not even the built in Photos app.</p>
<p>I would like to have back control of my PC. &nbsp;I have loaded one outside app that ALL of my photos have ended up in. And with the duplicates, after duplicates, after.... it now has &gt;10,000 photos in it! &nbsp;I have never loaded 10,000 photos to anything!</p>
<p>My husband passed away just over three years ago, and I am just now finally taking control of my entire life! &nbsp;Could anybody tell me how to take back this PC?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Barbara M.</p>

            <p>Hello Sujata&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was actually almost finished answering your questions last night, but I experienced another BSOD episode. It seems to happen almost daily now. &nbsp;But, first let me thank you for your reply. I very much appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions......I am the Administrator to the best of my knowledge. &nbsp;It's a long story, but if something asks for admin approval to do something, it usually accepts me. &nbsp;I am using the MS account. I tried setting up a local account for myself
 a while back, but when logging in to various places, I never knew if I was using my passwords and info, or my "alter ego". &nbsp;Once I got everything straightened out, I never signed in with the local account again. &nbsp;I did however, set up another user account
 under my late husbands name, so I would have a "Standard User" also. I was forced to do that when the super secret embedded Administrator just popped up one day, and almost locked me out. He's gone from the login screen now. &nbsp;I hope that's a good thing.</p>
<p>I was trying to remove all my photos from my OneDrive. Partly because OneDrive showed up in my directory as it's own entity. &nbsp;(I mean that it didn't fall under This PC, or any Microsoft Folders. &nbsp;However, it did suddenly show up in my (C:) drive user folder.
 &nbsp;And it turned into being a photo only storage space. The Document and Download folders just disappeared one day, and it was all photos. &nbsp;So, I have been moving all my photos from there to my user folder. &nbsp;OneDrive also started making duplicates of all the
 photos every time it updated, until I had a couple of thousand pictures in it, aside from the same pictures I had in my personal folders I set up for photos. &nbsp; The outside app I installed is Nero MediaHome. &nbsp;I wanted a photo app that is independent of Microsoft
 and Windows, due to the problem with Windows going down and taking everything with it that is attached to it. I always thought the store took everything out, until a light bulb hummed to life, and I noted that I also lost the start box on the screen as well
 as my keyboard, Cortana goes down, Edge, Photos app, the notifications and action center lock up and any apps I got from the store. &nbsp;I needed an app I could put photos in and still get to them when everything else crashed.</p>
<p>Last of it, I promise. &nbsp;Your suggestion of going to&nbsp;<strong>settings&gt;storage&gt;change</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span><strong>where new apps are installed. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>That was one of the things I originally asked about in my post. &nbsp;I can not change where new apps are installed. &nbsp;As I said, there are white (not grey as I said before) boxes that say "This PC (C:) and an arrow pointing down". &nbsp;If I click on a box, it will
 change to a bluish color, but does not let me change anything. &nbsp;Just like trying to set a default app for photo viewing. &nbsp;When I click on that box, it will open a list of apps or programs, but will not save your choice.</p>
<p>Sorry about rambling on, but I wanted to try and give you a better picture of what I have been experiencing. &nbsp;I hope I answered all your questions. And again, thank you for trying to help.</p>

                    <p>It's Star Wars day today, and many people out there are busy celebrating this huge event for Star Wars fans! I love Star Wars, and I enjoying playing many Star Wars games on my Xbox. What are your favorite Star Wars games to play, and how are you celebrating
 Star Wars day? My favorite game is the original Star Wars Battlefront 2!</p>

            My favourite Star Wars game I've played, and I've not played much, is The Force Unleashed. Loved the storyline of Vader's secret apprentice and the conflicting in him as you play through the game. Been meaning to put it back on recently and get every achievement
 but keep getting sidetracked lol. As for celebrating Star Wars day, again I was slacking in that department and binge played World War Z all day😂

6.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the
<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.<br />

<br />
1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then
<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator
</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:
<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>

<h2>            Facial Recognition - Windows Hello Sign-In Option not Working</h2>
                    <p>After installing a windows update today, I am unable to unlock my laptop using facial recognition or Windows Hello.&nbsp; I have been using Windows Hello since Oct, 2018 but today it shows me the following message in 'Sign-In Settings' page: Windows Hello is
 not available on this device. See the attached screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have confirmed that my camera is working but still I am unable to setup my facial recognition sign-in option now.&nbsp; Please advise me on how to fix this issue and provide me detailed steps to reinstall this feature.</p>

            Hi OsamaJaved 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Try the following...
<br />
<br />To repair your Windows Hello
<br />Open File Explorer and browse to this location:
<br />
<br />C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Microsoft\NGC
<br />Delete everything within that folder
<br />FYI if you can't see the AppData folder make sure in file explorer you go to the view tab and options - change folder and search options - view and select 'show hidden files, folders, and drives.
<br />
<br />Make sure to do this as Administrator logged in.
<br />Also, just keep clicking Continue if you get the message "You don't currently have permissions for this folder"
<br />
<br />If you can't get past that screen then right click the NGC folder and go to properties and click the Security tab.
<br />Click Advanced.
<br />Click Change beside Owner and type in Administrators and click OK.
<br />
<br />Now try emptying the NGC folder again, once done close all the windows.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings-&gt; Accounts-&gt;Sign-in Options
<br />Click Add a PIN again and set your PIN
<br />Try again.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work try creating a new account profile.

<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your comprehensive response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed each and every step however I got stuck at "<strong>Microsoft</strong>" folder and I was unable to pass through that.&nbsp; I followed the instructions of going to the
<strong>Security </strong>tab, <strong>Advanced</strong>, clicked <strong>Change </strong>
beside <strong>Owner </strong>and typed <em>Administrator </em>and <strong>OK</strong>, but nothing happened!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was not even able to access <strong>Microsoft </strong>folder.&nbsp; Pop-screen screenshot attached below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any workaround for me to set-up Windows Hello (face recognition sign-in) option?&nbsp; I want it back since it is really smooth and fast for me to log-in everytime my laptop is locked.&nbsp; Please share any other available option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            seems you don't have administrator rights on your machine.
<br />Try doing this in safe mode.

<h2>            Multiple problems with Windows 10 1803 &#40;April update&#41; on Surface Book 2</h2>
                    <p>There are multiple issues with Surface book 2 with Windows 10 April update (1803).</p>
<p>A lot of owners complain about it, but still no word from Microsoft:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/8gka29/surface_book_2_issues_collection_thread_after_1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/8gka29/surface_book_2_issues_collection_thread_after_1803/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Copied from reddit:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">There are some issues with my SB2 15" since insider builds of 1803, I have reported a few times in insider sub and the feedback hub but it doesn't seem to arouse attention.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsinsiders/comments/8ff5eb/lagging_issue_in_surface_book_2_15_still_exists/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">(previous
 thread in insider sub)</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/Ugr9bw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">(link to feedback)</a></p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">If the feedback post applies to you, please upvote in the feedback hub.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">So I created this thread here to list my issues, and please do reply to this thread with your issues too. Hope this will draw enough attention from MS to fix these issues soon.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>System freezes for a few seconds after closing an app (Edge, Mail, Calendar, Store, etc), visible from animations</p>
</li><li>
<p>When restarting or shutting down, the animation of dots running in circle will freeze briefly for a few times.</p>
</li><li>
<p>After using Visual Studio Code for couple of hours, a long time freezing happens following closing the application.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Touchpad gestures such as three fingers push-up and pull-down are laggy.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Slight log when closing Edge/other Apps. (Probably identical to #1)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Over all laggy experience specially in edge after the update</p>
</li><li>
<p>Draining battery, detach and reattach now needs to wait a while( nearly twice to three times), detach button shows red first then green.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Difficulty opening apps when Microsoft Edge is open. For example, when Microsoft edge is on, try opening the Weather app or calculator app.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Fan runs crazy from time to time when in performance mode on battery.</p>
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">WORKAROUND:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">Open the classic win32 control panel, go to Hardware and Sound, then NVIDIA Control Panel, change the global setting to use NVIDIA card, also in program settings, some programs like Edge/Chrome use Integrated
 Card, so change them too. Those lagging/freezing issues 1-6 may be fixed. Down side is this may use more battery, and can't detach</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">My workaround: Disable Nvidia video adapter in "Device Manager".</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">Personally I find it absurd that Microsoft don't test their own (super premium) hardware first before releasing such updates to the general public. You can notice this issue immediately after boot, even on
 a new fresh install.</p>

    <title>USB Mouse and Keyboard stop working in Windows 10 at Startup Screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB Mouse and Keyboard stop working in Windows 10 at Startup Screen &#40;picture, date, time, but not the login text box&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>My Lenovo IdeaCentre&nbsp;Desktop (fairly new, might be a refurb) running Windows 10 was having a problem with the taskbar at the bottom not being recognized properly by full-screen windows.l usually reboot the computer and the problem is resolved. This morning,
 after the reboot, my mouse and keyboard stop working on the Windows main screen (after the Lenovo logo). These are the identified symptoms:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mouse and keyboard work before Windows 10, but stop working at the Windows date/time screen.</li><li>Mouse light goes out.</li><li>Keyboard lights&nbsp;are&nbsp;on, but are non-responsive (num-lock, caps-lock)</li></ol>
<p>Here's what I have tried so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Safe Mode: I cannot seem&nbsp;to get into safe mode without a keyboard or mouse since it seems safe mode is blocked by this same screen.</li><li>Use different mouse and keyboard: Same problem.</li><li>Bios Settings: USB Legacy Enabled and Disabled: No noticeable change.</li></ul>
<p>I am downloading USB recovery software from Lenovo and Windows, but I would like to avoid losing as much as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've researched a lot of help on this topic and there is one thing I would like to make clear to help avoid wasting anyone's time.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The keyboard and mouse do not work.</span> Any solutions that involve using either
 of these to click on or enter information in Windows will be useless. I can use these in the setup or bios.</p>

            Hi Patrick,
<br />
<br />Windows Update KB4074588 has caused some incompatibility between your mouse and your USB Ports (Hub Drivers), you mosue and keyboard are fine . . .
<br />
<br />If you can get into Windows:
<br />
<br />Open Command Prompt as Admin and run this command to uninstall that Update
<br />
<br />wusa /uninstall /KB4074588 /quiet 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt
<br />
<br />You must then stop this update from installing again:
<br />
<br />Download the tool from the link below, run that, in the list of pending updates, select that update and click 'Hide' that will stop windows from attempting to install it: 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If you cannot get into Windows:
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
<br />
<br />If necessary ckick 'Show more Restore Points'
<br />
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to prior to this update

            A failed Windows Update is the likely cause of this problem.
<br />
<br />Try these options:
<br />
<br />Option 1: Perform a repair upgrade:

<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click Command Prompt (Admin)
<br />
<br />Confirm the drive letter for the Windows image. Usually D: –&gt; dir d:
<br />
<br />    Run the following to view the installed packages which will also show a date of install.
<br />
<br />    Dism /Image:D:\ /Get-Packages
<br />

            If you can get into Windows, can you navigate to the Control Panel?
<br />
<br />If so, go to Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />
<br />On the left click 'View Installed Updates'
<br />
<br />Find KB4074588 and uninstall it
<br />
<br />Then restart your PC . . .

            Hi Patrick, unless anyone else here on Community has a better fix,  it seems the only option you have is to reset Windows 10, while keeping your files and apps - this is a terrible error by Microsoft . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

<p>Thank you for the effort. This has been pretty bad. Timing-wise, not so good either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did the reset and that has worked. Now I need to do a whole lot of work getting everything back the way it was.</p>

<h3> alex_k17  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 BSOD kernel security check failure</h2>
                    <p>Let me start off by apologizing for my grammar and spelling, with that out of the way i have been getting a random blue screen of death and it says "kernel security check failure" i have looked online for many solutions as well as reset my pc (using the
 recovery option on windows) to try and solve this problem (i have had windows 10 for more then a few months) but this has been going on for about a month now and usually occurs once every 1-2 days but today when it happened it had a windows update following
 it up when my pc restarted and i was told by someone that this could be the problem that windows wants to update but can't at this point i am trying to ask for someone who has better computer knowledge for help. if you have any questions for me so i can give
 you more information on my problem feel free to ask and i will accommodate as best i can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>could this possibly be just a hardware issue and if so what is the culprit and how can i tell?</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 VM USB3 driver</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>We have in our environment virtual machines with Windows 7, 8 and 10.</p>
<p>I redirected USB3 to these VM, Windows 8 and Windows 10 works with USB3 and are recognize as USB3.</p>
<p>But we are not able to redirect USB3 to Windows 7, there is no driver for that, when i redirect USB Windows is trying to install Renesas driver for that but it failed. Is there any difference why Windows8/10 works and Windows 7 no ? I found only that Windows
 7 has no an in-box USB3.0 xHCI driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please point me to some drivers which can be installed on Windows 7 VM . I tried a lot of usb3 flash/hdd with the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to temporarily disable antivirus software (and any other security software) and firewall on the computer as a test and check if that fixes the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If disabling the antivirus software fixes the issue, you may have to configure the settings of the antivirus program accordingly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Make sure you enable the antivirus software, other security programs, and firewall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Warning: </strong><em>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

<h2>            Apps won&#39;t update - Error 0x803F8001</h2>
                    <p>I installed windows 10 home single language on 7/30/2015.</p>
<p>The first days installing and updating from windows store there wasn't any problems.</p>
<p>Now the error 0x803F8001 began to show up, and when I put retry it fails right after the "Adquiring license".</p>
<p>I have used the "WSReset" and the Powersell method regarding another Windows Store issues, but nothing happened.</p>
<p>The problem is still appearing and I'm afraid it could affect Windows Update. (Since the instalation, no updates through there).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: This problem aplies to system apps updates: Wndows Scan, Reader, MSN travel, MSN recipes. When trying to download another non-system update from store, like Netflix, it works.</p>

<h2>            Error code 0x80000FFFF</h2>
                    Hello!&nbsp;
<div>As my title would suggest, I am having a problem finding a solution to this error code. &nbsp;-Windows Vista&nbsp;home premium&nbsp;64bit-&nbsp;</div>
<div>Background, I am trying to install direct x11 so I can play this new game. Which should be installed with SP2, however "dxdiag" shows me that I still have 10. To my&nbsp;understanding&nbsp;I need "KB971512" (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=4390),
 however it REFUSES to install. &nbsp;It will get to 99% and then say failed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-As far as I know I am up to date on all my drivers.</div>
<div>-The only 2 updates I have for Windows update are "Windows Live Essentials 2011" and "Platform Update for Windows Vista x64-based systems (KB971644)" Both won't install<br />
</div>
<div>-I have tried everything I could find:</div>
<div>-Multiple "Fixit"s that say it fixed the problem however it still&nbsp;exist.</div>
<div>-Everything listed here&nbsp;http://www.taurarian.mvps.org/WU_Vista/8000ffff.htm&nbsp;</div>
<div>-I have done some virus scanning and as far as I can tell I am clean</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've spent&nbsp;quite&nbsp;a bit of hours trying to figure this out, and&nbsp;finally&nbsp;have given up and deiced I need help! It must be something really obvious or something very&nbsp;difficult&nbsp;as I feel I have covered the middle ground. Please help me!<br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you in advance</div>
<div><br />

            <p><span>Hi Anthonyskinner,</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It seems that you want to know how to turn webcam on. I will certainly help you with this.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the webcam?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is it a built-in or external webcam?
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you have disabled the webcam, you may follow these steps and try to enable it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Click on Start.
</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the start search box type devmgmt.msc and in the list click on
<b>devmgmt</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. In the device manager, click on view.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Now click on show hidden devices.</span></p>
<p><span>e. You should see
<b>imaging devices</b> in the list.
</span></p>
<p><span>f. Expand the Imaging device and right click on the webcam and enable it.</span></p>
