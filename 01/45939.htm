<h2>            Xbox 360 disk drive opening and closing automatically and randomly</h2>
                    
<p>Its been a few months since I bought my xbox 360, I started facing the issue of&nbsp;disk drive opening and closing automatically and randomly, almost after a week's interval, and it continued but not frequently, but today It started up with the above mentioned
 issue like 2-3 times a minute. I also turned the console off for like 2 hrs but the problem continued. Don't know whats the cause, but not the good outcomes that i'm looking at these days.</p>
<p>Kindly help me fix it.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Hey there&nbsp;The Hard Freak!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the disc tray issues. The first thing I want to try is a power cycle of the Xbox 360 console. Go ahead and power down the Xbox 360 console and unplug the power cord, HDMI/AV cable, and anything else plugged in to the console. After that let the console sit for 5 minutes. After the time is up, plug everything back in and see if the issue persists! :)</p>

<p>I already tried the same above many times. But the issue begins 10-20 min. after the console is powered on. That's certainly ridiculous and problem continues on irregular intervals. And major frustration level buzzes off during gaming when suddenly disk
 tray opens up. And this doesn't just happen during the time of gaming but while using any app or even when the console is on dashboard</p>
<p>And the tray opened 2 times just while typing this post! The problem does persists and very badly :(</p>

<h2>            Port forwarding for EYEMAX DVR on WIn Server 2012</h2>
                    <p>We were using router as a network controller in our lan. Now we replaced router with the Server (win 2012 r2 essentials). We have a EYEMAX DVR client software to connect to a remote ip in the &nbsp;web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously, on the router i had port forwarding setup and EYEMAX was working. When we replaced router with a server i can no longer connect. I guess there are similar setting to be made on a server, but i can't find what to do. It is definitely not &nbsp;a Firewall
 (when i turn it off EYEMAX still don't work).</p>
<p>There is an instruction ( http://site.camtechsurveillance.com/downloads/remoteacc.pdf ) how to setup a router to work, but i don't know how to apply similar changes on the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TL;DR.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58;  Mapped network drives not showing up until sign out&#47;restart&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Exactly what it says on the tin; anyone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what's happening:</p>
<p>
</p><p>After install, suddenly network drive mapping isn't working properly.&nbsp; When I go through the steps to map a network drive, said drive doesn't open like it's supposed to, and doesn't show up in This PC/My Computer until after I either sign out and sign back
 in, or restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, this is the process:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; Open This PC</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Click "Map network drive" and select the option from the dropdown</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; I select the drive letter (let's say I chose R)</p>
<p>4)&nbsp; I enter the network path:&nbsp; \\[computername]\R\ (the local drive letter on the network machine is also R)</p>
<p>5)&nbsp; Something flickers for half a second, but nothing happens</p>
<p>6)&nbsp; If I use the Run command, I can access \\[computername]\R\ just fine, but if I try to go to R:\, I get "Drive not found"</p>
<p>7)&nbsp; If I sign out and then sign back in (or restart), suddenly the mapped drive shows up in This PC, and Run can get to it using R:\</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the RTM build, upgraded directly from 10041.&nbsp; The network profile is set to Private, so there shouldn't be any sharing or security problems.<br />

            <p>I'm not sure if this is related but I'm also having problems with losing network drives or having them not show up. I am certain this is related to network adapter drivers and here is why:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running a Surface Pro 3 with Windows 10 Pro in Microsoft's Surface Pro docking station (so no excuses about third party drivers). Since upgrading to Windows 10 I was losing internet (but not intranet) connectivity when using the docking station after
 variable periods of use. Luckily I found a solution to this in <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_web/surface-pro-3-with-docking-station-ethernet-and/49f901d5-10a2-42e5-923a-5063b55f04a5?page=1">
this thread</a> which gives instructions for manually installing updated drivers for the Surface Pro ethernet adapter from the Microsoft update catalog. That stabilized the network connection but then I started losing my network drives. So I undocked my Surface
 to switch to the wireless adapter and the network drives reappeared. Next I redocked the Surface and watched the drives disappear. Then I manually connected to my wireless network while still docked and the ethernet adapter still enabled and active. The network
 drives immediately reappear. So for me, this problem seems to be clearly a driver issue since I didn't have the problem with Windows 8.1 or with the older (but unstable) drivers. If it matters, the driver version is 8.18.303.2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least I have a workaround but I'm guessing that it means all my network drive traffic is going through my slow wireless adapter. Not cool as I rely on transfering large files to and from my NAS for my job.</p>

            <p>In maybe the same tin...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stumbled into a problem:</p>
<p>Scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mapped a network computer drive to be E:\ on a laptop</li><li>Worked with no obvious problems - plug in a USB stick and it would take the next drive letter up</li><li>Then networked computer serving the mapped drive was not available - showed as not available on the laptop.. OK</li></ul>
<p>Problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plug a USB drive into the laptop - fails to show in Explorer. It appeared as a device; but not as a file system - guess Windows was trying to assign it to be drive E:\ - but that was held by the Map</li><li>The Map drive letter could not be released - Un-Map or Delete refused to clear it</li><li>Only solution was to put the network server back online and then clear the Map on the laptop.</li></ul>
<p>I was sure I had never had this problem before... but... all of my Windows 8.1 computers are now Windows 10 (10240 and 10525). I cannot test on Win 8.1. I still have a Windows XP computer - tested it... no such problems - dead network drive maps are easily
 deleted.</p>

            <p>I've run into this myself; if it helps, this is how I handled it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the USB drive plugged in, open Disk Management and simply change the drive letter of the USB drive.&nbsp; It leaves your network map alone, but remembers from then on what letter to give your USB drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frustrating that you have to do that to begin with, but best solution I've found.</p>

            <p>the MS preferred way is to use the far end of the alphabet when mapping network drives - that's why their default letter to map is "Z".</p>
<p>
</p><p>However: </p>
<p>My network server is set up with 4 physical drives with&nbsp;several partitions and shares. All of the drives and partitions follow an old mapping system I've used for the past decade... It&nbsp;just so happens I mapped E:\ on the network server to be E:\ on the laptop.
 It worked until the network drive was unavailable.; then the laptop balked.&nbsp;I'm sure that was never a problem with WinXP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fault seems to be in&nbsp;the drive letter mapping between network and removable drives not being resolved properly. If it fails it does not self-clean as it did in Windows XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>USB drives can be mapped to specific drive letters... I&nbsp;only do that when a particular USB stick is used for say "Plans" and I want it to have the same letter (say P:\) on every computer in the hive. But plug in a fresh USB drive and then have to Disk Management
 it... well... as you say: "frustrating"</p>

<h2>            Redeemed a code online but game did not queue and download on XBOX</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased an XBOX One with bundled games.&nbsp; Two of the codes loaded through Kinect with no issues.&nbsp; For the third, I kept getting an error and a message indicating that I should try again later.&nbsp; So I logged in and registered the code online and it appeared
 to work with no issues.&nbsp; The game was correctly identified and I received a message indicating that the game would download automatically on my XBOX.&nbsp; However, after 2 days, the game does not appear there.&nbsp; Online, it appears that I do own the game.&nbsp; How do
 I prompt the XBOX to download the game?</p>

            <p>I've had this issue since the last preview update. I've had to hard reboot the console to get the content to show up in my ready to install list. Hold your power button for 10sec or till it turns off, unplug the console for 5min, plug back in and turn it on. Then check your ready to install list. </p>

                    Doing a quick check before you can schedule upgrade is as far as I've gotten all day. I don't know what to do next.

            <p>The solution, which has worked for everyone who's tried it, not only provides bootable media needed for future repairs or reinstallation, but also gives a much better install that doesn't allow corruption or factory bloatware to be passed into the fresh
 new OS.&nbsp; </p>

<p>1) Is Blue tooth built into to your computer or are you using a usb dongle?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way check the device manager to make certain you have a working driver for the blue tooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Next go into settings and look under devices and make certain blue tooth is enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) If it is on and you do not see it you will have to search for your devices if it doesn't install automatically.</p>

<h2>            Windows time service will not start.  Error 1290</h2>
                    
<p>I was troubleshooting a time issue and performed the following commands</p>
<p>net stop w32tm<br />
w32tm /unregister<br />
w32tm /register<br />
net start w32tm</p>
<p>And I received an error.&nbsp; (didn't document)<br />
Went to services and attempted to manually start service and reveived the following message.</p>
<p>Error 1290: The service start failed since one or more services in the same process have an incompatible service SID type setting.&nbsp; A service with restricted service SID type can only coexist in the same process with other services with a restricted SID
 type. If the service SID type for this service was just configured, the hosting process must be restarted in order to start this service.</p>
<p>I performed the steps found in this forum post and it still does not work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I receive the same error.&nbsp; I can not start w32tm.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is your computer set to backup files automatically?</li><li>Are you using any third party backup program/utility (e.g. Carbonite, Acronis etc.)?</li></ol>
<p>Event ID 5 is specific to backup operations and basically occurs when your computer tries to backup automatically to a specific drive location. Since, the portable media is not connected to system the Event ID 5 is generated to display that the auto backup
 operation has failed. The warning message does not harm the system in anyway and if you want you may re-run the backup without any loss of data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. If the issue still persists, please post back for further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; To your questions:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; But I have now turned it off.&nbsp; So will see what happens now.&nbsp; When I open "backup and restore" that external HDD "My Book" is shown with a big red X on it.&nbsp; I am still mystified that "My Book" shows up anywhere since it is disconnected and there
 is no software associated with it that I can find.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; No.</p>
<p>It is good to know that no harm will come from this.&nbsp; However, you say I "may re-run the backup without any loss of data".&nbsp; When I click on 'backup now'&nbsp; the only option it gives is to my CD/DVD-Drive.&nbsp; So I suppose I will need to reconnect My Book to do
 a backup.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you need to reconnect the external drive to backup the image on your portable hard drive.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Event ID: 12348 is generated for the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) if the service does not have access to the volume root directory, the drive partition in which the operating system is installed and so the shadow copy creation of the
 volume may fail.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) provides the ability to create&nbsp;a point in time image (shadow copy)&nbsp;of one or more volumes that&nbsp;can be used to&nbsp;perform backups. The service is also used during restores of applications.</p>
<p>So, for the prevention of this event generation, we need to ensure that the VSS has access to the volume root directory. To do so, you may follow the following steps.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Go to
<strong><span>Start</span></strong>, click
<strong><span>All Programs</span></strong> and open
<strong><span>Accessories.</span></strong></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Right click on
<strong><span>Command Prompt </span></strong>in the Program list and then select
<strong><span>Run as administrator</span></strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:<br />
</span><strong>icacls&nbsp; C:\&nbsp; /grant&nbsp; system:f<br />
</strong>(<strong>Note</strong>: The above command is applicable if your Windows is installed in the partition C: of the drive. You may it replace it with the appropriate drive letter.)</li></ol>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Please post back for any further assistance.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Event viewer log history will still account the warning messages based on your system performance. However, they do not harm in any way. If you want, you may delete the older logs. If your system is freezing while in operation and giving slow performance,
 then you may try the steps provided in the following Knowledge Base (KB) article.</p>

            <p>OK I will ignore that notice in the Event Viewer since it does not indicate a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed the directions in the article you referenced ie. under Advanced Boot Options did a "Repair this Computer" and then "Repair Startup".&nbsp; After both processes the report showed no problems found and all tests showed each one to be operating normally.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>However, from clicking on "restart" to login screen it took 6 minutes.&nbsp; This is much longer than before the problems began.&nbsp; I am now going to see if I can pare down the "Startup" programs.&nbsp; Also could there be too many unnecessary "Services" running?</p>
<p>However, good news, have not had any freezes lately!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like to inform you that it is advisable to have single security software installed on the system to&nbsp;prevent&nbsp;any conflict between the third party software. Additionally, to rule out the possibility of a third party intervention, I would suggest
 you to boot your system in Safe Mode and check if the computer takes more time to boot up.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> </span><span>Try to boot your system in a state of necessary Microsoft services in operation and a&nbsp;minimal set of drivers enabled, called
<em><span>Safe Mode.</span></em></span><span><br />
<strong><span>Start your computer in safe mode </span></strong></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> If the system works fine in the safe mode, try to clean boot the system:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></strong></span></p>

    <title>Xbox keep crashing on manhunt mission - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raygneur  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox keep crashing on manhunt mission</h2>
                    After the first animation with Spacey the game keep crashing when i face the girls sitting at at the table outside. I've donne all the type of reset possible (hard reboot, cold reboot), seen the message for syncing the game which confirm the rebbot but
 the game keep crashing when i arrive at this point in the animation. The picture feeeze and i get at the start screen of the xbox. Anybody had the same issue ? Would having a disc version instead of numeric version correct the problem ? When we downloaded
 the game we had to shut down the xbox after 12 hours. When I turn it back on, it continued the doanload without problem. The installation was flawless.... Alain

<p>I've had the same problem with the "MANHUNT" mission, re installed it 2 times now, Microsoft solution is to factory reset my 96 hour old Xbox one, and spend another 25 hours re installing all my games, what a joke, Microsoft is basically telling us our time
 is worth nothing.</p>

<h2>            Trying to upgrade HP Pavillion dv6700 to Windows 10 and install hangs</h2>
                    My laptop is about 8 years old and originally came with Windows Vista. I upgraded it to Windows 7 years ago. Last night, I tried to upgrade it to Windows 10. It hung up at 32 percent install and 6 percent install features and drivers. Sat there for hours
 and I eventually rebooted using the power button. It came up and restored Windows 7 due to the install failure. Someone told me to update all the drivers and try again. The only update was a newer version of Bios which was installed. The drivers were all current.
 I tried the Windows 10 install again tonight and hung up at exactly the same place. The check before the install says the computer is compatible with Windows 10. I suspect some driver is causing the hang up. I think I might try removing all the drivers and
 try again. Is there any other solution?&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I have a 4-year old Dell E6320 Latitude that has 64-Bit Win 8.1 Pro with Media Center. System is at the latest patch and BIOS levels. Last night the install of Windows 10 Pro from ISO DVD hung at 32 percent/6 percent as described above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebooting caused the original system to be restored. A Win10 panel came up saying&nbsp;that the install failed and that the error occurred in the FIRST_BOOT phase during SYSPREP operation. Code is 0xC1900101 - 0x30018.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This failure has occurred twice in the same place&nbsp;on this machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Prior to launch I had uninstalled the Norton Security Suite and Suspended Bitlocker. The Pre-Install scan was clean - no issues of any kind identified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do to get this to work???</p>

            Went through the list provided. Nothing stood out. Removed most of the drivers and tried install again. Still hanging at 32 percent complete with 6 percent install features and drivers.

            Well, success. I was able to get the Windows 10 install to work. I went back to the HP website and updated all drivers again. Some did an update and some didn't. The 2 I remember were the hotkeys and chipset updates installed. I also removed the gadgets
 on the Windows 7 desktop and the sticky notes. I booted off the DVD, but did not do a clean boot. To my surprise, Windows 10 installed without hanging this time. This issue can be closed as solved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable/Uninstall your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install
 other software and\or troubleshoot any pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to malware attacks.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may also check by booting your system in mode. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or
 when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily
 lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is
 connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.

<h2>            How to set VPN L2TP Ipsec shared password on Windows 10 build 10240</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I'm testing the Windows 10 x64 10240 build on VMware Workstation 11, and have the following issue with VPN: After creating new VPN connection of type L2TP IPsec I need to set the shared password. Unfortunately, the settings for VPN connection have no option
 for this (it's new win 10 ui windows). Then tried to open classic interface properties from Network Sharing Center but the properties won't open and explorer is restarting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone can sucessfully create VPN L2TP connection with shared pass?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Tom</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Restore Point - overview, where can I find it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter f_inal frontier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Restore Point - overview, where can I find it</h2>
                    <p>Having grown into computing on a 32KB IBM 360, programming in Assembler, here I am, having built a twin socket Tyan based Windows 10 beast of hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here is my point and the question follows: while the net is full of material, to find the short of it often takes days. Such as me spending about three days getting on top of Word 2007 - aiming to move to 2013. The result for me is a document that tells
 me at any time how to set up Word 2007 so that it works for me. Unlike the initial install, which is positively dysfunctional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question is, does someone have a useful overview of Windows 10 Restore Point, how they are created, where held, how these relate to a System Image, and most of all how I can usefully display them in a list and decide which ones to trash?</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the various, and growing methods of finding settings in Windows 10, even just to get at a list of Restore Points is a three-cups-of-coffee task.
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Are u aware of that application bug ? Because it makes impossible to have a good report ticket to Rockstar© as they ask for a video proof of our purchases... And it actually says that all kind of Xbox app and Xbox servers are UP LOL&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Arandsor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming to the Xbox forums, I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried opening the Xbox Assist app through the System tab on the Guide menu below Settings?</p>
<p>Have you also tried a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
soft factory reset</a>?</p>
<p>Have you downloaded the recent April system update that was released yesterday?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also if you didn't know, you can actually view your order history by going online to
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/orders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">account.microsoft.com/orders</span></a>&nbsp;and that could be an alternative until this is solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know specifically what steps you've tried with Microsoft Support and if your console is up to date.</p>

            Thanks for the reply but the think is, after I have already done the hard reset and power cycle, the problem is still there, and Rockstar has a protocol for Support Tickets which need a video proof of our order history (is it legal?) using the Xbox System
 and Xbox Assistant... I guess if they are kind they can accept a proof with the Microsoft website but dunno the app is still bugged ^^'

<p>Hi Arandsor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for updating us. If you have already tried the factory reset while keeping games and apps, then check to make sure your console is up to date. Open up Settings&gt;System&gt;Updates &amp; downloads and make sure your console has the most recent April system
 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to recreate the issue on an Xbox One S with limited network connectivity so it does not have the new&nbsp;update currently. I tried viewing my order history and resulted in the same error while the Xbox Assist app was trying to open. It's possible
 this is due to the console not having the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Rockstar's policies you'll have to ask them why they require a picture of your order history through the console since the order history is the same no matter where you view it, so it shouldn't matter. Double check and make sure that they can use
 a proof from your order history online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know that your console is up to date.</p>
        </p>

<p>Thank you to have tried to recreate the situation because I haven't seen it anywhere, I supposed it too and so I did it (the update) and it's not effective, I will try to solve my problem with R* using website and order history pictures instead of their
 video protocol.</p>

                    OK, sorry if this is answered elsewhere.&nbsp; I would like to have different colors of the file folder icon.&nbsp; In particular I would like to keep the icon that is the default for Windows 7, using Aero.&nbsp; I have tried several versions of software that will give
 me a colored folder, but it is not the same one that is the Windows 7 default, the 3D folder standing on end with a page sticking out.&nbsp; I hope this is possible, and thanks for any help.

<p><span>Hi Western Massachusetts,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Windows you do not have the option to change the color of the icon.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, you need to restore all the folders icons back to default Windows folder icons. Also remove any third party application
 you have used to change the folder icon and colors to get the default view of the folder icons.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To restore the icons to default Windows icon, follow the steps below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Navigate
 to the location of the folder.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Right
 click on the folder and s</span></span><span>elect "Properties".</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
