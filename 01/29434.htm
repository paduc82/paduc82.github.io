<h2>            Windows 10 stuck in login screen</h2>
                    <p>When I boot my computer it automatically logs into the account ”Asministrator” and because it doesnt have a password, I cant safe boot or switch to another account.
</p>
<p>When that happens it puts me in the setup screen where it asks if I want my location to be shown or if I want to use Cortana, and every time I finish it, it says that it ”didn’t work, but you can try again.” With the error message OOBESETTINGSMULTIPAGE.
</p>
<p>Even if I try again, which I have many times, it has the same message. And after many restarts of the pc, I cant get it to go away.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

            Hello Gebu,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question. 
<br />
<br />It seems you've built-in administrator account enabled. First create a new administrator account for yourself using the built-in administrative account existing currently.
<br />
<br />Login to your account and open administrative Command Prompt and run this command: 
<br />
<br />net user administrator /active:no 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and reboot. 
<br />
<br />The 'Administrator' account should be disabled now. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!       
        </p>

            Hi Gebu
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />How to Boot from a USB Flash Drive in Windows 10 - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />

            <span>If you have forgotten your password, if you have another user account with administrative privileges you can log into that account and change your original user account's password from the User Accounts applet in Control Panel.
 If you don't have another account like this set up or don't have the password to it, you'll need to log into the built-in Administrator account. In XP Home, boot the computer into Safe Mode. Do this by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting
 up. This will get you to the right menu. Navigate using your Up arrow key; the mouse will not work here. Once in Safe Mode, you will see the normally hidden Administrator account. The default password is a blank.<br />
<br />
In XP Pro, you do not need to go into Safe Mode. At the Welcome Screen, do Ctrl-Alt-Del twice to get the classic Windows logon box. Type in "Administrator" and whatever password you assigned when you set up Windows.<br />
<br />
If you have XP Pro or Media Center and were using the built-in Administrator account for your regular work and it is therefore the only user account on the system, there are ways to change the password for that account to a blank. Microsoft doesn't permit us
 to tell you how in these forums. Their house, their rules. Use Google or ask a local computer tech (not a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place).</span>

    <title>My new surface pro, 2017, is overheating when using the touch screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> megos  say:</h3>
<h2>            My new surface pro, 2017, is overheating when using the touch screen for more than 15 mins&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I just got my new surface pro 2017 i5 256 8G RAM less than a week ago.</p>
<p>It’s working fine when I’m using the keyboard, no heating, no unusual performance so far.</p>
<p>The problem come when I remove the keyboard and start using the touch screen, the surface start to get worm from the top back then the device is totally overheating after 15-20 mins up to the limit that you can’t really hold it comfortably.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is happening with normal internet browsing!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Software is updated, no programs running in the background, plus I have tried all possible troubleshooting methods mentioned here in the community but the problem still persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My last hope was to do factory rest, I did that plus I re installed &amp; run all the updates as recommended by the system to make sure that the windows are up to date, i didn't install or download any additional program … but unfortunately again &amp; again it’s
 getting overheated just with normal browsing! <span>
☹</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this the normal permeance for the new surface pro?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice, any help will be really appreciated</p>

<p>Thanks Barb, this is actually what i did, i returned the device to the local seller in UAE who took almost a week to test the device and finally declear it as faulty, i'm now waiting to get a full refund back to my card, another 7 business days&nbsp; :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was really excited about the new surface but after my experience in the past 2 weeks - the wasted time to return the device and the waiting time to get the refund - i actually lost trust in MS hardware!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shame on you Microsoft!!</p>

 are added for each suit completed. This allows for a theoretical maximum score of 1256."</span></p>

<p>Hi and thanks -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand what is the highest possible winning score, but my question is what is the lowest possible winning score.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also know that the lowest possible score is zero, but that would be a losing score.&nbsp; If I go back long enough, I can get the score down to zero, but the game allows me to play, and eventually I win.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So again, what is the LOWEST possible WINNING score.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>Well, if you read the articles I linked to, you already stated you are getting lower scores than the second article says should be the lowest (since you add 100 for each suit completed)... You should be able to calculate the lowest score yourself from the
 scoring methodology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the point to get the lowest score?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can the score go negative or is that running out of moves?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Etc.</p>

<p>Hello keystina,</p>
<p>Stamps.com&nbsp;is&nbsp;supported for Microsoft Windows 2000/XP/Vista Windows 7&nbsp;operating systems according to their website.<br />
I recommend you uninstall the stamps.com software and then reinstall it. It may have become corrupt.<br />
<br />
Do you get any error messages? <br />
Check the event logs for any error messages. <br />
<span><span>Open Event Viewer by clicking the</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span>
 button<br />
Click </span></span><span><span><strong>Control Panel<br />
</strong></span></span><span><span>Click</span></span><span><span><strong>System and Security<br />
</strong></span></span><span><span>Click</span></span><span><span><strong>Administrative Tools<br />
</strong></span></span><span><span>Double-clicking</span></span><span><span><strong>Event Viewer</strong></span></span><span><span><br />
If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Then check the application event logs and look for any errors dealing with your stamps.com program.<br />
It may also be another software program is interferring with stamps.com software.<br />
You can use a clean boot to determine if there is a conflict. <br />
<br />
You will Disable all startup items and third party services when booting. This method will help us determine if this issue is caused by a loading program or service.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>KB 929135 - How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The steps below will place your computer into a “clean boot”, meaning using a minimal set of drivers and startup<br />
programs so that we can determine whether a background program is interfering. </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start on your Desktop<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type msconfig in the Start Search box and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable</span></span><span><span>All.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Once the computer is back to your Desktop, check to see if you are still having the problem.<br />
If the issue is resolved by placing the machine in “clean boot” then we have some sort of third party application<br />
and or service running that is possibly interfering. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To determine which program(s) and or service(s) that is causing this, we would need to go back into “msconfig” and start to enable programs and services and reboot until
 we see which one causes the problem.Depending on how many programs you have installed,<strong>this step can take a long time. You can enable programs in blocks to see if there is a problem which may be a little quicker.</strong></span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p>If placing the computer in “clean boot” does not fix the issue or after the troubleshooting is done, follow the steps above “To return your computer back to normal boot”.</p>
<p>How to set your computer back, to boot normal: <br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Click the Start orb on your Desktop<br />
2. In the Start Search box. Type msconfig, and then press ENTER. <br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
Click the General tab. <br />
3. Click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.<br />
4. When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.</p>
<p>Please reply back and let us know if this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely, <br />
</p>

<h2>            Windows Old file empty, data not found</h2>
                    
<p>Updated from Windows XP and Windows Vista. The program was supposed to have saved all the information from outlook into a "windows old" file folder&nbsp;(ie: inbox, calendar, contacts) however all the "windows old" folders were empty. This occurred with all users.&nbsp;Including
 with all thier documents from word and excel...etc.</p>
<p>Is there any way to retrieve all this old infomation as the import troubleshooter did not work (followed all online instructions to a "T".</p>

            Unless you format the C: drive during installing Vista and 7, the files contained in the Windows.old folder can't be deleted. So, I don't know why this is happening to you.<br />
Anyway, there are some&nbsp; <strong>File Recovery</strong> software available in the market which can be helpful to recover files. For example, the&nbsp;
<strong>Recuva</strong> . It's free and can be downloaded from here&nbsp; <a href="http://www.piriform.com/recuva/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.piriform.com/recuva/download</a> . It helps in recovering deleted files, but it has certain limitations and can't recover everything and depends on many technical issues, such as, if the Hard disc cluster has been overwritten then the recovery is
 impossible. Not only this software but also any Recovery software has this kind of limitations, and indeed there's no such perfect software available which can guarantee for 100% successful recovery. Nevertheless, sometimes this types of software work fine.<br />

No, you can't, that is an OEM license, which is tied to that computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<font>
<p>OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No; if&nbsp;the Operating System on the other Computer came pre-installed (Dell, HP, Acer, etc)&nbsp;you can not use it on another PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Laptop/Computer came with the Windows Operating System preinstalled (Dell, HP, Acer, etc), that Product Key that came with the Laptop/Computer is for the preinstalled OEM License and is non-transferable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines) is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only Retail Operating System&nbsp;License, that you buy and install yourself, are allowed to be transferred to another machine.</p>
<p>And Retail Licenses can also only be installed on one machine at any particular time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro 3 with Windows 10. When my Logitech MX Anywhere 2 is plugged in when I first turn on my surface, Bitlocker will not let me type! If I unplug my wireless mouse receiver and restart, I can type just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this? It's convenient to keep it plugged in because it's so small and I travel a lot, I don't want to lose it. Let me know! Thank you!!</p>

<h2>            Issue with downloading drivers and updates.</h2>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Thank you for your recent reply.<br />
<br />
Based on the information you have provided it would indicate the update has been completed successfully. The reason for the two different version numbers is because they are two different things. The one you see in the device manager is the actual driver for
 the wireless card. The one you see in 'Programs and Features' is a the software from Realtek to tie in with the driver. This is the one that has been updated, the actual driver will have not updated.<br />
<br />
If you require any further assistance please contact us on 0871 495 8944 (UK) or 01248 1248 (Ireland), Monday to Friday, 9am to 6pm or simply reply to this email.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Recently I asked for help in downloading and installing Toshiba updates as the three methods they gave me failed to work.When I advised Toshiba of this fact they sent the above as their answer which I fail to understand as the update was for a driver for the
 wireless card so why is the old driver version still showing?.<br />

            Can you please specify why are you trying to update the driver? Are you facing any problems with the current one? Because as per the Toshiba's tech support mail. The drivers that you have are latest and do not require any update they have only updated
 the software which works along side the drivers.&nbsp;

            The driver version I had was 2002.5.712.2012 dated 12/07/2012 for my wireless card Realtek RTL8723AE Wireless LAN 802.11n PCI-E NIC.The one that I tried to download from Toshiba was version 2.00.0020 dated 08/05/13 which I in my ignorance thought would
 be an improvement,after reading the Toshiba blurb.The driver I have now for the wireless card was downloaded and installed using SlimDrivers.I fail to comprehend what Toshiba are saying due to the Toshiba update saying it was a driver for the above wireless
 card with a different version number which I expected to see changed when I opened device manager,which incidentally has changed with the driver from SlimDrivers.To say I am confused is to put it mildly by drivers which are not drivers!!!.

 from Toshiba.

            There is no problem with Microsoft updates or with downloading and installing any other programs and if I update a driver using Device Manager that is o.k. too.The problem I am having is when I download a driver update from Toshiba it vanishes into the
 ether,never to be seen again wherever I searchCould do with a computer Sherlock Holmes on this case.

<h2>            iqrl_not less_or_equal__DRIVER_Iqrl_not less_or_equal</h2>
                    
<p>I just recently began getting serious BSOD errors (within the last 24 hours). I'm not sure what could be wrong as I've checked in countless forums and trying to troubleshoot the issue myself as well.</p>
First up, I haven't installed any new programs or applications nor have I installed or updated any drivers within the last 24 hours. Also, so far anyway, this error only happens when trying to use the main OS. Booting into safemode has yet to give me this error
 or crash. (I'm writing from safemode).
<p><br />
<strong>Tech Specs:</strong></p>
<p>Intel i7 2.8GHz</p>
<p>8 GB RAM (4 2GB sticks) [right now running with 6GB, I checked the RAM to see if one set was bad and haven't put all 8GB back in yet]</p>
<p>2 720GB (HDD)</p>
<p>Windows 7 Professional (OEM)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the error I get. I get a BSOD at, seems to me, random times after startup. Sometimes it's as soon as I login, sometimes it's about 10 to 15 minutes after login.</p>
<p>I usually get this error: Iqrl_not less_or_equal</p>
<p>I've only once gotten this variation: DRIVER_Iqrl_not less_or_equal</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've read in lots of forum posts for a solution, but I'm afraid I've missed something, so I'm posting here to see if I can get some better help and explanation.</p>
<p>Here's what the error box after next start up states:</p>
<p><strong>Problem Signature:</strong></p>
<p>Problem Event Name: BlueScreen</p>
<p>OS Version: 6.1.7600.2.0.0.256.48</p>
<p>Locale ID: 1033</p>
<p><strong>Additional Information:</strong></p>
<p>BCCode: a</p>
<p>BCP1: 0000000000000000</p>
<p>BCP2: 0000000000000002</p>
<p>BCP3: 0000000000000000</p>
<p>BCP4: FFFFF80002CE12B3</p>
<p>OS Version: 6_1_7600</p>
<p>Service Pack: 0_0</p>
<p>Product: 256_1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apon a second crash I got a similar report with different numbers as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BCCode: 1e</p>
<p>BCP1: FFFFFFFFC0000005</p>
<p>BCP2: FFFFF80002CCBCD8</p>
<p>BCP3: 0000000000000000</p>
<p>BCP4: FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help anyone can give me. I'm a music composer and without my PC properly working, I can't do my work. I also do not want to fresh install the OS if I don't have to. It's a lot of work and a pain to have to go back and re-install every bit
 of my software and recording gear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Derek</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Use these methods thoroughly :<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from<br />
tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not does not mean you should not<br />
check with the other methods below.<br />

<br />
Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.<br />
(If Rootkits run UnHackMe)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes - free<br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />
<br />
Run the Microsoft Malicious Removal Tool <br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; MRT&nbsp; find at top of list - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You should be getting this tool and its updates via Windows Updates - if needed you can<br />
download it here.<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(Then run MRT as above.)<br />

<h2>            Gamer pic</h2>
                    
<p>The gamer pic that I'm using on my console is not matching up on this website as well as another. I had this problem before, but I don't remember how it was resolved. When i go to change the gamer pic, the regular and personal gamer pic are the same. Any
 help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>It depends, if you upgrade through the Store (Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Go to Store),
<strong>no</strong>, the Windows 10 Home license was used as a base qualifying license for the discounted Pro Pack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you purchase a full version Windows 10 Pro license for 199 through the Microsoft Store,
<strong>yes</strong>, you can transfer the Windows 10 Home license to another computer.

            No. If you use an upgrade version, you end up with a single license, not two. That's why an upgrade version is less expensive than a full version.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bugcheck 1a is "MEMORY_MANAGEMENT". &nbsp;This indicates memory corruption has occurred; this can be attributable to hardware failure (faulty RAM, for example), or a bad/buggy driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Check if RAM sticks are working fine. Scan your computer's memory for errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned in the link below:</p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Diagnosing-memory-problems-on-your-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Diagnosing memory problems on your

            <div>All my drivers are up to date, should I reinstall them all or can I rule out particular ones?</div>
<div><br />
So far Method 1 didn't find any errors (enhanced search, default cache setting, 7 passes).
<div><br />
<div>I will work through the steps of the 2nd method as I have time. &nbsp;The computer is still under warranty but their solution is to reinstall Windows 7 to prove there is a hardware issue before they'll even touch it. I can't open the case unless I void the
 warranty, so I'm continuing to back up all my files (and make sure I haven't forgotten any) in preparation for a reinstall, but trying to do as much debugging as I can in case it is a software issue. &nbsp;Thanks for looking at my dump file and giving me advice.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>To see how to use BlueScreenView and MyEventViewer to troubleshoot Bluescreens see the<br />
methods indicated in this thread - top 3 answers (+1 other).<br />
<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/sometimes-i-get-a-blue-screen-when-using-ie-8/c675b7b8-795f-474d-a1c4-6b77b3fcd990">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/sometimes-i-get-a-blue-screen-when-using-ie-8/c675b7b8-795f-474d-a1c4-6b77b3fcd990</a><br />

We can analyze the minidumps if you make them available from the SkyDrive or other file<br />
sharing sites.<br />
<br />
Zip or upload the contents of C:\Windows\minidump</p>
<p>Use SkyDrive to upload collected files.<br />

<br />
Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) -<br />
actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Make sure the vents are clear and that the<br />
fans are working. Even though the temp is OK do not assume heat can't affect the video,<br />
sound or other system functions it those get to hot. Try adding a small fan blowing into<br />
the vents as a test. (Those are mostly for a PC not a laptop.)<br />
<br />
Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before these started?<br />
(Check Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there about the<br />
time this started) Main likely culprits are Video driver, other major drivers, memory, and<br />
antivirus/antispyware/security products could be at fault as well as drive issues.<br />
<br />
Use the troubleshooter below and refer to the next message for drivers and memory when<br />
you get to those sections and then return back to the troubleshooter as needed.</p>

<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />

The log might give you the answer if there was a corrupted driver. (Does not tell all the possible<br />
driver issues).<br />
<br />
Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party<br />
keyboard and mouse, as well as other major device drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<p>==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

Even one memory error is too many so that is at least part of if not the whole issue.<br />

            yeah, so I've read....backing up to do restore of OS to prove its not a software issue to the warranty holders. &nbsp;I think that's my best hope although I have found some new drivers to update when I get this fixed. &nbsp;

            Problem solved...after much haggling with the warranty company (I don't recommend buying one, it was a gift to me)..I finally got them to send over a technician. &nbsp;The technician was there to replace the HD (their diagnosis), but after giving him breakfast
 and a little smooth talking I got him to look at the memtest results and convinced him to tell his company to replace the RAM and MB. &nbsp;He checked each RAM stick and one tested slower than the rest even though it didn't report an error. &nbsp;He took that pair of
 RAM sticks out and my computer is now in excellent working order. &nbsp;Lesson: &nbsp;Warranty companies will try everything to get out of actually doing anything, but with enough undeniable logic and patient determination you can get them to at least open a case on
 your account. &nbsp;When you finally get a tech over, treat him well!!!

Well at least you got it fixed. Sounds like you need a new warranty company, if any, and<br />
a new technician. <br />

            Hi Renee.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I don't know what you've tried unless you tell me.  
<br />
<br />What works for most to reset PIN so it works is here:
<br />
<br />If you cannot Add or Remove the PIN in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign in Options even after a restart, then unhide Hidden Files in File Explorer &gt; View tab &gt; Options &gt; Folder and Search Options &gt; View tab &gt;  tick box to Show hidden Files.
<br />
<br />Browse to C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Microsoft\NGC
<br />
<br />Delete or rename to NGC.old this folder to reset the PIN.
<br />
<br />
<br />You may need to first take ownership of the folder:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3841-add-take-ownership-context-menu-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3841-add-ta...</a>
<br />
<br />Once you delete or rename the folder it will recreate it so you can add a PIN normally in Sign-In Options.  You may need to restart the PC first.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>I followed all your steps, took ownership of the folder, and that part worked. I added a pin, and that worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when I restarted it asked for password again, so restarted again and it still asked for password instead of pin.</p>

<p>The only option I have when signing in is under the box where I sign in there is an option that says "I have forgotten my password". No option to change sign in options. Plus, when I go to sign in options in settings, it doesn't say "change pin", only "add
 pin"</p>
<p>So I'm getting absolutely nowhere on this. I'm going to do a defrag, and then a full scan with Windows Defender to see if that helps, but I'm not very hopeful on any of these making a difference</p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>Sorry for taking so long to get back to you. I have tried each and every step you mentioned, including re-installing windows, and still cannot sign in with pin instead of password. I have sent feedback to Microsoft through the Microsoft Hub today, and hopefully
 they will resolve this issue in some way, as it seems quite clear that I cannot resolve this problem. Thank you so much anyway for trying your hardest to help me, but at this moment in time I cant see a solution.</p>

<p>Кто нибудь знает, почему не дает перезакачать map pack ? Скачивает 99 процентов, а затем говорит, Что невозможно скачать. Был на американском акаунте, скачал данный мап пак, кстати он продается и на русском. Игра хомфронт. Но так как игра на русском языке,
 данный мап пак не пошел, в связи с нововведение от микрософт, теперь если игра на русском, то и карты нужно покупать только на рашен лайве. Просто жуть. В оф поддержки объяснили, что да такая фигня возможна и что да, даже за деньги перекупить данный пак не
 получиться :) Маразм. И еще один повод сменить бокс на PS.</p>

<p>К двум последним постам: русский лайф это просто клондайк по сравнению с русским PSNом, там вообще сплошной аркадный шмурдяк и пара тройка бородатых игр. а в извинение за то, что больше месяца не работал мультиплэйер и украли личные и платежные данные игроков
 мне предложили скачать бесплатно игру литтл биг планет 1 которой уже 150 лет! при всем при том, что русского PSNа возраст поболе нежели у лайва. Я ни в коем случае не агитирую, просто делюсь опытом и предостерегаю от дополнительных трат. Сам продал PS3 с барабанами,
 джойстиками, мувом и 33 играми. </p>

<p>Если я правильно понимаю вопрос. Аккаунт - это учетная запись пользователя с логином, выдающиеся при регистрации в xbox live. Аккаунтов на одной консоли может быть больше одного, регион каждого при регистрации можно указать любой из доступных, если указать
 регион США - то можно будет видеть весь ассортимент американского лайв, но купить, что - л, а тем более скачать будет затруднительно - т.к. проверяется региональность. Аккаунт (учетная запись) в лайве бывает серебрянная и золотая.

<h2>            Windows XP service pack 3&#58; DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</h2>
                    Hi everyone,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an old desk top PC running Windows XP service pack 3 2002. It was working fine until about 6 months ago, when it started restarting unexpectedly whilst I was on the internet. When it rebooted it would show the XP screen with the little bar running
 across the bottom, but then it would just display a black screen. After shutting it down by holding the button I managed to boot it again in safe mood and turn off instant restart.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The next time it shut down I got a blue screen saying:<br />
<br />
Driver_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>***STOP:0X000000D1 (0X000000400, 0X0000002, 0X00000000, 0XF85F8A29)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>***NDIS.SYS- Address F85F8A29 base at f85dc000, Date stame 48025dD3</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Beginning dump of physical memory.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I think there was a little more underneath that, but I didn't write it all down as I was just planning on googling it. I found a number of other questions similar to this on the net, but none were using the same OS as me and I wasn't really sure what to
 do. Is there any chance it can be fixed?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be massively appreciated,</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Michael Duncan</div>

<p>Si estas en una PC en la marketplace web debes cambiar la region de la pagina desde la opcion que esta al pie de pagina y te saldran los precios es la moneda del pais seleccionado. Si tu perfil lo hiciste con un e-mail con otra regiom debes mudar tu perfil
 al pais de residencia para poder comprar.</p>
<p>Nota: si mudas el perfil a otro pais pierdes el dinero que tenia la cuenta</p>
