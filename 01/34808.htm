            <p>Why do you suspect that someone has access to your mail account?&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want&nbsp;to change your e-mail address, you have to do that using the services of your email provider.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a Comcast email address, you have to login to Comcast's website and change it there.&nbsp; If you have an AOL address, login to AOL.com.&nbsp; A Cox Communications email address, log in to
<a href="http://www.cox.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.cox.net</a>.&nbsp; Hotmail accounts have been susceptible to hacking for as long as Hotmail has existed.&nbsp; Hotmail is now Outlook.com. These are just examples.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen many instances of address books that are stolen from people and used by hackers to advertise things like Viagra.&nbsp; If you have connected your address book to Facebook, then this is another way that thieves get access to people's address books.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using&nbsp;the Google Chrome browser can get you hacked, if you use the wrong extensions or add-ons, and can even get you badly infected with viruses.&nbsp; Always maintain your Antivirus program to keep it current and ensure that it scans for you on a regular basis.&nbsp;
 Windows Defender does all that automatically.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>What you need to do now is <strong>change your password</strong> for your e-mail account.&nbsp; That should be the very first thing you do when you suspect being hacked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look at the link below for more specific details for your Microsoft account.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You can also create a local account to login to your PC.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You said this in your opening post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe my email account has been compromised since using Windows 10.&nbsp; Someone else is using my ID since I made the change.......Wondering how I can remove my email address when opening up computer and how I can find out who is using my ID&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without using an email address, explain this in more detail for me so I will understand it better.&nbsp;

</p><p>Please try to describe what is happening in more detail.&nbsp; I would like to help, but what you've written is confusing.&nbsp; Do you want to change your email address?&nbsp; Do you want to create a new account to login to the computer?&nbsp; Are you logging in to the computer
 with a local account or a Microsoft account?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply Brenda.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Best way I could explain everything that is going on.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My exact email ID is being used by someone else.</strong>&nbsp; Even with the password changes can't seem to get rid of it.&nbsp; My internet provider passes the responsibility of fixing it to the old provider and they pass it back.&nbsp; One company took the other
 over and&nbsp;I have been&nbsp;allowed to keep the original address.&nbsp; Both suggested I contact Microsoft because they said it could be their issue.&nbsp; At this point I am very frustrated because both the new and old provider can or wants to&nbsp;fix the problem.&nbsp; If I didn't
 have so much legal writing in the account I would dump it.&nbsp; Can't do that right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Biggest concerns.....Privacy along with identity theft.&nbsp; I think everyone should be concerned about both.&nbsp; Different world.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how else to describe the issue.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again!</p>

            <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<strong>My exact email ID is being used by someone else.</strong>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where are you seeing this?&nbsp;How do you know someone is using your email ID?&nbsp; I read this...someone is using your email ID, but not your email address.&nbsp; Email accounts are like this, UserName (ID) @ mailprovider.com.&nbsp; Anyone can have the same User Name as
 long as the mailprovider is different.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll use something common.&nbsp; It's possible to have JoeSmith as the UserName on 100 different accounts, but the mailprovider has to be different.&nbsp; @yahoo.com, @Outlook.com, @Aol.com, @Hotmail.com.&nbsp; Do you understand what
 I mean by this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if two people have the same UserName, the mailprovider has to be different.&nbsp; You can't have two strangers, using two different passwords logging in and using the same email account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My family lives in the states.&nbsp; There&nbsp;is a gentleman in Australia with my brother's exact name, first, middle and last.&nbsp; My brother and the gentleman from Australia can both use their full names for their UserName because the mailprovider will be different.&nbsp;
 If my brother and the gentleman from Australia both want to use their full name with a Gmail account, then that is not possible.&nbsp;One of them would be UserName and the other would have to be UserName1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Even with the password changes can't seem to get rid of it.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't get rid of What?&nbsp; Where?&nbsp; Do you want to change the name you login to the computer with?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;One company took the other over and&nbsp;I have been&nbsp;allowed to keep the original address.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, if you already had the UserName, say @thecompanythatwastakenover, the company that took over cannot give out your exact email address.&nbsp; It can't work that way.&nbsp; Two total strangers cannot have the exact same email address. The stranger would have to
 know your password to get access to your email account.&nbsp; The person who is using your UserName(ID) has @thecompanythattookover.&nbsp; You have UserName(ID) and @thecompanythatwastakenover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If I didn't have so much legal writing in the account I would dump it.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you open a web browser to do e-mail or do you use a third party email client, like Windows Live Mail, or Mozilla Thunderbird?&nbsp; If the company that took over has given you a new email address, it's easy to notify your contacts&nbsp;of a&nbsp;new email address.&nbsp;
 You can also save emails from email accounts.</p>

            <p>Thank you for&nbsp;your response.&nbsp; I totally get what you are saying.&nbsp; Someone does have my exact email address with the exact provider I am using.&nbsp; For example....*** Email address is removed for privacy *** even though I am not using gmail.&nbsp; Stranger must know my password even though
 I keep changing it.&nbsp; Have tried to change my name but the company refuses to do it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Microsoft Edge to log in but in private window.&nbsp; Not sure if that makes any difference.</p>
<p>Didn't have this issue with IE.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;....*** Email address is removed for privacy *** even though I am not using
</p>
<p>gmail.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you talking about a Gmail account?&nbsp; When you post an actual email address in a forum, as this, your "Email address is removed for privacy."&nbsp; I don't get to see I the email address.&nbsp; I carefully wrote about email addresses as an example, but I used spaces
 in them, so the forum software would not remove them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please allow me to explain something about email.&nbsp; Someone sends you an email.&nbsp; That email goes to&nbsp;the servers of whatever entity that provides the email account.&nbsp; The email provider stores the email for you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may or may not download the email to your computer.&nbsp; Downloading the email to your computer requires a third party email client, like Windows Live Mail, Mozilla Thunderbird, or what everyone always referred to as Outlook Express.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your email address was given to you by your&nbsp;Internet Service Provider, you might also do webmail.&nbsp; You login to your Internet Service Provider's website and do your email there.&nbsp; If your email address was given to you by your&nbsp;Internet Service Provider,
 they are your email server.&nbsp; You are logging in to their mail servers.&nbsp; Mail servers have addresses for Imap and pop accounts, incoming and outgoing mail servers, with port numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An internet service provider also cannot give two different people the same email address.&nbsp;And this holds true with internet based email providers, like Google Gmail, &nbsp;AOL.com, Yahoo and others.&nbsp; It is all computerized anyway.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance, if I wanted an AOL email account, I go to the AOL&nbsp;website and start the process of choosing a user name and password.&nbsp; If I wanted Brenda Woollard @ AOL .com for my user name, and if someone else has that exact email address, the computer is
 going to tell me that and offer me the choice of Brenda Woollard 01 or Brenda Woollard 02.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It cannot work that two unrelated people have the same exact email address.&nbsp; It would be a mess.&nbsp; Their email and your email both in the same inbox?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;One company took the other over and&nbsp;I have been&nbsp;allowed to keep the original address.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you login to the old&nbsp;email address, what do you see?&nbsp; If one company took over the other and you were given a new email address by the new company,&nbsp;you were, no doubt, advised to notify the folks in your address book of the change.&nbsp; As far as the migration
 of your saved email, in my opinion, would be the responsibility of the company that did the taking over.&nbsp; By saved mail, I mean your legal writings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing Microsoft in this situation at all.&nbsp; Windows only provides the environment to do email in, whether it's web based or&nbsp;if you use a third party email client. &nbsp;Microsoft's email is Outlook.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.</p>

</p><p>It most definitely is a Frontier/Yahoo issue.&nbsp; It looks to me like Frontier Communications is still your Internet Service Provider.&nbsp; Frontier has partnered with Yahoo to bring you more content to&nbsp;your homepage/email service type of deal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have been dealing with this for a long time.&nbsp; The FCC is the correct body to make a complaint to.&nbsp; It doesn't sound like Frontier Communications is keeping their customers happy. A poor business practice...</p>

<h2>            Win 10 Fails to Install with Error Code 0x80073B92-ox20009</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; I have been trying to update to Win 10 from my present Win 8.1 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried on numerous occasions using both Update through Windows Update &amp; by using an</p>
<p>ISO Image.&nbsp; In both methods everything proceeds normally until the installation stops and
</p>
<p>the following Error Code is displayed:-</p>
<p>0x80073B92-0x2009&nbsp; Safe_OS Phase with an error during Prepare_RollBack Operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update continually attempts to download the Update when I re-boot in Win 8.1.</p>
<p>I have a legitimate copy of Windows 8, which was up to date with all Updates.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>My computer&nbsp;exceeds all requirements for Win 10</p>

            <p>I have now managed to install Windows 10.</p>
<p>I got around the early errors by disconnecting all external drives, and all internal drives except of</p>
<p>course the Windows drive.</p>
<p>The installation went well, and on completion I re-connected all the internal &amp; external drives which were all recognised and everything is working perfectly as before.&nbsp; Even my Windows Gadgets were preserved and are operating correctly.</p>

<h2>            I cannot connect my xbox 360 controllers to my pc</h2>
                    I have a 2 in 1 charge and play while charging power lead but I cannot get my pc to recognise that the controllers are connected.&nbsp; I have followed all the steps on the microsoft and xbox websites, it either takes me to the product page for purchasing a
 new controller or I have downloaded a accessories software download.&nbsp; I have chatted with expert xbox gamers through xbox contact page and installed drivers, restarted, re-inserted usb plug, everything.&nbsp; All my sons want to do is play gang beasts together,
 using the controllers (as we discovered after buying the game that you cannot play 2 player on a keyboard as they had been doing on a free trial version)&nbsp; they have used their christmas gift money to buy the game and a lead to connect the controllers and I
 cannot get them to work!&nbsp; aargghh! #firstworldproblems I know, but if anyone can help, it would be much appreciated.&nbsp; thank you so much

<p>To connect a Wireless Xbox 360 controller to a PC you do need the Xbox 360 Wireless Gaming Receiver. You cannot use the play &amp; charge kit, as it is only used for charging and does not support playing while connected to PC.<br />

<p>Hi French,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unsure if you are still looking for assistance but it would appear everyone has pointed you in the right direction. I had an aftershock controller and it would plug into my PC no problems but would recommend an adapter as stated for OEM xbox 360 controller&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy findings!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Make sure that your PC has WIFI and Bluetooth connectivity in case you plan to use a Xbox One controller.</p>
<p>I use a Xbox 360 on my pc through the Wireless adapter like my colleague StuartATrueRed showed.</p>

            <p>so a coupledays ago &nbsp;I tried to go into my account and a message kept appearing saying that i couldn't log into the account. But the other users that are linked into the computer didn't have this problem. So then yesterday i opened up my account and then
 i saw that all of my files were deleted. Literally, everything. My itunes won't even load. The download file has all of my music in there. Im talking about 2,000 songs. This has been very depressing for me due to the fact this is music saved from 6 years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            A friend getting on your xbox when your on vactation and modding your gs and getting your ability to earn earlier game achievements banned.</h2>
                    
<p>I was on vaction and asked one of my friends (non xbox-live member) to watch our dogs so we gave him a key to our house. I have auto-sign in so he got on my&nbsp;acc and apparently thought i would be happy that he figured out how to mod my gamerscore. He thought
 i would be happy because i got all the achievements and a high gamerscore. So now I can't earn achievements for games I did legit. He ruined my gamerscore and I don't know what to do. So what do I do?</p>

<p>get a new account and start over you are 100% responsible for your own account. &nbsp;next time do not have auto sign in enabled and or set up a password for the new account next time you are not home. &nbsp;there is NO appeal for gamescore resets you can post in

<p>1) Nice friend you have there. (sarcasm intended)</p>
<p>2) YOU are responsible for your account at all times. There are tools on the console to prevent unauthorized access.
</p>
<p>3) Talk to your friend about him reimbursing you for your Live time so you can create a new account and start over. This time putting a pass code on your account to protect it from people like him.
</p>
<p>4) So long as you don't change consoles other accounts can share DLC (avatar items excluded of course).</p>

<p>Then you can't. Apple's License agreement excludes such an option and the OS-X installer detects that is not running on the legitimate hardware and will not proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only the Dedicated OS-X server build will work as a VM and even then only on Apple hardware.</p>

<p>You would need to furnish your own copy of macOS, which you can get only from the App store, but its not easy to setup, but its possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As other have noted, Apple licenses macOS with its proprietary hardware, so, if you run it on non-approved hardware, you are basically going against the license agreement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many tutorials and instructions you can find using your favorite instructions about creating what essentially is called a hackintosh. &nbsp;</p>

            I haven't read Apple's EULA specifically but almost certain it includes a clause precludes reverse engineering the software which is exactly what the hackintosh&nbsp; community is doing so is illegal.

            There could be a number of reasons to want access to OS-X but it is always safest to play within the rules. I have an iMac in the loft that hasn't seen&nbsp; daylight for 3 years and Macbook that gets dragged out once a month to test interaction issues with
 Windows. When I got it (second hand) it sat on the desk for half an hour and I couldn't think of anything to do with it.

<p>I own and use a MacBook Pro, but 10 years ago, I built a Hackintosh using an Asrock board and AMD sempron processor. It was a fun project. In terms of legality, over the past 10 years since this was made possible with OS X on Intel, I have never heard of
 Apple knocking on anyone's door over it. In fact, its actually a gateway drug into the Apple ecosystem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, its not gonna be a reliable experience, the minute Apple releases a point update, its likely to break your setup. I got fed up after 10.4.6 and put it aside for a while. A few years ago, I decided I wanted to own a real Mac and made the investment
 in one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tinkering will become tiresome and annoying after a while, and if you really want to use macOS, you eventually cave and purchase a real Mac.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, endorsing or condoning it should not be taken out of context. The fact that Oracle's VirtualBox and VMWare both provide the option to setup macOS as an operating system in a virtual machine; says as much. Apple has not sent them any cease and
 desist orders to remove the function.</p>

<h2>            Desktop is inaccessible</h2>
                    I'm using an ASUS F6A and I can log into windows vista but when it takes me to the screen that should be my desktop all I can see is a grey screen. I can still access the internet using the FN key, so I'm pretty sure someones pressed a button and put it
 in some sort of mode but I have NO idea how to fix it. Any ideas?

<p>Suggestion #3. <br />
Go to <strong>Safe Mode with Command prompt.<br />
<br />
</strong>Logon to your account ( I am assuming you can logon to your account in safe mode as mentioned in earlier reply ).<br />
Run a system file check.<br />
<br />
Start button &gt; search box&nbsp; type&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> cmd</strong>&nbsp; &gt; look up, RIGHT click on&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>cmd.exe</strong></span> &gt; click&nbsp;<strong>Run As Administrator</strong> &gt; in that black and white cmd window, type at the flashing
 prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>&nbsp; &gt; press<strong>ENTER</strong> key.<br />
Note : there is a <strong>Space</strong> between "sfc" and "/".<br />
Sit back and wait. It will take some time.<br />
When done, exit cmd window.<br />
Reboot ( re-start your computer )</p>

    <title>Windows Explorer Bugged and Cannot Click Desktop Icons or Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> finnesterhuizen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer Bugged and Cannot Click Desktop Icons or Windows</h2>
                    <p>So this has happened to me twice already, only temporary solution I found was to do a complete reinstall of Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What triggered this problem each time was logging into a Microsoft account on my pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From there some strange problems came up. (I have a dual monitor set-up, and these problems only came up on the monitor set to primary) My mouse and keyboard have full functionality, however I couldn't click any desktop icons. Furthermore, strangely I could
 only interact with the window focused on, ie. I couldn't drag or click on a window underneath the one I had selected, leaving the only way to switch between windows be alt tabbing. The Task Bar had limited functionality and seems to only be clickable at random
 when selecting different windows. If I ever clicked anywhere on the desktop, I would lose all functionality on the screen and the only way of getting control back was to alt tab to another tab again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarting Windows Explorer does nothing to help, and reinstalls have proven ineffective since the problem comes back every time I log into my Microsoft account. I have the latest updates of windows installed, and all drivers etc. are up to date. I reiterate
 that the problem only comes up when I log into my Microsoft account, I had been using my pc fine for over a year again before I tried again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I don't want to have to reinstall Windows again, so input would be greatly helpful,</p>
<p>

<h2>            Skype Keeps dropping out and requiing me to log in again</h2>
                    I work from home and have my computer set to log in to skype when I log on my computer. Recently, it keeps just arbitrarily closing and requiring me to log in again with full email and password. This does not seam to be happening on any regular time frame
 and I have unchecked show me away after a set time frame. Any thoughts as it is annoying to have to keep loging in. This is happening at least 6-8 times&nbsp;a day.

<p>Juan,</p>
<p>I followed your instructions with no success. However, I have been observing more closely when the Skype drops out. I have determined it is when I go back to the main page for MSN.com (which is my home page for news). It appears that I can surf through any
 part of the MSN but when I select to go back to the main page that it closes the Skype. I do not appear to have any issues with searching (IE) for any other sites or when closing them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your assistance is greatly appreciated</p>

<h2>            Widows 10</h2>
                    <p>Just&nbsp;setting up a new laptop and have a few questions regarding Windows 10.</p>
<p>1. Is there a way to change the Start Menu layout to that of previous Windows start menus?</p>
<p>2. Where are the default desktop icons, i.e. My Computer and Recycle Bin?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Related: Is an "APP" the same as "Icon"?</p>
<p>3. Is there a setting to change the desktop image?</p>
<p>That will do it for now.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi tompopo
<br />1.
<br />To get the Start menu looking like the old Start Menu in say Windows 7, you need to use a 3rd party utility like Classic Shell:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.classicshell.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.classicshell.net/</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />To add the Default Shell icons to your Desktop:
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose Personalize
<br />
<br />On the left of the Settings App, choose Themes
<br />
<br />On the right, click 'Desktop Icon Settings', then form the resulting dialog, you can add those icons
<br />
<br />In Windows 10 there are 2 types of program, an App and an Application:
<br />An Application is the same as the old programs you are used to using
<br />An App is a new type of application, usually downloaded form the Microsoft Store. An App does not have a traditional Menu, like File, Edit . . .etc. and provided more modern functionality . . .
<br />An Icon is just a shortcut to either an App, application, folder or file
<br />
<br />
<br />3.
<br />To change your Desktop background:
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose Personalize
<br />Set Background to Picture and then click Browse to find your preferred picture
<br />
<br />A quicker way to do this in Windows 10 is, find any picture on your PC, right click the picture and choose 'Set as Desktop Background' . . .
<br />

<h2>            Background Intelligent Transfer Service will not install.</h2>
                    Hello, I have been having a problem with BITS not being installed after paying someone for clean installing it. Basically, everytime I try to install .NET Framework 4.5 or higher, it warns me that download wont be completed because BITS is missing from
 the PC. I need the Framework for various other things, but more importantly I wish to play some games, especially Terraria. I tried downloading BITS from the microsoft website, but it just says that I cannot download it due to low storage, despite having over
 355 GB free on both HDDs. Any help will be appreciated, thank you.

            <p>You cant use a splitter cable to display something different on a second monitor because what you to to one you also do to the other.&nbsp; Think of this like having 2 sets of headphones plugged into the same plug, when you raise the volume on one you also raise
 it on the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need a different set up and for us to help you need to give us your system specs</p>

            Sorry for the delayed response. I ended up spamming the f12 button when I booted the comp and had the windows 10 usb inserted. From there I was able to manually boot from the USB and reinstall the OS.
