<h2>            installing games</h2>
                    My children have several windows 95 games. They worked fine on the Windows 98 I was running. I purchased a new computer with windows vista and it will not let me install the games. It will show the screen but when I hit install, it does nothing.

            You may try to run them in <strong>compatibility mode</strong> (right click on the file which is launching a game &gt; Properties &gt; Compatibility tab &gt; Run this program in compatibility mode for: Windows 95)<br />
<br />
hmm.. Old games for Windows 95... If I remember some of them were launched in MS-DOS... You were able to launch them from Windows 95 but they used MS-DOS to work. You may try this:<br />
<br />
Download and install dos emulator from here: <strong><a href="http://www.dosbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dosbox.com/</a>
</strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwelie.com%2fcss%2foutgoing-google.gif" /> this one I guess is the most popular (If I remember I also used it) &gt; launch game using dos emulator (you will find somewhere information how to do
 this). I launched in that way some really old game, like Theme Park, and Desert Strike.<br />
<br />
Much more information about dosbox you can find at their wiki website: <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
<br />
You should also check whether these games are listed at this webpage: <a href="http://www.dosbox.com/wiki/GAMES" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.dosbox.com/wiki/GAMES</a> <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwelie.com%2fcss%2foutgoing-google.gif" /> so you may find precise description how to run them using a dosbox.<br />

    <title>Repair Inquiry for Xbox One Disc Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noons end  say:</h3>
<h2>            Repair Inquiry for Xbox One Disc Drive</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have never created a post on these forums before, so apologies if my topic is in the incorrect location. I have been experiencing inconsistent disc drive issues since I received my Xbox One, but some discs are much more troublesome than others. I have
 to eject and re-insert some discs ten to fifteen times before my Xbox finally detects there is in fact a disc in it, but other times the same discs will be detected without issue. I have found the issue bothersome enough to request a repair through the "My
 Service" self-service section for the console. However, the only option I had was the "<span>Xbox One - IW - Standard Exchange - Flight Program", as my console's standard warranty window has lapsed. I was wondering what happens to my console in this program?
 My greatest fear is that I will send in my console, but will be returned a refurbished console which is not my own. I take great pride in my console's appearance and cleanliness, and would find it very anxiety-inducing should I be returned a console which
 is not my own or which is a refurbished console which once belonged to another. Does anybody know exactly what sort of console I would be receiving in return? Any help is appreciated.</span></p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi MikeJu1 ,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />No need to upgrade. You can directly install Windows 10 without any worry for license. 
<br />
<br />You can go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />You can download the latest Windows 10 package from this link and install.
<br />
<br />If you had your Windows 10 license activated previously, you got a digital license. You will never need the product key again once you get digital license. Since, you have a digital license, hence when you do clean install, the license information is automatically picked up from Microsoft activation servers. Windows will activate your Windows license from this information.
<br />
<br />Make sure the version installed is same as it was previous. For example, if it was Windows 10 Home, you need to install Windows 10 Home only not Windows 10 Pro. If at any point during installation it asks for the key, choose you will do it later on / skip.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi Mike.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Once you have a license  you can reinstall WIndows 10 any way you want as often as you please.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated steps here for doing the best possible Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Skip the Product Key and it will reactivate after you connect to the internet. 
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Mike, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />You should just clean install Windows 10 rather than upgrading from Windows 8.1. This will have 2 benefits, if you have to reset again, it will reset to Windows 10, not 8.1 and your system will be more responsive and reliable . . . 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Hello Sherri<br /><br />I am a fellow Community member here to help. I am very sorry to hear that you are experiencing this difficulty. I know that it is extremely frustrating to say the least.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the new version of Skype is still under development and as such is lacking many of the features and functions of classic Skype and contains many bugs.<br /><br />While there is not yet an ETA, it is expected in the very near future that Microsoft will begin rapidly releasing updates for the new Skype in order to add features and functionality and correct known bugs.<br /><br />In the meantime, Microsoft has listened to user feedback and has decided to continue supporting classic Skype into the foreseeable future. If you are interested in returning to classic Skype for the time being it can be gotten here<br /><br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a><br /><br /><br />if you should choose to re

<p>11 keys on my new Acer Aspire notebook will NOT work, BUT ONLY when I try to type my activation key in. The following keys are only NOT available in the Windows 7 activation key entry windows but work everywhere else without issue. I'm repeating myself because
 I am even having a hard time believing this is actually happening...</p>
<p>1, 0, E, U, I, O, A, S, L, Z, N (note that both the zero and the letter O do Not work)</p>
<p>That's right this Acer Aspire works perfectly in every way, without any issues at all, including Qwerty keyboard. In fact I even hooked up a USB MS Comfort Curve keyboard and found also that the same keys would NOT work but&nbsp;ONLY in the Windows 7 key entry
 window for activation...</p>
<p>Is that utterly weird or what?! Has anyone else experienced something like this and perhaps ever found a solution?</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply! Daddio</p>

            <p>Computers, which are built by large manufactures that come with Windows Pre-Installed, come with two (2) Product Keys:</p>
<p>A) OEM SLP: This key comes pre-installed in Windows, when it comes from the Factory. This key is geared to work with the OEM Bios Flag found only on that Manufacturer's computer hardware. So when Windows was installed using the OEM SLP key (at the factory)
 Windows looks at the motherboard and sees the proper OEM Bios Flag (for that Manufacturer and that version of Windows) and Self-Activates. (that's why you did not need to Activate your computer after you brought it home)</p>
<p>B) COA SLP: This is the Product key that you see on the sticker on the side (or bottom) of your computer. It is a valid product key, but should only be used in limited situations (sush as if the OEM SLP key stops self-activating for whatever reason). The
 key must be activated by Phone. (Note: All manufacturers that use the OEM SLP system are required by contract to include a Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker, that has a COA SLP key, on the computer)</p>
<p>Your Windows is using an OEM SLP key, but (for whatever reason) cannot see the special instructions in the computerâ€™s motherboard and is unable to Self-Activate.To fix the issue, you will need to change out the OEM SLP key with the COA SLP key. The normal
 way to do this is to click the â€˜Startâ€™ button, right-click â€˜Computerâ€™, select â€˜Propertiesâ€™ and then click â€˜Change Product Keyâ€™ (located in the lower right-hand side of the window). Enter the COA SLP key and follow the instructions in the Change Product Key
 Wizard. http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en/genuinewindows7/thread/da16dd03-502a-4b21-9c9f-24fd26497a51</p>

            <p>Hey Andre,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply but I think that you might have missed the point of my post in part because it's kind of confusing to talk about keyboard keys and license keys in the same post.</p>
<p>My unusual issue stems from the fact that I have a perfectly working system, with the odd exception that there are 11 keyboard keys that will NOT type in when attempting to enter thet COA SLP Key into the pre-activation license key window.</p>
<p>These same keyboard keys work just fine everywhere else on the system. In fact I even tried to on-screen keyboard to see if that would work - same annoying result, all the same keys were none functional with the same little popup that states basically that
 it is an innappropriate character or something to that affect...</p>
<p>In summation, I have 11 keyboard keys that won't type anything in the Window 7 activation key code window, yet work perfectly everywhere else in the system.</p>
<p>Hows that for entertaining activation experience?!</p>
<p>Again Thanks for the response, Daddio</p>

            Is it a USB keyboard? Have you tried plugging into a different port?<br />
You might need to update your chipset drivers.<br />
<br />
Skip entering your Windows 7 product key and complete the installation.<br />
<br />
Once you reach the desktop, click Start, right click Computer<br />
<br />
Click Properties<br />
<br />
Scroll down to Windows Activation<br />
<br />
Click the link x days until activation.<br />
<br />
Click the link that says 'Show me other ways to activate'<br />
<br />
Enter product key<br />
<br />
Click Next<br />
<br />
Select Phone Activation<br />
<br />
Click Next when Enter your key page displayed<br />
<br />
Select your country<br />
<br />
Click Next, call the number listed<br />
<br />
Remember to explain to the call agent your situation.<br />
<br />
Provide the generated installation ID when requested by the call agent<br />
<br />
They will give you a confirmation ID in return, enter it<br />
<br />
Click Next to complete the activation. <br />

Hey Palcouk,</p>
<p>Yes, this is a factory Acer Aspire that simply has had a From Scratch Install done of Win7-64 Hm Prem OEM SP1 with the key entry and activation skipped during the initial&nbsp;install and update.</p>
<p>Like I have done hundreds of times, I wait till the unit is complete and thoroughly tested BEFORE entering the COA SLP Key (license key off the sticker on the underside of the unit). I normally deliver a lovely, ideal, fully tested and configured system
 to the client, allowing them to activate at time of delivery if they approve of the unit (which of course they always do).</p>
<p>I have never seen or even heard of this particular issue that I am having with activation and I have spent days searching hundreds of posts looking for this same issue, to no avail.</p>
<p>I could take time to completely redo this system but I really want to exhaust every possibility before doing that. Also, I expect that MS would eventually want to know about every flaw in there Activation system, were I they...</p>
<p>Thanks for the response, Daddio</p>

            <p>Hey Andre,</p>
<p>...I know, scarry huh... I have been using a very precise Win7 build out scheme that works near perfect every time asuming hardware is working as it should, so I expect that this is not the problem but I am going to do another From Scratch Install (FSI)
 of Win7-64 Hm Prem OEM SP1 in precisely the same way I always do, to see if the problem is still there.&nbsp; I was also thinking that I ought to try activation as soon as asked to see if it works there...</p>
<p>I apologize for the mildly gruff tone of my previous posts&nbsp;but it really did seem like you weren't reading my posts carefully before responding though I do imagine you are responding to many posts and may be skim reading a bit more as a result.</p>
<p>Still I do appreciate the responses and will post back here when and if I find solution or if my FSI produces the same result or other...</p>
<p>I've seen a lot or wierd Windows stuff over the years but never on my own implementations and this one though small (yet not being able to activate is pretty big as well)&nbsp;and annoying is worthy of the books...</p>
<p>Blessings &amp; Success in all you do,&nbsp; Daddio</p>

    <title>Disable PIN caching for Virtual Smart Cards - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tuelle2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable PIN caching for Virtual Smart Cards</h2>
                    <p>We want to store digital certificates for PDF signing in virtual smart cards. Due to regulatory reasons (FDA, we are developing medical devices), I have to assure that the PIN protecting the certificate&nbsp;has to be (re-)entered for each document to be signed.
 The default behavior seems to be that the PIN has only to be entered for the first document and is then cached. Is there any possibility to configure the PIN policy of a virtual smart card to "always prompt". As far as I know, this can be done for conventional
 smart cards and the windows certificate store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any information!</p>

<h2>            BPD Software tries to install after starting the computer everytime</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>After startup, my computer immediately tries to install (with Windows Installer) a program called 'BPDSoftware'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;have seen that there exists a trojan with this name, and I also had serious problems with the computer before restoring the system to an earlier point. Before restoring, Office programs and some other ones stopped working, a program called TrayApp attempted
 to load, and several error messages popped up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have both an active, updated firewall and the anti-virus programs F-Secure running, and they do not detect any malware. I have scanned the computer with Windows Defender Offline without finding anything to be wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone recognize the problems, and is there a way to get rid of the attempts to install BPDSoftware?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Iphone wont stay connected to my new Windows 8 laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eddygee53  say:</h3>
<h2>            Iphone wont stay connected to my new Windows 8 laptop</h2>
                    <p>I just switched over form a Samsung to iPhone and when I try connecting the phone to my laptop it wont even stay connected for half a second. All it does is connect and disconnect. The connection wont last a second by the time it disconnects and when it
 disconnects it connects again half a second later, literally about half a second. I know its not the phone or the cable because I connected it to an older windows 7 laptop and it worked just fine. The connection would say stable no matter how I move&nbsp;the cable.
 When&nbsp;I connect any other device in the same USB port it stay connected. I have tried all he USB ports and they all do the same thing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried an ipod and it doesn't stay connected just like the iPhone but when I put in a USB flash drive it works fine.&nbsp;I cant figure this one out myself and cant find a solution online.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, thanks!</p>

    <title>my computer is stuck on installing service pack &#58; stage 3 of 3- - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slpgb  say:</h3>
<h2>            my computer is stuck on installing service pack &#58; stage 3 of 3- 0&#37; complete.  do not turn off computer.</h2>
                    I saw a similiar post to Hi Demonofcain,<br />
<br />
Thank you for writing to Microsoft Windows Vista Answers.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It seems after installing Service pack 2 for Vista, you are getting a start up message stating that the computer is installing Service pack stage 3 of 3 and it appears on every restart.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You may try to remove Service pack 2 from the computer and install the stand alone version of Service pack 3.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To remove Service pack 2 access the link below and follow the steps:<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/948537<br />
<br />
To install standalone package of Vista Service pack 2, access the link below and download the file to the desktop. Later run the installation of Service pack 2 from the desktop.<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a4dd31d5-f907-4406-9012-a5c3199ea2b3&amp;displaylang=en<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Try disabling the security software and install the Service pack 2.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the issue persists, please reply back with the details:<br />
Did your computer come pre installed with Service pack 1?<br />
Do you have any security software on the computer?&nbsp; If yes, the security software manufacturer name.<br />
Do you have any external devices connected to the computer, during the update?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hope this would help us fix the issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Regards,<br />
&nbsp;<br />

But I can get to my desktop if I restart since I get the same message and I have vista home premium<br />

<p>Boot from the Win7 DVD and use the repair option.</p>
<p>File: \windows\system\winload.exe</p>
<p>Status 0XC0000225</p>
<p>The selected entry could not be loaded because the application is missing or corrupt.</p>
<p>Chose an operating system to start or press TAB to select a tool.</p>
<p>The only system offered is Windows VISTA.</p>
<p>--------------------------</p>
<p>If I access the repair option after booting from the Win7 DVD, there is no operating system offered.&nbsp; The selection area is blank.</p>
<p>I've tried going ahead with NEXT several times, but without any luck.</p>
<p>--------------------------</p>
<p>If During boot I select F12 for the boot menu, I can select Disk Drive and then select the proper drive for my system and it will boot just fine.&nbsp; But, I have to do this every time I restart.</p>
<p>--------------------------</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>John</p>

<h2>            Windows Fax Not Showing Sender Details</h2>
                    At my office we have recently upgraded some machines from Windows Xp to Windows 7 and now Windows Fax does not show the sender details in the Inbox. The columns have all been added but they are blank. In the Sent box all of these details are showing. In
 Windows XP this displayed in both boxes. Drivers are updated. Anyone have any suggestions?

                    <p><span>I'm unable to perform the&nbsp;Windows 10 Feature Update 1803 update. The downloading process is stuck at 100% and after sometime it fails giving an error code&nbsp;0x80240034. There's no problem with my Internet connectivity &amp; speed. I'm currently
 running 64 bit OS Pro with build 17134.345. I have performed an Update troubleshoot with administrative privileges which found Potential Windows Update error detected. I presume this is in the update and&nbsp; only related to the update as&nbsp;wu10.diagcab reports
 this potential error and cures it by deleting update from my installation. When this eventually gets downloaded it will not provide a restart and install updates button and there seems no way to trigger the update to start.</span></p>

            Hi Max, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />Usually with this kind of update issue I'd recommend the update troubleshooter, but since you've already tried that, the next step would be to manually reset the Windows Update components to see if it corrects the issue.
<br />
<br />Here's a link to instructions to do that:
<br />

<br />
<br />Give that a try, and let me know how you go! Thanks!       
        </p>

            Hi Max2thous10, version 1809 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<p>Thanks Graeme , but is this not a bit major for a fault in the Feature Update that seems to have started from its original deploy in 4th October 2018.
<br />
<br />
You seem to want me to create a new user&nbsp; and clear all network settings why is this necessary when it has worked before but not with this feature update.
<br />
<br />
I have been only given serious advise which will change my system further . <br />
<br />
Why is Microsoft handing out incompatible updates? When I first noticed this problem Microsoft Updates&nbsp; was installing the update but failing in the middle of it presumable because it had been written badly and appeared it was not checking for the existence
 of the item it was trying to update. I was told at this time to pause it and that Microsoft would fix it . This was in 4th October last year :</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e15ca65-dd04-4b8a-96d8-32c73bf39ceb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e15ca65-dd04-4b8a-96d8-32c73bf39ceb?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and then</p>

<p>Thanks Graeme , but is this not a bit major for a fault in the Feature Update that seems to have started from its original deploy in 4th October 2018.
<br />
<br />
You seem to want me to create a new user&nbsp; and clear all network settings why is this necessary when it has worked before but not with this feature update.
<br />
<br />
I have been only given serious advise which will change my system further . <br />
<br />
Why is Microsoft handing out incompatible updates? When I first noticed this problem Microsoft Updates&nbsp; was installing the update but failing in the middle of it presumable because it had been written badly and appeared it was not checking for the existence
 of the item it was trying to update. I was told at this time to pause it and that Microsoft would fix it . This was in 4th October last year :</p>

<p>
</p><p>and then</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06d4f64d-f150-4480-81a2-99a8b4473ec6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06d4f64d-f150-4480-81a2-99a8b4473ec6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Are you both suggesting in view of my post above that windows has somewhat changed since this roll out in 4th October 2018 was created. I have to suggest to you that nothing has been installed on my computer since 4th October 2018 and therefore it should
 repeat this same error of an undo of the installation unless the Feature update has been modified since 4th October 2018. If this was then modified why was it not brought inline with Windows Professional?</p>

<p>Dave thanks for your advice. However the last time I ran <span>Media Creation Tool it lost all my apps and messed with my data . Why do you feel it does not do this now. Why do I need to go this extreme route when MS has modded its own update since
 4th October 2018 and not brought it inline with Windows Professional? </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The only reason I can see for this different behavior on install is that the update has been correct or changed from the one issued 4th October 2018 which now brings this new addressed problem with the update downloading properly and no button
 made available to install it as an update. <br />
<br />
It is quite silly to recommend a route as you suggest on a fully working operating system. The only item not working is the badly written update which appears to not be able to recognise what is installed without failing the update. I suggest that the removal
 of this button on my system is an indicator that MS is aware of this problem and has removed ability to install a broken update until it has time to fix it. I was told in October to pause the updates. Nothing has been fixed.</span></p>

            I rebooted in safemode by pressing shift reboot going to advanced menu and getting into safemode . Much easier . I deleted the contents of C:/Windows/SoftwareDistribution and rebooted. This then started downloading the Feature 1803 update again for Windows
 10. Now I had nothing in this directory so the only reason of a failure would be the incompatible 1803 update with Windows 10 Professional. Now amazingly this machine is now updating and has currently got to 1809

<p>
</p><p>The only way to send a file by email is to start the email from my default Mail app Thunderbird and then attach the file.</p>

            Hi Steven
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />If you are using Microsoft Outlook 2016 or 2019
<br />
<br />Ensure Outlook is set as the default Mail client
<br />
<br />Close Outlook
<br />
<br />For 32 bit versions of Outlook...
<br />Delete Msmapi32.dll located C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\system\MSMAPI\1033\
<br />
<br />For 64 bit versions of Outlook...  (I think this is the right path??)
<br />Delete Msmapi32.dll located C:\Program Files\Common Files\system\MSMAPI\1033\
<br />
<br />Run fixmapi.exe
<br />
<br />Open Outlook (Outlook will replace &amp; register the Msmapi32.dll and then open).
<br />
<br />Try the "Send To &gt; Mail Recipient" again.
<br />

 BTW, I was online with Microsoft for over an hour.&nbsp; They were very nice.&nbsp; They took control of my desktop and made many changes, none of which helped, but someone can figure this out!</p>

<h2>            Downloading Updates. </h2>
                    
<p>For two of my games, Modern Warfare 2 and Fable 3, everyday I have to download the same updates over and over again. Example is that lets say on July 1st I play Modern Warfare 2, I would have to download the update and then I wouldn't have to download it
 again until July 2nd. This is only with these two games and the rest of my games seem to be fine although I don't know if those games just haven't had an update recently.</p>
<p>This isn't a major issue, but it does bug me having to download them again and again.
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Grindernerd</p>

            Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />

<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Status
<br />Scroll to the bottom
<br />Click Network and Sharing Center
<br />
<br />Click Change advanced sharing settings
<br />Expand All Networks
<br />Under Password protected sharing
<br />
<br />Switch between 'Turn on password protected sharing and Turn off password protected sharing' 
<br />
<br />Then choose 'Turn off password protected sharing' 
<br />
<br />Then click 'Save changes'
<br />
<br />Also:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: optionalfeatures.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support
<br />Tick the SMB 1.0/CIFS Client
<br />Untick SMB 1.0/CIFS Automatic Removal and
<br />Untick SMB 1.0/CIFS Server
<br />
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />Restart if prompted. 
<br />
<br />Microsoft apparently has a workaround which does not require enabling SMBv1, for those who rely on the ability to 'browse' the network.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4034314/smbv1-is-not-installed-by-default-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/403431...</a>
<br />
<br />Explorer Network Browsing
<br />
<br />The Computer Browser service relies on the SMBv1 protocol to populate the Windows Explorer Network node (also known as "Network Neighborhood"). This legacy protocol is long deprecated, doesn't route, and has limited security. Because the service cannot function without SMBv1, it is removed at the same time.
<br />
<br />However, if you still have to use the Explorer Network in home and small business workgroup environments to locate Windows-based computers, you can follow these steps on your Windows-based computers that no longer use SMBv1:
<br />Start the "Function Discovery Provider Host" and "Function Discovery Resource Publication" services, and then set them to Automatic (Delayed Start). When you open Explorer Network, enable network discovery when you are prompted.
<br />
<br />All Windows devices within that subnet that have these settings will now appear in Network for browsing. This uses the WS-DISCOVERY protocol. Contact your other vendors and manufacturers if their devices still don't appear in this browse list after the Windows devices appear. It is possible they have this protocol disabled or that they support only SMBv1.
<br />
<br />Also make sure the following is enabled:
