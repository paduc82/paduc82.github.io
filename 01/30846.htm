<h2>            Elite Controller - my experience including problems, a short review and suggestions for improvement. </h2>
                    
<p>I'm writing this for anyone considering buying the Elite controller and for those that own it to compare notes about it's functionality. This is MY EXPERIENCE and, as such, should be taken with a grain of salt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been an XBox gamer since the original white 360. I've owned nearly every model since then. I'm generally a FPS guy, but played Elder Scrolls a lot, especially Skyrim (though I bought Tamriel, I quickly lost interest and it's been shelved).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought the 1TB Elite Console Bundle in December 2015, upgrading from the 500GB 'standard' bundle purchased in February 2015. I play a lot of Battlefield 4 and thought the Elite controller would help with some of the frustrations I had with the original
 controller. I was especially looking forward to having the ability to change the curves of the controller sticks - one problem I always have is 'overcompensating' when trying to aim. I thought curve adjustment would allow me to have a slower, smoother movement
 in the middle ramping up to faster as you get toward the edge of the stick range. That, sadly (and still isn't) the case, even after the somewhat recent update. There are lots of complaints about the Elite controller stick sensitivity/curve issues, like this
 one (of many):</p>
<p><a href="https://xbox.uservoice.com/forums/251650-console-hardware-accessories/suggestions/10957662-update-accessories-app-to-fix-elite-controller-sti" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://xbox.uservoice.com/forums/251650-console-hardware-accessories/suggestions/10957662-update-accessories-app-to-fix-elite-controller-sti</a></p>
<p>One thing I HATE about the new controllers vs. the old 360 controllers is how the battery works (or doesn't in this case). The 360 had a genius battery - no outer cover to remove and it only went in one way. In a dark room, you could quickly and easily change
 the battery. NOT so with the new XBone controllers - I have to turn on the lights, remove the battery cover, figure out which way the battery goes, replace the cover and hope they went in the right way (esp. frustrating if you're using AA batteries).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply put, that battery system blows chunks compared to the 360. Add to that the notification about low battery status either never shows up or shows up really late (as in I often have the controller turn off in the middle of a game due to low battery,
 when I only got the notification 5 minutes ago).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The controller itself feels solid and the 'addition' of the headphone jack is nice (WHY did it ever get left out of the original controller, other than a ploy to sell another $25 accessory, is beyond me).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easily removeable/replaceable sticks, paddles and D-Pad are swell, but nothing truly special. The options are what one would expect for a $150 controller. I like the carry bag, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem that I'm having with mine is the left stick 'bounces' - a clear example is using it to select letters when entering a login or password. I quickly push the stick all the way to the left and release to move over one letter but, as soon as I let
 go, it 'bounces' back to the previous letter. If I hold it and release when I get to the letter I want to select, it bounces back to a letter to the right of the one I landed on. I've tried correcting this in the app for controller customization, but it never
 truly fixes the issue - in the cases where I can get it to no longer bounce, it then has a dead zone that's too large, or causes other anomalies during gameplay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with the 'original' Xbox One controller, I sometimes still get random disconnects. I *never* had the disconnect problem with my Xbox 360 S and the units are in the same location in my media cabinet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, not terribly impressed with it and, if I could go back to using a 360 controller with it's far superior batteries, I would.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now my opinion is the the battery placement truly sucked on the 360. It never bothered me when I had it, though found that large hump in the center annoying as hell after playing with the One controller. To each their own.</p>

<p>You don't know what I'm talking about because you don't know about 360 controllers. Here's an image of the old controller and it's battery:</p>
<p><a href="http://compass.xboxlive.com/assets/ca/9e/ca9e79ad-5881-473f-b03f-1594ae2aa067.png?n=360-controller-batteries-l.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">compass.xboxlive.com/.../ca9e79ad-5881-473f-b03f-1594ae2aa067.png</a></p>
<p>The battery released with the button and the button helped orient the battery. You could change the battery in complete darkness in seconds. Not the case with the newer Xbox One controllers.

<p>Elite controller is a god send for me after the DS4. That thing destroyed my hands so I thought I'd bring the cronusmax out. I now use the Elite on both xb and ps consoles from this gen and last.</p>
<p>OP, if you're set on wanting to use the 360 controller on the XB1, get yourself a 3rd party non ms adapter, the option is there though unofficial.</p>

<h2>            Is having an unactivated version of Windows 10 illegal&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a custom built PC and was wondering if having an unauthorized version of Windows 10 is illegal? My brother said it was awhile back but I remember looking it up and I believe it said it wasn't. However, I would just like some confirmation. Is it, or
 not? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Yes, Windows 10 EULA clearly states you must posses a Windows 10 genuine license in order to use Windows.

            If windows is not activated and you are still using it, no. It is not technically illegal to just have un-activated windows on your PC.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />As per Microsoft, you must activate your version of Windows to unlock all the features. You may run non-activated version but it have limited capabilities. For example, you can't even change desktop wallpaper on non activated machine. There are frequent notifications asking you to activate. 
<br />
<br />So activate your system today and enjoy it fully.
<br />
<br />Regards.

            Hi, LateefKhabbaz
<br />
<br />My name is Phillip and I am an Independent Advisor. I hope it helps.
<br />
<br />Perform the procedure to repair the system files:
<br />Follow these instructions: press the Windows + X keys and select Command Prompt (Administrator) or Windows PowerShell (Administrator), in the window that will open, you must type the commands in their respective order:
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />• DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•  sfc /scannow 
<br />
<br />Each of these actions can take a few minutes, so it is important to execute one at a time. When finished, you must restart the PC.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
While there's no confirming information currently, it's highly likely that there will be an SP3 as Vista still has a fair number of years of support remaining.

    <title>Date format change in 1703 update&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gaborpot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Date format change in 1703 update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 10 Home updated from version 1607 to 1703.</p>
<p>I'm using a third party program built in Delphi in 2008 for accessing a network database. Since the update the field for entering dates in the program is only showing two slashes instead of the date.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has there been a change in how Windows handles the dates in the 1703 update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The date field works, I can type in the date, but no numbers are shown. There is a date picker asociated with the field and it also works. I've tried changing the date format in the Windows settings, picking other locations and country formats but the numbers
 aren't displayed. </p>
<p>Changing the d/m/y order affects the input filed and the slashes in the field are changed with the Windows date format ie if I put dashes the field will display dashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a recovery and reverted back to build 1607 and now the program is working again but this is just a temporary solution since I can't avoid updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The developer of the program is not available.</p>

</p><p>It's highly likely that the programming language is experiencing incompatibility issues with the Creators Update. In situations like this, we usually suggest to refer the developer of the program. However, since that's not possible, you may also share your

    <title>Persistent Filter keys problem in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zhekus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Persistent Filter keys problem in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, when playing video games, my keys started to "stick". It is accompanied by notification sound and only when pressing Shift key. For example when pressing Shift and W (running forward in game) for more than 8 seconds, when I let go of W (and Shift)
 my game character continues moving forward till I press W again. I never had this problem before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to replicate it when holding other Shift and other letter for over 8 seconds as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Ease of Access keyboard settings Sticky keys and Filter keys are disabled. Yet I still having this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It drives me mad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

            <p>Yes. &nbsp;this is a very annoying issue. &nbsp;Happens to me too. &nbsp;two questions, do you have more than one computer with windows 10 over a network. &nbsp;I have found if one of any of your computers/laptops has sticky keys enable it will propagate back to the original
 computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly there is a second menu under the sticky keys control panel spot. &nbsp;and in there is the 8 second thing. &nbsp;it is easy to miss after you disable the sticky keys the first time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my suggestion is to turn it off on ALL your computers. &nbsp;And if you re-install windows 10 on another computer at a later day....well the sticky keys will come back since it isn't disabled on that new computer....I had the last thing happen to me recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But yes...very very annoying in games as you have to hard reset to get out.</p>

<h2>            Error Code 38&#58; Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware because a previous instance of the device driver is still in memory. &#40;Code 38&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Error Code 38: Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware because a previous instance of the device driver is still in memory. (Code 38)<br />
<br />
The driver could not be loaded because a previous version of the driver is still in memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using the File History Feature in Windows 8.1 Professional.&nbsp; Evidently, there was a delay in doing the file history storing to my external USB-connected Hard Drive. I plugged in another USB-connected hard drive to a separate USB port&nbsp; &amp; got the same
 error. I removed the USB Mass Storage driver &amp; re-installed it. I got the same error. I tried the Microsoft Fix it Utility: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/mats/hardware_device_problems</p>
<p>I still have the same problem with both devices</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I remove the file history (USB Mass Storage) from my computer's memory to resolve this issue, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did this before to no avail. I still got the error (Thank you).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally fixed this by doing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned off the File History in Control Panel File History.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted the USB Mass Storage Controller with Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: left">I shut down the computer &amp; reconnected my USB attached Mass Storage drives (Buffalo Mass Storage drive &amp; Toshiba Mass Storage Drive to my USB slots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started my computer back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I re-installed the Buffalo drive software, &amp; the USB Mass Storage Drives were recognized, again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not think I will be using the File History again. It takes up 10GB per execution &amp; does not tell you when you are approaching the external Mass Storage drive's capacity. The Mass Storage Buffalo drive was only 50% full when I got the error message.
 The Toshiba Mass Storage Drive was 75% full. FYI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Respectfully yours,</p>

<p>Salut !</p>
<p>Ce problème peut également arriver pour une autre raison, tout d'abord, quand tu joues, es-tu constamment connecté au Xbox Live ? Le problème que je vais évoquer m'est déjà arrivé, il se peut que quand une partie s'enregistre à telle date et telle heure,
 par exemple la date et l'heure par défaut de la Xbox 360 quand elle n'est pas connectée au Xbox Live (le 21 novembre 2005 il me semble pour la date et 13h pour l'heure par défaut) et que tu veuilles la charger à une autre date et une autre heure (comme aujourd'***
 le 27 février à 18h04) la console peut ne pas trouver la sauvegarde et dire qu'elle est corrompue parce que ce n'est pas en rapport, logique me direz-vous, mais il est vrai que ce problème peut arriver, dont à moi. La solution, déconnecter sa console du Xbox
 Live, essayer de charger la partie et ensuite l'enregistrer plus tard une fois la 360 connectée au Live.</p>
<p>Après je ne sais pas si ça vient de là mais tu peux toujours essayer.</p>
<p>Désolé du pavé au fait xD !</p>
<p>Tiens-nous au courant</p>

            Salut, moi aussi j'ai des sauvegardes corrompues suite à la mise à jour de 74go. J'avais commencé le jeun avant cette maj et je l'ai fini avant près cette maj et les succès de fin de campagne sont bloqués . Une partie du jeu dit que j'ai fait tous les
 chapitres et la partie succès dit que je n'ai fait que 6/8 des missions de campagne. J'espère qu'il y avantpresutreura une maj correctrice à moins que l'on puisse supprimer des sauvegardes...

    <title>Windows Hello recognizes face, but does not unlock pc - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Hello recognizes face, but does not unlock pc</h2>
                    <p>Since the new windows update, I'm having problems with windows hello. It does recognize my face, and shows the "hello myname" message. The problem is, it does not unlock my pc, as I still have to give my pin/password in order to get past the login screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            1. Reset Facial Recognition and/or Fingerprint Options
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + I to open Settings.
<br />Click Accounts and select Sign-In options.
<br />Locate Fingerprint or Facial Recognition options and click Remove under them.
<br />After that, click Get Started and follow the on-screen instructions to reset Fingerprint and Facial Recognition.
<br />Reboot your PC if needed.
<br />
<br />2. Modify Group Policy Settings
<br />
<br />Creators Update might have modified some of the crucial settings of Group Policy. Therefore, we would recommend to launch the Group Policy Editor and check/edit the settings related to Windows Hello functionality.
<br />
<br />Pres Windows key, type gpedit, and press Enter.
<br />Click on Computer Configuration and open Administrative Templates.
<br />Select Windows Components and open Biometrics.
<br />Click on Facial Features and right-click on Configure enhanced anti-spoofing option.
<br />Select Edit and disable the Configure enhanced anti-spoofing feature.
<br />Reboot your PC.
<br />
<br />3. Update drivers
<br />
<br />If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform. To fix that, try to update the corresponding drivers:
<br />
<br />Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager.
<br />Locate the Hello, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually and right-click on each of them.
<br />Select Remove driver software and wait for the removal to be finished.
<br />Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC.
<br />Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, uninstall the KB4048955 update.
<br />
<br /> Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />(This is the update you want to uninstall KB4048955)KB4048954
<br />KB4049011
<br />
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart then see if stability is restored. 
<br />
<br />The update might try to install again. So, try blocking it.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:

    <title>Cannot buy xbox live&#47;add credit card - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot buy xbox live&#47;add credit card</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, im not sure if this is the correct forum for this topic. But here it goes: Recently the person that i was getting XBL from via Credit Card, had to cancel the Credit Card. I logged on Xbox Live and said my account was suspended. I went to Change Payment
 Method, then remove credit card. It would not let me remove it. I tried to add a credit card, but it said there was an error with the marketplace, Status code: 8C320008. I turned to the actual Xbox website, i click remove, a green circle circles, then nothing.
 I tried adding credit card, but it took me to a page saying "Uh Oh.....That shouldn't have happened" every time. Ive tried clearing cache, different browser, etc......Thanks.</p>

<p>Try giving a call to their support team, use this link to find the specific problem you're having and request a call. I had a problem with my credit card a while ago and they solved my issue in less than 5 minutes. Hopefully you'll have your problems solved
 just as fast :)</p>

            Normaly I would say Hard Disk Drive is corrupt or faulty, try to reinstall Windows but I am a little concerned by your comment C drive formated, if you have formated the drive it may just be a storage drive and not bootable. C drive is where Windows and
 programs are installed if you format it you wipe your data.

                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've&nbsp;just re-&nbsp;installed W8 &amp; W8.1. on my HP probook 4520s computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; however none of the HP or Intel programs are showing in programs and features. three are listed ie HP support assistant, Skype, and synaptics pointing device. I reckon 30 or more are not
 listed. Three months ago HP installed a 64 bit O/S .... could that have something to do with it ??? the computer seems to work fine.</p>

            <p>Hi Neil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions: </p>
<ol>
<li>Which HP and Intel programs are you referring to?</li><li>Are you referring to Hardware drivers?</li></ol>
<p>If three months ago HP has installed 64 bit OS and if you have just reinstalled Windows 8.1 then by default you will lose all the programs previously installed. You can visit HP support and install the software and drivers required for your
<strong>HP ProBook 4520s Notebook.</strong></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two computers, a HP probook 4520s (which is this one) and a HP 2000. about 2 weeks ago I noticed in my programs and features, a program [ EPSON A8E359(XP-410series) had been installed. sometime in April ... it was listed on both computers, in the
 programs and features. </p>
<p>I had to call HP to remove this program. (on the HP 2000 which in under warranty)&nbsp;meanwhile I had re-installed the operating system on the probook.&nbsp;before&nbsp;I did this, there where 39 programs listed, however since the re-install I only saw three programs.
</p>
<p>I noticed my printer was not working, so I re-installed the printer software and the printer works fine and&nbsp;my HP support assistant is ok howvever&nbsp; .... I think 5 intel programs. 10 Microsoft, 3 realtek, and one qualcom are not listed as before.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP installed a 64 bit O/S&nbsp; some time ago,( on the probook)&nbsp;and everything seemed ok .... until the EPSON episode ... I don't know that much, so you can imagine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>even operating with the 64bit W8.1 everything was fine and every program was listed in the programs and features. at least I've been able to rid myself of EPSON (I've never had an Epson product) but what happened to the program previously listed in the programs
 and features. ??? did they get lost in the re-install .... the probook</p>
<p>was originally designed to work on W7, I installed W8//8.1, and when I reinstalled the O/S I had to go through all of that ie W7&gt;W8&gt;8.1 (takes a while .... took me 20 hrs.... @ the moment every is working fine. I'm just missing some programs from&nbsp;the list
 in the programs and features When you mention&nbsp;drivers I don't know what you mean are they listed in the p&amp;f...?????. should I do another re-install ??? 20hrs ???&nbsp;&nbsp; please know I thank you for your help ... if not even easy to describe my situation&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neil&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Neil,</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which Operating System was installed when you bought HP probook 4520s?</li></ul>
<p>When you re-install Windows OS all the programs which you have installed prior to installing Windows will be deleted. You need to reinstall the programs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are looking for software and drivers for Windows and HP does not have them, use
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/leavinghp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.update.microsoft.com&amp;desc=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.update.microsoft.com&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Windows Update</a> (in English) and visit component manufacturer's Web sites, such as AMD, intel, realtek, and others. When using Windows Update, be sure to check for optional updates.

            <p>Hello John Rubdy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I purchased this Computer [ HP Probook 4520s] it had a W7 32bit O/S.&nbsp; I put a W8/8.1 on&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a problem with the key board and HP took it back&nbsp; and installed a new one and a 64bit W7&nbsp;O/S. that was about 4 months ago. I re-installed
 W8/8.1 64 bit, and everything was fine, until I got infested with Epson A8E359(XP-410series). this thing removed my printer software and installed Epson stuff, also lots of pop ups trying to get me to buy their junk ... Epson appeared on both my computers.
 My other computer an HP 2000 is under warranty and HP took Epson off however I hadn't noticed the printer problem at that time ... with my probook I decided to go back to square one ie reinstall W7 64bit O/S[ I have a Hp disc] and then re-install W8/8.1 however
 Epson was still on ...I managed to get&nbsp; the print software off, and take it out of programs and featues, &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>as far I can see everything is fine except my programs and features dose not list all the programs which are&nbsp; on this computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I say Epson and the like for example Search Protect which I've had to uninstall 6 times take the fun out of computing ... I now look in programs and features most times I turn on my computer, because that Epson thing was installed on my computer in April
 I just did not notice it, I hadn't used the printer so I would not have known. I just happened to see when I was un-installing Search Protect ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope I've not made you dizzy ... </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update. No, your response have not made me dizzy. Any programs you install will be saved in Program files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to <strong>C:\Program Files (x86)</strong> and <strong>C:\Program Files </strong>
and check if you can see the programs which you have mentioned are listed. If the files are not listed then try reinstalling the programs and check if you can view in
<strong>Program file folder</strong> and <strong>programs and features</strong> from
<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> You can try running this Microsoft Fixit tool and check it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open this Fixit link using Internet Explorer: <strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Program_Install_and_Uninstall?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Program_Install_and_Uninstall?wa=wsignin1.0</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> You can also check in new user account whether you can view the programs installed on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Create a user account</strong></p>

                    <p>On occasion, I'm experiencing a slight static shock from my Surface Book case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The shock isn't strong enough to make a noise or alarm me. It is noticeable and has happened a few times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It still appears to be working just fine.</p>

<h2>            Ad account Lockout source is  TMG</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have a user whose account is locking in every 10secs. The source shows the TMG server in our DMZ. I did some google-ing and found the logs on TMG . On TMG I see one Samsung mobile device is trying to authenticate and failing. This device according to
 client one of the user who has left the organization but somehow had mail configured and it’s causing such issue. I have removed the device from the user mailbox(in Exchange 2007).</p>
<p>Can we block this device a TMG level so that we can avoid lockouts.</p>

            Hi bonefish77.
<br />
<br />The issue could relate to the permissions.
<br />
<br />
<br />Give Permission to the folder/drive that you are facing the issue with. 
<br />
<br />In Windows Explorer, right-click the file or folder you want to work with. 
<br />From the pop-up menu, select Properties, and then in the Properties dialog box click the Security tab. 
<br />
<br />In the Name list box, select the user, contact, computer, or group whose permissions you want to view. If the permissions are dimmed, it means the permissions are inherited from a parent object. 
<br />
<br />Turn off UAC (User Account Control) 
<br />
<br />Before you can do anything, you must turn off the UAC, or you will be locked out of the following steps. 
<br />
<br />1) Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; User Accounts 
<br />2) Click "Change User Account Control Settings" 
<br />3) Move slider all the way down to "Never Notify" 
<br />4) Reboot 
<br />
<br />2) Take Ownership 
<br />
<br />Yes take ownership. Even though you are logged on as an Administrator, you can't change files that don't belong to you. The Program Files folder is set to the Trusted Installer group and the Administrator doesn't have the rights to change anything. So now we have to claim all the files and folders. 
<br />
<br />1) Open Windows Explorer 
<br />2) R-Click on Program Files -&gt; Properties -&gt; Security Tab 
<br />3) Click Advanced -&gt; Owner 
<br />4) Click Edit 
<br />5) Select Administrators -&gt; Put a checkmark in Replace owner on subcontainers &amp; objects -&gt; Apply 
<br />6) Wait a while..... 
<br />7) When it finishes, Click OK on all boxes to close everything 
<br />
<br />3) Fix Permissions 
<br />
<br />Now that you own the files, you have to give yourself permission to modify them 
<br />
<br />1) R-Click on Program Files -&gt; Properties -&gt; Security Tab 
<br />2) Click Advanced -&gt; Change Permission 
<br />3) Select Administrators (any entry) -&gt; Edit 
<br />4) Change the Apply To drop down box to This Folder, Subfolder &amp; Files 
<br />5) Put check in Full Control under Allow column -&gt; OK -&gt; Apply 
<br />6) Wait some more..... 
<br />7) When it finishes, the dialog boxes may hide behind the Explorer window. Minimize it and click OK on all the the dialog boxes 
<br />
<br />8) Reboot PC.
<br />
<br />Let me know how it goes

            Fixed the problem lads. There was a file hidden deep inside one of the folders that couldn't be found/deleted/moved by Windows. I deleted the file with a third party tool and the files can now be moved.
