    <title>Windows Vista mail program does not export all contact files - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Vista mail program does not export all contact files  </h2>
                    
<p>After I export my windows mail contacts in vcf format to a new folder on my desktop I have noticed that NOT all of the contracts are present in the new folder.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I show the windows mail contacts along side the contents of the folder to which I exported
 the contacts I see some(to be precise, 256) are missing in the new folder. I have exported 3 times, each time to a new folder and get the same results. I can see that some of the missing files are group folders(apparently Windows Mail does not export group
 folders in vcf format) but other files are just not in the contents of the desktop folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I get all the files AND group folders to export correctly?</p>

<div>I was going to say that if you were interested in migrating those contacts to another Vista computer, you could simply copy the folder C:\Users\username\Contacts to your thumb drive, and from there copy it to the other computer. That will preserve all
 the attributes, including Groups.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For any other use, you are pretty much stuck with using VCF or CSV format to do the export/import. Sorry, I have no idea why so many of your contacts are missing when you did that.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There is one other (roundabout) method. Install the free Windows Live Mail program, which will automatically import all the contacts from Windows Mail. Be sure to select the Live ID option when prompted by the Windows Live Mail installer. From then on,
 you can keep all your contacts in perfect sync with any other computer running Windows Live Mail, and you also have access to those contacts on any computer connected to the Internet by simply going to<a href="http://contacts.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://contacts.live.com</a>
 and logging in with that same Live ID.</div>

<p><strong>You said the following:&nbsp; "</strong> Windows Mail has no mechanism for exporting Groups. If you would tell us what you intend to do with the exported contacts, we may be able to suggest a workaround."</p>
<p><strong>My response:</strong></p>
<p><strong>I want to export ALL my contacts to a USB thumb drive that I can take with me and be able to view them on any other PC. I have already determined that if I save them as the original file extension&nbsp; ie&nbsp; .contact</strong> ,<strong>I'm NOT able to view
 them on a computer running the Win XP OS because that uses the email program Outlook Express and the file extension is .wab. I have not yet tried to view the vcf contacts on Win7 but from what I understand I should be able to view the vcf contacts on that
 also.&nbsp; My problem is that I am missing 256 contacts after I export them</strong> .<strong>I DO understand that windows Mail does NOT export groups but there are only 9 groups in my contact list. WHY dont the other contacts get exported? Am I doing something
 wrong and if so, what? </strong></p>
<p><strong>I DO appreciate any and all help you can give.&nbsp; Thank you and have a good day.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
DisplayLink graphics technology is designed to connect computers and displays using USB Ethernet and WiFi. It also allows multiple displays to be connected to a single computer. I would suggest you to disconnect all the external devices except mouse and keyboard
 and check if you get the error message.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps! Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to boot the computer into safe mode with networking and check if the issue persists. Safe mode Starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default
 settings and basic device drivers and services as possible causes.<br />

The problem persists in SAFE MODE.&nbsp; As mentioned in my first post, this only started happening after the upgrade to Windows 8.1.&nbsp; This has to do with something new introduced by Windows 8.1

<h2>            Using an image to build identical computers using Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello:&nbsp; I have 15 identical computers to set up.&nbsp; They already have a fully licesnsed copy of Windows 10 installed.&nbsp; I thought I would set up the first one, make a system recovery image using the Windows utility and install the image on the other computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this I think I would need to reactivate them.&nbsp; I have been provided with an activation key by the integrator that sold me the computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;They say&nbsp;i can use this activation key to reactivate all fifteen computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to make sure this is legit.&nbsp; I am concerned I might&nbsp;lose the original license on the target computer when I copy the image.&nbsp; Can I use the same activation key to re-activate multiple computers after imaging?</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Using a recovery image, created on a different PC will require you to activate Windows on machines, the image is used on and the product key has
 to be a <strong>Volume license key</strong> in this case. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Volume license keys are issued by organizations for use on machines associated with the organization.
</span><span>Volume License Keys (VLKs) are issued under a specific license agreement and enable your organization to use the software that you have licensed. VLKs can be
 used only with Volume Licensing products, they cannot be used with retail software or software that is preinstalled on a new computer (original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, products).</span></p>
<p><span>Article reference:
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/volume-activation/volume-activation-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary update turned my pc into a paperweight....</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Ok since the update, I turn my computer on, I'm greeted with an Automatic Repair screen stating that windows could not start correctly. It says it needs to restore
 to an earlier point in time to when it worked correctly, and the only 2 buttons are "Restore" and "Cancel". When I click "Restore", windows will take over 20 minutes to start up, when it boots up, Windows is very slow. I'm only able to use my computer for
 about 15 minutes until my computer goes back to the Automatic repair screen. I've been facing this problem for several days now.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I tried everything listed everywhere you can imagine, from disconnecting/reconnecting my hard drives, to starting it up in safe mode with no change. The only thing
 that worked was doing a full factory reset which reverted my pc back to Windows 8.1. Ran it for a whole day with no issues. Tried a fresh install of windows 10, and with in 15 minutes, im back to the same problem of the auto repair restarts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Someone give me a clue. I really need help with this. issue.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delayed reply, I've been away on holiday. Ok I'll have to reinstall windows 10, as I left windows 8 on while I was away so my sister could use it while she dog sat for me(nearly 2 weeks and not one reset), and &nbsp;I'll do the best to get the information
 needed, but as I said before I'm lucky if it runs for 15 minutes before restarting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            &#62;&#62; Proper way to stop Disk Defragmenter&#63;</h2>
                    I run Disk Defragmenter on Windows 7 and it do 1 Pass, 2 Pass, 3 Pass, and continue forever. When can I safely stop the Disk Defragmenter? Can I stop after 3 Pass? After 3 Pass, my Hard Drive is still 6% fragmented so do I run the Defragmenter again?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I realize the inconvenience you are experiencing while installing Windows 10<span>. I will certainly help you.</span></p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>If your PC won't start, download installation media and use it to reset your PC. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>On a working PC, go to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=616447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1); text-decoration-line: underline">Microsoft software download website</span></strong></a>.</li><li>Download the media creation tool and then run it.</li><li>Select <strong>Create installation media for another PC</strong>.</li><li>Choose a language, edition, and architecture (64-bit or 32-bit).</li><li>Follow the steps to create installation media, and then select <strong>Finish</strong>.</li><li>Connect the installation media you created to your nonfunctional PC, and then turn it on.</li><li>On the initial setup screen, enter your language and other preferences, and then select
<strong>Next</strong>. If you're not seeing the setup screen, your PC might not be set up to boot from a drive. Check your PC manufacturer's website for info on how to change your PC's boot order, and then try again.</li><li>Select <strong>Repair your computer</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen, select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>. From there, you can:
<ul>
<li>Restore from a system restore point by selecting <strong>Advanced options</strong> &gt;
<strong>System Restore</strong>. This will remove recently installed apps, drivers, and updates that might be causing your PC problems. Restoring from a restore point won’t affect your personal files.</li><li>Select <strong>Reset this PC</strong> to reinstall Windows&nbsp;10. This will remove apps and drivers you installed and changes you made to settings, but lets you choose to keep or remove your personal files.</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>Please post back with the status of Windows 10 installation. We'll be glad to help you.</p>

<h2>            Sades headset suddenly not recognised by Xbox One X - no sound or mic</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, a couple of weeks ago my Sades headset stopped working with my Xbox One X. Separately all things seem to work (controller and headset). It appears my headset is no longer recognised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've tried:</p>
<p>Checked the headset works with other equipment - it does.</p>
<p>Tried headset in another controller - it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>Checked both the console and controller software is up to date - They are.</p>
<p>Been in device settings - I'm no longer able to access volume control for the controller (it's there, but I'cant select it).</p>
<p>Reset the system - Disconnected and reconnected the controller.</p>
<p>I've checked the 3.5mm jack fitting on the headset and the controller jack port - both look in perfect condition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the top screen corner the mic symbol is crossed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read lots of threads suggesting a recent update has somehow stopped headsets working...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Grateful for any support - thank you!</p>

<p>Thank you Zatomas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had already checked the trouble shooting pages - but these fail to address this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now stuck in a microsoft loop. I followed link to support you suggested, but it keeps directing me to the virtual agent only. The virtual agent says click here to speak to someone, but that link just takes you to the Microsoft support front page!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks XBF Crystal P.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As outlined in my original post - I've already tried all the things you recommended. I know the headset works (tested with my laptop) and that the controller and spare controller are fine too. Both have been working fine and then suddenly the controller
 and xbox won't recognise the headset? &nbsp;This seems to be a wider issue according to other threads with other gamers too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is an Xbox issue...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft Controller fails to recognise headset (microphone icon crossed out on top right of screen).<br />
</p>
<p><strong>After 2 months Problem solved</strong> - <strong>it is the official black wireless Xbox controllers
</strong>linked with our console.<br />
</p>
<p>Spent over 5 hours trouble shooting with Microsoft advisors.</p>
<p>Went through everything - reset - factory reset, updates, network settings etc.</p>
<p>Then suggested we tried the controllers with a friends Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried our controllers (our original and spare) and both had the same issue (wouldn't recognise the headset) on his system.</p>
<p>We brought one of his controllers to link to our console. It worked (with our headset).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft are now taking our faulty controllers off for repair (thankfully - still under warranty).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wish we'd tried this from the outset - still don't know why both have failed...</p>

            <p>I have same issue, I thought it is fast build issue kind of started after new designed store update so I revert back to windows phone 8.1 and than updated to official windows 10 version and reset phone , the issue still persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like it's issue with updating/downloading apps on wifi connection only, and not problem with my wifi as I tried multiple different wifi connections.</p>
<p>Download start and stuck at some specific point or if download than it takes more time than normally should.</p>
<p>Download works perfect on cellular network without any issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And another thing is looks like issue happens only with large size apps like &gt;10mb (not exact).</p>

<h2>            Steam games freezing&#33;</h2>
                    Hi, a while ago I was forced to install direct-x 11 with Windows 7 (32-bit), but shortly after all of my Steam games began to visually freeze and the audio would begin to loop, thus forcing me to shutdown the game via the Task manager. I have an Nvidia
 GeForce 6150se integrated graphics card, with 3.5gb ram installed. I am wondering if anybody has/can solve this issue?<br />
<br />
-Thanks<br />

<p>Hey Sam,<br />
<br />
Direct X 11 comes inbuilt with Windows 7. As such, you shouldn't be prompted to install it.</p>
<p>Coming to the issue, here’s a support link from Steam that talks about the issue described in your post.</p>

<h2>            Direct access - export to another pc</h2>
                    <p>Every now and then we have pc´s where direct access have not been enrolled on a pc during installation process.
</p>
<p>So I am trying to find a way to import direct access to a pc, that is located off company network to fix direct access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I of course have google on this and found that alot of registry keys are stored in the DNSpolicyconfig. But the firewall rules I am unable to find and how they can be exported from a working machine to non working pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do any have some knowledge on this?</p>

<p>Hi ChrisF5601,</p>
<p>You can add Windows Media Center to the AutoPlay listings (so you can set it as default later) using a Registry Edit here.</p>

<h2>            Cannot connect to network printer HP Laserjet 4250n</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I am at the right place to get help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 5 desktops running Windows 7 32 bit &amp; are connected via DSL router. One of these desktops is connected with HP Laserjet 4250n printer. 4 out of five (including the one with printer) are printing smoothly but one desktop is not able to connect to the
 shared printer. While attempting to Update the drivers, message appears saying <em>
<strong>"Windows cannot connect to the printer. Unable to find a core driver package that is required by the printer driver package."</strong></em></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3f6eab98-ce9e-4db4-8c54-959f204647b6" /><br />
</p>
<p>Internet access is smooth &amp; all 3 other desktops connected to the network printer without any problem. All desktops were updated with Windows 7 32 bit the same day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reference screenshot is attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly guide. I will be grateful.</p>
<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TURN off display&nbsp; 10&nbsp;min<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SLEEP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30 min<br />
When the computer is playing music (using either Windows Media Player or iTunes or any other musicplayer), and the display goes to sleep (after 10 minutes), the sound is also turned OFF,&nbsp;although the music player app is still playing.<br />
How can I prevent the sound driver (Realtek High Definition Audio) in this case from 'going to sleep' without changing the 'TURN OFF THE DISPLAY" to NEVER?<br />
BTW, this happens whether audio is coming from the built-in speakers or from the Audio Line-Out.<br />
My only solution so far is to disable Power Settings and leave the display from being turned off.<br />
I tried Sony's tech support but they had no clue other than disabling Power Management (turning all to NEVER).</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>In an effort to save battery, as much as possible Many Laptops has propriety Power Saving system that over rides the OS.</p>
<p>Sony's support will be a good place to go. <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.workingbrain.net%2fcool.gif" /></p>

 found no errors.&nbsp; This happened after I was forced to do a full system restore from 5/15/2014.&nbsp; My date and time is up to date.&nbsp; Here is the CheckSUR.log results:</p>

<p>OK, so I used my Windows 7 installation disk and followed all the steps outlined for an in place upgrade.</p>
<p>After Windows performed an online compatibility check, I got a message that it is unable to do an upgrade because the version I'm running is newer than the upgrade version.&nbsp; Where do I go from here?&nbsp; This is very frustrating.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. Does this error occur when you boot into the system or when you try to open Chrome?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have tried your suggestion but the problems still exist even after a clean boot</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet Explorer and Microsoft&nbsp;Edge both work although I have noticed that Office 2013 will not run, although the other Microsoft programs (player) and apps work</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to uninstall Firefox, Chrome and &nbsp;Samsun Kies nothing happens when I try to uninstall</p>
<p>In addition to this I have tried to reinstall Firefox again nothing happens if I try to double click the download or try to run it as an admin</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

<p>
</p><p>Although YMMV, this is what worked for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Logged in to Windows using an admin account on the affected machine;</li><li>Launched Chrome using admin privileges;</li><li>Launched Task Manager to check what was running.

<p>I had recently installed the MSN add-in, which may have caused the problem.</p>

<p><span>This is for a fingerprint program to store login/passwords to use for Webpages. It was made by&nbsp;AuthenTec, Inc. or UPEK Elkon later on. I heard

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are running Windows 8.1 and not Windows 8.1 Pro, you will not be able to use Group Policy editor. It is available only in Windows 8.1 Pro, not in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I searched a bit for this error and it appears that in Windows 8.1 preview, this same error was resolved for the same driver as yours by installing an earlier version of this driver. Please read through the information in the following thread, specially
 the replies by the user named <strong>RiazAM</strong>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/security/how-to-enable-windows-biometric-framework/35f7e37d-9e6b-465d-8132-452e57deaeb8?page=1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/security/how-to-enable-windows-biometric-framework/35f7e37d-9e6b-465d-8132-452e57deaeb8?page=1</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears to me as a problem caused by the Fingerprint Reader driver. If the information in that thread does not help you, you may get in touch with the help team of the vendor for this driver and see if they could throw some more light into this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

    <title>Mouse pointer alignment - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aj139  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse pointer alignment</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 on a Toshiba Satellite E55-A5114. I recently connected it to a Sceptre monitor to extend the display. My wife uses remote access to work from home and has an issue with the mouse pointer alignment. When using programs on the Sceptre
 monitor the mouse is clicking on the intended target correctly. When she moves the mouse pointer to the laptops display and clicks on something, the pointer actually selects other things that the pointer is not hovering over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not experienced this issue with any other applications besides her work programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas for fixes are GREATLY APPRECIATED!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
