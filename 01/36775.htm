That's a lot of information there.&nbsp; Try not to overwhelm the volunteers on the Microsoft forums with too much information about your issue with your Epson printer under Windows 7.&nbsp; ;-)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Try installing the latest drivers from Epson:<br />
<a href="http://www.epson.co.uk/gb/en/viewcon/corporatesite/products/mainunits/support/2782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.epson.co.uk/gb/en/viewcon/corporatesite/products/mainunits/support/2782</a></p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
Given the last time drivers were updated for that device (September 2009) - it may well be that printer just doesn't work well under your chosen OS (Windows 7.)&nbsp; Although it may work better if you have that driver installed and the associated software downloaded
 too.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Are you actually trying to resize the photos?</p>

            The lack of resizing does not really have as much to do with your printer as with what program you were using to view and print the photos on your old computer. You need to identify the program that you used to use, then get the installation files and
 install it on&nbsp;the&nbsp;new laptop. This may have been a utility program that came with your camera or the Epson printer.

<h2>            Microsoft support is broken.</h2>
                    i have repeatedly gone through the "get help" program link in windows 10 , gone through the trouble of getting the less than useless computer program to figure out i need a real person for help, then clicked on the "chat" option as i do not want to/cant
 use a phone only for the program to crash &amp; not open a chat service. Fortunately the problem i was trying to get fixed is more of a annoyance than a critical problem BUT i know that i need proper support in order to fix it. dose anyone know of a alternative
 way to get into contact with Microsoft support?, apparently the service is no longer supplied from their website as even after going through it for a good half hour all i can find is how to get phone numbers.<br />
If no fix/way to contact them is given before the weekend ill likely call then.

            Hello Greg, thank you for your timely reply.&nbsp; First of all although often with their own problems (including poor english skills) Microsoft had personnel who would respond to requests for assistance via the methods up above, the reason i have been fairly
 set on that method is that they also have on file information on my previous problems that would make solving my current one vastly simpler (&amp; as stated previously i would prefer not to use a phone).
<br />
But since you are insistent, Other than the problem posted up above the problem i'm currently having is that windows update keeps bringing up a message that updates are unable to install. It is a very intrusive message that leaves NO option to minimize, ignore
 or close until you follow a link provided to the update center of which there's the troubleshooter excreta. The thing is though that i know why updates are unable to install, it is due to what the previous windows techs have done, they made updates unable
 to install as my computer would restart in order to install updates &amp; then state it was unable to install them, it would continuously do this at random closing whatever i was working on. undoing something is far easier if you know what has been done hence
 why talking to their techs would have been preferable, nonetheless its possible that my computer may still be unable to install the updates even with the block removed &amp; indeed i do not want updates to ever be self installing as it has cost me hours of time
 in the past, But this new development is also doing so as it often closes whatever program i happen to be in at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
thanks&nbsp;

<p>Microsoft's own 'help' is no help at all, as you have discovered. But that's what you get when you're not paying for it. Do you think it will be any better if you speak to a real person?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Highly trained, bright people who have the gift of knowing how to deal with the public and explain complicated technology in a clear, straightforward manner come at a premium price. You can get top quality support, but only if you're willing to pay for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The alternative is to do the research on your own. It takes a lot longer and requires more work on your part, but the results are always worthwhile. Do that enough times and you'll be&nbsp;<em>answering</em> questions here instead of asking them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For people like yourself who are already in a jam, this is not what you need to hear. This is not the time to read through information on the internet, as valuable as that is, or to step through complicated checklists that may or may not have anything to
 do with your issue. Instead, show your computer to a professional who will not only fix your immediate problem(s) but will generally make things right with your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Then</em> start learning how to use your computer correctly. When I did this I started from the very beginning. I'm not kidding. You're probably more advanced than I was. I resolved to learn what I didn't know - and&nbsp;<em>unlearn</em> what I thought I
 knew - which included learning how to use a computer wisely. Then you can provide your own technical support instead of taking your chances with Microsoft's script readers.</p>

            Yes, we deal with Windows Updates problems by the thousands here so know the latest fixes instinctively.  
<br />
<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />

            &nbsp;Thank you for the attempt David, but alas although it mentions other methods all i can find in your link is phone numbers &amp; as stated above id prefer to use alternative methods of contact, in fact their "message" service would have been preferred, but
 i would have settled for emails or the like &amp; indeed i was already able to find their phone numbers &amp; should i be unable to fix this before the weekend (when ill have phone time) i shall have to use one.&nbsp;

            Bulldog, sorry but your reply is worse than useless.&nbsp; do i expect a premium service for free? no, but when i buy a car new off the lot i expect it to have oil &amp; be capable of running smoothly for a good number of years with regular servicing, my computer
 has not fared well at all, at least... not when running windows (its run perfectly fine on linux although linux is to limited for the full range of what i want to do with my computer.)&nbsp;<br />
&amp; no Microsofts computerized help is useless, their human Representatives are aggravating often enough but have records &amp; some skill of which would greatly help.<br />
Thank you for your concern with my computer literacy, though not fluent i know enough to get by &amp; indeed never had this kind of problem with windows 7.&nbsp;

            Sorry Greg, but it appears you have either not fully read, or not fully comprehended what i have stated in my previous reply.&nbsp;
<br />
Updates are completely blocked from updating, I do not think that it is one of the methods in your last links as i would be able to override them easily by simply manually installing them. Attempting to install them manually or via the updater is useless until
 that block is removed.

            I read everything you wrote and gave you the steps to perform first to see if there is any deeper problems which I would then deal with.
<br />
<br />
Why did you only quote the steps I gave to manually install Updates and skip over the most important ones which are to run the walk-through repairs and reset. This is why they are Steps 1 and 2. Instead you want to quibble about steps 3 and 4 before even trying
 the first two steps. <br />
<br />
As I said I've handled thousands of these cases and know what needs to be done and in what order. If you want to debate this then I suggest you take it to a shop where they minimum charge is $150 which I am saving you here. But they will likely refer to one
 of the MVP tutorials to fix it in the shop. <br />
<br />
I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>A car and a computer are very different, although both require servicing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's very tempting to blame everything on big, bad Microsoft. While I'll be the first to admit that Microsoft is big and bad, I also know - from my own experience and the experience of the smart people who taught me - that if you really want a computer that
 runs well, despite whatever Microsoft does to it, then learn how your computer works and how to make it work for you. To me, that's more satisfying than joining a pity party. Take control!</p>

<h2>            Webcam not being correctly identified by Windows 7 operating system</h2>
                    I had a logitech webcam and got a new HP HD-4110 Webcam for Christmas with Arcsoft software. &nbsp;I have uninstalled the Logitech software. &nbsp;When I plug in my webcam to a USB port, Windows identifies the webcam as a SunplusIT PC Camera, not an HP and I can
 not get the camera to work. &nbsp;How do I get windows to identify the camera properly. &nbsp;Is there a patch? &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

<h2>            Why Can&#39;t I Play DVD&#39;s Anymore&#63;</h2>
                    I have a collection of Movie DVDs that I bought and other DVDs that I made with my own videos.&nbsp; Neither will play on my computer, but they used to.&nbsp; This started when&nbsp;I&nbsp;upgraded to Windows 10, but I can't figure out what the problem is.&nbsp; I read an article
 saying something like MPEG-2 videos can't be watched anymore, but I'm not sure if that's related to my problem.&nbsp; Seems very weird that a laptop won't play DVDs anymore, but I don't think I'm the only one having this problem.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;
 Thanks.

<h2>            Jumper EZ Pad 5S Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have recently purchased the above computer through Gearbest, and although I believe it represents great value for money it has not been without its issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is shipped with an early release of Windows 10 which has numerous failings and bugs.</p>
<p>These included:</p>
<p>No connection or sync with One Drive</p>
<p>Notification problems</p>
<p>Would not update through Windows Update</p>
<p>No response or support from seller or manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent hours and days trying to resolve these issues , both on my own surfing the web and with the assistance of Windows Support Technicians. This resulted in a partial fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally resorted to a clean install, (link below), which has had its own set of problems. Although it has resolved all my previous issues , it has created another. This is not a path for the faint hearted or inexperienced, as it proved to be challenging
 and very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would like to hear from other Jumper users with their problems and solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>

Bug check description: This indicates that an exception happened while executing a routine that transitions from non-privileged code to privileged code.
<br />
This appears to be a typical software driver bug and is not likely to be caused by a hardware problem.
<br />
The crash took place in a standard Microsoft module. Your system configuration may be incorrect. Possibly this problem is caused by another driver on your system that cannot be identified at this time.

<div>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to try these steps and check.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>Method 1: Safe mode:</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>Safe mode starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible causes. I would suggest you
 to boot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue persists. Refer this link to boot the computer in safe mode:</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />

<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>Method 3: Scan your computer for virus</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;I would suggest you to perform a complete scan on these drives to check if there is any errors and check. Refer to these steps:</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />

<p>
</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 30px">This originated in the Windows 7 SP1 DVD/ISO creation process. There was an issue in the creation process that caused a WMI registration to remain in the DVD/ISO. Since the registration is designed to work only during
 the DVD/ISO creation process, it fails to run on a live system and causes these events. These events are not indicative of any issue in the system and
<strong>can be safely ignored</strong>. If however you want to<strong> prevent these events from getting generated
</strong>and want to remove this specific WMI registration manually, please follow the steps mentioned in this article for running the workaround script.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 30px">After running the script the Event ID 10 errors related to this event should stop occurring. This does not remove any of the existing entries in the Event log, they would need to be manually cleared out of the application
 event log.<br />
<br />
<span>Note:</span> <strong>There can be other reasons for Event ID 10
</strong>error messages, this only <strong>prevents the error message listed</strong> above from occurring.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 30px">

    <title>Windows 10 window manager is broken&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prigoryan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 window manager is broken&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Just found a really strange behaviour of WinAPI. Try to create simple window project (default) for example in VS2017 on Windows 10. In functions CreateWindow/CreateWindowEx/MoveWindow/SetWindowPos try to set X and Y to 0, 0 which should correspond to top
 left corner of screen on single monitor system. Run it. Whoops (screenshot). X is about 7 pixels far right than it should be (see pic). Run same executable on Windows 7 without recompilation - everything is just as expected (0, 0 is top left corner). Seems
 like a bug to me</p>

github gist</a> with source code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.</p>
<p>My Win10 version is 18348 (Insider preview). But this issue was found a lot earlier.<br />
VisualStudio 2017 is latest available community edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.P.S.</p>
<p>Here is the same issue I found on github while searching web for similar problems:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/digitalcreations/MaxTo/issues/50" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://github.com/digitalcreations/MaxTo/issues/50</a><br />
They suggested <strong>DwmGetWindowAttribute(..., DWMWA_EXTENDED_FRAME_BOUNDS, ...);</strong></p>
<p>But why should I use this API if <strong>official MS documentation says</strong>, for example, for CreateWindowEx that
<strong>X and Y are position in screen coordinates starting from top-left corner</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>P.P.S. #2Here's some more of this BUG:</p>

<p>Many thanks for your reply. Here is link to my report:&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/AA4gtj8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/AA4gtj8</a></p>
<p>Couldn't find category which coresponds to WinAPI so desided to put in in Applications -&gt; Visual Studio Community 2017 cause it's dev thing.<br />
Also here is a screenshot on Windows 7 which shows everything is OK there (exe was not changed or rebuild):</p>

<h2>            So The Xbox App On Windows 10 Is Actually Kinda Interesting... IMO</h2>
                    
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>So due to my work schedule I didn't really get to mess around with the Xbox App on Windows 10 yesterday. Today however, I'm not working so... I've checked it out. I wasn't really interested in the "stream
 a Xbox game to your PC or other device" thingy... until I actually tried it. It's actually kinda cool and I could possibly see uses for it in the future... for those moments when I just wanna play a game on a tablet while I have an amazing bubble bath. (Ok...
 maybe to much info but you get the idea... or maybe you don't. lol) You just plug your Xbox controller into a USB port. Obviously the app reminds me of the Smart Glass App. You can pretty much do anything on it, and it even has a Start A Party beta on it which
 I haven't tried yet because I'm not entirely sure if I need to be streaming a game for it to work? But anyways, has anyone else tried streaming games from their Xbox One's yet? What did you think?</strong></span></p>

<p>GG - Read the other Windows 10 thread on here, just download the Media creation tool and jump the queue. &nbsp;You don't actually have to create any media with it, it will ask you as soon as you fire it up if you want to upgrade the pc its on. &nbsp;That's exactly
 what's happening on my PC right now as I type, its downloading the update</p>

<p>I streamed a few games to my Surface Pro 3 last night after updating it to Windows 10 just to test it out. &nbsp;I was pleasantly surprised with how well it worked. &nbsp;Did have one issue where the audio dropped out for a little while but restarting the game resolved
 that. &nbsp;All told I probably played for 2-3 hours over streaming and aside from the audio issue I kind of forgot that I wasn't playing the games directly on my tablet. &nbsp;Definitely a feature I will get some use out of...</p>

ANTI-KINECT</span> as you think. One of my Ones actually has a kinect. What bothers me is the lack of games for it. "Most" people who praise it, praise it for the voice commands. That's fine... for them, but I actually don't care for them really. It doesn't
 take me forever to do what I want when I use my controller for navigation. That's just me. Everyone here already knows I'm kwazy. (with a k) I actually wish they would make more games that use it. Sit down for this one... I actually enjoyed Kinect Rivals.
 I know I don't have the greatest reputation here, but I've met very few here who "get me". My sarcasm flies over peoples heads sometimes. lol Anyways, to answer your question about Cortana... I don't really see myself using it. I imagine those who like voice
 commands will love that feature. It's just not me. With all that said, who knows... maybe one day I'll use it for something. As I mentioned at the beginning of this thread, I had no interest in streaming my Xbox One games to my PC or tablet but it seems ok
 after I tried it. <span style="color: rgba(149, 38, 216, 1)">:)</span> Anyways... again... I know it looks like I hate the kinect because I don't ever recommend that people should buy an Xbox One with it, but I usually tell them it's because I don't like voice commands and
 unless they do, the lack of games for it make it pretty much useless. <span style="color: rgba(149, 38, 216, 1)">
IMO</span>. Ok, I've typed way more than I usually do so I shall leave now. I'm not sure if anything I said makes sense.

    <title>Auto Screen Rotation on Lenovo Flex 2 14 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Auto Screen Rotation on Lenovo Flex 2 14</h2>
                    <p>hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>my laptop used to support auto rotate screen feature on its default windows 8.1. but from the day I have installed windows 10, that feature is not there. I feel, I have wasted my money on a for its feature of flexible flap. Laptop rotates 180 degree but
 windows doesn't allow the screen to auto rotate. I have tried everything on settings but it seems that there is no such feature now. Plus, there was an option of working on two screens at the same time but that too seem to have been removed by windows in its
 10th version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is the case, I will have to return to my old windows 8.1. And if this is a bug, which is, kindly fix it and let me know what you ppl are doing to resolve my problem.</p>

 I would like to sign in with my own sign in password and then my desktop arrangement would be as I want it to be.</p>

<h2>            Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro on Windows 10 can&#180;t update</h2>
                    Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro works ok on Windows 10 but "Check for updates..." responds that something&nbsp;is wrong with my internet settings. I had&nbsp;the problem with Outlook 2013 that it could not send messages but that problem is now solved due to a workaround command
 prompt. Maybe there is a similar problem with Windows 10 that blocks the communication with the Adobe update server.

<p>Errors installing new updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried installing these 17 new updates four times today, each time when I restarted the computer I had the Startup Repair pop up and it took 20 minutes for the computer to boot. After the third try, I ran the Troubleshooter and got the following error
 messages:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows Update error 0x80070490(2014-10-14-T-11_16_12P)" - NOT FIXED</p>
<p>"Problems installing recent updates" - NOT FIXED</p>

</p><p>My computer was running fine until I tried installing these updates.&nbsp;What suggestions do you have to fix these problems (and hopefully keep this from happening in the future)?</p>

            Sounds like the file association for .TXT files has been damaged on this machine.&nbsp; Try running the .TXT file association fix from this site, the fix is for Vista, but I'm pretty sure it will work for Windows 7 also:<br />

                    <p>I'm having a problem with Skype on one of my computers.&nbsp; I'll call one "House", and the other "Garage".&nbsp; when I get a call from my sister in Ohio, "House" gets a ring tone, I answer, and cannot hear her.&nbsp; If I answer on "Garage", I can hear fine.&nbsp; Now for
 the strange part.&nbsp; If she calls "House" from a different computer it works fine.&nbsp; This started after a SKYPE update.&nbsp; I've even gone so far as to completely uninstall SKYPE, the download it again.&nbsp; Still the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Jerry</p>

            Hi JerryVanEiken
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            It still didn't work, but now I was logged out in the garage, and Skype says my new password is wrong!&nbsp; She called me from her laptop and it works fine in the house computer.

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>No, she's using Windows 10 (1809).&nbsp; My other sister called me on Skype and it worked fine.&nbsp; I hear the Skype tone for the call, but no audio.&nbsp; If I answer on my garage computer, everything works fine.&nbsp; Except it's winter, and I have no heat there. :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
