<h2>            Error 36888 and Error 36884&#63; App crashing ONLY in PRIVATE network.</h2>
                    <p>I have downloaded KEXP Artist Discovery App from Windows 8 Store. It works fine when I'm connected to a public network, but on my home, private network some specific videos on it crash and take out my whole internet for a few minutes when I try and play
 them. I think it is the Errors 36888 and 36884 as they are in my event logs around those times. I read somewhere that unchecking Use TSL in internet options might fix it. It did not but I now have a different error code. Error 127, 1014, 2486 and 1002 all
 occured within 90 secs of each other when I tried to play one of the videos. I'm not really sure what any of this means. Can anyone help me please?</p>

            <div>Hi JC,</div>
<div><br />
Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and posting your query on Microsoft community.</div>
<div><br />
From your issue description, I understand that KEXP Artist Discovery App crashes when playing specific videos.</div>
<div><br />
Could you please answer the following question so that I can help you in a better way.</div>
<div><br />
1. Is the issue specific with this particular app or with all the apps?<br />
2. What is the security software installed on the computer?<br />
3. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div><br />
Now let’s try some steps for resolving this issue, which I have described as methods given below.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:<br />
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As you are
</span><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">event id 36888 error in event viewer, I suggest you try the following steps and check.</span></p>
<p>
</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Open Group Policy Editor by pressing Windows key + R.</span></p>
<p>
</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Now type gpedit.msc and press enter.
</span></p>
<p>
</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Go to Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; System &gt; Distributed COM &gt; Application Compatibility and enable "allow local activation security
 check exemptions"</span></p>
</strong></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong> <br />
I suggest you follow the link and instructions given in the link<br />
<strong>What to do if you have problems with an app</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong> <br />
I suggest you disable antivirus installed on the computer and check.<br />
<strong>Important Note</strong>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
If the issue persists then I suggest you to contact app support and check with them.<br />
Refer to the link.<br />

            <p>Hello, thank you very much for the response. It is much appreciated.</p>
<p>As for your 3 questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. So far I have only had this problem with this particular app, but the laptop is new (I bought it last week) so I have not tried and tested a large number of apps, but the others I have tried all seem to work fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The laptop came with a trial for Norton but I uninstalled it as it seemed to be being funny (i.e. the antimalware would be turned off and it wouldnt let me turn it on). I did a factory reset (explained below) and uninstalled&nbsp;Norton afterwards. So now
 the laptop just has the built in Windows 8 protection. I think it is Microsoft Security Essentials and Windows Defender.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Yes I bought the laptop new last week but it seemed buggy (in hindsight actually it was mostly just the KEXP app but as it was the first thing I downloaded so when it didn't work I thought the laptop was being buggy. Also the Norton was being funny as
 described above). So i did a Windows Reset. Now everything seems to be OK except the KEXP app.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your suggestions. I tried Method 1 yesterday after reading it in another forum, but my laptop does not appear to have Group Policy Editor. When I type gpedit.msc into Run it does not find anything. My friend said the Windows 8 version I have
 does not have Group Policy Editor. It is possible to download? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I shall try methods 2 and 3 when I get home later (I am at work currently). </p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

            <p>Ok I've tried everything now and still the problem persists. It must be something weirdly specific to the App so I've got in touch with them too.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help, and if you can give me any info on whether I should have a Group Policy Editor I'd much appreciate it. Cheers!</p>

    <title>Upgrade to Windows 8.1 and email program - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimm54  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade to Windows 8.1 and email program</h2>
                    <div><font>Back in May 2013 I purchased a new Dell desktop computer with Windows 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Internet Service Provider had a major problem setting up my email account with the Outlook.com email program that came with Windows 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; I contacted Microsoft
 Support and several agents tried numerous things, without success , to fix the problems created by my ISP and then I was advised by Microsoft Support that it would be best to just install
<strong>Windows Live Mail</strong> on my computer and use it for my email program.&nbsp; A Microsoft support agent installed Windows Live Mail for me and&nbsp; it has worked perfectly ever since.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>Now, here is my question:&nbsp;&nbsp; I was just notified that I can upgrade my computer to the new
<u>Windows 8.1</u> operating system, which I would like to do.&nbsp; However, I am concerned that if I do upgrade to Windows 8.1,&nbsp; will I lose the Windows Live Mail program that I currently have installed on my computer?&nbsp;&nbsp; The Windows Live Mail program has been
 working fine and I would prefer to keep using it and not risk having problems with a new email program. &nbsp;Will I lose Windows Live Mail on my computer if I upgrade to Windows 8.1?</font></div>
<div><font>I would appreciate your comments.Up</font></div>

</p>
<p>You seem to know about Windows 8 and 8.1.......</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Would you happen to know what I need to do in order to right click directly on a photo and "email to recipient" ?&nbsp; I use Hotmail.com for my email....which is accessed automatically through windows live. But apparently this is not an "email program"??? Any
 advise would be appreciated as I am unable to send the original size photos in an email attachment or inserting them. My family member abroad states they always arrive 400 x 600 even though I send a photo file that is 5152 x 3864.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've tried inserting them and right clicking to select 200%, that doesn't work either. they still send small.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I attempt to send from the library, by right clicking,&nbsp;selecting&nbsp;"send to email recipient" and selecting size....once I press "ok" this message shows :&nbsp;<font>"There is no email program associated to
 perform the requested action. Please install an email program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Programs control panel."<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3479665e-81a8-4054-bb5c-79dc52066e4d" /></font></p>

            <p>Assuming Windows Live Mail (not Windows Live Hotmail/Outlook.com) is installed, you will need to re-assert Windows Live Mail as the default for&nbsp;<strong>E-mail</strong> in the CUSTOM (<strong>&lt;=important!</strong>) section of
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/set-program-access-computer-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><font color="#0072c6">Set Program Access and Computer Defaults</font></span></a>&nbsp;and then restart your computer before any
<strong>Send To</strong> or <strong>MailTo</strong> functions will work properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will find support for Windows Live Mail in these forums: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/livemail">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/livemail</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: An attachment adds a ~35% markup to a message; e.g., a 1.5 MB attachment added&nbsp;to a 1KB email becomes a +2 MB message - which might be refused by many ISPs). Better use SkyDrive&nbsp;to share&nbsp;such pix.</p>
<p>PPS: Next time around, <em>begin your own new thread</em> about your problem instead of hijacking someone else's thread. THX</p>

            <p>Hi PA Bear, </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for your response!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I bought this machine with Windows 8 on it the week it came out. </p>
<p>I can only assume that yes, Windows Live Mail is what is installed. </p>
<p>Is this considered a "mail client" that I can "associate" in the default programs?
</p>
<p>Because honestly, I still can't figure out what settings I'm supposed to change.</p>
<p>I apologize, though I'm fairly good at navigating and troubleshooting....my knowledge is limited.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've attached an image of what my&nbsp;email setting screen looks like.&nbsp; </p>
<p>my login screen address reads: <a href="https://login.live.com/default" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://login.live.com/default</a>
</p>
<p>I get to that screen by typing <a href="http://www.hotmail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.hotmail.com</a> in the address bar.</p>
<p>Could possibly be MSN?? I sign in with my Hotmail email address.&nbsp; They automatically upgraded this live.com to "outlook" several months ago.&nbsp; But it's different then
<a href="http://www.outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.outlook.com</a></p>
<p>Hopefully you know what I mean, cause&nbsp;that will sound confusing if you don't. :-)</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>"Snail Mail" is even more inconvenient then the reduced size photos by email, my recipient/family member lives abroad and it would take 2 months to reach them.</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>I do not see "CUSTOM" as an option in "program defaults"</p>
<p>I also looked on the hyperlink in your message "Set Program Access and Computer Defaults" (screenshot attached)&nbsp;....it claims all programs that came with Microsoft Windows are already the default.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Sorry, but I'm still at the drawing board and not sure what to do from here or if it's just impossible to right click on a photo in my library, select email recipient and a size to send. Which is a bummer, but not surprising to me.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I appreciate you taking the time to help me. Not sure if my screenshots help show why I'm stuck, hope so though.</p>

</p>
<p>In "set your default programs ^&nbsp; I see "MAIL" ...Microsoft Corporation. And it says "This program has all it's defaults".&nbsp; I still selected it as default and pressed "OK". Nothing changed though.

            <p>Thank you PA Bear,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>That answers my question. I am using a webmail app then and it can't be "associated" as a default "program".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I appreciate you helping me clarify that. It's what I assumed, but wasn't sure.</p>

    <title>Removing parental controls - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> koen1994  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removing parental controls</h2>
                    
<p>How can I remove the parental controls from my account? I made it a few months ago on a windows 8 consumer preview, while I was still 17 years old.. I turned 18 in august of this year, and after buying an xbox 360 today, I set up my account on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I want to add someone as a friend, it says that I need to give the password of a parental account, which I forgot the info of.</p>

<p>so, how do I remove all this parental stuff?</p>

<p>i got it solved.</p>
<p>here's how i fixed it:</p>
<p>in control panel "programs and features"</p>
<p>select "turn windows features on or off"</p>
<p>then scroll and find ".net framwork 3.5.1."</p>
<p>first i unchecked and uninstalled it. then restarted. then, i came back, clicked the checkbox to re-install .net framwork 3.5.1. (i didn't install any of the sub-items)</p>
<p>restarted again, now i don't get the the gfxui error anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i was never able to access or modify the intel graphics settings when the gfxui crashed at startup. that was the only notable symptom of not having the graphics driver.</p>

            follow directions previously stated (page 1) for uninstalling the 2-3 associated programs. &nbsp;To reactivate the net framework &nbsp;3.5.1&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &nbsp;Control Panel &gt;&gt;&gt; Program and features &gt;&gt;&gt;
<div><br />
<div>On the top left margin: click on turn windows features on or off. &gt;&gt;&gt; &nbsp;Net framework 3.5.1 it'll be a blue box, I believe. &nbsp;Click to reactivate that one. &nbsp;Otherwise the directions for everything are posted like 4 times in this forum. Please read</div>

</p><p>If you've forgotten your Windows password, there are several ways to retrieve or reset it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your PC is on a domain, your system administrator must reset your password.</p>

</p><p>We suggest running an <strong>Internet Connections troubleshooter</strong> and check if it will help resolve the issue. The troubleshooter can automatically find and fix some common connection problems. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Click the <strong>Start </strong>button.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the search box, type&nbsp;</span><strong>troubleshooter</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>Click&nbsp;</span><strong>Troubleshooting</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>Under&nbsp;</span><strong>Network and Internet</strong><span>, click&nbsp;</span><strong>Connect to the Internet</strong><span>.</span></li></ol>

            Hi,<br />

Fix network connection issues in Windows 10<br />

&nbsp;<br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible<br />
solution?&nbsp;The router can be the issue even it other OS's are working fine. And <br />
I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - <strong>click Update Driver (may not do</strong><br />
<strong>anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi</strong><br />
<strong>Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.</strong><br />
<br />
Then check the System/Motherboard Maker's Site and that of the actual device<br />
maker (such as Intel,&nbsp;RealTek, Broadcom, or Atheros) for even newer drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

            Ask the System Maker's Support and do same in their forums.<br />
<br />
Use the exact methods below to check for your driver updates.<br />
<br />
It is possible that the drivers you are using, even if the latest now available, are not<br />
100% Windows 8.1 compliant. Check with your System Maker's Support (Motherboard<br />
Maker for custom systems) and/or the actual device maker. The latter, such as Intel,<br />
RealTek, Atheros and others may have newer versions not available at the System/Motherboard Maker's site. And continue to check with them regularly over the next year +.&nbsp; Also update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device
 drivers.<br />
<br />
Get your apps and devices working in Windows 8.1<br />

<br />
=======================================================<br />
<br />
Be sure to check for updates to the router firmware since that can have a definite effect<br />
on Windows 8.1 connections even though other OS&nbsp;systems connections are fine.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Check with&nbsp;the System Maker's Support (Motherboard&nbsp;Maker for custom systems) and/or
<br />
the actual&nbsp;device maker for driver updates. If there are no newer versions&nbsp;re-install the
<br />
same ones. Ask in their forums&nbsp;(if any) about any known issues.<br />

<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7 and Windows 8.<br />

Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible<br />
solution?&nbsp;And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are <br />
you positioned from the router? Are there obstructions in the way?<br />
<br />
<strong>Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.</strong><br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - click Update Driver (may not do<br />
anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi<br />

Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated <br />
drivers as Windows&nbsp;8&nbsp;loves updated drivers.<br />

<h3> raddatzjos  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I keep media playing when I switch applications&#63;</h2>
                    I listen to Pandora Radio quite frequently in Chrome, but when I switch focus away to another metro app, Chrome is muted! How do I fix this? It's exceptionally frustrating to turn on music and then switch to work on an essay or check email only to have
 the music muted. The Netflix app does the same thing. I'm running Windows 8 Pro on my desktop, if that helps anything.

            I already have a Microsoft Account. It was created when I set up my PC instead of a local user account. Also, the Windows bootloader vanished from my hard drive, prompting a reinstallation of Windows 8, so now I'm running on a clean install with the same
 problem.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is by design when a modern app isn't the main focus it&nbsp;goes to "sleep" when it becomes main focus again it wakes up. This helps performance and memory.</p>

            Is there no way to make an application not sleep when it's not the main focus? It's incredibly inconvenient not to be able to multitask like that.

            I have this same problem too when switching away from a browser in metro mode. The browser is not asleep because the songs keep playing, the sound is just muted. So I don't see how this is an issue
<span>for</span> helping performance/memory if the browser is clearly still running and playing the music. It looks like an issue with how windows is handling audio for browsers in metro mode.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is by design when a modern app isn't the main focus it&nbsp;goes to "sleep" when it becomes main focus again it wakes up. This helps performance and memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Keep us posted if you face any issues on windows in future. We will be glad to help you.</p>
</blockquote>
<div>Can you elaborate on what "sleep" means? Clearly the app is still running and functioning because songs in Pandora keep playing! That doesn't sound like sleep to me, that sounds like changing the channel on a TV, you're not looking at it anymore, but it's
 not static, it keeps changing!</div>
<div><br />
<div>But if this complete lack of response to several users is Microsoft's idea of "help" when it's just dumped all of it's new users into a completely foreign interface with no context to help users navigate, I don't see the company lasting too much longer.
 Even Microsoft can only afford to screw up so many times.</div>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently tried to change the security permissions of a folder on my external hard disk.
<strong>I denied permissions (my attempt was to protect folder from being deleted) of authenticated users.</strong> After that when I tried to access this folder I'm getting this error: "<strong>You have been denied access permission to access this folder</strong>"</p>

<p>They are not imported from a previous OS. As I said in my query, I assume that it occurs due to a technical mistake while I attempted changing permissions. Anyway I tried your solutions. But it doesn't help. Is there anyway I could reset the permissions..?</p>

 install the 2005 and 2008 packs I got error 1935 and some text afterwards I couldn't understand. Can I get some help with this error? Also I have looked at other threads about this but it seems none have helped(and some seem quite outdated). If anyone has
 the answer it would be deeply appreciated, I have been trying to get this game to work for about a week now. One more thing, for an unknown reason I can't install some updates and I can't wipe my computer, it just won't let me. Thanks in advance.

            So I tried to install the x64 versions of what you sent for 2005 and 2008 but the error 1935 prevails. Is this supposed to happen? Also I looked at the troubleshooting and It didnt help.

            Which version of Windows is this game originally designed for? It might be too old to run on Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Other users have reported installing a later version of the Visual C++ Redistributable bypasses the need to install the older 2005 release. You could try that to see if it works.

            So I reinstalled the other versions but it didn't fix the error or let me open my game. Is this a problem with my updates? My windows updates refuse to install so it might be that. How can I make them work?

    <title>Windows 10&#58; Task Manager is not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> braveandnoblegamer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Task Manager is not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few weeks ago I ended up with a virus on my Windows 10 machine. I went through a thorough clean-up process using a number of tools (Malwarebytes, Zemana, HitmanPro, etc.) and followed a guide for the specific virus I had. This seems to have worked and
 I am no longer experiencing any symptoms and none of the tools detect anymore issues. However one issue remains, that I assume is related or a byproduct of this virus - my Task Manager no longer opens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me that a crucial file related to it was corrupted or deleted. I know the virus intentionally attempts to block task manager, and I have looked at remedies for this such as renaming task manager to something else to see if that allows it to open
 (it doesn't work), but nothing else I have found online has worked. When I launch task manager a window pops up with the Task Manager heading, but the window is blank (solid white) and after a few seconds it closes itself. Is there a way to simply reinstall
 Task Manager? I feel like the virus is no longer present, but that it or in cleaning it a related file was lost and that a reinstall would be able to fix this, but I can't find any information regarding this online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue can be caused a corrupted system file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to better assist you, answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How are you trying to open Task Manager?</li><li>Have you tried opening Task Manager by pressing<strong> Ctrl + Alt + Delete</strong> or by right-clicking on the taskbar?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, if you've downloaded a third-party antivirus software that is free, we suggest uninstalling them and see if the issue will persist. This will also help us isolate what is causing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>have to</span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>temporarily
 disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also locate the Task Manager executable file in <strong>C:\Windows\system32.
</strong>Once you see <strong>taskmgr.exe</strong>, try opening it and update us with the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply so we can find the best solution for you.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 free upgrade failure - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 free upgrade failure</h2>
                    <p>On my wife's computer, I attempted the Windows 10 free upgrade. &nbsp;After two failed attempts, I am completely stuck. &nbsp;In the information provided by Microsoft (prior to the Win 10 upgrade), it stated that the option to restore the previous version would be
 available. &nbsp;This is not the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this time, the error code(s): &nbsp; 0x800704B3</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0x8007005&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>are displayed. &nbsp;System restore is unavailable. &nbsp;Basically, her laptop has been reduced to a machine that is not Win 10 and cannot be &nbsp;restored to Win 7 SP1. &nbsp;If anyone has any ideas of clearing this mess, I will gladly go back to Win 7 SP1 and let the techies
 fix some of the multitude of bugs with the Win 10 roll out. &nbsp;The laptop is an Acer with Intel processor (i5, I believe). &nbsp;I am unable to get to the computer properties, too. &nbsp;I am very frustrated. &nbsp;The laptop will boot and display the desktop, allow play of
 the Microsoft games (Checkers, Solitaire, Spider Solitaire, etc. and nothing else. &nbsp;It is a glorified picture frame with freebie games. &nbsp;I hate Apple, but they are become more attractive by the second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any suggestions.</p>

    <title>Have Windows 8 install Samsung Galaxy Ace USB Driver again - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> datvm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Have Windows 8 install Samsung Galaxy Ace USB Driver again</h2>
                    When I installed Windows 8 and connected my Samsung Galaxy Ace (GT-5830) by USB cable for the first time, Windows automically downloaded and installed the drivers, so I can use Mass Storage and USB Debugging (I'm an Android developer) as well as tethering.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Yesterday, I accidentally uninstall some Samsung softwares while cleaning up my computer, and today, Windows can no longer detect my device. When I connect with USB cable, the device only charge power, no storage or any feature can be used. In Device Manager,
 it is shown as an unknown device. I tried to update the driver of that unknown device, but it failed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can you please tell me how can I make Windows re-download those drivers, just like the first time?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Note: I didn't need Samsung Kies to make it work, Windows just did everything for me.</div>
                </div>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We will help you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Query 1: </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> I suggest you to run the <strong>
hardware and devices</strong> troubleshooter by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><span>Windows </span></strong>icon key on the keyboard, type
<strong><span>troubleshooter</span></strong> and select the top most search result<strong>.</strong></span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>View all </strong>from left side panel of the screen.</span></li><li><span>Select </span><strong><span>Hardware and Devices<span>, </span></span></strong><span>c</span><span>lick on
<strong>Advanced </strong>option and check <strong>Apply repairs automatically </strong>
<span>option.</span></span></li><li><span>Follow the on screen instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>If the driver, application, game or software of the older operating system fails to work properly in the current operating system, you can always make it programmable in the
<strong>compatibility mode</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Compatibility mode</span></strong><span> runs the program in the current version of Windows using the settings from previous version of Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Locate and <strong>right-click</strong> on the game setup file and click on
<strong>properties</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on the <strong>compatibility </strong>tab, check the box <strong>
Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>, select Windows&nbsp;10 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done,
<strong>restart</strong> the computer for the effective changes to take place.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></span><span><span>It is recommended that you install older version of the operating system first and then the latest version but it is not mandatory.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Query 2:</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To dual boot your PC you first have to create partitions to load both the OS onto the drives.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Create disk partition by following the steps below</span><span>:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Open run command by pressing <strong>Windows Key + R </strong>
keys on the keyboard, type <strong>diskmgmt.msc</strong> and press <strong>Enter.</strong></span></li><li><span>Right click on <strong>OS(C:)</strong> hard drive and select <strong>Shrink Volume</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Allocate the space of disk in MB and click on <strong>Shrink</strong>. A partition by name
<strong>Unallocated</strong> will be created.</span></li><li><span>Right click on the <strong>Unallocated</strong> disk drive and select <strong>
New Simple Volume</strong> option. Follow the onscreen instructions.</span></li><li><span>Now boot the PC from the bootable device and install Windows on the created partition.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>After creating the partitions, install Windows 7 first and then install Windows 10 from the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><span>Media Creation Tool</span></strong></a></span><span><span>&nbsp;onto the selected drive, which has enough space to accommodate both the OS.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You do not have to use a new product key to activate Windows 7 copy as the product key of the operating software will be integrated to the motherboard. Even after installing Windows 7 you will be able to upgrade to Windows 10 since the product key
 would have been activated already on the motherboard which will not interrupt the upgrading process.</span></p>

<p>What is going on here, I need functionality (that I quite frankly pay for) that has been taken away in the newest (forced) update!&nbsp; I have been in vain trying to reach someone in customer service only to be forced to post in the community.&nbsp; I need to set
 my Skype to ring to my external speakers and not my headset so I can hear when someone's calling me when I'm not in front of the computer!&nbsp; How do I get this to happen as the functionality seems to not exist on this interface!</p>

<p>
</p><p>In the new Skype version, you still have the option to configure your audio and video settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To access the settings, follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tap your profile picture.</li><li>Select <strong>audio and video settings</strong>.</li><li>Select what audio device would you like for Skype to use. If you have multiple audio devices (mic and speakers) there should be a drop down arrow.</li></ul>
<p>

</p><p>Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>Karen,</p>
<p>Thank you for this.</p>
<p>However this is not the current issue I have.</p>
<p>Yes I have multiple audio devices, however when someone calls me, I had the ringer going to the external speakers on my desktop.</p>
<p>I'd answer the call and I'd use my USB Logitech headset to talk and hear the conversation in private.</p>
<p>Right now when I switch the speaker everyone around me can hear the conversation which is unacceptable.&nbsp; The older version allowed me to let the ring go through the desktop speakers (external) while my conversation was (internal) on my headset.&nbsp; I need this
 functionality otherwise I'll have to port my phone number elsewhere.</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Joe</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>You can set the USB Logitech headset as the main communication audio device in Skype, this way you can use it to answer calls and talk to them privately. Unfortunately, the new Skype does not have an option to automatically switch the audio device, however,
 you can install the classic version if, just like you mentioned, you can switch from different audio devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To install the classic version, please refer to the steps below:</p>

<h2>            Surface 2 will NOT Refresh properly</h2>
                    At the end of the Refresh my Surface 2 says something like "We have encountered a problem. Please wait whilst we gather some error info and your Surface will automatically be restarted". Well nothing happens. It stays locked like this until I turn it off
 at the power button. When I re-start it it works but not properly eg. Internet Explorer doesn't load pages. But if I try to Refresh I just go through the cycle again.&nbsp;
<div>When I check for Windows Updates it just hangs forever so I cant seem to update Windows either.</div>
<div>What do I do?</div>

I have&nbsp; had my pc, tablet 2nd phone off. My main phone stays on at all times however it does not have skype installed.</p>
<p>Why would skype then show me online?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Is there a diagnostic tool or any recommendations for this issue? Note: I have reset my pw at least twice. Yet, eventually this always happens.</p>

            Hi The
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Skype is a connected Microsoft Service, so, when you sign into a Microsoft Service such as Outlook.com or OneDrive.com, then your Skype status will become active.
<br />
<br />If you want to change your Skype status to offline or away, launch Skype, right click your profile picture in the top left then choose 'Away' or 'Invisible'.       
        </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>my xbox 360 slim 250GB keeps asking me to install the same game updates.</p>
<p>The problem started just last week after Dirt3 update.</p>
<p>Even the update has been installed at least 20 times by now, every time I insert the game disk it asks me to download the game update.</p>
<p>The same happens with MW2 as well.</p>
<p>I called Microsoft support and they asked me to recover my gamertag which I did but it didnt help at all.</p>
<p>Could some one please help?</p>
<p>Thanks heaps</p>

<p>Try clearing your cache (plenty of step by step how to vids on youtube) The thing is with doing that, you will be asked to update all your games again but hopefully just the once for each game and not every time you play.</p>

<p>Yeah try clearing your cache, and that should solve the problem. Here is a step by step on how to do that:

http://support.xbox.com/en-au/pages/xbox-360/troubleshoot/hardware/clear-system-cache.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless you have your gamertag on a memory stick/card which may also be causing the problem</p>

<p>Feel free to add me if you want dude I am getting the Xbox One at launch. But if your looking for a community I would suggest you check out the following recommendations:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cravethegame.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Crave The Game</a> - ran by a decent person known as Miss Wotsit</p>
<p><a href="http://gamersrespawn.co.uk/index.php?action=home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">GamersRespawn </a>- they seem like a nice bunch</p>
<p><a href="http://www.oldgamerz.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OldGamerz</a> - ran by RubberDuckie I believe and more than likely the type of atmosphere you are looking for and the least likely place you are going to find kids from what I can see.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gamerkitten.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">GamerKitten</a> - ran by Gillete73 although I might be mistaken but again another lovely bunch of people.</p>
<p>Console 3 - It is a fairly well laid back community, but I believe it's too laidback and that's a bad thing.</p>
<p>The four communities that I have linked for you are all the decent casual communities that I know of, I hope that helps you.</p>
