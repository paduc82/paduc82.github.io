                    <p>Original Title: Can no longer restart a service</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After installing Windows update KB2565063, I can no longer click on "Run" from the start menu and type in "services.msc".&nbsp; My printer periodically loses communication with Windows and Lexmark gives directions to restart the service in this way.&nbsp; Now when
 I click on "Run" it wants to open a file instead.&nbsp; How can I now restart a service?</p>

    <title>Default app notifications - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diannelongson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Default app notifications</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 10 about 3 weeks ago. Yesterday I received 3 notifications in quick succession. Each one said
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"an app caused a problem with the default setting for.html files, so it was reset to Microsoft edge".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition there was a message that wasn't saved in the Action Centre which said something about being given an alternative temporary user password and that all my files would be lost/deleted... &nbsp; Very Scary Stuff</p>
<p>
</p><p>It completely changed my desk top, my files disappeared and all my bookmarks were lost. I chatted with an answer tech online who gave me no answers but at least found my files for me. She told me I could move them back to the main menu of file explorer which
 I did. I thought the problem was fixed, but the same thing has happened again today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have neither the time nor the desire to spend hours of every day on this. Also I am not a techie so almost all the advice online is next to useless to me. Can anyone give me a clear answer about what is going on and what I can do about it?</p>

<h2>            The upgrade key you entered is for an edition of Windows that does not work with Windows Anytime Upgrade - New Toshiba R830 upgrade with retail pack</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I live in the UK and have just purchased a brand new Toshiba R830 pre-installed with Windows Home Premium (64-bit).- obviously this version of Windows is activated.</p>
<p>With the purchase of the laptop at Micro Anvika, I purchased a shrink-wrapped copy of Windows Anytime Upgrade to Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; I believe you refer to this as a retail copy.</p>
<p>When I go into Windows Anytime Upgrade:</p>
<p>1) Key verifies</p>
<p>2) I accept licence terms</p>
<p>3) I click on Upgrade</p>
<p>4) Upgrade returns the error "The upgrade key you entered is for an edition of Windows that does not work with Windows Anytime Upgrade"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Upgrade Advisor confirms that I can: You can upgrade to 64-bit Windows 7 Professional....</p>
<p>The retail copy does not specify whether it is 32-bit or 64-bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UK Microsoft office is closed and it is a bank holiday.&nbsp; I want to upgrade this this weekend and the USA team can't help because they can't give me an activation key from the USA for the UK.&nbsp; I am unable to use the support link I received on my first
 try as that says I'm in the wrong country.&nbsp; So, please find someone who can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards, </p>
<p>Maria</p>

<p>Sounds like you bought an OEM System Builer license. Is it? </p>
<p>Please note that Anytime Upgrade does not support OEM, MSDN-Academic, Volume License (student faculty licenses). If you are in posession of any of these media, you will have to back up and do a custom clean install. If you wish to do this, please backup
 your Windows 7 Home Premium or whichever edition you currently have installed. Certain licenses for Windows distributed to students at the tertiary level are not perpetual, meaning you can't continue using the software after completing a course or graduating.</p>

<p>Hi Larry,<br />
<br />
To be able to disable the Web Search when using the searchbox, you need to turn off Cortana. The searchbox will now say "Search Windows" instead of "Ask me anything." It will be more responsive and only show results from your hard drive or local network. To
 do this, you can follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Login to Windows 10 computer with your Microsoft account.</li><li>Click on <strong>Cortana </strong>search bar.</li><li>In the search box at the bottom, type <strong>Disable </strong><strong>Cortana</strong>.</li><li>Once the suggestions appear in the list, click <strong>Cortana &amp; Search settings</strong>.</li><li>Then turn off <strong>Cortana </strong>option.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, don't hesitate to get back to us.</p>

                    <p>I've had Xbox since forever. I have an Xbox one and have only had one gamertag since I first brought my Xbox 360. My son who is eleven was here with his cousin who is 14yrs old playing on my system. The next day I was suspended. Called in said it would be until the 25th. That was the 24th I called. This is the first time this has ever happened. Anyways they said it was due to not appropriate language. My son said my nephew said somethings that took him off Xbox live. I want to see how can I fix this. I've never had any problems. My daughter of 5 used this so does my son that is 11. I'm a mother who's family plays with them from far. Please help.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            System Protection tab Missing in Safe Boot</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Pro 64-bit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My goal was to restore to an earlier restore point in Safe Boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using msconfig.exe, I checked Safe Boot.</p>
<p>I rebooted into Safe Boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to the System Properties dialog.</p>
<p>However, the System Protection tab was missing.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Unable to connect to internet computer slow</h2>
                    <p>*Original Title: <strong>Start up/internet connection issues</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi I have a Toshiba laptop but have suddenly started having issues when i start up in normal mode. When i start up in normal mode it is very very slow, also once loaded up the laptop will not connect to the internet. I have tried to do a system recovery
 but it seems that the system recovery is not working either. i have carried out a clean boot aswell but still no joy. The only way i can get onto the internet is to start the system in safe mode. Any help would be great.

            <p>Try to boot the computer in SMWN and since hte computer works fine in Safe mode, I would recommend to uninstall any Antivirus softwares and also try to run a scan using malwarebyte and remove unwanted softwares. After that check if the computer is booting
 fine in normal mode. If its working fine, install the security software back.</p>

    <title>Update to Windows 10 removed some ASUS products - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stev1der  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update to Windows 10 removed some ASUS products</h2>
                    <p>Today I attempted to shut down my ASUS G11CD (two weeks old) and Windows 10 updated. It was a lengthy update which turned off and on the computer several times and gave both the "clock percentage" visual and some full screen blue "welcome messages" before
 taking me to my log in screen. I logged in and was met with a few error messages and a notification that a couple of ASUS programs were automatically removed because they were not compatible with this version of Windows. There was no issue with these programs
 whatsoever prior to the update. There was a security update following that one and so, I decided to shut off and turn back on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time, I have taken note of the error message that popped up. It's a small box that says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ASUS Product</p>
<p>
</p><p>g_pAsWMI_NotOpen</p>
<p>
</p><p>Closing it shows a box that replaces "ASUS Product" with simply Error and some of the successive boxes leads to a different error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>g_pAsWMI_GetDeviceStatus_NotOpen</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some simple research led me to finding out that one of the products that came with the machine has been uninstalled. In fact, at least two have been uninstalled.<br />
</p>
<p>Opening the ASUS App Box link and heading to ASUS Command and trying to use either the Ai Charger II or Power Manager tools does not work. The programs close before properly opening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do these products no longer work? What happened to them and is there any way to get them back? Did Windows update give me Windows products that do the same thing and these are no longer necessary? I purchased this computer a couple weeks ago and now
 a natively installed product is already out of date?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had issue with this after the most recent update? It appears that people had similar issues in Windows 8, but I'm using Windows 10 and I don't want to simply remove programs because they're no longer compatible if it's an issue with an incorrect
 update. ASUS Support didn't seem to know anything about this problem. Does anyone else have a similar issue and can those programs be recovered?</p>

</p><p>I did talk to ASUS, but when I attempted to install an ASUS product, downloaded off the ASUS support website, Windows 10 wouldn't allow it because it said that a "Lenovo" product wasn't compatible with my computer. I won't say for certain, because anything
 is possible, but I'm reasonably sure that a download off their website wasn't coming from Lenovo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any idea why Windows would be giving me this particular message when trying to install the Power Manager from ASUS?</p>

            Extensive troubleshooting with ASUS seems to point to an error in the install of the update, but troubleshooting the update doesn't appear to show any issues with the Windows 10 install, except for the programs removed.

            <p>It appears that the ASUS products were not the only ones removed (and it appears to be the "fall" update).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was suggested that something was wrong and I should start over with a "factory reset" of the computer, wiping it clean and starting from an out of the box state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased this computer in November and it arrived and I started setting it up in early December. The first thing I did this time, after the reset, was run the Windows 10 update. It came pre-installed with programs and with a version of Windows 10 that
 worked with everything on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took video this time, because ASUS insisted they had no knowledge of any issues and didn't seem to believe that it wasn't user error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The very first thing I did after wiping and starting up the computer as I had done when it came out of the box was run an update. It caught Windows 10 Home, version 1511, 10586 as an available update. I ran the update and chose to install it right away,
 hoping that maybe it was one of my later installed programs or virus protection that caused the problem. It was not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon the final reboot and logging in, I recorded video on my phone to notice what might be removed. I caught&nbsp;two notifications this time.</p>
<p>
It said&nbsp;that ASUS AI Charger and AI Charger Plus were removed because they are no longer compatible with this version of Windows.
</p><p><span>The next notification shows that REALTEK Bluetooth Drive was also removed for the same reason.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got no issue with updates making programs obsolete, but ASUS insists that this shouldn't be happening and that no other reported issues have been brought up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me state that their customer service&nbsp;has been atrocious. Utterly awful. However, if it was a simple fix, I'd just assume they'd say, it no longer works, sorry. That's not what's happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that my brand of computer may have something to do with it, but as I've tried ASUS, I'm wondering why trying to reinstall programs off their support site gets me an error message in Windows saying
 that a Lenovo product isn't compatible and if that has anything to do with why they were removed in the first place. I don't understand how that could happen, but why would an ASUS product that worked in November no longer work after this latest major Windows
 10 update and not even be on the radar? I also realize that's a question that can't be answered, but my problem is that it doesn't seem to present a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't just deny this update to Windows 10, can I? At any rate, there's no guarantee that an update in the Spring wouldn't do the same thing and remove the programs then. If I wanted to just uninstall the "old"
 programs and reinstall new ones, why can't I do that without the program being refused from the ASUS website?</p>

            How interesting. This is August 2016. I got my brand new ASUS computer July 30th and started working on it on July 31st. I had the same thing happen to me on the 1st of August. Now since this is several months after your issue. I am curious as to why this
 has not been corrected yet. Any help would be appreciated.

            <p>And the g-pAsWMI-NotOpen error just happened to me on startup after the Windows 10 update a few days ago (September 2016) on an Asus desktop that has been error-free for 2 years. I wonder if Asus support&nbsp;has owned up to it by now?
</p>
<p>So, I guess I will uninstall Asus Power Manager. Thanks for the info!</p>

            This is just another prime example of Microsoft and Windows 10&nbsp;taking over the world and every personal computer they can get their hands on without any prior approval from the end user or even asking permission to remove program or make them obsolete.
 How the heck were these program perfectly compatible with the initial, release version of Windows 10 but now magically, and for no explained reason that I see, other than Microsoft greed, they are now no longer compatible??? Yet Microsoft did not actually
 ask me or prompt me to uninstall them or replace them? now I just get random startup errors on a machine that is less than a year old???&nbsp; This is crap, the engineers and coders at Microsoft have basically been given free reign over every piece of software
 in existence, and if they can make it work, well tough s*** they can just make it "Not Compatible!" basically they are making money hand over fist, and not actually having to be help to any standard or any level of customer service at

                    <p>Hi good day, I'm having trouble with my usb 3.0 ports. the port doesn't read the usb devices such as flashdrive mouse etc. but my usb 2.0 port is working well. My USB 3.0 port was working well since I plugged my phone and windows 10 didn't detect it and
 suggest a "fix" to resolve this issue. And since then my usb 3.0 is now not working. I've checked my device manager and the&nbsp;Intel® USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller is now missing. I've tried to reinstall the driver unfortunately intel does not support windows
 10 usb drivers. I've also tried uninstalling it then restart to automatically reinstall but the problem is still the same. Any Idea how to fix this?</p>

                    I have the latest version of Windows Media Player and it's in my windows 8 Toshiba satellite but it doesn't seem to support an animation I made that is a .avi file. I need a solution soon because I was planning on uploading to youtube on my friends account.
 If you can, can you please send a video response. Thankyou

                    After you search for a file and you find it, how do you find its original file location in the address bar?&nbsp; I think I used to be able to do this by right clicking and clicking "open file location," but now it's not there anymore.&nbsp; Any ideas?

<span>Hi Foljiny,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Without selecting the file, you may not get the option&nbsp;<strong>Open File location.
</strong>So I would suggest you to first select the file then right click and choose Open file location.</span></p>
<p>
<span>There are two ways to check the file location of the searched files.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select the file and Right click on the
 file</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Choose&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Open File location</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On the search result page, click the
 arrow next to the Views button<span>&nbsp;</span>on the toolbar.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click a view or move the slider to&nbsp;<strong>Details.</strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>You can see the file loaction under folder.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues using Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the methods.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode and then perform clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a. When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<strong>Shift key</strong> when clicking the <strong>Restart button.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. The next screen will present you with three options. Click
<strong>Troubleshoot.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>c. Next, hit <strong>
Advanced</strong> options followed by <strong>Windows Startup Settings</strong> from the next screen.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, you’ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>F4 for Safe Mode
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>For more information you may refer to the article mentioned below.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>Windows Startup
 Settings (including safe mode)</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps
 eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>

</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. It will scan your system files
 and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>

            <p>I have this problem with two of the four PC's I upgraded from Win 7 to 10. All are ASUS i5/i7 MB's with SSD boot drives. The login prompt comes up very promptly after the BIOS startup, but the&nbsp; screen then goes to "Welcome" with the rotating thingi for 10
 -15 seconds before the desktop appears. On the other two PC's the desktop come up almost instantaneously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled all the possible culprits in Task Manager StartUp, and done the same in Autoruns to no avail. Interestingly these same two PC's both have the same shutdown problem. You have to click shift &nbsp;Shut Down otherwise the PC reboots itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really like a solution if someone has one.</p>
