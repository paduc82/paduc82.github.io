<h2>            &#34;Renew Gold Now&#34; Message won&#39;t clear.</h2>
                    <p>My gold membership was running out towards the beginning of Sept. and I renewed with a prepaid card before it expired. Now on the xbox itself at the home screen and the guide screen the remainder message won't go away. I tried a hard reset but that didn't clear it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When reporting such problem it's important to mention where your driver comes from and which version of the driver you have tried to install as nobody can guess. Providing this information avoid inappropriate suggestions from people who try to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not having this information I would suggest you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go through article <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725873(v=ws.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Code 43: Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems</a></li><li>If necessary go to the <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
AMD Graphics Drivers &amp; Software</a> page to download the appropriate driver for your graphic card. Note that at the top right of the page there is an
<strong>Automatically Detect and Install</strong> section</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p><span><span>Hi
</span><span>ekkieleigh,</span></span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for visiting Windows Vista Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>We would like to get a little more information from you to help troubleshoot your issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Please answer the following questions as best you can.<br />
1. Do you have any security software or non Microsoft firewall running on the computer?<br />
2. When did the issue start on the computer?<br />
3. Did you make any software changes on the computer?<br />
<br />
It sounds like the security settings are changed on the computer. I would recommend you to restore the security settings to default. To do this, follow these steps.<br />
Open the following link and click on Microsoft Fix it and run it successfully: </span>

<br />
<span>Try resetting the Internet Explorer settings to default as well. To do this, follow these steps.<br />
1. Click Start, type inetcpl.cpl and then hit enter.<br />
2. On ‚ÄúInternet Properties‚Äù window, click Advanced tab, click Reset button, click Reset button once again, click Close and then click OK button to close the ‚ÄúInternet Properties‚Äù window.</span></p>
<p><span>Visit the following link and run Microsoft Fix it to automatically reset the settings:
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</span></span></a></p>
<p><span>Once you have reset the Internet Explorer settings to default, then try to connect to the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span>For your reference, I‚Äôm adding some links those talk about.<br />
1. Troubleshoot Internet connection problems.<br />
</span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-us/help/fc58605e-a2be-470c-95b3-6808a76347991033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-us/help/fc58605e-a2be-470c-95b3-6808a76347991033.mspx</span></span></a><br />

    <title>Did upgrading to Windows 10 cause my Office 2013 to deactivate&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Did upgrading to Windows 10 cause my Office 2013 to deactivate&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Did upgrading to Windows 10 deactivate Microsoft Office 2013?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a computer with Windows 8 on it 2 years ago. Since then I have been using Microsoft Office 2013 with no problems. I upgraded to Windows 10 and in the past month I have been receiving count down messages when I use Word that my product is set
 to expire in xxxx of days. Today it expired and Word now only works as a read only program. I tried to reactivate it but I received a notification saying I needed the product key. I don't have the product key. In a conversation I had with Microsoft (in which
 they said there was nothing they could do), they suggested I contact HP, the maker of my PC, to see if they had the product key since I know I did purchase a subscription (there is no record of it in my Microsoft account) and I don't remember downloading or
 installing Office at the time I set up my computer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I called HP and with my product information, they confirmed that indeed, Windows and Office came pre-installed. HP offered to retrieve the product key on my computer for me for $99. They also said that Windows 10 had caused Office 2013 to be deactivated.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I did a search and found a tool to retrieve my product keys. Two keys were found for Windows 10 and for Windows OEM. The key for Windows OEM didn't work and I received a message from Microsoft saying that: The Product Key entered was not recognized as a valid
 Product Key. Please check the characters entered and try again. You may need to use www.office.com/setup instead to download your new Office product. Or you may be entering a Product Key for an older version of Office that uses a different download site. If
 you need further assistance, please contact support to get additional information.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I contacted Microsoft Tech help again with my new information and they said I need to contact Microsoft Office Help. I did and I re-explained the problem to them. They said I should contact HP. When I asked if there was anything else I could do there was a
 long wait and then the call terminated (I was hung up on.).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
At one point it was suggested that the problem was related to a problem with the upgrade process not with Windows 10 itself. I did have problems upgrading and had to contact Microsoft to upgrade a second time.<br />
<br />
Is there anything else I can do to get my Office 2013 back?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks for any suggestions or help in advance.</p>

            <p>Shame on HP &amp; Microsoft. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid your only choice is to pay $99 to HP to get a 2013 product key or purchase 2016 office for $150. If you do choose HP I would get the key and then write letter to HP CEO letting him/her know that this is last HP device that you intend to purchase.
 Paying $99 ransom for product key is pretty low.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 I had to re-install office 2013 due to problem with activation. Luck was with me since I had purchased office 2013 from Amazon prime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. locate&nbsp;C:\Windows.old, this is where old Windows folder files are stored</p>
<p>2. Now locate and copy C:\Windows.old\WINDOWS\System32\spp\store</p>
<p>3. Make sure all your Office apps are closed, and paste the above folder to&nbsp;C:\Windows\System32\spp\store</p>
<p>4. Restart your computer</p>
<p>5. Your Office products should be activated again!</p>

<h2>            BACKGROUND THEME</h2>
                    <p>Just upgraded my laptop to windows 10.&nbsp; Personalized background theme all ok.&nbsp; But then found that my desktop PC background theme had changed to the same one as my laptop.&nbsp; Not what I wanted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then reset my PC background theme only to find that it changed on my laptop also. Hubby uses the desktop PC and prefers a different background theme to me.&nbsp; But I cannot work out how to stop any change on one affecting the other. Can anyone help.</p>

    <title>Xbox Live Gold Annual Subscription - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> songfulstew0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Gold Annual Subscription</h2>
                    <p>We purchased an Annual Subscription card for my son's account prior to the end of his annual subscription and waited for the notice to pop up saying that it needed to be renewed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just realised that this hasn't happened because he has a 90 day extension to his current subscription due to the announced price increase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming that the 12 month subscription card will still give him 12 months of subscription when we need to add it in August even though it was purchased prior to the price change being announced but I would be grateful if someone can confirm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Time you redeem via prepaid cards is fully added to whatever time is left on your son's account (up to 36 months).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for example if your son has still 3 months of Gold left on his account, and you add a 12 month card, your son has 15 months of gold on his account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or if your son has an active subscription, and his subscription would renew in 3 months from now, and you add the 12 month card, the prepaid card will "pause" his subscription, activate 12 months, and after the 12 months of the card are over, the subscription
 will continue with the remaining 3 months, and your son will have to be billed again in 15 months from now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there really is no need to wait until you redeem prepaid cards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, since some promotional cards have an expiry date on them, I heartily recommend to redeem prepaid cards as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But keep in mind, that you can have only up to 36 month of Gold or Game Pass time on your account.&nbsp;</p>

            yes, you still have the 12 months since it's a prepaid card. Plus, you can also redeem it now since xbox live gold subscriptions can be stacked up to 36 months.

<div>Are you planning on redistributing Windows 7 or other Microsoft software to others such as by giving it away or reselling it?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you're not a reseller or involved in redistributing Microsoft products to third-parties, then you probably don't have to worry.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>However, if you want to buy Windows 7 and give it away as a gift to your kids for a birthday or some such, you could find yourself in legal hot water.&nbsp; You would not be allowed to distribute it to your children without official
 authorization from Microsoft.</div>

<h2>            Problem with payment of xbox game pass for pc</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to pay xbox game pass for pc. Immediately began to give an error, as in the screenshot, only the date was different.
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac47dc83-bb4c-4cd9-8da5-973e8216e156?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac47dc83-bb4c-4cd9-8da5-973e8216e156?upload=true" /></a></p>
Then a notice arrived that the money was written off.
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6105203c-bdb0-41f7-8bf9-533f1e4e57fd?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6105203c-bdb0-41f7-8bf9-533f1e4e57fd?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>The game pass has not been activated, but now offers to buy a month for $ 5. When you try to pay, it gives the same error. I tried to pay with different cards and paypal account. The result is the same.</p>

<h2>            Resetting security settings for hard drive partitions</h2>
                    <div>I was fiddling with the settings under the security tab of the properties for one of my hard drive partitions and inadvertently deprived myself of access to its contents. I've tried to do a system restore, to no effect; is there any way for me to restore
 the default settings of the partition?</div>
I deleted the "Users" and "Authenticated Users" under the security tab in Properties for my E: drive; is there a way to go about re-creating them or to undo the change?

    <title>Problems logging into Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems logging into Skype</h2>
                    Question for MS IT: for some reason I got logged out of my Skype account last week and cannot log back in. It tells me "There is a problem with your Microsoft account. To fix this, sign in to account.live.com from a browser". Since I do neither have the
 old email nor the old phone number that I used to create the account many years ago anymore, I have to then go through a long questionnaire. I answered that very diligently and am confident I got all of the questions right but then receive an email from Microsoft
 telling me that my account could not be verified! I don't know what to do anymore, can somebody from Microsoft IT please help me unlock the account. This is ridiculous, it's even easier to get into online banking than to unlock a Skype account. Thank you

<div>
<p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I am sorry to hear of this experience. Please be informed that in order for you to gain access to your account, you will be needing to recover it first and that is through answering the recovery form.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>However, if you were able to do it and received an email reply that your account cannot be recovered. I can only suggest to try and fill out the form again, please make sure you do not leave blank fields and answer as many information as you can.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>But in case you get the same email reply, please do check the private message I sent you.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the same problem. I have never had a Microsoft account. I have always used Skype only. Skype was set up in such way that it opened up automatically whenever I started my tablet. Today, when I opened my tablet, I was asked to log into Skype but I do
 not remember my password or the e-mail address or the phone number I used when setting up the Skype account about two years ago. I tried to recover my password but it has not worked. It always brings me to a page where I am asked to recover my Microsoft account.
 But I have never had a Microsoft account and am not interested in having one. The only thing I want is to be able to log into my Skype account again. I filled out the recovery form several times and it does not help. It also doesn't help that there is no way
 to contact Skype support directly. No direct e-mail address or phone number. It's all about the "Community." Very disappointing and frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know my Skype name and can provide my personal details, including DOB, address, some of the contacts from my Skype account, etc. I hope someone can help me retrieve my password, so that I can log into my old Skype account. I don't want to create a new
 one since I would lose all my conversations and photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your advice,</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If you are being routed to Microsoft page whenever you try to reset your password, it is possible that you're logged in using your email address. To further check it, can you please try to do a password reset again using the steps below?</p>
<p>

<p>1. Access this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a></p>
<p>2. And provide your Skype name then click Continue.</p>
<p>3. Once routed to the&nbsp;Recover details page, click <strong>Reset password</strong> button.</p>
<p>4. Choose I forgot password and click Next.</p>
<p>5. Type your Skype name if it was not automatically provided, then type the captcha and click Next.</p>
<p>6. You will be then routed to&nbsp;We need to verify your identity page, choose which security method would you like to receive the verification code then click Next.</p>
<p><strong>If you choose email address:</strong> provide your email address.</p>
<p><strong>If you choose mobile number:</strong> provide the last 4 digits of your mobile number.</p>
<p>7. Then post the code and enter your new password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know if this works or if you get the same error.</p>

            Hello.&nbsp; I signed up for Skype and have a Skype account with a phone number and account credit I paid for that I am not able to access any more.&nbsp; I was just recently required to sign in through Microsoft.&nbsp; However, at the time, I didn't know what I was
 doing and I ended up creating a Microsoft account.&nbsp; I always logged into Skype with my email address.&nbsp; My Microsoft account is now registered to the same email address.&nbsp; I cannot recover Skype because Microsoft thinks im logging into Microsoft and not Skype.&nbsp;
 Please help me recover my Skype account and phone number so that I can use it again.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; This is so frustrating and ridiculous.

            Hi Suzanne, 
<br />
<br />Unplug your PC and if it is a laptop, remove the battery 
<br />
<br />Press and hold the Power button for 30 seconds 
<br />
<br />Plug your PC back in and if it is a laptop, replace the Battery 
<br />
<br />Start your PC and see if it boots into Windows 
<br />
<br />If not, let's see if we can get into the Windows Recovery Environment: 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset
        </p>

            Hi Suzanne.  I"m Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />Unplug power and remove battery, press and hold power button for 30 seconds to release all power from circuitry, plug back in and power up to see if any change.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.  If one of these methods work, then go to Step 3.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC following the steps in the middle of the downloads page here:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>  Make sure to uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose only the licensed version.
<br />
<br />If the Media Creation Tool will not cooperate use the alternate download site at <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn‚Äôt fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn‚Äôt work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   You can also try System Restore to a point before the problem began.  
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media or Repair Mode  Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Corrupt file causing hard drive crash</h2>
                    I have an internal Seagate ST9500423AS that seems to have a corrupt file that causes the hard drive to crash
<div>The file used to contain steam games but got corrupt recently. I can delete and copy files from the hard drive but if I even hover over the corrupt files name the hard drive will crash causing the laptop to hang for about 10 seconds</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there anyway to remove the file without causing the hard drive to crash? I have tried Chkdsk but it gets to a certain point and freezes there</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>EDIT: It seems running a chkdsk and not being impatient fixed the issue. One of my game folders became corrupted and froze up the hard drive</div>

    <title>Qualcomm Atheros AR956x Wireless Network adapter and Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deb_o  say:</h3>
<h2>            Qualcomm Atheros AR956x Wireless Network adapter and Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Are you coming to the conclusion that your wifi network adapter (specifically the Qualcomm Atheros AR956x) is faulty because Windows trouble shooter cannot resolve your wifi connectivity issues? I was. I finally found a driver that seems to have solved the
 problem. See link below.</p>
<p>
My Windows 10 laptop (an Acer Aspire) repeatedly lost its ability to connect to my Wifi network. If I restarted my router it would work until the next time the laptop slept, hibernated or shut down. The trouble shooter could never resolve the issue and the
 so-called search for updated drivers always told me I had the latest one. I spent hours trying every so-called solution posted on this and other forums to resolve this issue with no success. After trying various search parameters for drivers I finally found
 a link to the driver that solved my problem. (Atheros was the key, not Qualcomm.)

<p>
</p><p>(It seems that the forum truncates the appearance of links, so here is the link in text form:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.atherosddrivers.com/2017/09/atheros-ar956x-wireless-network-adapter.html&nbsp; )</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know why Windows does not find this driver when searching for updated drivers for the AR956x.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed it yesterday so it's still early days but so my laptop has seamlessly resumed it's wifi connection after shut-down, sleep and hibernation. It was so great this morning to discover I did not have to restart the router to get the laptop back online!
 Hope this helps a bunch of you folks out!</p>

<p>Don't know, restless so i am answering. On Ps4 each save file is 16MB. Including the profile save and the 2 auto save's. So far game save space is 184 MB so i would recommend game save file management for xbox one too. I usually have 4 save files on a regular
 basis, one before missions one after and one before certain objectives. </p>

<h2>            Transferring photos from phone to PC</h2>
                    Before I downloaded Windows 10 for my PC, I was able to plug my phone into it via a USB cable, navigate to the folder within 'My Computer' containing all the photos I've taken with my phone's camera (a DCIM folder), and copy and paste them to my computer.
 Now with Windows 10, I have navigated through every single available folder, and my photos are nowhere to be found (the DCIM folder is empty). The 'import photos' feature of Windows 10 only shows a selection of my photos, the ones that I have shared via WhatsApp
 or Viber. Where are all my photos, and how can I copy them to my computer? Thanks in advance for your help.

            <p>Hi Rhen</p>
<p>Many thanks for your reply. If I understand your questions correctly, yes, I believe my computer is recognising my phone, as it appears in the devices list under 'This PC' when plugged in. However, it seems that my computer is not recognising all the files
 (i.e. my photos) on my phone, as they are not appearing in any of the available folders. As I mentioned, I did not have this problem before 'upgrading' to Windows 10. Do you know how to make my photos 'discoverable' to my computer? Just FYI, I have an android
 phone, an HTC One M8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>
<p>Emily</p>

            <p>Hi Emily, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With regard to your concern, we suggest that you visit HTC's support site and download the updated driver for your phone. You can also try using the HTC Sync Manager to transfer photos.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes. </p>

            <p>Hi Mark</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your suggestion. I have downloaded the HTC Sync Manager for my laptop, updated my phone's drivers, and synced the contents of my laptop with Sync Manager. Now when I connect my phone all of my pictures appear as a list under 'camera shots'
 (although there are no thumbnails and when I click on a file name the picture doesn't display). However, when I select the photos I want to copy (by date), right click, select 'copy to computer' then choose the folder I want to copy them in to, nothing happens.
 I get a message to say 'Library updated. 0 file has been copied to folder'. If I try to copy to a new album I get an error message: 'Unable to create album. There was a problem creating this album'. What shall I try next?!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Emily&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>No, my photos have not copied to the Pictures folder, and dragging and dropping to either my desktop or the Pictures folder doesn't work either (nothing happens).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            HELP&#33; DVD&#47;CD-ROM drive not working&#33;</h2>
                    HELP! I've used the Microsoft Fix It, I've scoured the community forums and have followed links here and there, I even followed this one: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/929461 which requires you to edit your registry! STILL, no success!<br />
<br />
Yesterday the Windows Vista Update ran, all was A-OKAY and hunky dory (or so I thought). After I turned off the computer, ran some errands, the DVD/CD-rom disk will not work! When I try to run an installed program which requires a disk (like a video game) I
 receive the message "Cannot locate the CD-ROM: Please insert the correct CD-ROM, select OK and restart program" even though the disk is in the computer. When I try to insert media, the auto run will not ... well ... run! I went into the file COMPUTER and located
 2 things; underneith the bit where it sais "Devices with Removable Storage" I found one D:\ RW Drive which told me that the device was not found, and to the right a similer menu which told me to "Insert a Disc" when I clicked D:\ RW.
<br />
<br />
I looked under DEVICE MANAGER to take a gander at my drivers and located my DVD/CD-ROM driver and it told me the device was working properly - HOWEVER, when I ran Microsoft Fix It it told me something different. It told me my Class Filters are corrupt, Device
 Filter Drivers are Corrupt, Device is not working properly, Drive is disabled, Drive is not assigned a drive letter. Now this is all hunky dory but I don't speak computer, and I'd like to UN-DISABLE and UN-CORRUPT everything!<br />
<br />
I've already done a system restore, and followed the link which requires you to go into your registry and delete the filters. It's a gateway computer, I've already spoken to gateway and they told me to do a Factory Restore (which I haven't done yet because
 I'd like to see if there's a way of fixing this issue without uninstalling EVERYTHING on my computer).<br />
<br />
I really hope this isn't a lost cause. Help me Microsoft, you're my only hope.<br />

<p>Try this step for your DVD drive problem:<br />
<br />
Delete the UpperFilters registry entry:</p>
<p>Click Start, on the search field, type regedit, and then press Enter.&nbsp; Registry Editor starts.</p>

<p>3. Expand Control, and then expand Class.</p>
<p>4. Under Class, click {4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}.</p>
<p>5. In the right pane (topic area), click UpperFilters.</p>
<p>Note An UpperFilters.bak registry entry may also appear.&nbsp; To delete the UpperFilters registry entry, you must click UpperFilters and not UpperFilters.bak.</p>
<p>6. On the Edit menu, click Delete.</p>
<p>7. When you receive the following message, click Yes to confirm the deletion of the UpperFilters registry entry:<br />
Are you sure you want to delete this value?</p>

<p>Note Do not exit Registry Editor. You must have this program for the next step.</p>
<p>Delete the LowerFilters registry entry</p>
<p>1. In Registry Editor, expand My Computer, and then expand HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.</p>
<p>2. Expand SYSTEM, and then expand CurrentControlSet.</p>
<p>3. Expand Control, and then expand Class.</p>

<p>8. Exit Registry Editor.</p>
<p>After you have you deleted the corrupt registry, you will need to reinstall the driver by following the step below.</p>

<p>2. Click on Device Manager at the left side of the window.</p>
<p>3. Click on the + next to CD/DVD DRIVES</p>
<p>4. The + sign will become a - sign and you may have a list of multiple drivers that drop down below. If so, each driver will need to be removed one at a time.</p>
<p>To remove a driver simply point the mouse to the driver, right click the mouse one time, and choose 'Uninstall.'</p>
<p>5. Continue to remove these drivers until there is no longer a heading for CD/DVD DRIVES.</p>
<p>6. Then look for IDE/ATA/ATAPI controllers and repeat the same steps to remove all of them as you did for the CD/DVD drives.</p>
<p>Note: When asked to restart, do not until all are uninstalled</p>
<p>7. The heading IDE/ATA/ATAPI controller will not disappear and all the controllers may not disappear after being uninstalled</p>
<p>8. Click on the X in the upper-right hand corner of the DEVICE MANAGER window.</p>
<p>9. Restart the system, and let Windows reload the correct drivers.</p>
<p>10. Test if the issue is resolve.<br />
