<h2>            A network cable is not properly plugged in or may be broken</h2>
                    First of all, hello! So I have a Lenovo IdeaPad U510 for 2 years and all of a suddden it refuses to connect to internet. When I troubleshoot it shows this message: "A network cable is not properly plugged in or may be broken"....i use a wireless router
 so i dont see why is that problem, my phone connects to wifi without a problem and so does my TV...yesterday i restarted my laptop and the internet worked for an hour or so then it disconnected again, now it doesnt even work anymore and when i try to troubleshoot
 again it just freezes. What is the problem and how can I solve it?<br />

<h2>            Look and feel of Win 7, XP emulation mode</h2>
                    I guess I'm old and don't like change.&nbsp; I just bought a new Win 7 laptop after having a Win XP Professional laptop for years.&nbsp; I do NOT care about XP emulation from the standpoint of older programs running under Win 7.&nbsp; I want to know if the emulation
 mode visually can be made to look EXACTLY like Windows XP, including the "classic" mode?&nbsp; Things like ability to view thumbnails in any folder easily in Windows Explorer is what I miss or the Win 98 vertical column in the Start menu.&nbsp; It seems as though functions
 in Win 7 are hidden or moved to&nbsp;different places just because they "could."

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>Sorry there's not a direct way, but I'd love to help with some ideas. &nbsp;For your specific example (thumbnails in any folder), you can click the Size slider at the top-right and choose the size of thumbnail icon you want. Instead of just "on or off" like XP,
 you can choose how big you want the thumbnails, but essentially its the same. &nbsp;It's not labeled, so<a href="http://www.windows7taskforce.com/thumb/Suggestion_View_Mode2.png/x/560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here's a picture of what I'm talking about</a>.</p>
<p>The vertical column Start menu is gone, but there are 3rd party replacements that mimick the "Windows 98" style of a single column. &nbsp;I personally prefer and greatly value the enhanced Windows 7 Start Menu (especially that search box at the bottom), but I
 realize that one size never fits all. &nbsp;If you're interested, this program is called<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Classic Shell</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a program from Star Dock called <a href="http://www.stardock.com/products/windowblinds/downloads.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Window Blinds</a>, which can "skin" your entire system to look totally different (or in this case, totally classic). &nbsp;I used it for years back in the Windows 2000 and XP days, and this company has even built apps<em>on behalf of Microsoft</em>&nbsp;for inclusion
 in Windows Vista and 7. &nbsp;It's not free, but it has a trial that you can try out if you want to give it a shot (although again I'm fairly in love with Windows 7 as-is).</p>
<p>I know many of the changes seem like "change for change sake", but it depends on perspective. &nbsp;Windows 7 is actually a culmination of many hundreds and thousands of users sending feedback (during the XP and Vista days) saying "why can't it do this.." or
 "I want it to do this...", and Windows 7 is what resulted. &nbsp;Again, one size never fits everyone, but Windows 7 is arguably the most user-minded version so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi EPHARP and thanks for posting. <br />
<br />
If you have an option to boot to CD-Rom why are you trying to boot to an external device? If your internal CD-Rom is not working then yes you will need to boot to an external device of some kind. If you do not see this option then you will need to contact your
 OEM to see if there are any BIOS options available to you to boot to USB media devices.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps! Please post back and let us know the status of your issue.

<br />
Thank you for your answer.&nbsp; Even though their is a CD/ROM option in the boot device list I don't have an internal CD/ROM on this semi stripped down IBM Thinkpad X30.&nbsp;
<br />
IBM did not have an answer other then marking the USB BIOS boot option, but a USB device does&nbsp;not show up on a list.&nbsp; The removeable device boot option I thought should work,<br />
but I am still hung up. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks again. <br />

Thanks for replying. Have you tested the media to make sure that it boots on another computer? If not please attempt to do this to rule out any issues with the media itself.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!

            Hello Shawn <br />
<br />
Yes I have and am currently able to run this media device on other PC's.&nbsp; I was able to use this device prior to the invalid Boot.ini file.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am even able to use it during this failing boot process&nbsp;when I use a software product(that is used for backup of
 the&nbsp;hard drive)&nbsp;that does cause an interupt during the boot.&nbsp; SO I am just not able to force it to boot from the XP CD.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The drive is able to work during the boot if the CD is forcing an interupt, but just not able to point it there.<br />
<br />
I'm pulling my hair out on this one.&nbsp;<br />

            Hi EPHARP, <br />
<br />
Thanks for replying. If the CD-ROM is not booting when selected in the BIOS, the next thing I would look for is an option on startup to select boot device. If you do see that option, and the device is not listed in the device options then you will need to contact
 IBM to see what options you have available to you to boot to the CD-ROM. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

            I've had the same problem for several days. I finally resolved it today. I've tried every thing from deleting boot.ini, bootcfg /rebuild, to using the mbr commands. Nothing worked.<br />
<br />
Finally, I used gpart setting all the data as unallocated and XP SP2 installed properly and rebooted, and installed.<br />

<p>Hello Steve</p>
<p>Thank you for responding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am unfamilar with <strong>gpart</strong>,&nbsp; where do you set it?&nbsp;&nbsp; When you say it unallocates all the data, do you mean all the data on the hard drive, to include user data?&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is a command, how to I get an interupt to
 enter it?&nbsp;I get the invalid boot.ini errer, I then&nbsp;am unable to force a DOS prompt during the boot process, it goes state to starting windows and then fails.&nbsp; The only thing I can do before windows start up enter/edit the BIOS setting and enter the temporary
 boot selection but can not force the boot to the external CD drive that uses the USB port.&nbsp; Please help, I either have to get this fixed soon or buy a whole new laptop. (Which I can not afford!!)</p>

<h2>            Restrict access to e-mail without logging out</h2>
                    <p>I have set up my computer with local account (standars user) without password to make the pc boot straight to my desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to use the calendar app but microsoft bundles it with mail and contacts as well. I don't want to allow anyone access to my emails but i can't restrict them. I have turned off mail and contacts sync but anyone can turn them on without admin pasword
 and gain access to my inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why oh why are those 3 things bundled? To be honest, i'm not even comfortable giving microsoft access to my inbox but they demand it if you want to use calendar app.</p>
                </div>

</p><p><span>Thank you for coming back to us with the current status.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To assist you better, I would like to know do you have a user account which is working?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have a user account which is working. I suggest you to log-in using that user account and try running Microsoft safety scanner. If a computer is infected by a virus, lots of resources will be taken up to greatly slow down computer performance.
 To run virus scan (<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>) click on the below link:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, I recommend you to delete the created new user account, it seems like the account is infected.</span></p>

<p><span>Thank you for your time and effort.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s try different steps and check if this helps. I would suggest you to disable or uninstall anti-virus program and try running safety scanner in Private mode (Internet explorer).
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>NOTE:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If
 you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></p>

                    <p>Has anyone else recently ran into issues with Xbox Live Gold Sharing in your house?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have 2 Xbox One Consoles (Son #1 and Son #2 both have one in their rooms).&nbsp; We have a total of 3 Xbox Gamertags.&nbsp; I have one and they have their own.&nbsp; Son #1's Xbox One is set as my gamertags "Home Console" which used to allow Son #2 to use Xbox Live
 from his room on his gamertag but now that doesn't appear to be working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the reason it's telling him he needs to signup for Gold because my gamertag which has the Xbox Live subscription is not signed into that console?&nbsp; Do I need to be signed into that console in order for him to get the benefits when he's signed into his
 gamertag?</p>

            <p>I was able to open the windows store by using the following method provided by Microsoft customer support:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can run the Windows store apps troubleshooter on Windows 10.&nbsp; Follow the steps to perform System maintenance trouble shooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press Windows + X keys on the keyboard and select Control Panel.</p>
<p>Type Troubleshooting in the search bar on the Control Panel.</p>
<p>Click on View all on the left navigation pane.</p>
<p>Click on Windows store apps.</p>
<p>Click on Advanced on the Windows store apps dialog box and click on Run as administrator (enter the credentials if required).</p>
<p>Click on Next and follow onscreen instruction complete the Windows store apps troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I had was successfully downloading any app on my screen.&nbsp; I was left in limbo after the download as if it got in a loop and couldn't get out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the next day, the apps appeared in my start up menu.&nbsp; So, I guess it worked but just took extra time before I got them.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 File Explorer Search Wildcard Characters Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lostinspace88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 File Explorer Search Wildcard Characters Not Working</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to locate filenames as I used to do so easily in Windows XP.&nbsp; I tried using simple wildcards,
<strong>*</strong> (match any number of characters) and <strong>?</strong> (match any character in a specific position), but these seem to have been deleted.&nbsp; Nothing fancy, these are just pretty universal wildcard characters that have been supported on various
 operating systems and even the on Internet for several decades.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh well, so I eventually found this link: <strong>https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa965711%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</strong></p>
<p>which explained the somewhat misnamed <strong>Advanced Query System</strong> or AQS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally, <strong>met*.pdf</strong> failed to find the files I was seeking.&nbsp; Then,
<strong>met *.pdf</strong> (note the placement of the space) only matched files that had a space
<em>before</em> the string 'met.'&nbsp; You will note that <strong>met*</strong> should actually only match filenames that begin with "met," but such fine distinctions are utterly lost on AQS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to AQS, if I'm up for more typing (instead of simply clicking a checkbox as I could before) and bin any notion of a wildcard character, I can type:
<strong>filename:met ext:pdf</strong>.&nbsp; To be fair, I can also type <em>name</em> instead of
<em>filename</em>.&nbsp; I get a sea of filenames containing "met"; but the desired files are still not found!&nbsp; It is finding some files in subdirectories--the&nbsp;<em>All subfolders</em>&nbsp;option being selected--but not the ones I seek and have confirmed are there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using the pull-down <em>Other Properties</em> filter, but it is difficult to know what is selected, because no checkmarks are displayed next to your selection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has nothing to do with indexing, hidden files, or age of files -- the files were created within the past 2 weeks on this very computer --&nbsp;and I have clicked every non-indexed option.&nbsp; These are not even system files, at least
<em>pdf</em>s were not considered such under XP, but who knows with Windows 10?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searching just does not seem to work as one would expect it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What on earth is going on?&nbsp; Prior to posting this, I checked a number of links to discover that this 'advancement' has been going on and complained about since Windows 7.&nbsp; Still no fixes by Windows 10.&nbsp; If it weren't for fellow posters, I would feel like
 I was testing a Beta release or something.&nbsp; No, not that either, Windows just ran a rather lengthy Windows Update this morning.</p>

            <p>Well things are fixed in that it works as documented. &nbsp;At least, unless something is broken. &nbsp;Clearly something busted up on yours because met*.pdf is a very valid search string and should find things like metclub.pdf or whatever.</p>

            <p>Thanks, again, @LtCmdrKeene.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the "<strong>Control Panel Troubleshooter</strong>" (entering that string in the Windows Search was the quickest way to find it) and ran the
<strong>Search and indexing</strong> option, twice.&nbsp; For some reason, even though I am the only user, I am not, by default, an Administrator.&nbsp; Anyway, I ran it both as a User and an Administrator, and it came up negative.&nbsp; As that might solve some people's
 problems, I include it here.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7515e83d-f722-4b10-bc24-3ccd91e66590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7515e83d-f722-4b10-bc24-3ccd91e66590" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What actually SOLVED my problem was having another poke around the various View and Options windows.&nbsp; I found this one under the File Explorer window:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8aa8adb2-ef0e-4dc2-9774-ce3c30efdf8c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8aa8adb2-ef0e-4dc2-9774-ce3c30efdf8c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c42f397a-e56a-47cf-8b0c-45c13fa62d8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c42f397a-e56a-47cf-8b0c-45c13fa62d8d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that the option for <strong>Searching in file folders for system files</strong>&nbsp;had been left unchecked.&nbsp; Even though I would never have considered a PDF a system file, nor is the folder (D:\Documents\Personal) in any way stored under systems files,&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">nonetheless,
 checking that box magically made the sought after files appear!</span></strong>&nbsp; And this works both with wildcards, * and ?, as well as AQS instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to locate this window is a bit tricky via the Windows search (next to the Windows icon), but I did manage it with "<strong>Search Options</strong>".&nbsp; Adding the word "File" or "File Explorer" confused it, returning only Web results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps Windows 10 considers the use of wildcard characters an automatic search for systems files?&nbsp; If so, it does not explain why they would not appear with the simple AQS search or&nbsp;other odd results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Curiously, prior to this, I had tried using the <strong>File Explorer &gt;&nbsp;Search &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Change indexed locations</strong> to ensure that all volumes --&nbsp;except those folders on the C: drive that Windows considers protected systems files -- were
 INCLUDED in my indexing.&nbsp; <em>NOTE: You must have something typed into your search box or at least activated a dropdown there for the Search tab to even appear.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d135d29-6648-44a6-bc30-038574a416b2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d135d29-6648-44a6-bc30-038574a416b2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This did nothing</span>, nor did having ALL of the search "<strong>In non-indexed locations</strong>" checkboxes activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So my advice is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>TURN INDEXING OFF</strong></span>!&nbsp; Searches might be slower, but they're at least accurate.&nbsp; Windows 10 search indexing (or default out-of-the-box file searching) simply&nbsp;doesn't seem to be
 working as advertised.</p>

<p>Dear Boulder_Man,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your input, but as I posted, I managed to <strong>solve</strong> the problem in (unique to Windows 10?),
<strong>by turning the indexing option off, even though I'm not searching for system files.</strong>&nbsp; That forces it to search through the actual file directories, rather than some out of date index list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I am not allowed to mark my own answer as "Mark as Answer" or even "Helpful."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure which version of Windows you are using, but <em>there definitely is a field specifier,
<strong>"name:"</strong></em>&nbsp; I use it quite often.&nbsp; It searches the filename&nbsp;field, which appears to have been renamed 'Name' in Windows 10 (possibly an earlier version).&nbsp; See the first field in the image above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I tested your tilde suggestion, but it didn't work.&nbsp; From earlier Windows Search releases, the tilde (undocumented) seems to ensure that wildcard characters, such as asterisks,&nbsp;are treated as wildcards and not actual characters.&nbsp; But that actually isn't

            I, too, have used "name:" and have doubly confirmed that it is an accepted token in Windows 10 because it is highlighted in the search box just as other known tokens (e.g., System.FileName) are.

<p>Thanks LostInSpace88.&nbsp; Turning indexing off allows use of wildcard * and single character ? as expected, but slows the search also as expected.&nbsp; With indexing on, any of the other suggestions on this thread such as ~" (how wierd!) simply did not work to
 represent the first N characters of the name.&nbsp; Obviously a huge and obvious bug.</p>
<p>This kind of thing makes me believe that Microsoft program engineers never use any of their own software. &nbsp;

            Does the application show up in your Start menu? Rather than simply delete it, see if there is an uninstall feature.
<br />
<br />Go to the makers site and see if they have an uninstall tool specifically for it. For example, many anti-malware makers have separate uninstall tools.

                    Hello i am experiencing this auto repair loop error. I dont really know how it started, but i believe it had to be some sort of update that caused this issue. I tried every option that the auto repair provided. I looked all over youtube for a fix and nothing

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to do the Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>

            Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click System Restore, see if you can go back to an earlier time.
<br />

<br />
<br />If that does not work, boot into the recovery environment, then click 'Go back to previous version of Windows'
<br />
<br />If that does not work.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.
