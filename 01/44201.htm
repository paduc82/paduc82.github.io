            <p>well I can't see any of my programs on my taskbar therefore need to always switch screens to find programs - so yes annoying but further to your point if windows says that an item is pinned to the taskbar and one can't see it &nbsp;- it affects the functionality&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Why won&#39;t Windows Live Movie Maker import my video properly&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skinkybob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why won&#39;t Windows Live Movie Maker import my video properly&#63;</h2>
                    I am trying to import and edit a movie clip on Windows Live Movie Maker, but it always gives me this message: "The video was not imported correctly. Verify that the digital video tape is not blank, and then try again." The tapes are fine, as I am watching
 them on the camera as they are supposed to be importing. I know that the firewire connection is working, because I'm able to rewind, stop, and play the film on the camera through Windows Live Movie Maker. For whatever reason, however, it simply will not capture.
 What is wrong?

Similar problems are common for sure but there are many <br />
variants and solving the issue can be tricky.<br />
<br />
I realize you stated that you know how to do it but are you<br />
using a combination of Live Photo Gallery and Live Movie <br />
Maker via a FireWire connection as described in the articles <br />
I posted for you?<br />
<br />

    <title>Search indexer does not find files in mapped drives - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephen_ford  say:</h3>
<h2>            Search indexer does not find files in mapped drives</h2>
                    <p>WinXP Pro, MS Office 2010</p>
<p>When searching for documents containing specific words, there are no results from my mapped drives.</p>
<p>The PC has two hard drives, C: &amp; D:</p>
<p>Folders on D: are mapped to H: &amp; K: and they contain many Word documents with .doc and .docx extensions.</p>
<p>Some of the folders are shared on a home network for access by another PC.</p>
<p>I have been very carefull to ensure that the included &amp; excluded locations are correct and have worked down the trees selecting and deselecting folders.</p>
<p>For example C: only indexes the folders Docs&amp;Settings\administrator and Docs&amp;Settings\&lt;My account&gt;</p>
<p>H: &amp; K: index all but&nbsp;an image folder in each one.</p>
<p>I have rebuilt the index and checked that the apporoprate file extensions have contents indexed. There are 6.2k files indexed which could be about right but if files are not being found becasue they are not being indexed then that number should increase
 by several thousand if the indexer can be made to process them.</p>
<p>It appears to me that files on the unmapped C-drive are found but not on the mapped drives.</p>
<p>I assume that I need to index K: to search it. I assume that if I just index D: but search K: there will be no matches.</p>

            <p>Hi. Thanks for your reply. I tried (1) but only confirmed that the indexer will no go near any folders associated with a mapped drive. I map drives for convenience and to enable sharing of Office templates, so removing them is not an option. I even deselected
 the drives and selected each top-level folder but with no change.</p>
<p>If I index the raw drive but search the mapped drives will search still find the files or do I have to search the raw drive?</p>
<p>I run a registry cleaner every couple of weeks but it improves the performance of the PC so much that it is not really an option to let Windows gum-up (as I see it) by not cleaning the registry.</p>
<p>I am trying (2) now...</p>

<p>Result: Search results as desired.</p>
<p>I tried all the suggestions above but the mapped drives did not appear to index.</p>

            <p>Search finds the data I need only&nbsp;if locations are included which are relative to primary drives.&nbsp; The indexer will not look at mapped drives but that is not a problem any more.</p>

            <p>I have just unmarked the answer to this question becasue it did not answer the question. I evolved a work-around which is not the same thing&nbsp;as an answer.</p>
<p>The problem remains.&nbsp;It seems that search indexer can't handle mapped drives but more annoyingly, there is no information about whether this is correct behaviour or not. If it's correct behaviour then why doesn't the indexer give an error message and prevent
 mapped drives from being added to the included list? If search indexer should be able to index mapped drives then why doesn't it?</p>
<p>Do I need an answer? Not particularly becasue I have a work-around but it might be interesteing to to be told why the indexer does not say that it will not process mapped drives...</p>

            <p>Yes that's interesting. Thanks. Even though the guy in the last link experienced the indexing working on a mapped drive, I have my doubts. Mine don't, even after rebuilding the index and having system privilege.</p>
<p>I was in fact waiting for someone just to confirm the obvious - to index mapped drives risks processing muliple instances of overlapping folders and so to prevent this happening, it appears that mapped drives are ignored, and that would be the safest restriction.</p>
<p>However, it would be nice&nbsp;if microsoft&nbsp; could just publsh the restriction (and the reason) instead of leaving the users to figure out the rules by trial and error.</p>

<em>Categories </em>view to either <em>Large icons </em>or <em>Small icons</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By doing this, the <em>Mail</em> entry will always appear when you open <em>Control panel</em> in future.</p>

<h3> samtcat01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reseting Surface RT and installation stops at 68&#37;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to reset my Surface RT after a recent update completely hosed my device. It wouldn't turn on and none of the less drastic actions would revive it. So, I decided to reset it using my recovery USB. Everything worked fine until I reached 68% and
 it just hangs. Even letting the reset run overnight, it is stuck at 68%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've even tried redoing this reset, but again it only makes it to 68% and hangs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how to complete the reset?</p>

            Hi  ProTechnologyUsers
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />First of all, Hyper-V is only available in Windows 10 Pro or higher edition.
<br />
<br />Virtualization needs to be enabled in your BIOS first in order for Windows 10 to detect it.
<br />
<br />You can see if your system has support by doing the following:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: msinfo32
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Click the System Summary tab
<br />Scroll to the bottom
<br />

 you can see that the VTx is enabled but programmes aren't detecting it... I searched in bing about it and found that it is caused by the credential security that is not available in my PC !! before some time, every programme were detecting VTx but I don't
 know from when it changed... PLEASE HELP !!</p>

            Looking at the type of CPU, the Core 2 Duo dates back to 2007 and might missing some low level processor instructions to enable full support under modern versions of Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Windows 8 in 2012 introduced some important processor requirements that left behind a lot of older processors. 
<br />
<br />Your best option might be to upgrade the motherboard the processor.

<br />Your motherboard is not compatible with some of the newer technologies in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />You should consider upgrading.

<h2>            Installing .NET Core SDK fails.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to install the .NET Core SDK version 2.2.203 (latest as of today), but the installation fails immediately with error, "User cancelled installation." with "Retry" and "Cancel" buttons. I did not cancel the installation. Clicking Retry immediately
 results in the same window appearing. I did run the installer as administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click "Cancel" I get a "Setup Failed" window with the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Setup Failed</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">One or more issues caused the setup to fail. Please fix the issues and then retry setup. For more information see the

<h2>            USB ports not showing up during printer install</h2>
                    I am trying to install a second printer, I have one installed in USB001. When I go to install it only shows the one USB port to install to, which is already occupied by the first printer. I have the other LPT and COM ports open but no USB. I have 4 slots
 on my computer, why is only one showing up? How can I add another port?

The offer on the console has disappeared from all dashboards for over a week now. The console pre-order was for a limited time anyway. You should still be able to preorder from any retailer or the Microsoft Store website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there Ninja,<br />
<br />
Glad you were able to find the Xbox One Preorder!<br />

Hope you enjoy all the awesome stuff that'll be coming out for that console. <br />

<p>I did not order through the dashboard. I'm wondering if I will get the achievement anyway at some point? I mean, I pre-ordered my Xbox One BEFORE anyone could even pre-order on the 360 dashboard. I don't get why your most loyal customers will miss out a
 special achievement because they pre-ordered from the "wrong" place.</p>

Lees voor je post ook eerst eens je eigen post na zodat je er zelf al 10 schrijffouten uit kan halen...<br />
Daarnaast moet je, je vraag duidelijk formuleren.<br />
<br />
We zien je gamertag, je zegt dat er iets mis is, maar je zegt nergens wat jij er mis aan vind of wat er mis is...<br />
<br />
We proberen het gewoon opnieuw, post even opnieuw duidelijk wat je probleem is! <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-21.gif" /><br />

    <title>Surface Dock and Samsung UE510 display - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matgra  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Dock and Samsung UE510 display</h2>
                    <p>When I connect my Surface Pro 4 to the Surface Dock and use a mini-displayport to HDMI cable to the Samsung UE510 display, it works for about 4 minutes then disconnects and the Surface can no longer see/detect any displays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disconnecting the Surface from the Dock and reconnecting doesn't work.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebooting the surface detects it again for about 4 mins.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled power save options - nothing changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connecting the mini-displayport cable directly to the Surface Pro works fine - lovely in fact.&nbsp; So the problem is the Surface Dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded and used the Surface Dock Updater tool&nbsp; and it claims I am running the latest firmware.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded the display reg file to flush the registry and restart the display config setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still nothing working properly - I need to have the display connected to the Surface Pro to get it to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is the dock doing any logic processing??&nbsp; Surely it just needs to convert digital signals from one port to another....</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Matgra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Windows may not&nbsp;install some updates for the new dock unless it’s attached when searching for updates. It's important that you make sure that the dock is connected to your Surface Pro 4 without a DisplayPort adapter&nbsp;attached when updating. If it doesn’t
 resolve the issue or your Surface tells you there are no updates to install, we suggest that you check for updated drivers and firmware for your monitor from the manufacturers website. Furthermore, if another one is available, you can change your Mini DisplayPort
 to HDMI adapter, and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give us an update, and let us know if you have additional concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
        </p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dock is permanently attached during any/all update processes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I still cant get the display to work with the Dock.&nbsp; I have changed to many different types of cable and nothing works via the dock.&nbsp; However all work when directly attached to the SP4.</p>
<p>

<p>Two things you might try if you<span>&nbsp;haven't&nbsp;</span>already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power cycle the dock by unplugging and replugging in the AC power cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plug the the sp4 side of the dock cable upside down into the sp4.</p>

<p>Thanks - tried both those things.....also tried deep power off cycle with everything unplugged from main supply and restarting.&nbsp;&nbsp; I notice too there were a few updates from MSFT for the Surface and related tech this weekend.&nbsp; So we'll see what happens but
 as of now, still using the mini-displayport on the SP4 itself.</p>

<h3> jjjjcc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I download and install Windows 7 pro with a product key and USB key &#40;no .iso or CD&#47;DVD&#41;</h2>
                    So my hard disk failed, Dell can replace it but none of the software. &nbsp;I have OEM versions of Windows 7 pro and Office 2010, which means I have product keys (somewhere) but no disks. &nbsp;Perhaps Dell recover disk will work, but this is 7000 miles away. &nbsp;I
 have seen links to download install .ISO (hopefully its official?) but I would have no way to burn on CD, so my question is...

</div>
<div><b>Can I download an Installer for Windows 7 Pro 64 bit to install from USB key and my existing product key?</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>What about for Microsoft Office 2010 Home &amp; Student?</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for your help guys.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--------------------------</p>
<p>Reinstalling Windows 7:</p>
<p>you will have to use a tool such as the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool (<a href="http://store.microsoft.com/Help/ISO-Tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.microsoft.com/Help/ISO-Tool</a>)
<br />
This simple tool will help you convert the same image file into to a USB thumb drive. For installation purposes, you should get a thumb drive that’s at least 4 GBs in size to store the installation files. Browse to where the Windows 7 Image is stored, open
 it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select the USB device where you want to have the backup stored to for installation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the USB device has been identified, click the Begin copying button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that’s it, the next step now is to boot your&nbsp;Computer from the thumb drive, make sure the thumb drive you will be installing Windows 7 from is plugged into the USB port. This might vary by manufacturer, but the usual one to try is F12, start your Computer
 and press F12 repeatedly until a screen is displayed giving you the option to boot from a USB Memory device, select that and press Enter on your keyboard.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 7 will boot as it normally does into the setup environment</p>

    <title>Computer crashing when under load. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phoenixf20  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer crashing when under load.</h2>
                    <p>Basically when i play csgo, this game mostly has happened with others but this one is almost 100% of the time, it shows a BSoD first time is always store exception error (or something similar don't actually remember, sorry), then after i restart and try
 to rejoin the game another BSoD shows up but this time is a different error critical process died.
</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>1) i've formatted and reinstalled everything didn't change anything. </p>
<p>2) My computer crashes after the game loads, about 5 seconds in game everything freezes and then the BSoDs previously told.</p>
<p>3) This happens about 5 times before i can rejoin and stably play the game, after that i can keep playing normally no more BSoD next time i get into game.
</p>
<p>4) Only under load since i haven't experienced it when browsing on internet, etc...
</p>
<p>5) i've noticed that after all crashes steam kind of resets the configuration to default, also csgo, and it doesn't crash again, this one is weird, i guess safe mode?
</p>
<p>6) All drivers up to date. </p>
<p>7)Built pc 6 months old specifications cpu: i3-4150 gpu: nvidia gtx 950 RAM: 8gb PSU: evga 400w HDD 500gb MoBo&nbsp;gigabyte h81m-h. 8) im thinking a of hardware issue because as i said before already formatted and reinstalled everything.</p>

<p>
</p><p>One possible cause of this issue is missing or outdated driver. Have you checked if the issue persists in safe mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, we suggest that you download and install the latest touch screen driver and see if it helps. You may refer to this

<p>For Ubuntu VHD boot, use this tool:</p>
<p>http://www.vmlite.com/index.php/forums/17-vboot</p>
<p>It allows you to boot Ubuntu from a VHD.</p>
<p>XP/2003 will be supported later this year.</p>

<p>Hello sathishj,</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers Community.</p>
<p>You would be able to get a better response from a forum that deals with running Ubuntu as a .VHD because the users are more familiar with using the tools in the manner that you are requesting.</p>

<h2>            Genuine Windows Product Key</h2>
                    I was in Iraq for three years and my computer HD crashed during that time. I had a shop repair everything and they had to . reload Windows, which later I discovered is not a Genuine Version. However, on the back of my Sony Lap Top the MS Sticker with my
 Product Key is listed but when I changed the product key with the original and valid product key it is returning with the statement that the product key I entered is invalid for activation. How can I resolve this? Thanks in advance&nbsp;

<p>I"m copying on this e-mail a picture I took of my label from the bottom of my laptop. When I first bought the laptop it was a Vista product, but I updated along the way. Then I had that HD crash when I was in Iraq and the guy who repaired it absolutely probably
 used a non-genuine copy of windows. But it worked ok and then when I came back I wanted to get things corrected on my laptop so, that's why I'm now trying to enter the valid Product Key # but its telling me its not valid. See label.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jerry,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A quick question before proceeding.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Are you trying to install Windows update or upgrading to windows 10 from previous version of Windows?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are facing issue Windows update, </span><span><span>Please follow the methods below and see if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1: </strong><br />
<span>I suggest you to run the&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows Update troubleshooter</strong><span>&nbsp;it will automatically fix some common problems installing updates and check if it helps to resolve the issue. Click the below link:</span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830262</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, try the below method and check if it helps or not:</span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to reset the windows update component manually. Resetting Windows Update Components will fix corrupt Windows Update Components and help you to install the Updates quickly. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1. Press&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows Key + X</strong><span>&nbsp;on the keyboard and then select “<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)”</strong>&nbsp;from the menu.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2. Stop the&nbsp;</span><strong>BITS, Cryptographic</strong><span>,&nbsp;</span><strong>MSI Installer</strong><span>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows Update Services</strong><span>. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press
 the “</span><strong>ENTER</strong><span>” key after you type each command.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong>net stop wuauserv</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>net stop cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>net stop bits</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>net stop msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. Now rename the&nbsp;</span><strong>SoftwareDistribution</strong><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><strong>Catroot2</strong><span>&nbsp;folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “</span><strong>ENTER</strong><span>”
 key after you type each command.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong>ren &lt;C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old&gt;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>ren &lt;C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old&gt;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>4. Now, let’s restart the&nbsp;</span><strong>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer</strong><span>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows Update Services</strong><span>. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the&nbsp;</span><strong>ENTER</strong><span>&nbsp;key
 after you type each command.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong>net start wuauserv</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>net start cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;net start bits&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>net start msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>5. Type<strong>&nbsp;Exit</strong>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;</span><strong>Command Prompt</strong><span>&nbsp;to close it and then restart the computer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also refer the link below for more information</span></span></p>

<p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 3:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>If issue with upgrade to Windows 10, I suggest you to upgrade to windows 10 using an ISO file and see It Upgrades.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please refer to the article below by <strong>Andre Da Costa</strong> to install windows 10 using an ISO file:</span></span></p>

<h2>            New Skype update for iPhone 6S</h2>
                    <p>I updated my iPhone 6S Skype.&nbsp; Now I can not send SMS.&nbsp; Now I can not share my screen.&nbsp; Now I can not use camera for video call. I do not like this new version.&nbsp; I tried using information stating:&nbsp; select contact, use "+" and select options, but this version
 does not offer this.&nbsp; My questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>how can I send SMS?</li><li>how can I have a video call?</li><li>how can I share my screen?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If these are not available, how do I un-install this new version and reload the version I had.&nbsp; I really don't like this version.

<p>Your Paypal account either needs to have a valid credit card attached or a positive money balance, which can be transferred in from an attached bank account or another Paypal account.
