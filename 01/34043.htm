<h2>            Mortal Kombat issues</h2>
                    
<p>I bought Mortal Kombat Komplete edition and when i go home my extra characters ( Rain, Kenshi, Skarlet and Freddy Krueger ) were there when we did a versus mode on the same console. 2 days later after i bought the game my extra characters are gone. I have
 experience this with the Klassic skins. I don't know how to change them and i still unlocked more in the Krypt. Ive tried offline and online and still they aren't there. i Downloaded my profile, got all the compatibility packs, cleared cache and switched storage
 device. Yet still didn't work can somebody help me?</p>

<p>If i read this right, You bought DLC to some extra characters and when you went to play the game again they were gone? Also did you download this game or the DLC from your Profile or from a family members? Also if you deleted the game ect. from your hard
 drive and re-downloaded them and still does not work. Try to delete your profile, and Recover it and then redownload the content. Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Close. The characters are built in the disk. For example, there are DLC characters you can buy with msp. Instead of buying them separately you can buy it built &nbsp;in the disk.</p>

<h2>            Cannot remove volume pop up</h2>
                    <p>I restarted my computer recently and suddenly an expanded volume pop up has started to show up. Before only the volume bar appeared, not the gigantic chrome.exe thing too.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3dcdb7de-29bd-4560-bc9a-22c7fc19bd9b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3dcdb7de-29bd-4560-bc9a-22c7fc19bd9b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried looking how to fix the issue and get rid of it, but almost all of the solutions tell me to go to "Other Options" under Ease of Access. However, I don't have an "Other Options" tab under Ease of Access.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>It never used to be like this in the past and I don't know how to get rid of it. I don't think its a notification either because I messed around in notification settings and nothing got rid of it.<br />

<h3> sarojkhadka  say:</h3>
<h2>            ELAN Smart Pad &#40;V3.3&#41; driver for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">Hello Community!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">I recently installed Windows 10 on my laptop (Samsung R540-JA01AE) and almost everything is working fine except my touchpad. The touchpad isn't working smoothly. There's no problem moving the cursor but sometimes I can't click
 from touchpad (by tapping on the touchpad surface). After looking at the device manager I found that the driver installed for the touchpad was a general "PS/2 Port Input Device". Then, I installed ELAN Touchpad driver from Samsung website. Now the click by
 tapping is fine but multiple gestures like three finger swipe, vertical scrolling are not working. The driver I installed is actually for windows 7 as it was the only latest driver version available there. Every features are "ENABLED" on ELAN settings.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Where can I get the latest driver for ELAN smart pad? Or, have I just done something wrong?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Please help!</p>

    <title>Transferring everything from an old HDD to a new HDD - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Transferring everything from an old HDD to a new HDD</h2>
                    So I just bought a new 3 TB HDD and wanted to figure out what the best way to trasfer all the files (including my Windows 10 OS) onto the new drive. I might use the old one as a back up for important files but I want my new and bigger one to be my main
 drive/ boot drive. Any suggestions are appreciated.

            <p>If all of your files/software are on the same partition as Windows they will be transferred to the new HDD when</p>
<p>your clone/image/migrate Win10 to the new HDD. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have data or software on a separate partition or HDD to Windows you can&nbsp; simply copy that data</p>
<p>to the new HDD. </p>
<p>Be careful to use the same drive letter for the partition that the data is stored on now in case there</p>
<p>is something that requires the original file path ( software in particular, but some data may as well ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a number of cloning tools. I use the free version of AOEMI Partition Manager, but HDD mfg's</p>
<p>also have similar software available from mfg's web site.</p>

<p>
</p><p>- I appreciate that 3TB may be more than enough space for your needs, but you should seriously consider</p>
<p>getting an SSD for Windows.&nbsp; 120GB is adequate, but 240GB is more cost effective per GB.</p>
<p>Of course this is a bit of a bother if you have everything on C:\ , but&nbsp; Windows loads faster and runs quicker</p>
<p>from and SSD. Once you've used Windows on an SSD you will never want to go back to HDD...
</p>
<p>Sooo slow... Software also benefits some, but games are fine on an HDD as they only benefit from
</p>
<p>slightly decreased loading times on SSD, and of course, data if fine stored on an HDD.</p>

            It should all be on one partition. The plan is to eventually get an SSD for windows but I need to improve my processor, graphics card, and get a bigger case (with better cable management). When I get home I will try to clone the old onto the new one (a
 7200 RPM). I'll I've done on the new drive is format it I believe.

            <p><em>"I'll I've done on the new drive is format it I believe. "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>AOEMI and similar tools will sort out the formatting. What you want to do is start with
<em>Unallocated </em>space.</p>
<p>If using only one partition it's easy. If doing multiple partitions it can be a bit challenging setting up the
</p>
<p>capacity of each partition to exactly the GB you desire, but steps can be rolled back before committing</p>
<p>to the migration.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you say 'tile colors', do you refer the background of the start screen and the tile color accents?</p>
<p>These settings have been moved from the usual PC settings to the new charms bar. However you have to be on the Start Screen page to access these.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Open <strong>Start Screen.</strong></p>
<p>b. Open <strong>Charms bar</strong> (<strong>Windows key + C</strong>)</p>
<p>c. Click <strong>settings &gt; Personalize</strong> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have your backgrounds, background colors and the accent colors. Your tiles will use the background color of your application. This is specified in your Manifest in the first Tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Reply with the status so that we could help you further.

            I think he refers the tiles colors. <br />
New colors are very ugly for many apps: <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6f236b2-2093-4fdf-add1-303e4656f990" />Why we can't set tile color like it was in win8? (for those apps that didn't specify
 it in their manifests http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn449733.aspx)<br />

            Exactly. In Windows 8.1 the Start screen tile colors take on the predominant colors of the app icons. This is truly, truly horrendous. It's one step forward, two steps back with Microsoft these days.<br />
<br />
Seriously, when you had the tile colors set to one color in Windows 8.0 you could differentiate between the tiles by means of the application icons themselves, in them. Now, with the entire tile coloring in a rude and ugly way, it offsets any differentiating
 marks, making it far more difficult to identify the application tile/icon you are looking for. I mean this is ABC's now... In Windows 8.0 I set categories up in the start menu for desktop apps (Office, System, Graphics, etc.) and sorted my application tiles
 under these for easy access. So when I opened the Start screen I could not only see the rows but the application tiles and since they were all the same color I could differentiate between the tiles quite easily. I would just go Windows Button-&gt;left-click Photoshop
 tile. Now, I open Start and am like where the heck is anything? Are not any serious Windows users actually developing this stuff?
<br />
<br />
I will say this: I know Windows 8 has had a lot of blowback from users and although I agree with a lot of that I also understand what Microsoft has to do. But when I finally got used to Windows 8.0 (I run Windows 7 x64 as main OS) I thought it would only get
 better. But this Start screen in 8.1 is just horrendous. I can't use it like this. I have a lot of apps sorted on it and when I open the Start screen it looks like some sort of depraved candy land that I don't want to be in. Worse than that, I can't find anything
 because the crazy colors are throwing off my ability to find/distuingish anything. Example: I installed the Sigil ebook editor application (desktop app). It is mainly a black icon but it has some tiny bit of red int he middle of the letter 'S' (which is the
 icon, a letter 'S'). The Start tile that ensues from this is a huge blood-red square with some black letter in it you can't hardly see. That is just crazy. How they can develop the Start screen and not give the ability to customize is just incomprehensible.
 If anything thinks this is actually helping people recognize icons they are sadly mistaken.<br />
<br />
I really do like some of the features of Windows 8.x. The Explorer additions, the native USB3 support, and, yes, even the Start screen as it was in Windows 8.0. But the whole spiel was 'customization' when Windows 8.1 was being released. But this is not customization,
 this is the opposite of that. With Windows 8.0 you could set the background color of the tiles, effectively, but with Windows 8.1 you cannot. So how is that giving people any options? The option has actually been taken away. And the default behavior, besides
 being the only behavior, is also the wrong behavior. When you actually work with a computer (not just slide your candy Start on your Surface RT) you need quick and efficient access. When you open Start your tiles/icons need to be there in a distinguishable
 form; you don't need the whole landscape jumbled by tile colors.<br />
<br />
It's so basic, Microsoft. This stuff really makes me fear for you. <br />

            It (8.1 tiles) is so ugly that I have stopped upgrading any machines to Windows 8.1. &nbsp;There were several other things that I found work a rounds for to get rid of Microsoft's changes. &nbsp;Not for this issue. &nbsp;Microsoft also made it impossible to roll windows
 8.1 back without just doing a complete restore. &nbsp;Truthfully, I will be advising any of my clients to ignore 8.1. &nbsp; In fact, it sort of made me lose faith in Microsoft's judgments. &nbsp;I guess I was the last one to have that anyway.

            <p>Search&nbsp;out one of my previous posts here&nbsp;for how to solve this problem for individual applications with manifest files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I note that Microsoft Office has now&nbsp;been updated with manifests, so the tile problem for Office applications is fixed (for Office 365 users, at least).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am working on an automated solution which I will post in my SkyDrive&nbsp;Public folder&nbsp;in the near future (I am currently doing it with batch files, but it is not user friendly enough for general distribution).</p>

            <p>Thanks Paul. You mean I have to create a .VisualElementsManifest.xml file for EACH app listed in start screen? O_O</p>
<p>It seems that MS programmers loose their skills - to change a tile background color I have to perform a Linux-like witchery (\\\/) &lt;- facepalm</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, it is not entirely straightfoward.<br />
<br />
If you create a manifest file for each application, some will not work for a number of reasons (protected files,&nbsp;some shortcut formats not supported for colouring, certain command line syntaxes that don't work, etc). Selecting a color can be fiddly even for
 one tile, as the shade only has to be out by a little to be seen as a clash with either the icon or a neighbouring tile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've spent quite a bit of time sorting out these problems and can now change the background of all my Desktop application tiles individually or in bulk with batch files, but color selection is too painful to do more than specify a few applications and set
 the rest to a single color (or leave as is). In practice, it is still a major improvement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having figured out all the requirements and "gotchas", I was planning on building a small .NET app that did the same job as the batch files, but with a smart interface for bulk and individual&nbsp;configuration (or any combination), which requires no hooks into
 the OS and makes fully reversable changes taking into account the tweaks to be made for all the special cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am hoping to have it in the Windows Store in a week or three. It will be likely free, voluntary donation-ware or a couple of dollars per user (still considering the options). There are enough planned features to stage three releases with refinements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In the meantime, I would suggest you&nbsp;limit fixes to addressing the odd application where the tile color masks the icon or is unbearable, as an effortless-to-apply solution is not very far away.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would have had it done by now, but I wanted to see what changes came about for 8.1 GA, and get my workstation rebuilt with 8.1 and VS2013 before starting anything new. Prototype in batch file exists now, has been tested for a few weeks&nbsp;and works very&nbsp;well
 with absolutely pleasing results. Coding in .NET is underway this week. I will post on Twitter and PinkAxolotl.com when it is ready. Should I fail in this task for unforeseen reasons, I will release the batch files and people can edit them to their liking.</p>

            Manifest files for all the 300+ silent installers I maintain? Tiles are not versatile and now even less so. Additionally, if you want a certain program to get a shortcut on your desktop you have to go into ProgramData folders to create shortcuts. Why can't
 Microsoft figure out how to create shortcuts from tiles since the tiles refer to the programs also? Really, all this is ridiculous and it has no working chance and will/should be looked back on as one of the Win8.x failures. Further, now applications that
 install (not talking about faux Store apps) won't create shortcut in the Start screen anymore either, so you have to add them to Start manually, one by one. This may seem like a good idea when you have no idea what you're doing on a PC (yes, Win8 is dumbing
 down computing a lot) but when you run a tight ship and are a power user you will find everything is now harder for you, but the options for you to change behaviors have been capped too. So like I said, one step forward, two steps back. There's also no way
 to add something to the charmbar, like a direct shutdown button so only one click would be needed. Now 3 are needed... Etc.<br />

            <p>How do you open the file in monitor 2?<br />
Is monitor 2 your primary monitor?<br />
What is the&nbsp; specific program to open the file?</p>
<p>The default monitor setup is Mirror mode, that is both monitors displays the same thing, when you change it to Extended does it still display in Mirror mode for all programs? Initially when you open a program in extended desktop mode the program opens on
 monitor 1, you have to drag it monitor 2 from monitor 1: </p>
<p>Move windows between multiple monitors<br />

<p>If you were able to drag the program to monitor 2 but still shows on monitor 1 as if in mirror mode try setting it back to mirror display and then back to extended display.</p>
<p><strong>To change an extended display to a mirrored display</strong></p>
<p>The following procedure works only for mobile PCs. If you're using a desktop computer, you may be able to change an extended display to a mirrored display by using the software provided with your video card or display driver.<br />
1. Open Windows Mobility Center by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking Mobile PC, and then clicking Windows Mobility Center.</p>
<p>2. On the External Display tile, click Connect display.</p>
<p>3. On the New Display Detected dialog box, click Mirrored, and then click OK.</p>
<p>Most mobile PCs use FN+F5, FN+F7, or FN+F8 to cycle through the display modes. To determine which function keyboard shortcut you need to use, check the information that came with your mobile PC, or go to the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>To change a mirrored display to an extended display</p>
<p>1. Open Display Settings by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking Appearance and Personalization, clicking Personalization, and then clicking Display Settings.</p>
<p>2. On the Monitor tab, select the numbered icon that represents the additional monitor that you connected.</p>
<p>If you connected only one additional monitor to your computer, its icon is identified by the number "2."</p>
<p>3. Select the Extend the desktop onto this monitor check box, and then click OK.</p>
<p>4. If prompted to keep the current settings, click Yes.</p>

<h2>            Multiple beeps then and randomly powers down, even after less than two minutes of use.</h2>
                    
<p>Yesterday, turned on my xbox one and loaded netflix. I began searching for a show to watch and, after about a minute, the xbox gave the 'power off beep' twice, and turned off completely. I powered the unit back on after a moment to find it had gone into
 full startup (green screen). It then behaved normally. I assumed it was just some sort of crash nod carried on as normal. Again today, I powered the console on, started to look for something on netflix. This time the console made the 'power off beep' about
 seven or eight times, then the made bit the power on and power off beeps several times I very quick succession, turning itself onto green screen for a moment, then turning itself off again. I powered on the console again after a check of power supply and such,
 and it was again running normally. I bought my xbox on day one. The disc drive Died. Microsoft wouldnt replace it without me paying four hundred quid deposit. The shop thankfully replaced the unit, but has said they won't do it again. I don't want to pay microsoft
 more money for another broken console. Please help!</p>

<h2>            Quick Access Folders Point to the Same Folder</h2>
                    <p>In the process of trying to have Quick Access folders (easily confusable with Libraries) point to different locations, I somehow ended up with them pointing to the same folder (e.g. 'Pictures' points to 'Documents', 'Music' points to 'Documents', etc.).&nbsp;
 I tried the 'Restore Default' on the 'Locations' tab of the 'Properties' dialog, but they all change to the same default, not different ones for each (Pictures, Music, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a simple way to correct this -- so they point to their respective folders?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi, </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand the inconvenience you are facing currently.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that if some of the folders are pinned to quick access, then you may have to unpin to remove it by
<strong>Right click </strong>on the folder&gt;<strong>unpin from quick access</strong>.</p>
<p>If it is not pinned, then ideally removing through <strong>Right click </strong>
on the folder&gt;<strong>Remove from quick access </strong>should work.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I&nbsp;suggest you to perform <strong>Chkdsk. </strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Chkdsk </span></strong><span>is a system tool which verifies the file system integrity and fixes system errors.</span></p>
<p><span>Follw the steps below:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows+X</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>Command Prompt (Admin</strong>).</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type the command <strong>Chkdsk</strong><span>&nbsp;/f/r.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hit <strong>Enter</strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span><strong>Chkdsk disclaimer</strong>: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive, while the bad sectors might be recovered however there might be pertinent data loss.</span></span></p>

            <p>My apologies but it turns out I described the problem incorrectly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In reality, the folders I was describing (Pictures, Documents, Downloads, etc) are listed under This PC. (Users/NAME/Pictures, and so on. Under Properties that are called System&nbsp; Folders.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was trying to conserve space by pointing these folders to a different location but somehow I got them all&nbsp;pointing to the same folder. Even when I use the Restore Default button in Properties, it inserts the same path for each.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems like a relatively simple fix so I am uncomfortable running Chkdsk on such a new computer (less than a month old).</p>
<p><br />
Thank you again for your time. </p>

            <p>When you get multiple System Folders pointing to the same folder, you have to edit the Registry to unscramble the mess.&nbsp; Make sure the folders you want to be your System Folders have been created in the file system:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open the Registry Editor by typing "regedit" in Search or the Run dialog.</li><li>Ctrl+F will open the Regedit search dialog.&nbsp; Type: <strong>UserShellFolders</strong>.&nbsp; Select the checkbox to search Keys; clear the checkboxes for Values &amp; Data.&nbsp; Click 'Search' and you should find yourself at:
<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</strong>.</li><li>You should see the stored path names in the right-hand pane.</li><li>Edit Values in the right-hand pane by double-clicking the Value name.&nbsp; Type the correct path for each folder.</li><li>Repeat the above for values found under: <strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders</strong>.&nbsp; (these are there for legacy software.&nbsp; May not be needed by any programs you run, but good form to be consistent).</li><li>Close Regedit &amp; reboot.</li></ol>

            <p>This solution, while very educational (I enjoyed tinkering with the settings) did not completely solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up adding a new user account, deleting the old one, and re-adding the old account to get things reset. I had to do some other resets for my preferences, but all in all, not bad at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your assistance.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Are you talking about the BIOS Password when you first Boot your Computer, not&nbsp;your User Account Password</p>
<p>If you are having problems with a BIOS Password, you will have to contact Acer Support as per Microsoft advice.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.acer.com/us/en/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.acer.com/us/en/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft forbids assistance being given in the Forums to "crack" or bypass&nbsp;Passwords.</p>
<p>But if your problem is with a User Account Password and&nbsp;you are using the correct User Account Password, this is their advice:</p>
<p>"How to use System Restore to log on to Windows 7 or Windows Vista when you lose access to an account"</p>

<h2>            Security info change problem</h2>
                    I wanted to read my mail,so I logged in but I couldn't do anything because when I logged in there was the change security info text.It says that it needs my alternate email or my phone number.Well,it would be easy...but I don't have a mobile phone,so I
 entered my second email address and then it said that they sent me a code on my second email so I can verify idk what.Then I logged in my second account just to see that I needed the security info change there too,so I couldn't do anything again.So I made
 a new email address and entered it where I had to,and finally I got an email "Security info replacement". I click on continue,and now I don't really remember what I did there,but when I now want to log in then it says this "Did you request a security info
 change?" "Someone started a process to replace the security info for(myEmail)",and I have two options to choose 1.Yes,this was me or the second this wasn't me.So I go to the first one and it says "We're not ready for you yet" "Your 30-d

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>As per the issue description, I understand that you are not able to access to your computer because
 of security information change. You tried to change the security information but it got locked for 30 days (waiting period).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue

</p><p><span>Microsoft sometimes ask you to verify your account. We do this to help protect you, and make sure that you are in fact the correct person attempting to access your info. However, if all of your security info is incorrect or
 out of date—for example, if you no longer use any of the phone numbers or alternate email addresses associated with your account—you need to delete the out-of-date info and update your account with new security info, and this 30-day wait period is for deleting
 the obsolete information.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you choose to delete your out-of-date security information, we don’t fully remove it for 30 days. This waiting period helps to deter hackers from updating your security info
 and gaining access to your account without your knowledge. <strong>But the waiting period doesn't mean you're locked out of your Microsoft account</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can still access to your Microsoft account and with that to your computer. Refer the section “<strong>I’ve turned on two-step verification</strong>” in the following Microsoft

            <p>Thank you, I get it now. But why does it show someone else's email instead of my second email address?</p>
I know that the email that is showing is not mine,because I tried to log on it ( I thought that it maybe was my email that I forgot about ) , I tried different passwords and none of them worked. So, I clicked that I forgot my password and then it showed me
 the security question of that email, and that question was on a different language. I know that I used only my language, so that email can't be mine.<br />

 in such situations. If a hacker tries to get access to your account by editing the security information, he can’t do it. He will have to wait for 30 days to get the security information changed.</span></span></span></p>
<p>

            Hi Tony,
<br />
<br />That icon with the little Red Cross means that this instant message send failed after you sent a message to your contact
<br />
<br />A possible explanation for this issue is the contact has not yet added you under his/her contact list . . .

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>- Are you using Microsoft account or Local account?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot. Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software
 conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>* Place the computer in a Clean Boot and check if the issue is occurring due to any third party programs.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the link to view the steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></p>

            <p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Hi,</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Are you referring to the Slide Show for the background picture which does not change or is it an isolated desktop background that you are unable to set?</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Well, if you are referring to the multiple desktop background pictures that you have set as slide show (which would start according to the time that you have set), this could be due to the fact that the slide show might
 be paused under power options.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Check if these steps helps to reset the settings:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>a) Press <strong>Window+X</strong> key together and select
<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>b) Click on <strong>Power options</strong>.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>c) Click on <strong>Change plan settings</strong>.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>d) Click on <strong>Change advance power settings</strong>. Click on
<strong>Change settings that are currently unavailable. </strong></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>e) Under <strong>Desktop background</strong> settings, select
<strong>Available</strong> for <strong>Slide show</strong> section.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>f) Click on <strong>Apply</strong> and then on
<strong>OK</strong>.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Check if the desktop background works as a part of slide show.
</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>If it’s an isolated picture that you are trying to set as background, Corrupted TranscodedWallpaper.jpg could be one of the different reasons. Follow the methods to try and fix the issue:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><strong>Method 1:</strong></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Follow the steps to rename corrupt TranscodedWallpaper.jpg:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>a) Press<strong> Windows and R</strong> to open Run. Type the following location and hit Enter:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><strong>%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Themes\</strong></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>b) Right-click the <strong>TranscodedWallpaper.jpg</strong> file, and then click
<strong>Rename</strong>.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>c) Change the file name to <strong>TranscodedWallpaper.old</strong>, and then click
<strong>Yes</strong> when you are prompted.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>d) If <strong>slideshow.ini</strong> is listed, double-click this file.
<strong>Slideshow.ini</strong> should open in <strong>Notepad</strong>. Select all the text in slideshow.ini if any exists, and then press
<strong>Delete</strong> on the keyboard.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>e) On the<strong> File</strong> menu, click <strong>
Save</strong>.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>f) Close <strong>Notepad</strong>.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>g) Close the <strong>File Explorer</strong> window, and then browse to the picture that will be set as the background image.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>h) Try to apply a background picture again.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>If this does not work, proceed to the next method.
</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font><strong>Method 2:</strong></font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Check the Remove background setting under the Ease of Access settings. Follow the steps:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>a) Press<strong> Windows+X</strong> key to select

<strong>Make the computer easier to see</strong>.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>c) Make sure that the option to <strong>Remove background images</strong> not selected.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>d) Click <strong>OK</strong> twice, and then close the Ease of Access Center window.</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Check if the required changes help you to retain the background wallpaper.
</font></font></font></p>
