<h2>            certificate errors on Microsoft edge and google app in store</h2>
                    My 2in1 has built in windows 10. I can't access anything like Google and YouTube and when I tried downloading chrome it wouldn't let me. I got the app but it didn't work saying no internet connection even though everything else did. I shut it down tried
 again and got no result. I uninstalled it to reinstall it but it said I had it installed it even though the system, start said otherwise because it was nowhere to be found. Please help me. I promised i'd use it for schoolwork but can't get to any sites. 😢

            <p>Hi Nusrat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Get back to us with the answers to the&nbsp;below questions to assist you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Have you installed all pending updates?<br />
2.&nbsp;Did you make any changes to your computer prior to this issue?<br />
3.&nbsp;Are you able to use other browsers without any error?<br />
4.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Do you get the same error when you try to browse using Internet Explorer web browser?</span></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>
</p><p>Occasionally you'll get an error message telling you there's a problem with a website's security certificate. A site's certificate allows Internet Explorer to establish a secure connection with the site. Certificate errors occur when there's a problem with
 a certificate or a web server's use of the certificate.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I&nbsp;would suggest you&nbsp;to install any pending updates on the pc to check if that helps.&nbsp; Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Keyboard Short Cut CTRL &#43; X not working in any applications</h2>
                    <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a strange issue with the keyboard shortcut, only the CTRL + X is not working in any applications except in Windows Explore. If I'm able to cut and paste in Windows Explore it means the keyboard is ok. This applies to both my PC and laptop, I have
 this issue when both are running window 8.1, now I updated to Window 10, the problem is still there. Some common applications I installed on both computers are ESET, Chrome and Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really couldn't figure out what's the problem, please help.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Mike&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern and are happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly follow the below methods and check&nbsp;if it&nbsp;helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Hardware Troubleshoot</strong><br />
Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if the issue is with your Audio.
<br />
Refer these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div><br />
Press Windows key +X, select Control panel</div>
</li><li>
<div><br />
Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons</div>
</li><li>
<div><br />
Click on troubleshooting and click on the view all option on the left panel</div>
</li><li>
<div><br />
Run the hardware and devices troubleshooter</div>
</li></ul>
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Uninstall and reinstall the keyboard driver from device manager.<br />
&nbsp;Follow the steps:</div>
<div>
<p>1. Press Windows key + X from the Keyboard and click on Device Manager.<br />
&nbsp;2. In Device Manager, double click on the Keyboard.<br />
&nbsp;3. It will show you the device driver name, select that device and then right click on it.<br />
&nbsp;4. Click on Uninstall button.<br />
&nbsp;6. Restart the computer, the drivers will get automatically installed on your Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I would also suggest&nbsp;you to check with any other external keyboard and see whether it is working fine.
</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

<p>Hi Xabarass-76,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, the option to turn off the USB 3.0 is in the BIOS settings. Since you're unable to turn it off via BIOS settings, I'd recommend that you contact Lenovo so they can check the device for you.<br />
<br />
Keep me updated with the results. </p>

            If you could disable the host controller it would just disable the USB port entirely.&nbsp; It would not somehow make them become USB 2 ports. That a function of the chip set.&nbsp; USB 3 is, in general, backward compatible.&nbsp; What is the problem you're trying to
 solve?

<p>
</p><p>The problem is issue with a USB interface Box when it works with Lenovo Notebooks. (In traces is possible to see Usb Overlapping messages).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Vendor suggests as troubleshooting to try to disable Usb 3.0.</p>

<h2>            Killer Instinct on Windows - frame rate issue and can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t throw with keyboard</h2>
                    
<p>Killer Instinct is finally on Windows 10! YAY!<br />
<br />
Except I have two little problems with the game.</p>
<p>#1 - I have all the graphical settings set to max and the offline Single Player is running too fast! &nbsp;I don't even have a powerful CPU either, I only have an Intel i5 760! But my GPU is a Geforce 960. :) &nbsp; I also have a 3D monitor
 that supports 120hz and it feels like the game is running at 120 FPS, almost double the speed, so it makes Single Player offline unplayable! &nbsp;But everything else is fine. &nbsp;The Training runs fine and so does multiplayer. &nbsp;I just wish I could play the Single
 Player game to practice with an AI.</p>
<p>#2 - I dunno if this is my keyboard or if it's the game itself, but I can't perform any throws using my keyboard! &nbsp;If I press 2 keys at the same time (Low Kick and Low Punch) it only does one or the other so throw doesn't execute
 itself! &nbsp;I know, I know.... I SHOULD BE USING A GAMEPAD! :) &nbsp; And I will buy one if I enjoy this game. But does anyone else with a keyboard have this kinda problem? &nbsp;I'm using a Logitech wireless keyboard K350. &nbsp;If it's my keyboard that's failing to input
 2 buttons at the same time, I'll just go buy a gamepad I suppose, but if it's the game itself, it would be nice if Microsoft could fix this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bah nevermind, I found the problem on another gaming forum! &nbsp;The game's framerate is tied to my monitor's refresh rate! &nbsp;I lowered it from 120hz to 60hz and now the game runs fine at 60 fps! :)</p>

                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have very troublesome problem about Windows 7 aero.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first you might think: Why create a new issue as there are already a lot answer for it? Well... I 'm tried all fixing solves, but none of these solves are fixed my problem. This issue happened at 9th August when I started play old game MotoGP (1997) suddenly
 it crashed and after that crash I lost my Windows 7 Aero.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem: My Windows 7 aero is down and trouble shooter cannot find any problem what it cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used an internet to discover this issue and I have seen many answer for this problem, but none of these are fixed my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooter: Not found an issue&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Fix it: I also tried this one, but this fool program don't find my internet at all so it can't setup at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried enable my Aero peek, but it is grey out so i can't turn, but even it is grey out. It is activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also went to services.msc ... I restarted "Themes" and did troubleshooter again -&gt; not fixed issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also turned off "Cryptographic Services" off and did troubleshooter again -&gt; no fixed -&gt; cryptographic services turned back on</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I also updated my graphic card Nvidia GTX 970 driver to newest one -&gt; not fixed it either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am out of ideas what to do next. So far no solved answer from internet found. Any ideas?</p>

Hi,<br />
<br />
Have you tried uninstalling the game?<br />
<br />
You might consider performing a <strong>System Restore</strong> so you can go back to the previous state when Aero theme was working fine on your computer.<br />
<br />
To perform <strong>System Restore</strong>, follow steps below:<br />
1. Press <strong>Windows key</strong> on your keyboard. <br />
2. Type <strong>cmd</strong>, right-click on the result, then choose <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.<br />
3. Type <strong>RSTRUI.EXE</strong>, then hit Enter and follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure to select the date of the restore point before the issue started.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.<br />

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I have already removed this old game my computer, when this game mess my aero system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried this a system restore, but unfortunately it gave me only 2 restore points that was for 13th August at 1:38 pm and second restore point was 40 min earlier, than first restore point and this issue happened for me at 9th August. There wasn't any
 restore point before that 2nd August. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, there was 3rd restore point at 4th August (that would be good for me), but when I tried select it. A system restore program not found it and it recommend to use these 2 restore points that are from yesterday. This didn't help me at all.&nbsp;</p>

            I just did that system file checker. Results was expected: No issues found after file checking and it said that all files are fine without any corrupted files. After it I restarted and tried get aero to work. Nothing happened. Aero still down.

            <p>Hello Monica Cam</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I just got my windows 7 Aero theme working. I tried one idea, what just came to my mind: I decided to change my computer resolution. I switched from 1920x1080 to 1600x1020. After that change, my aero came back to normal. Then later I switched it
 back to 1920x1080 resolution and aero theme was fixed after that resolution change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem case solved after 5 days from issue happened! Happy ending.</p>

<p>2 options.&nbsp; Either access via a web browser (WhatsApp web) or install the WhatsApp windows 10 app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT - all WhatsApp is driven from your phone so you MUST have WhatsApp installed and running on your phone, the message store remains on the phone not the tablet/laptop.&nbsp; I'm not aware of any changes happening in the future on this requirement (just from
 what I've read online) it's basically a phone based platform that they have extended some support to PC for.</p>

<h2>            xbox one won&#39;t sign into xbox 360 account</h2>
                    <p>I have an Xbox one that I've had for about a year and I was playing an Xbox 360 game and it froze. So I decided to restart my console and started up the Xbox 360 game and when it started up I was signed out. So I tried to manually sign in but every time I tried it gets stuck on signing in with the loading icon and it doesn't go any further then that. I tried signing into another account but the same problem occurs. I can play games but it won't&nbsp;sign in for some reason so I hope someone encountered this problem and found a solution.</p>

<h2>            Lock screen image returns to default after shutdown</h2>
                    Whenever I open my laptop from shutdown, the lock screen image is the default nature image from Windows 10. But when I check the settings, the picture of the lock screen is not the nature image but the one I saved. This only happens after shutdown, the
 lock screen I want is correct when I open from sleep.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>I am also experiencing this problem and the change you suggest doesn't solve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue I have is if I shutdown via click "Start | Power | Shutdown" route i.e. via the explorer UI it works correctly and I get my lock screen image, a .jpg image from C: displayed at startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my power button configured to do a Shutdown in power settings and if I use that to shutdown then at startup I get the windows default lock screen image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem is I use a Shortcut based on shutdown.exe /s /hybrid /t 5</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it looks like the shutdown via the Explorer UI is doing something additional prior to triggering the shutdown be it a Full or a Fast start variant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No sure if this is something recent of a long standing issue as only switched to using the Power button for shutdown recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a pity MS have dropped the 'Ctrl'+&lt;key&gt; shortcut options from the explorer UI as you used to be able to do "Ctrl"+"Esc" &amp; "Ctrl"+"u" to shutdown on 7 and earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has a fix for this issue would like to know as the "Start|Power|Shutdown" is a personal&nbsp; bette noir that has appeared in 10 along with the fact that virtually none of the UIs in 10 and Office 2016 respect the "Desktop\Color\window" registry key
 so you can't get away from endless intense white screens other than by tweaking the display colour settings which then ruins image color rendering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

    <title>I tried to configure a Pinnacle 80e TV tuner with Media Center&#59; it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnscherer  say:</h3>
<h2>            I tried to configure a Pinnacle 80e TV tuner with Media Center&#59; it checked only for digital antenna and failed to find the cable signal</h2>
                    When I configured my tuner (with QAM cable input) with Media Center, it searched only for a digital antenna signal. (Another person had this same problem, but he was using an analog input.)
<p>Part of his post:</p>
<p>status: scanning for digital antenna signal....</p>
<p>A TV signal was not detected. Please make sure a live TV signal is connected to the computer and try again.</p>
<p>The problem is it only lists the possibility of digital over-the-air TV as being a source.&nbsp; I cannot choose cable, analog cable, digital cable, QAM, anything else except "digital antenna".&nbsp; What am I supposed to do next to set up Windows Media Center?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me again:&nbsp; How do I force WMC to scan the tuner for QAM signals in addition to the antenna signals that it is already looking for?&nbsp; (The tuner swears that it is QAM compatable)</p>
<p>Note: I also tried an HP tuner (which appears to be from Hauppage) - WMC DID scan for settop box, then cable, then digital antenna - of course it found only cable signals. I noted in device manager that this tuner shows as three tuner devices, whereas the
 Pinnacle tuner only shows as one device - is that significant?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Johnscherer,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers.<br />
It might be for one of the following reasons that it failed to find the cable signal</p>
<p>•&nbsp;If you receive your TV signal through an over-the-air antenna, the channel might be temporarily unavailable, or you might not have reception.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;If you subscribe to a cable or satellite service, your subscription might not include the channel you're trying to access. To remove channels that you don't receive, on the start screen, scroll to Tasks, click settings, click TV, click Guide, and then
 click Edit Channels.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;If your TV signal passes through a cable or satellite set-top box, the set-top box might not be tuned to the appropriate channel. Make sure the set-top box is actually tuned to the channel that you are trying to locate.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;If you have one or more TV tuner devices connected to your computer, you might be having trouble with one of the TV tuners. Make sure that each TV tuner is enabled and that the appropriate drivers are installed.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;If you receive your TV signal from an over-the-air antenna or cable jack in the wall, make sure that the cable is connected properly to the TV-IN jack on your TV tuner hardware.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;If your TV signal passes through a cable or satellite set-top box, make sure that the set-top box is turned on, and that these two cables are attached:</p>
<p>i.&nbsp;A cable connecting your TV signal to the set-top box.</p>
<p>ii.&nbsp;A cable connecting your set-top box to the TV-IN jack on your TV tuner hardware.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Contact your TV service provider to ensure that your service is active and has no technical difficulties.</p>

<h2>            star wars force unleashed ultimate sith edition</h2>
                    
<p>Hello folks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to figure out how to properly install "Star Wars Force Unleashed Ultimate Sith Edition". I can play the game but need to know how to make sure that I get all the niceness that is "Ultimate" :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The list of my games has it showing up as the same thing twice which is strange, and the storage section of my console has it listed only once but at 12gig (where most of my other stuff is about 6 gig.) So, I am assuming that I have the contents of both
 discs. Now I just need to know that the game is smart enough to read this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps my best gauge is the bonus costumes? I have alternate costumes for my character including a ton of star wars characters such as Darth Maul. If this is Ultimate-only then I must be set. If everyone gets that, however, I am lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ty!</p>

<p>All the extras are on the second disc with this game. &nbsp;So basically the first disc is the game and the second disc is all the DLC. &nbsp;So you can have either or installed and it makes no difference.</p>

 One die bessere Wahl oder gibt es egal was genommen wird?

<p>Ohne jetzt Unitymedia zu kennen nehm ich einmal an, es geht "nur" darum wie dein Anschluß nach außen hin sichtbar ist. Vom Unitymedia-Router bekommen alle Geräte die bei dir zuhause dran hängen eine für interne Zwecke reservierte IP (z.B. 192.168.xxx.xxx).</p>
<p>Xbox Live ist es egal, ob du auf ewig mit der gleichen IP daherkommst oder dir dein Provider immer wieder eine dynamische IP aus seinem Adressbereich gibt.</p>

<p>I've tried installing Vista SP1 three times and each time it goes through the whole process even to the point where it restarts and says "100%" complete, it then tells me the upgrade failed and unistalls all of it. when&nbsp;I go into update history
 it gives me the error message "WindowsUpdate_80242016" "WindowsUpdate_dt000", this is really naffing me off, can someone sort it out for me please, my AVG is switched off during the process.</p>
<p>thanks </p>

<p>Norton (and McAfee) applications are <em>notorious</em> for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. Let's see if getting rid of the Norton "leftovers" resolves your problem.<br />
<br />
1. Download the Norton Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop: 
ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/removal_tools/Norton_Removal_Tool.exe&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>3. Right-click on the file you saved in #1 above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to run the utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.<br />
<br />
4. Test.</p>

                    I deleted the folder windows media player because it was messed up and I thought I would just install it again. I downloaded media player 10 and 11 on microsoft.com and they both say I can't install. I tried windows update but it won't show up..I was going
 to install windows live essentials but I don't think it comes with media player. Is there anyway to get it back? I cannot find a download called "Windows Media Player 11 for Vista" theres a page for it, but I can't find were to download...

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>To install Windows Media player for Vista download the package from the link below.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/11/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/11/default.aspx</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Or you can try to run SFC scan to get back the player.</span></p>
<p><span>To do this, follow these steps: </span></p>
<p><span>Steps to perform SFC scan</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Click the Start button</span></p>
<p><span>2. From the Start Menu, Click All programs followed by Accessories</span></p>
<p><span>3. In the Accessories menu, Right Click on the Command Prompt option</span></p>
<p><span>4. From the drop down menu that appears, Click on the 'Run as administrator' option</span></p>
<p><span>5. If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled you will be asked for authorization prior to the command prompt opening. You may simply need to press the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert the administrator password etc.</span></p>
<p><span>6. In the Command prompt window, type: sfc /scannow and then press Enter</span></p>
<p><span>7. A message will appear stating that 'the system scan will begin'</span></p>
<p><span>8. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></p>
<p><span>9. If any files need any replacement SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Vista DVD for this process to continue</span></p>
<p><span>10. If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations"</span></p>
<p><span>11. After the scan has completed, Close the command prompt window restart the computer and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link below for more information.</span></p>

</p><p>Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention, and keeping us updated on the situation. Is this issue occurring on an Xbox One or Xbox 360? What is the exact error message that appears?&nbsp;The Xbox 360 cloud storage will need to be enable to use, but the
 Xbox One will use the cloud as long as the console is connected to the internet. We have an article entitled

<p>
</p><p>It may help you</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this article not help you , then you need to create a windows 10 media file through media creation tool and reinstall windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE:- YOUR FILES AND FOLDERS WILL BE DELETED IF YOU HAVE A SINGLE PARTITION.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF YOU HAVE SEPARATE PARTITION, THEN CHOOSE THE DRIVE(PARTITON) IN WHICH WINDOWS(OLD) IS INSTALL AND SELECT IT.</p>
<p>SO THAT NEW WINDOW 10 WILL BE INSTALL IN THAT PARTICULAR PARTITION AND YOUR OTHER PARTITION WILL BE UNAFFECTED.</p>

<p>Hey MattWade1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you can clean install windows by using "windows media creation tool". It will take 4.5 gb of data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But make sure you have backup your data before using WINDOWS MEDIA CREATION TOOL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community</p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can disable all backgrounds app by visiting <strong>setting</strong> - <strong>
Privacy settings</strong> - <strong>Background </strong><strong>app</strong> - now choose which app to stop.You can disable all, this will not harm your pc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also you can visit task manager and stop unnecessary background apps running.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:-</strong> Don't stop any Microsoft core app</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that still don't work for you then you can <strong>reset</strong> your pc.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or</p>
<p>You can activate <strong>safe mode with networking </strong>and install <strong>
windows media creation tool</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this will work for you....</p>
