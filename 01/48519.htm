    <title>After a short time, audio programs freeze and sound stops playing on - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            After a short time, audio programs freeze and sound stops playing on external speakers, which are connected to a docking station, which is connected to a Dell XPS 16 laptop.</h2>
                    I am running Windows 7 on a new Dell XPS 16 laptop with a Kensington Docking station. All purchased from Dell.&nbsp;&nbsp; Plugged into the docking station is an external monitor, mouse, keyboard, and external speakers, including a sub-woofer.&nbsp; When I play music,
 after 10-30 minutes, the sound shuts down.&nbsp; Any programs that were producing the sound, whether ITunes, or Pandora radio, stop (freeze).&nbsp; If I unplug the audio cable from the Kensington Dock station and wait a few seconds, the programs continue and the sound
 will begin to play from the laptop.&nbsp; At that point, I can plug the audio cable back into the Dock and the sound will&nbsp; be fine again for another 10-20-30 minutes.&nbsp; Then it stops again.&nbsp; Repeat that 100 times.&nbsp; I have spoken with both Dell and Kensington.&nbsp; Neither
 can solve the issue.&nbsp; Kensington blames Dell.&nbsp; Dell blames Kensington.&nbsp; Any ideas?<br />
<br />
No new programs have been installed.&nbsp; This is a brand new computer.&nbsp; No error messages appear.

            Hi Sparky999,
<div><br />
<div>When you were on with Dell, did they walk you through updating your audio drivers?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, have you tried a different set of speakers or headphones plugged directly into the dock?</div>
<div><br />

            I have been testing for the past few weeks.&nbsp; Here are the results:<br />
1)&nbsp; Both Dell and Kensington either installed updates (remotely) or had me install them.&nbsp; All drivers are up to date.&nbsp; Nothing changed.<br />
2)&nbsp; Programs and files and operating systems were re-loaded, re-installed, re-set many times.&nbsp; Nothing changed.<br />
3)&nbsp; I tried three different sets of speakers (different sizes and power).&nbsp; All fail exactly the same way.<br />
4)&nbsp; I attached the docking station to two different PC's, one laptop (running on UNIX? not mine.) and one desktop (running Windows XP).&nbsp; Neither failed and the audio worked for days without stopping.<br />
5)&nbsp; I attached the speakers directly to the notebook, rather than the dock, and the audio ran for days without stopping.<br />
6)&nbsp; I attached headphones directly into the dock (at the lowest volume setting possible because, they blast my ears at anything above level 1) and they have been working for days without showing signs of stopping.<br />
7)&nbsp; Kensington sent me a replacement dock, and it fails exactly like the original one.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that the audio shuts off after a few minutes only when this Dell Studio XPS 16 notebook running Windows 7 is attached to the Kensington docking station and the speakers are connected directly to the dock.&nbsp; Something is either draining power
 or using too much power or eating up resources or causing conflicts....

            I have a similar issue. I haven't even gotten to plugging in my speakers, I have all my p<span>eripheral devices.&nbsp; when I shut my computer down, and restart, all the devices are missing.&nbsp; It takes about 20 or
 30 minutes for my computer to recognize these devices</span>

            Hi,<br />
I'm running a Dell Studio (Windows 7) with the Kensington Dock and get the same problem. I have reloaded the drivers but to no avail.

<h2>            Stickynotes notes issues in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10; </p>
<p>Touchscreen device</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I copy/paste links to stickynotes. If there is a single link on a stickynote and nothing else I can click the note, Ctrl/A, Ctrl/C then Paste into the browser bar. No problem. However, If I have more information than a single link and wish to select
 a link, I need to highlight the link before copying.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>On my touchscreen device, if I try to select using stylus or finger, Windows draws instead of selecting. Is there a way to turn this off?

<h3> grace monserata  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Automatic Repair&#34; Endless loop after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I have a Dell Inspiron 20 3000 All-In-One Desktop that runs on Windows 10. Everything has been going smoothly for the past couple months. There were no issues or problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until recently, it asked for an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the update, I wasn't able to log into the computer. All that showed was a black screen with my cursor on it. I waited for about a couple hours but the black screen was still there. So I tried to restart the computer by plugging the power supply off,
 then plugging it back on and turning on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I turned on the computer, I got a blue screen saying 'Automatic Repair' and that my computer didn't restart correctly. So I restarted it. But after I restarted I got the same screen again. I've restarted multiple times, and I'm having this problem for
 about 3 days now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've resorted to some of the answers on the internet, and one said to go to Startup Settings and select 'F7'. I tried to do so but after I restarted I ended up getting an error telling me to contact someone and tell them about a stop code,&nbsp;0xc000021a.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried to completely reset the computer, since I have already made a backup for my files in advance. But resetting won't work somehow. It says that the reset wasn't completed and no changes were made. I have done this with the "Keep my files"
 option and the other to completely erase everything and re-install Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Restore won't work either. When I selected it, I had two choices to restore my computer. Both of them were when I uninstalled some applications. (Flockmod and FireAlpaca if I should be specific.) I have tried both choices, but then it says that the
 System Restore didn't complete, and that no changes were made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Asides all that, everytime I try to restart I either get a blue screen with the "Automatic Repair" or the stopcode&nbsp;0xc000021a and it restarts.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any answers or help would be appreciated a lot, thank you!</p>
<p>

            <p>I have the same problems. No crossword daily challenge and no April 2018 maps for any of the games--jumble and wordament were there until today when they disappeared.&nbsp; Where is the response from Microsoft??? I don't even see a "we're working on the problem" or at the least "we're sorry for the problems". Instead--silence here.&nbsp; When told to contact support and get this community forum with no answers it is EXTREMELY frustrating.&nbsp; Where is the QC of these products?? And where is customer service??&nbsp; I see none!</p>

<p>
</p><p>If the light is not on but it is charging, you might want to get a warranty to replace the light. If the light is not lighting up nor the surface says charging, try to plug it in again. If that doesn't work, you really want to get a warranty.</p>

            <p>Please give us more information. Are you saying that you see "plugged in not<br />charging" on the screen AND the LED on the end of the power cord that plugs into<br />the Surface is lit? If it isn't lit, you may need to replace the charger. If you<br />are in the USA, you can go to the closest physical retail Microsoft Store and<br />they will assist in diagnosing. If not near a store, can you try your charger on<br />someone else's SP3,4,5, or 6 and theirs on yours to see what happens? </p>

    <title>printing shipping labels in paypal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> i hate hate computers  say:</h3>
<h2>            printing shipping labels in paypal</h2>
                    got a new computer and am having trouble printing shipping labels in paypal..I have a HP1020 printer that works fine..My problem is that when I got a new computer, the shipping label is all messed up when I try to print a UPS label through paypal..It does
 not mess up when I print a USPS label..I'm sure this has something to do with a setting, but I don't know much about computers..I hooked my old computer up and it worked fine when I printed a UPS label, so it has to be a setting on this new computer..Any help?
 Thanks

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Do you get any error message when you print the shipping labels?</p>
<p>2. Which browser do you use to access websites?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue can occur for one or more of the following scenarios:<br />
</p>
<div><b>Scenario 1:</b> Your video card or video driver is outdated or corrupt. <b>
Note</b> Outdated or corrupted printer drivers can also cause script errors when printing from Internet Explorer
<br />
<br />
<b>Scenario 2:</b> You may not have printer permissions assigned<br />
<br />
<b>Scenario 3:</b> Protected Mode is enabled for the Internet security zone of the web page<br />
<br />
<b>Scenario 4:</b> There is an issue with temporary folders on your user account and the Low folder under the %TEMP% location has been deleted</div>

            <p>Hi,,I disabled protected mode..same prob..</p>
<p>I don't have a problem viewing the label or printing it, it's just that is all messed up..when I print a USPS label, it's fine..when I try to print a UPS label, it is distorted and messed up..This is a new computer so I don't think the video card or driver
 is outdated...I hooked my old computer back uop and I can print UPS labels just fine, so I don't think it's the printer..any other ideas? thanks, rick</p>

            Hi John, 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, what version of Windows 10 are you running?
<br />
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Windows Updates
<br />
<br />What update(s) are showing as pending on your system?

            Hi all,<br />
<br />
Just saw this thread as the most recent. I also stumble on error code&nbsp;0x80070005. This is the first time I run into a Windows 10 update error.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am trying to update from Windows 10 1809 to the newest Windows 10 1903, however it always fails and I get that error message.<br />
<br />
Already tried updating several times, disabling antivirus software, stopping VPN, clearing the SoftwareDistribution folder, but to no avail. The update downloads and starts installing, after that my Dell Inspiron 15 7000 laptop restarts a few times, however
 at the last restart I just see something along the lines of 'Undoing windows update changes', and the laptop boots up with no trace of the update. I find the error in the update history, which just says "Failed to install on ‎12/‎06/‎2019 - 0x80070005"<br />
<br />
The update troubleshooter says that there are no issues found.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?
        </p>

    <title>Windows 10 PC turn off unexpectedly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sir richardward  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 PC turn off unexpectedly</h2>
                    Good morning it's Sunday morning 10/23/16 at 10:46 AM, my PC shut down last night for the first time, I do not know&nbsp; if this is the problem, but all my problems started when I downloaded the last update, Windows<strong> 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems
 (KB3199209)Friday night on 10/23/16</strong>
<p>
</p><p>The first time I had&nbsp;the&nbsp;shut down is when I was using Quicken 16 deluxe&nbsp;every time that I would click on a file in&nbsp;Quicken my PC was shut down. I deleted Quicken, PC did not&nbsp; shut&nbsp;back down when I clicked on other files, I reinstall&nbsp; Quicken last night
 and did the mandatory update in Quicken,&nbsp; now when I click on a file in&nbsp;Quicken my PC does not shut down, but I'm still having an issue that when the PC is idle it will shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was just wondering if anyone else was having the same problem, after&nbsp; they install Windows 10 version 1607&nbsp;for X 64 – based systems&nbsp; (KB3199209)&nbsp; and is using Quicken 16 deluxe,&nbsp;like I said, I do not know if this&nbsp;is&nbsp;the problem but it never hurts to ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Richard</p>

    <title>How to reset what Cortana calls you. &#91;Bugged&#63;&#93; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr. alternative  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to reset what Cortana calls you. &#91;Bugged&#63;&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so I know what the mods are going to say, though I know they will say it anyways. It seems they never pay attention to the actual problems in my experience, just the titles, so question is for anyone who might
<em>actually </em>be willing and able to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Cortana has bugged on me as I cannot change what she calls me. I've tried going under Notebook&gt;About Me&gt;Change Name. While going through that process, she will pronounce whatever i put there correctly, but when I click
<strong>DONE </strong>all that changes is the text, not what she actually says. For example, if I change my name to "Chief" (going back to the default) and ask her what my name is, the screen will show," You are Chief", but she will say, "You are Fuko-".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the reason I'm having this problem in the first place is she bugged out when I tried to teach her that my name was "Fukurou"(the Japanese word for owl). When I couldn't get her to pronounce it right, I gave up and immediately tried to change it to
 something else, but, from that point on, she will not change it no matter what I do.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried turning her off, deleting what she knows about me from the cloud, going through the proper "change name" sequence the mods will tell me, restarting my computer, and all the combinations thereof that I could possible imagine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions, or is she just broken beyond repair now?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused with Windows updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Few more details would help us to provide a better response.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. After upgrading to Windows 10, did you update the drivers?</p>
<p><span>2. <strong>What are the other troubleshooting steps that you tried to resolve the issue?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>3. Which model of gateway computer are you using?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 1: I suggest you to visit the computer manufacturer website to check for the latest BIOS version &amp; chipset driver and install it to check if it helps.

<p>Windowss 10 was working great, but after every Microsoft&nbsp; update the computer goes to restart, but doesn't finish.&nbsp; Nothing is happening.&nbsp; I have to shut down computer by pulling plug, /and then plug it back on and hit the ON button.&nbsp; It then finishes booting
 and updating.&nbsp; I posted on another site and they recomended an fresh install using the Media Creation Tool.&nbsp; Did that and everything was OK.&nbsp; Then last night there was an update, and It wouldn't finish and boot up.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. After upgrading to Windows 10, did you update the drivers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes updated drivers-&nbsp; couldn't find any new ones.</p>
<p><span>2.
<strong>What are the other troubleshooting steps that you tried to resolve the issue?</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Re installed a new copy of windows 10 using media creation tool</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>booted into safe mode --&nbsp; booted OK</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Ran CHKDSK&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; found no issues</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>used System File Checker - no issues reported</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>downloaded Windows Update Diagonistic Hotfix -&nbsp; nothing</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>ran Windows update troubleshooter.cchanged my Power options</strong></span></p>
<p><span>3. Which model of gateway computer are you using?</span></p>
<p>Gateway RS</p>
<p>BIOS American Megatrends&nbsp; p01-a4-</p>
<p>8 gran</p>
<p>1 terr hard drive</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 1: I suggest you to visit the computer manufacturer website to check for the latest BIOS version &amp; chipset driver and install it to check if it helps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My computer will boot up from&nbsp; restart and will also boot up from cold boot up.&nbsp; I will not know if it will finish booting
 after a Microsoft update until the next windows 10 update, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>BIOS Disclaimer: </span>
</strong></p>
<p>I haven't checked for update to BIOS</p>
<p><strong><span>I don't want to mess with the BIOS.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cmmputer was working great with 8.1, great after the first install of Windows 10, and then after 1st major update,&nbsp; problem started.&nbsp; I just want it to finshthe
 boot proscess and not have to pull plug, and turn it back on after every update.</span></strong></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for sharing us the details. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try simple steps, as you said you could not find any new driver. I suggest you to go to the computer manufacturer website download all the latest updated device driver and install the same in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Right-click on the setup file of the driver and select<strong> Properties</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Check Run this program in <strong>Compatibility mode</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>If that does not helps, I would recommend you to do a system repair using Media creation tool. Download and create Windows 10 ISO from the below link.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you complete creating media. Insert the Windows installation DVD in the DVD ROM and restart your computer.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After you boot the computer using Windows DVD, a black screen appears with gray text "<strong>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD".</strong> Press any key<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select the correct time and Keyboard type. </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>Repair your computer</strong> in the lower left corner.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> from <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click <strong>Advanced options</strong> in <strong>Troubleshoot screen</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click <strong>Startup Repair</strong> from <strong>Advanced Options

</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Next, choose the operating system by clicking on its button.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows will look for problems on hard drives and verify that all required files are intact.</p>

 Then either the computer will finish re-booting up, or it will not.&nbsp; I will let you know how it goes.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

</p>
<p>Or do do have any other way to fix this.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I did not do a clean install.&nbsp; It asked if I wanted to save my files and apps and I chose yes.&nbsp; Should I have done a clean install.?</p>

    <title>Lost sound after upgrade to Windows 7 due to error code 10. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fred1210  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost sound after upgrade to Windows 7 due to error code 10.</h2>
                    
<p><span><span><span>My daughter and grandchildren emigrated to NZ two weeks ago and I cannot use Skype properly because&nbsp;I cannot get sound.&nbsp;
 The driver&nbsp;has Error code 10 which prevents it running.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I have a Creative Labs Audigy 2 audio card.&nbsp; The driver is Creative Audigy Audio Processor (WDM) version 6.0.1.1241.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Before switching to Window 7 recently I ran Upgrade Adviser which told me that, with the latest driver, the card would be
 W7 compatible.&nbsp; I have run it since and it now confirms 100% compatibility with the new driver.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Most sites I have visited suggest getting the latest driver which, of course, I already have.&nbsp; I have tried un-installing
 and re-installing many times to no avail. Most frustrating!</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I am not a bright spark with computers but I generally manage to find my way around them but this has got me really baffled.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Help solving the problem would be greatly appreciated.</span></span></p>

<p>What seemed to work was installing the Windows 7 drivers from Creative using the compatibility option.</p>
<p>There appears to be Windows 7 drivers for Audigy 2&nbsp;using the&nbsp;following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.creative.com/Products/product_list.aspx?catID=1&amp;CatName=Sound+Blaster" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.creative.com/Products/product_list.aspx?catID=1&amp;CatName=Sound+Blaster</a></p>
<p>You could try that but try first without using the compatibility option.</p>
<p>If you can, uninstall the older drivers using "Uninstall a program" beforehand.</p>
<p>You may also want to create a System Restore point beforehand.</p>

            <p><span>Hi HillarySecond,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can try </span></span><span><span>booting from Windows Vista installation disc and<span> try performing a startup repair.</span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For further information, you can refer to the link below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What are the system recovery options in Windows Vista?</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-Vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-Vista</span></span></a><span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If startup repair failes, then try running a check disk.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: When you run the check disk, there are chances of losing data so you can take a backup before running checkdisk.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Insert the installation disc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Restart your computer. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart. If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: If your computer is not configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer. You may need to change your computer's BIOS settings. For more information, see BIOS: frequently asked questions.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Choose your language settings, and then click Next.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e. On the System Recovery Options menu, click Command Prompt</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>f. At a command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>chkdsk /f /r X:( drive letter)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: When you run the checkdisk, there are chances of losing data so you can take a backup before running checkdisk.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>g. Press Y when you are prompted to check the disk the next time that the system restarts.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>h. Restart the computer and check.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></p>

</p><p><span><span>There is no key code for Windows 10, as it is a free upgrade. It uses the previous Operating System key which was installed.

<p>
</p><p>Did this happen booting from the DVD, or running it, or the ISO from within Windows ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned "Burned to Disk... Started to Install"... this sounds like you booted from the disk, which won't work... Correct me if I'm mistaken...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even when my installations ask for a key... ( Clean Installs only ), there is a "Skip This Step" or "Do This Later" button... I don't see this on your image...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you download the RTM ISO, or a Insider Preview ? They both have a build 10240.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It seems you must first do an upgrade, bypassing the key screen, then wait for MS to activate Windows 10 upgrade.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only them can you do a clean install.</p>
<p>

 do not get the query for the key code but obviously something is different in my circumstances.</p>

    <title>Second monitor doesn&#39;t always display&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevodaflygon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Second monitor doesn&#39;t always display&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The computer detects it and basically says there's nothing wrong with it, but sometimes it doesn't display.</p>
<p>It stops working after I turn off the computer or let it go to sleep mode, but only sometimes.</p>
<p>I can usually get it working again after troubleshooting, disconnecting and reconnecting some cords, or playing around with the display or resolution settings.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting says there's no problem and my drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>It's getting frustrating.</p>
<p>Any ideas as to what's causing it?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I have the same problem that after reboot, morning startup or after sleep the second monitor, that I have selected as my main display, quite often (not always) seems to have been forgotten. I am using an HP ProBook6560b laptop and a Samsung Syncmaster P2250
 display as my second display. It is connected with the analog monitor cable and the computer KNOWS that it is connected to this monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I mean is that I can find the monitor and its drivers onboard and it is listed in devices attached to this computer.</p>

<p>First, are you saying your game gave you 2 red rings of death? I don't quite understand what you meant there. Can you still play other games, or will your console always show those 2 rings?</p>
<p>Second, if you're not banned from LIVE (which looks like you aren't) it means you have a certain game ban. Xbox doesn't have anything to do with this. I'd try contacting 2K Games/2K Sports if you're trying to appeal for your game ban.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say this was an unfair ban. 2K Games just wants less hackers in their games and make it fair for all of all of their players. Xbox has started to do this too (thank goodness) on all of their games. It's just a process they're doing right now.
 They're trying to get rid of all the modders and stuff in their games.</p>
<p><b>EA did not make NBA2K11. Contact 2K Games about this. You can Google them and find their site.</b></p>

<p><em>Help you out?, I think not.<br />
<br />
I&nbsp;was stating facts from what you had written in your post, or was that inaccurate?.<br />
Would you prefer to be mollycoddled and lied to?.&nbsp;Maybe I should have replied with&nbsp;'yes of course they will lift the ban now that you are sorry', you are sorry you were caught, simple!.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Its quite simple really you should have helped yourself out by not cheating in the first place, and you deserve what you get. I am happy to hear they are policing their games and preventing cheats from gaining access to them. The more game developers who do
 this the better the service will be for honest gamers.<br />
<br />
And no one here can help you anyway you would need to talk to the people who banned you in the first place. And why would they lift a ban when it was obviously justified to begin with?.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have two consistent bug checks:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION (133)</strong></span><br />
<br />
<em>This bug check indicates that the DPC watchdog executed, either because it detected a single long-running deferred procedure call (DPC), or because the system spent a prolonged time at an interrupt request level (IRQL) of DISPATCH_LEVEL or above.
</em><br />
</p>
<p>We cannot in-depth debug this type of bug check as a kernel-dump is required. Not a problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">--------------------</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The next bug check is <em><strong>A0000001</strong></em> which is specifically an ATI/AMD based bug check. If we take a look at the call stack, we can see the AMD video driver called directly into the bug check as opposed to Windows going through its traditional
 fault handling, etc:<br />

            <p>Sure, I've unmarked my post as the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll need a kernel-dump, please + Driver Verifier enabled:</p>

<strong>2.</strong> <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Driver Verifier:</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<strong>What is Driver Verifier?</strong><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8/8.1, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows
 kernel-mode components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</strong><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How to enable Driver Verifier:</strong><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
<strong>6.</strong> Check EVERY box that is <strong>NOT </strong>provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
<strong>7.</strong> Click on Finish.<br />
<strong>8.</strong> Restart.<br />
<br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD. To expand on this a bit more for the interested, specifically what Driver Verifier actually does is it looks for any driver making illegal function calls. When and/if this happens, system corruption
 occurs if allowed to continue. When Driver Verifier is enabled, it is monitoring
<em><strong>all </strong></em>3rd party drivers (as we have it set that way) and when it catches a driver attempting to do this, it will quickly flag that driver as being a troublemaker, and bring down the system safely before any corruption can occur.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will detect it in violation almost straight away, and
 as stated above, that will cause / force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <strong>not</strong> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
If your OS became corrupt or you cannot boot into Windows after disabling verifier via Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
<br />
-- Note that Safe Mode for Windows 8 is a bit different, and you may need to try different methods:

5 Ways to Boot into Safe Mode in Windows 8 &amp; Windows 8.1</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</strong><br />
<br />
I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier. I will usually say whether or not I'd like for you to keep it enabled any longer.<br />
<br />
<strong>My system BSOD'd with Driver Verifier enabled, where can I find the crash dumps?</strong><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />

<p>I have a Halo 3 Green 360. The one from 2007. Now I have just read that a small % of old 360s will break with this new update. Microsoft will know and replace it with a new 360s. Now if it dose break my halo 360. What are the chances Microsoft will replace
 it with the silver Halo Reach 360 lol. </p>

<h3> ignaciokaracsonyi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 doesn&#39;t recognize installation in 2nd drive</h2>
                    <p>So, I had windows 10 installed in let's call it HDD "A". I bought a solid hard drive, (let's call it "B") and installed&nbsp;windows 10 on that one. I decided that disk&nbsp;A was more useful as data storage than&nbsp;having 2 windows 10 installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Windows 10 and its&nbsp;file explorer of disk "B",&nbsp;I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;delete the files in disk "A"&nbsp;(which has the installation of Windows&nbsp;10 I no longer want). I couldn't. I tried to format it.&nbsp;Didn't work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used my Windows 7 installation disk to access the repair menu during boot. Using that, I formatted and deleted all the partitions on disk "A". Once I restarted the computer, disk "B" is no longer recognized as windows and the computer doesn't boot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I thought about reinstalling windows 7, and upgrading to 10 once again in disk "A" so I can once again choose&nbsp;between using Windows 10 in "A" or "B" as before. But now, my new Windows 10 in disk "A" also doesn't recognize my disk "B" as a windows. All
 my information is stored in disk "B". </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can access the Windows 10 in disk "B" and use it?</p>

            Yes, you can delete the $NtUninstallKB... files and any related $NtServicePackUninstall$ folders and files, if you wish. Those are mostly uninstall files from Windows Update and service packs. You need these files only if you might ever want to roll back
 or uninstall a Service Pack or update.<br />
<br />
If you're going to keep a given patch or update, the uninstall files serve no further purpose. Just delete them as you would any other file or folder. (Note: Windows will correctly prevent the deletion of any of those files that are still needed for one reason
 or another.<br />
<br />
The fixes will still be listed in XP's Add or Remove Programs Control Panel applet. To remove their entries, open the program, check Show updates at the top of the window, scroll to Windows XP - Software Updates, select each one at a time, and click Remove.
 (Or, just leave them there in case you do find you want to bring some of them back.)<br />
<br />
You'll get an error message telling you the file has already been deleted. Click Yes and move on to the next one. Just be sure not to accidentally uninstall an update that you haven't already deleted. If the Software Update Removal Wizard opens rather than
 the "already deleted" error message, click Cancel.<br />
<br />
You may also want to burn them all to CD or copy to an external drive to hang onto before deleting them.

<p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Sorry to hear you are having this problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If you're having this issue on your Xbox One, I recommend you to perform a hard reset on your console:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.&nbsp; Unplug the power cord from the back of the console
 for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Plug the power cord back in and restart the console.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That is a password error code on Xbox.&nbsp; I would check the Xbox Live status page first and if there are no issues follow the below recommendation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Cannot purchase several 360s&#38;&#35;39&#59; games through backward compatibility</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Having trouble purchasing games through backward compatibility. Tried both through PC and Xbox. It shows message "<span>currently purchase not available. try again later".</span></p>
<p><span>Tried different games and what I've found:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Successfull purchase - Blood Forge, Castlevania, Aqua, Gears of War: Judgement, Red Faction:Battlegrounds and Iron Brigade</span></p>
<p><span>2. Unsuccessfull purchse - Mass Effect, Halo Wars, Supreme Commander</span></p>
<p><span>So please advise what's going on. I'm located in Kazakhstan, but there is no such region in setting, so I put Russia instead. Everything is working except some purchases of 360's games as listed.</span></p>
<p><span>Best regards,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Dan</span></p>

<p>If there is no official Xbox Live support in Kazakhstan then this cannot be resolved as Support and especially in this case Store Support is only available for officially supported regions.
</p>
<p>Probably a region mismatch between your card used to purchase and the console region.
</p>
<p>The games are to blame as the ones bought successfully are probably not region restricted and the ones it won't let you purchase are. The game publishers decide what restrictions to place on the content they own and Microsoft only enforces those restrictions
 in the various stores.</p>
<p>Possibly a way around this would be to purchase Microsoft points, redeem them on your account and then use a PC or an Xbox 360 to purchase the content. Once purchased you would be able to download and play on Xbox One. That way you wouldn't run into a region
 mismatch between card and console. I think...</p>

<p>Press and hold the Xbox button on your controller, when the options menu pops select report a problem on the right of the menu to make the Xbox ream aware of your issue.</p>

<p>They are aware of the issue if you read the above answrr he is correct a lot of the games the op named are region locked</p>
<p>The only way to get 100% download is to live in an xbox live region </p>

<p>Its also part of the terms of use</p>
<p>Any suggestion otherwise is a violation of the terms of use for circumventing the controls.of.zbox live</p>
<p>And no using ms points won't work</p>
<p>Region locks are applied.to.the games themselves and are legally enforceable</p>

<p>I wasn't sure about using MS points but I'm sure you are correct. Thanks.</p>
<p>Valkyrie your approach only works if someone is in Preview. The regular Xbox One OS doesn't have that feature.</p>
