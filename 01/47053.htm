            Having the exact same problem downloading the non-Pro version of Windows 8.1 on a Toshiba Satellite C855D. &nbsp;The download gets to the point where it is about to install, and then no joy. &nbsp;Got the following error code (quoted verbatim):

<p>New try: Same fail</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) ) Asked MS help desk</p>
<p>They tweaked my PC remotely</p>
<p>New try: Same fail</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <blockquote>I have the same issue on a dell xps. After some try and error I also found a windows update that does not work and thus stayed in the pipline. Its the KB2756872. I tried for hours to solve this problem, because it might be connected
 to the 0x80073bc3, until now with no success. I tried all the tools and solutions available. Hope that Microsoft will fix this issue soon.
</blockquote>
MarcoZanoli,
<div><br />
<div>I have exactly same issue as you. KB2756872 has NEVER installed on my Dell XPS8500. I have the same error code as you also when trying the upgrade from 8 to 8.1. I too believe that the issues are connected. Could you check to see if you can also run the
 "Refresh your PC without affecting your files" option in the "Settings/Change PC , Settings/General" options as I can't do that either and I'm sure it's all connected When I try to do it, I get a message saying "some files are missing -insert your media" or
 something similar. My situation is that I bought a Dell XPS8500 about 2 months before Windows 8 came out so got the option to upgrade as part of the deal when 8 came out. The PC would NEVER upgrade directly from Windows 7 to 8 using the upgrade assistant and
 I had to download the files on to USB stick and then only option that would work was a clean install. I could also never install the WIndows Media Upgrade from the store despite having a valid licence key, Every time I tried to do it, it just failed. With
 the KB2756872m it very briefly flashes saying that it 100% complete and then saying "failure configuring updates- reverting...." I've tried EVERYTHING -updating drivers, uninstalling sound cards etc, unplugging all external devices and nothing seems to work.
 Now not being able to upgrade to 8.1 is the last straw!!</div>

            Hallo Colin - I have a similar story indeed. My Dell XPS one 27 came with Win7 and an upgrade option. I upgraded after a while because there where issues with the computer that I hoped to solve through an update. It worked fine through the store - nevertheless
 I had to send in the computer later anyway because the issue continued. Dell changed the harddrive and the motherboard and I got it back with a clean win8. Unfortunately the first thing I noticed was that the win update did not work and it took me quite a
 while to figure out that the cause was KB2756872. I tried everything you did as well - exept a complete fresh installation. Since I did this already 4 times in the last couple of months I am sick of it and decided to wait for 8.1. Now, I am quite disappointed
 that it did not work. My conclusion: I will never buy a Dell computer again, and also never a All in One system again!

            <p>I don't think the problem is with Dell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is: Microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd three calls with MS about this problem and they didn't help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the Engineer came to me with a discourse about: Windows work with all kind of PCs meanwhile Apple work with the same hardware, so is hard to achieve all the PCs...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please,&nbsp;work with all kind of PCs is the Windows force and merit. Unless I did believe that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If&nbsp;the costumer want to work only with one kind of hardware probably he'll go to the&nbsp;MS&nbsp;competitor</p>

            I had this problem on a laptop and the thing that was wrong was that the hard drive partition was not set to active. You need to start up program for formatting&nbsp; and managing hard disk partitions and click on make partition active. Once I did this the
 Windows update file loaded and then the Windows 8.1 loaded from the Windows shop.

            <p>Hi Moose,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you got any address reservations on your router?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also check your DHCP/DNS settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel &gt; Network and Internet &gt; Network and Sharing Center &gt; Select the connection &gt; Properties &gt; Scroll to Internet Protocol Layer IPv4 &gt;Properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that you are obtaining an IP address automatically by selecting that in the button, and that your DNS is configured automatically. Unless you have a reason for it to be otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how that goes.<br />

    <title>How to stop Windows 7 from installing a security update&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> krarkrrrc  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to stop Windows 7 from installing a security update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'll start off by saying I have a legitimate copy of Windows 7 that I can prove I bought if needed.&nbsp; I'm not trying to get around pirating the os in any way.<br />
<br />
That said, the latest security update KB3207752 has rendered my focusrite scarlett 8i6 soundcard unusable - a card which is no longer supported by focusrite, does not have open source drivers, and will not be receiving any more software updates.<br />
<br />
When I uninstall this update the card works normally.&nbsp; I have turned off all auto-update options in the action center that I have found and yet this update still gets silently installed at some point in the day, apparently by a background process, without any
 alert, and without any need for the computer to be restarted.<br />
<br />
I'm at the point now where I have to uninstall this update every morning and restart the computer just to use my soundcard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What settings do I need to change to prevent this update?</p>

            <p>It is a rollup file and fixes a number of security&nbsp;issues so should really be applied and a fix sought from Focusrite</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said that turn off automatic updates altogether and uninstall this update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Manually run Windows update, find the update in the list and right click, select hide. This should stop the update being applied. Turn back on updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only caveat is sometimes Microsoft "updates" the update so ends up being seen as a new version and then gets applied.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I get that it's a security fix and no doubt beneficial to most users but as you can see in my case I don't have a usable computer with it installed.&nbsp; It's breaking software that is no longer being maintained by the company that made it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That caveat is going to be extremely annoying if this pattern of silently updating in the background continues.&nbsp; Windows update has reported it last updated on 4/12/17, yet I've had to uninstall this update every day since.&nbsp; All this despite setting "Never
 check for updates, never install automatically".&nbsp; Is there something I'm missing here?&nbsp; Is an automatic update setting turned on somewhere else?</p>

            This morning it was installed again, and just uninstalling it and then restarting would not get rid of it alone.&nbsp; I actually had to disconnect my internet before restart.&nbsp; So on startup Windows is connecting to the internet and making sure this gets installed.&nbsp;
 I guess the days of trusting my computer and having it do what I want are over.&nbsp; Fantastic.

            <p>Then you need to clean it off and then immediately do the manual update so you can get the list of ones outstanding. Only when you have it as a list can you choose to hide an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The caveat is not certain, just&nbsp;I know it has happened in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I make the point about it being needed solely to be complete. Blocking an update is a workaround not a fix (a distinction even Microsoft seem to struggle with at times).</p>

                    <p>Dear experts,</p>
<p>I had an issue with my notebook&nbsp; and my HDD was damaged. So i had to install a new one. I dowloaded the Microsoft Win 8.1&nbsp; ISO in order to make a fresh installation. The windows key is embedded in my Bios still when i try to install Win8.1 it requests a
 key. Is there another valid version that i can download which will get the key from the bios automatically?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

            Try using one of the following default keys to get the installation going. You can then change to your OEM key after setup:
<br />
<br />Windows 8.1 retail can be evaluated by use of generic product keys:
<br />
<br />    Core/Home=334NH-RXG76-64THK-C7CKG-D3VPT
<br />    Core/Home Single Language=Y9NXP-XT8MV-PT9TG-97CT3-9D6TC

<br />    Professional with Media Centre=GBFNG-2X3TC-8R27F-RMKYB-JK7QT
<br />
<br />Make sure you choose the right edition.
<br />
<br />After setup:
<br />Windows 8.0, Windows 8.1  came preinstalled on my computer, how do I find the product key?
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Command Prompt (admin)
<br />
<br />Enter the following command:
<br />wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />The product key will be revealed, copy the product key then enter it

    <title>Synaptics Driver issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> foxzes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Synaptics Driver issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My new laptop is great 'n' all, however, It has one issue with synaptics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plan to play games and other things on this, meaning pressing keys and moving my mouse at the same time is something I'd need to be able to do.</p>
<p>Normally, with all other laptops I've had, you open mouse settings and allow this.</p>
<p>For some reason this isn't an option anymore. I'm not sure whether its just my laptop or synaptics in general now,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have a solution?</p>
<p>is there a version of synaptics I can install that will allow me to press keys and move my mouse at the same time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>It started when I bought this laptop</p>
<p>I keep getting updates, but that's only because windows wants to reinstall synaptics when I uninstall it to temperately fix the problem</p>
<p>and no, I haven't done any troubleshooting steps&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its still not working.</p>
<p>I've followed every tutorial I can find, Obviously Ive put no delay (always on) Touchpad&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I've put smartsense on minimum</p>
<p>this has reduced the issue, but whenever I move around my mouse and press a key the mouse stops</p>
<p>only for a brief moment, but this is still a HUGE issue when it comes to things like gaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please help? I've tried for hours, and found no solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it be possible to uninstall this current version and install one that will allow me to fix this?</p>
<p>I really don't know, I'm not a wizard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankyou!!</p>

                    <p>Hi there&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i just put together a new pc. made sure i put all the drivers, and updated windows 10 fully.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Intel Services Manager preventing proper shut down of computer</h2>
                    My computer is running on Windows 8.1 and whenever I try to shut down, a message will pop up that an application remains opened. I have to cancel the shut down and upon cancelling, I noted that Intel Services Manager is the application that always prevent
 the proper shut down. I have to manually close it before system could shut down properly. Appreciate advice on how to resolve this problem so shut down could proceed smoothly. Thanks!

            <p>I performed a clean boot, and the problem persisted. I can only get a proper shutdown after hitting "cancel" when it gives you and improper shutdown prompt, and then I have to close intel services manager with task manager. Any ways to troubleshoot?</p>

<p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This feature allows you to connect two or more networks together and allows you join a network connection when you can’t directly connect them to a switch or router. Since you are able to bridge these together and you are unable to get Internet connection,
 we recommend that you contact your Internet Service Provider first to see if you miss some certain settings that is needed for the network bridge.
</span></p>

<h2>            Halo 5&#58; Guardians F.A.Q&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings, Spartans! It's that incredibly exciting time we've all been waiting for. Three years have passed since our last adventure with the Master Chief, and a lot has changed. To gear up for the release for Halo 5: Guardians, we've prepared an F.A.Q to
 cover all of the questions you may have. One question remains that is up to you to answer; is the Master Chief a hero, or is he a traitor?</p>

<p><b>Q:</b> <b><i>When will Halo 5: Guardians be released?</i></b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>Halo 5: Guardians will be released on October 27th, 2015! If you wish to start downloading the game early to be set to go right as it launches, Pre-order Halo 5: Guardians today!</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Q: </b><b><i>What can players expect with Halo 5: Guardians' campaign? </i>
</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>A lot has gone down since the events of Halo 4, and the Master Chief may be in a little bit of trouble. Spartan Locke, one of the highest ranked Spartans in the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), is leading Fireteam Osiris to search for the Master
 Chief to bring him in. While Spartan Locke is on the hunt, Master Chief is leading his own squad, known as 'Blue Team', to carry out Master Chief's mission to stop the biggest threat in the galaxy.</p>

<h2>            Shutdown Failure with Windows 10</h2>
                    I upgraded my wife's computer from 8.1 to 10.&nbsp; Now, when I click "Shut Down" the computers actually does a restart.&nbsp; The only way to get it to completely shut down is to press and hold the power button after the screen goes black.&nbsp; How can I correct this?&nbsp;
 Can I simply "re-install" windows 10?&nbsp; And if so, how?

<h2>            Unable to download Xbox 360 gamer profile when playing any Xbox 360 game on Xbox One.</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have searched far and wide and spent many hours trying to resolve this without much success.</p>
<p>Connected via NBN FTTN with Telstra on Standard Evening Speed plan (avg 45Mbps download) confirmed via SpeedTest.</p>
<p>I am connected to the network via Wired connection, have tested with console connected direct to modem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabled IPv6 on my modem.</p>
<p>Opened up all recommended ports.</p>
<p>Added Xbox One to DMZ.</p>
<p>Set static IP on Xbox One and in modem.</p>
<p>NAT Type: Open</p>
<p>All services are available.</p>
<p>Network test via Xbox states Everything is good. Your console is connected to the internet.</p>
<p>NAT test says All done. It looks like your NAT type is Open right now.</p>
<p>Testing multiplayer connection results in 100% packet loss, and occasionally a Teredo address error. Also a network quality error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Detailed network stats test reveals:</p>
<p>Download speed 40.30Mbps</p>
<p>Upload speed 7.95Mbps</p>
<p>Packet loss 100%</p>
<p>MTU 1480</p>
<p>Latency 132ms</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have cleared Xbox 360 cache.</p>
<p>Have power cycled modem several times with no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reset modem to factory, lo and behold I was able to connect to Xbox Live via Xbox 360 emulator and download my profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a session of gaming I turned the console off as normal and went to bed, then work next day.</p>
<p>Came home wanting some Far Cry 2 therapy (which I had been able to play in the last session), only to find the dreaded "Getting your Xbox 360 info" screen, and the spinning circle of doom and no progress, which faded to grey and then entered the game screen.
 Pressed the buttons to open the Xbox Guide, only to find no profile! Go to download profile, and the dreaded "Checking network status" and spinning circle of doom. Then goes to screen stating "Can't connect to Xbox Live. Select Test Connection to troubleshoot
 your connection." When I test the connection as instructed, I get the "Everything is good, your console is connected to the Internet".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another factory reset of the modem but this time I still can't connect. Gone through all the steps as before but this time I can't get to my Xbox 360 Xbox Live profile at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to sign in to my gamer tag on the Xbox One initial sign in, just not via the emulator. I'm quite tech savvy, but this is doing my head in big time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone aware of Telstra doing tricksy things in regards to Xbox Live traffic?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my knowledge you only have one gamer profile, so when you login on your XBox One, its the same profile as the one you were using on your 360, there arent two separate profiles between the two consoles.</p>

<p>Hey there Jo!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to redownload your account off of the emulator.
</p>
<p>Now after reading the steps that you have already performed, I would say that there are a couple of things that you can do try and resolve this problem.
</p>
<p>If you haven't already, then I would suggest trying the steps here on our support page entitled
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-playing-xbox-360-games-on-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshoot playing Xbox 360 games on your Xbox One</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If that does not do the
 trick, there's also this little trick that I like to do that resolves a bunch of general problems that you may have concerning your console. When you get a chance to go</span></span><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>Settings&gt;Disc
 &amp; Blu-ray&gt;Blu-ray&gt;Persistent storage </span></span><span><span>and
 clear it 3 times. After doing that, go to </span></span><span style="font-weight: bold"><span>Settings&gt;Network&gt;Network
 Settings&gt; Advanced Settings&gt; Alternate MAC address </span></span><span><span>and
 clear that alternate MAC. The console will say it needs to restart to apply the change, so let it do that and then try to download your profile again.&nbsp;]</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>When and if you get a chance, give those steps a try and let us know how that helped.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

<p>Unfortunately still no luck, tried the steps as mentioned, but still getting the Can’t connect to Xbox Live message.</p>
<p>All tests same as before.</p>
<p>Only thing I haven’t done is factory reset the Xbox One, I’ll give that a go and see what happens!</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice everyone, I’ll let you know how it goes.</p>

<p>So reset the Xbox One but kept all info - still no luck with signing in to emulator, despite the setup procedure recognising I had some Xbox 360 account information and offering to set it up automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reset and removed all info - still no luck! This is insanely frustrating and doesn’t make much sense!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will research more and try to find a solution...any ideas welcome at this stage!</p>

            I do not want to know what it is but make sure your password is not longer then 16 characters I know the 360 consoles including the emulator do not like passwords longer then 16 characters. If it is longer then 16 characters you will want to change it
 to something less then 16 characters.

    <title>Billing Account Locked...still wait for help 1 week later - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Billing Account Locked...still wait for help 1 week later &#38;gt&#59;&#58;&#124;</h2>
                    
<p>So I accidentally let my Xbox Live run out on 7/7. (I had a prepaid card for 12 months) So I buy another one on 7/8 and try to input the code. Message pops up that my "billing account has been locked. Please call Microsoft so we can fix this". I call and
 the support guy tells me nothing looks out of the ordinary. He was going to tell the Advocacy team and they would contact me 72 hours later. I wait until 7/11 and no phone call or email. I get on chat instead of waiting 30 minutes on the phone. Same thing
 was told to me and to wait at least 24 more hours. The chat support member tried to get me to update my security proofs and said if I did that I couldn't do Xbox Live for another 30 days if I went that route. So I said no obviously, all I want to do is unlock
 my account. Well I had to work 2 straight days and wait until 48 hours passed before I called again on 7/13. At this point I am furious and yet again the support agent can't get me to talk to anyone to help me at all and told me to keep waiting. Wtf is going
 on? Can someone in this company help me? Btw its been a week -.-&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Venseti,<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, we're not able to look into why you're seeing this message. Only phone support would be able to assist with a particular issue like this. I'm not sure what's going on or why it's taking them so long but you may want to contact phone support and
 speak with their billing department as the "billing locked" is well within their area of expertise.<br />
<br />
I can however tell you that this issue is related to leaving automatic renewal on your account with a payment method that can't cover the cost of the renewal. Have you checked your billing information to check that everything was proper? You can do so
<strong><a href="http://commerce.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. Once you've done that, you'll want to contact phone support and speak directly with their billing department by visiting this link
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yeah, even using those links doesn't allow you to change your payment options. I wanted to change form PayPal to my debit card. No dice. Had this problem last year, too. I've never experienced so much trouble trying to give my money away. I've been with
 Mac on computers for years because of crap like this with Windows. Guess it's time for a switch to Playstation. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            how to completely get rid of windows 10</h2>
                    I updated to windows 10 and hate it. So since there is an option to go back to windows 8 I did, but now every time I turn on my laptop windows 10 tries to automatically install. How do I stop this without stopping any other updates from installing. I just
 just flat out dont want anything about windows 10 on my laptop. I already unistalled other updates that have been recommended and its not working

            <p>I am so disappointed in this company --- where do you get the right to come into my computer and change it without my permission.&nbsp; you were suppose to get an okay to change to windows 10 -- I DID NOT GIVE IT. GET IT OFF MY COMPUTER NOW.

<p>
</p><p>windows 10 gives a person absolutely no options and messes up the programs installed on my computer.&nbsp; I have lost</p>

            <p>you gave permission by running windows&nbsp; in default OOBE settings and windows update in full auto<br />
<br />
Never Ever set windows update for win 8.1 and previous to automatic<br />
always use option 2 or 3<br />
<br />
which looks like this in win 7 (white text inserted into image)<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>after setting windows update to option 2 or 3 you can then choose to hide any "updates" related to winders 10

            <p>Debra, Just got to agree with you completely, everything you say has happened to me , I never asked for the program it just started downloading whilst I was doing something on line and I lost everything, I was just about getting used to windows 8 and now
 this monster has really screwed up my computer, my wife has had a notice to say they are going to do the same with her laptop and if she doesn't like it she can revert to 8 within 31 days, But no info on how you can do this</p>

<h2>            Display Driver nvlddmkm stopped responding, has successfully recovered</h2>
                    
<p>HI<br />
<br />
Im currently having this error everytime i play my games, i had already re formated my computer and installed a fresh copy of vista and dowloaded the latest nvidia driver for my card , i think its version 185 the latest one and still having issues , i was previously
 using XP SP3, when i first encountered the error , i was able to play games for about 2 month with out issues , thinking that sp3 was not stable thats why i upgraded to vista ultimate but it happened again with just the vista os , board and video card driver,
 and the game ,im thinking its a hardware issue since there are a lot of hits an posts at diff forums , i havent tried troubleshooting hardware but if its a software issue hope theres a fix that and is just a dowload away , i saw a link from one of your KB
 article "Windows6.0-KB938194-x86.msu" and its date back 2007 , is there an updated patch like this since even now people are still having trouble with this issue 2 years after , is there any possibility that this is a hardware issue and just have it checked
 out by my&nbsp;pc retailer ???? i know i have alot of questions and im just tired and frustrated&nbsp;troubleshooting&nbsp;my pc&nbsp;. I havent tried un installing the drivers on safemode but will try when i get home , just tried it on ordinary boot&nbsp;. hope this will be the answer!!!
 will give you updates&nbsp;.<br />
<br />
Thanks very much for your timely response<br />

If you were running fine, and are now starting to see this, I suspect overheating. Have you blown out the heatsink/fan on your video card?
