<h2>            Seagate Backup Plus 4TB drive with Windows 10 stopped working</h2>
                    I have a Dell XPS (L502X) laptop with Windows 10 Pro. (Previously running Windows 7 Ultimate) Approximately 24 hours after upgrading to Windows 10 Pro my Seagate Backup Plus Desktop drive has stopped working. When the drive is connected it causes Windows
 Explorer to freeze. Looking at the device driver in Device Manager it shows a default Microsoft driver from 2006 is installed. How to update this device driver? When I run troubleshooter Windows says this is the recommended driver.

            I fixed my problem. I have a Seagate Backup Plus that wouldn't show up after I downloaded Windows 10. I uninstalled the "Paragon" software driver from uninstall programs menu in computer and re-downloaded it from Seagate website. WORKS PERFECT NOW! http://www.seagate.com/support/external-hard-drives/portable-hard-drives/goflex-pro-for-mac/backup-plus-mac-software-master/<br />

            I had the same problem with a Seagate Backup Plus (USB 3.0) external drive. Method 3 above worked perfectly for me - thanks! &nbsp;One word of caution to desktop PC owners (I have a Dell XPS 8700) with wireless keyboard and mouse like me. &nbsp;Be sure to un-install
 the Universal USB that connects the wireless keyboard/mouse to the PC last or before you start, plug in a wired keyboard and mouse if you have them. &nbsp;I got lucky - after I un-installed the "Intel(R) USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller - 1.0 (Microsoft)" universal
 USB, I lost control of my wireless keyboard and mouse. &nbsp;I shut off and turned on my PC manually and all of the universal USB drivers I had un-installed re-installed, was able to use my keyboard and mouse and got access to my Seagate drive.

            <p>I also have a Seagate Plus Slim drive I bought before my PC crashed and was forced up to Windows 10.</p>
<p>I was about to open the box and install the hard drive, but the messages indicate problems.
</p>
<p>I went to the compatability site linked above, and it is actually a Windows 10 selling site, if you try to use the support, etc links, it seems to come back to the page that will sell you products for windows 10.&nbsp;</p>

            My Seagate Backup Plus stopped working when I upgraded to MS 10. &nbsp;My Seagate Dashboard said the software (4.021.0) was up to date. &nbsp;My troubleshooter said the device was working properly. I FINALLY went to Seagate's website, which &nbsp;indicated that Seagate
 Backup Plus works with MS 10 ONLY for software versions 4.2.x or later. &nbsp;Soooo....guess I am out of luck with being able to use my existing backup drive. &nbsp;

            <p>Same problem with the Seagate Backup Plus drive.&nbsp; Reinstalling the Paragon drivers didn't work for me, nor did changing to generic USB drivers.&nbsp; Here's what worked for me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opened device manager and uninstalled the device</p>
<p>On the computer name at the top, I right clicked and selected Add Legacy Hardware</p>
<p>Clicked Next</p>
<p>Selected "Install the hardware that I manually select from a list"</p>
<p>Selected "Digital Media Devices"</p>
<p>Next</p>
<p>Choose Model "Digital Media Device"</p>
<p>Next</p>
<p>On "The wizard is ready to install your hardware" finish up the prompts to complete the install</p>
<p>I think it scanned for the device and added it, but I may have scanned for hardware changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, Device manager now shows a digital media device and Explorer shows the Seagate Backup Plus Drive&nbsp;where I can see my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing this,&nbsp;when I rebooted the computer&nbsp;I got a black screen that said "Bootmgr not found".&nbsp; When I&nbsp;disconnected the Seagate Backup drive it booted just fine.&nbsp; I plugged the drive back in, went into the BIOS and found the Seagate Backup drive first
 in the boot order, I made it&nbsp;the last boot device.&nbsp; I can reboot now with the drive connected.&nbsp; So far things seem to be working.</p>

            Kudos to you! &nbsp;This finally worked after I uninstalled everything I could find on my Surface 3 remotely related to Seagate. &nbsp;Then I went to Seagate's site &amp; reinstalled Dashboard, rebooted Surface 3, set up a new backup plan on Dashboard which -- after
 2 hours -- backed up my selected files. &nbsp;Yahoo! &nbsp;Thanks again.

            With over 2000 forked groups, this nearly becomes impossible. Personally an option to leave all forked groups at once would be prefered.

            I finally was able to get myself out of all those groups. It took a lot of pressing keys, and frustration, but in the end i managed. Since the end of life of skype 7 is nearly upon us, I do hope that forking in skype 8 is either non existing or limited
 9not forking a already forked group0 or 9one fork per non forked group0 or something, so that spammers can be stopped. I'm lucky i was able to opt out of all these groups, or I would have been forced to close down my account, and create a new one. Given the
 fact nothing of importance is linked with this account, except skype, i could live with that, but just imagine people who would have any skype balance left or anything, that would defenatly be a thorn in their side.<br />

<h2>            Brand New Controller, Right trigger squeaks </h2>
                    
<p>I purchased a Master Cheif Edition Xbox in August of this year online from Gamestop. I only play Destiny and as you should know it is an FPS. So I use the right trigger to shoot. The squeaking has become unbearable; I hear it above the game sounds now. I
 want to replace the controller, but I do not want to have to wait and be unable to play the game, as I only have one controller. What should I do?</p>

            <p>Hey ReXound!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear the sound is bothering you. Do you get any performance issues with the controller? The squeak isn't something that should inhibit your gaming, but if your controller is still within warranty then a Repair/Replacement is going to be your best option to clear up that sound.</p>
<p>To set up service for your controller head on over to <a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/Pages/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Online Service Center</a> and register your console and request a repair for an accessory.</p>

                    <p>Good morning,</p>
<p>On a customer's system, I've installed a program, which launches quite some WMI queries, for determining the status of the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regularly those WMI queries are failing, and in event logs, there are lots of errors (event ID 5858), hereby&nbsp;a typical&nbsp;example (I've obfuscated computer name, customer name and GUID for security reasons):</p>

<p><i><span>Just as a test, try playing a game that does not require a hard drive and that you have not installed to the hard drive. Now unplug the hard drive from the console, be sure it is OFF when you do this.
 Now turn the console ON and insert a game, not Black Ops or Halo as they need a hard drive to play, and see if it runs normally when you play it or if it lags. If it runs normally then the issue lies with your hard drive. One thing to check is how much space
 you have left on the hard drive. If it still lags even without the hard drive attached then I am out of suggestions.

<p>Try what @Temhotabot has said, and if that doesn't work, attempt to test your xbox live connection. To me, it's sounding as your internet may be slow, or its quite possible you are being paired with people with slower connections., which ultimately can cause
 you to lag.</p>

<h2>            Unable to launch Volume Mixer via taskbar</h2>
                    <p>*Original Title: Volume Mixer wont open</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't remember when this problem started, but I can no longer open the Volume Mixer through the taskbar. Volume Control and all other options work. It has become really inconvenient, as Chrome is now stuck at 10% or so volume. While it's not an issue using
 speakers, if I want to wear my headphones I have to raise their volume to 100%, even though I usually have them at 1% as they are otherwise painfully loud. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Signature always has drop shadow and placed inline</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am having problem with adding firm logo to signature. I am using html to create and edit signature, and also tried to create trough creating new email message and than saving as a html file. Result is the same. Windows Live Mail keeps doing the same
 thing every time, picture is with border set to "Drop shadow" and alignment set to "Inline". No matter what I do it's always the same. I need it to be without border and with alignment set to left. When I open html file in every internet browser or other email
 client programs everything is fine, just the Windows Live Mail 2012 is having a fit with html file. Any suggestions how to work around this?</p>

<h3> michaelc233  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Image Backup</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 10 Pro, 64bit on my laptop. Drive C is a Samsung SSD 850 Pro, 512 GB. I've been trying to create a system image backup for 2 months with no success. I get the popular error code 0x81000033 each time. My System Reserved space on drive
 C has a capacity of 104,853,504 bytes, 99.9MB. Used Space is 74,604,544, 71.1MB. Free Space is 30,248,960, 28.8MB.&nbsp; I understand from everything I read that I don't have enough space to create the volume shadow copy. I've ran Chkdsk and no errors were found.
 I've tried every single fix on the Windows Forum and other Windows related websites with no success. I don't understand why Microsoft can't fix this problem that's existed since Windows 7. Does anyone have a good fix for this????

            <p>I started Volume Shadow Copy and Windows Backup in Windows service. Both were listed with manual action. This did not help the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran Check Disk on drive C and it reported no errors. This did not help the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I turned off my third party anti virus/internet security completely. This did not help the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve gone to Disk Management and assigned a drive number (G) to the System Reserved space. Then I wrote a command prompt fsutil usn deletejournal /D /N G to delete the Change Journal. Iâ€™ve run this five times and keep getting a message that the action cannot
 be completed or the drive cannot be found. The G drive shows in Disk Management for System Reserved..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't figured out yet how to increase the space in System Reserved. Maybe that will help.</p>

            You can make an image with DISM or you can run the system imaging tool and run it to an external hard drive. That way your back up is off you computer if anything happens to your hard disk you wont lose your back up to.

            I am trying to create my system image on an external 1TB hard drive, always have done that. The file backup is already on the hard drive, the failure comes when the system tries to create the system image. I tried creating just a system image and get the
 same failure and error report.&nbsp; I created backups with system images on this laptop for 5 years with no problems. The problems started after I had the Samsung SSD 512GB drive installed as drive C and I installed Windows 10 about 3 months after the drive installation.
 The issue started with the Windows 10 installation. I haven't had any other issues with this drive and a friend had the same SSD installed on his laptop, running the same Windows version, and he hasn't had this issue.&nbsp; I briefly read over the DISM page. Can
 the Windows image created by the DISM process be used to reinstall my system in the case of a system failure?<br />

            That what dism meant to do on how i read it and all the things you can do with. It can get very technical with it. But you can always try a program like parted magic. to make copies. If your having troubles i would go ninite.com and see if there a program
 to use for that. &nbsp;

</p><p>Hi Shirlen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are aware of a problem that resulted in an incorrect driver update for some
<strong>AMD Radeon HD 2000, 3000, and 4000 series</strong> adapters.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>(Updated: 12/18/17)</strong></span></p>
<p>If you were impacted by the incorrect driver, Windows Update <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4057291/multi-monitor-display-and-display-resolution-not-working-for-amd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB4057291</a> has been released that will&nbsp;install a driver to restore multi-monitor display and resolution control capabilities. &nbsp;Go to<strong> Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security</strong>, then

<p>
</p><p>*****</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps for <strong>all versions of Windows 10</strong> to manually delete the
<strong>22.19.128.0 driver</strong> from the system and recover the recommended driver version (<strong>8.970.100.9001</strong>):</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Start <strong>Device Manager</strong>. To do this, press and hold (or right-click) the
<strong>Start Menu</strong> icon, and then select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Expand <strong>Display adapters</strong>, right-click the adapter that has the problem driver installed, and then select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>Driver</strong> tab and verify driver version is <strong>22.19.128.0</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Uninstall Device</strong>.</li><li>Check the box that says, "<strong>Delete the driver software for this device.</strong>â€ This step is important and will prevent the problematic driver from reinstalling in the future.</li><li>The system may require a reboot at this point. Reboot if needed, then reopen <strong>
Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Select any device, then click <strong>Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes</strong>.</li><li>Recheck the driver version.&nbsp; If it still reports <strong>22.19.128.0</strong>, repeat steps 4 to 7 until the recommended driver (<strong>8.970.100.9001</strong>) is re-installed.&nbsp; If this resolves your graphics problems, you can stop here.&nbsp; If a different
 driver version is installed, follow the next step to check for the driver using Windows Update. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security</strong>, then <strong>Check for updates</strong> and install any available updates.</li></ol>

 by bad sectors and could not migrate to a fresher hard drive as a result and it was more cost effective to just get a fresher box with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, so far so good but the issue now is Adobe CS4 Master Suite. I bought a legal licensed copy of it from a consultant that had a business copy with multiple licenses and was able to legally sell me one of his licenses and sent me a zipped ISO image
 on a DVD with product key and it's worked fine on Vista since 2009, just by replacing the amtlib.dll file with the correct one with my license), and briefly on Windows 7 (7 was obtained via an ISO image to buy time until I could do a complete upgrade) and
 it installed and worked on 7, no problem, at least Premier, Acrobat and Photoshop and media encoder anyway and now that I have Win 10 Pro (OEM), I can't get the Setup.exe file to run and install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not been able to force compatibility since it's not installing. BTW, I have read up of other solutions to installing CS4, but this is slightly different, and as I said, it installed fine on 7 the brief time I had it until I was forced back to Vista
 due to issues with the ailing hard drive. I also did an update of 10, thinking it might help, no go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files are zipped and I've used the default Zip7 to unzip and it seems to have unzipped fine and when I click on the executable file, nothing, just a notification to allow changes to the OS, yes, no. I click on yes and then nothing after that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally, it was zipped and unzipped using WinRaR so would that be an issue or does it matter?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>John.</p>

<p>Never mind,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I answered my own question. I HAD to download WinRaR to get the executable file to unzip. Once unzipped, the installer loaded and I installed what I needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, Premier opens and works in Windows 10, no problem, after I updated the amtlib.dll file with the correct one for my product key and it opens and so far, seems to work as it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will be testing other programs soon, but so far, so good.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 mystery</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 10 that was uploaded from w7. Sometime ago I was tricked into a computer tech company who installed supremo and came into the unit for a tune up. After about a year, he came back for a checkup. He said he found a ton of dll32 files and he
 wanted additional payment. He told me how serious this and then proceeded to request on his hand written notepad. I said he wasn't getting anymore. I guess this must have pissed him off. He left some kind of file with supremo on the machine. A while later,
 I fired up the unit and was surfing the net when all of a sudden I caught a flash of supremo come on the screen. I thought there was something fishy going so I immediately searched for and deleted it (after some research)!<br />
the computer starts up normally, runs fine for about two minutes, then says its shutting down and proceeds to do so. It says boot file 00101100x00100100 is missing. How do I proceed from here?</p>

    <title>Start Original Xbox Live Servers for ALL Backward Compatible Games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> holy land  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start Original Xbox Live Servers for ALL Backward Compatible Games</h2>
                    <p>First-generation Xbox Live shutdown</p><p><br /></p>





<p>Xbox Live for the original Xbox was discontinued by 
Microsoft on April 15, 2010, encouraging gamers &nbsp;to upgrade to the Xbox 
360 and future Xbox Systems. Online support for the original Xbox and 
all of its games have been cut off forever, meaning the likes of 
Splinter Cell, Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow, Splinter Cell Chaos 
Theory, Halo 2, Ghost Recon, Rainbow 6, Crimson Skies, MechAssault and 
Project Gotham Racing will lose part of what made them great.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>Phil
 Spencer, has made a huge step bringing back xbox first generation 
games. But there is no online support or plans to start the servers. 
Please support this petition and tell all of Microsoft, Xbox Live and 
Game Developers to support the Xbox Community.</p>



<p><br /></p><p>If
 we dont get support for this petition many gamers will never get the 
opportunity to enjoy these games again or for the very first time. By 
supporting this petition it will not weaken the xbox system or the 
community but only enlarge it and help it grow. I want to personally 
thank each and every one of you for your time and support. Please share 
this with your Family, Friends and Social Media for more support. Without you nothing will improve.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Here is the INFO of the Chipset &amp; Other Junk:</p>

<p>Yea, A big bunch of pictures. It seems that the driver is hidden ( I used the show hidden devices thingy ), or that it is split into multiple devices and/or drivers. + Just in case for hackers, I have a fire wall, Anti Virus, all of the protection software!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Chipset, BIOS, and some major drivers will be available at the System/Motherboard Maker's<br />
Site. So that is Gateway for you. For other 3rd party device drivers (not chipset) after checking<br />
Gateway (if they provided the device) then check with the actual device makers' sites.<br />

Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to<br />
the&nbsp;BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate&nbsp;device drivers.
<br />
Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in
<br />
their name.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your
<br />
system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address
<br />
of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and
<br />
more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most
<br />
current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and
<br />
complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the
<br />
version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind
<br />
certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver
<br />
stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if <br />
3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you
<br />
have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then
<br />
Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions.
<br />
(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT <br />
after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing
<br />
actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed
<br />
(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is
<br />
installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<h3> onejohn one9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox LIVE, ISP, and NetFlix</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xbox is the leading console for Microsoft.&nbsp; Microsoft developed the console for revenue.&nbsp; So, it makes since that Microsoft would be interested in my perspective on the purchase of a SONY PS3 simply because it costs less for family entrertainment.&nbsp; Yet,
 there is an easy soluion or Xbox to maintain thier customer base&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xbox requires that I pay for n Xbox LIVE account to connect to my Netflix account&nbsp;through my Internet Service Provider (ISP).&nbsp; SONY prides sreaming and gaming on-line for free.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have considered purchasing a SONY which could&nbsp;promote&nbsp;further purchases
 into the SONY&nbsp;franchise&nbsp;simply because an Xbox LIVE membership serves one family member for gaming one at a time since it is intended for commnity gaming.&nbsp; Yes, the family can appreciate Netflix together, but&nbsp;while occupying game-time dad or big brother may&nbsp;have
 wanted to capitalize their leisure time&nbsp;batteling Locust Hords on another console&nbsp;to satisfy some neo-virtual blood-lust with the world comunity while the rest of the family absorbs&nbsp;"CHICK FLIX" (no live community required).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The solution I mentioned for an increase in Xbox revenue would be to allow internet access to netflix with new Xbox software providing netflix either directly or through Xbox Live for free.&nbsp;&nbsp;This provides an increase in family entertainment versatility
 making the Xbox the family choice.&nbsp; This way the console supports both family entertainment and on-line gaming while the profile owner "gets their game on" using their profile for community gaming on another console, not impeaded by the family entertainment
 (or family pacification to free gamers to game).&nbsp; Being the console of choice&nbsp;leads to Xbox game and accessory&nbsp;purchses, pedicated by&nbsp;Xbox LIVE memberships&nbsp;for community&nbsp;gaming and maintaini your customer base.&nbsp; Thereby providing&nbsp;an increase in Xbox Console
 revenue.&nbsp;</p>

Pressing 1 only works if it's showing your primary windows instillation (next to the 1) - in this instance, the screen does not show any windows instillations (it was installed 3 years ago and I've had no problems since.

            The Recovery Console (RC) does not run properly from an XP CD if the SATA Mode in the BIOS&nbsp;is set to AHCI or RAID.&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By setting the SATA Mode to IDE the&nbsp;RC works correctly from an XP CD&nbsp;and does see the HDD. The RC now:</p>
<ul>
<li>prompts to select which Win Installation to use </li><li>prompts for administrator password </li><li>The C:\WINDOWS&gt; prompt is displayed and its files can be listed </li><li>MAP cmd shows A: Floppy, C: System Partition, D: Recovery Partition&nbsp;+ 2 x CDs</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't understand the meanings/significance of these various SATA Modes, so I'm setting it to IDE only when I want to run RC from CD and setting back to RAID when I run normally.</p>

    <title>unable to switch windows 10 third-party input method using ctrl &#43; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cnfczn  say:</h3>
<h2>            unable to switch windows 10 third-party input method using ctrl &#43; space</h2>
                    <br />
<br />
<br />
windows 10 version:1511<br />
<br />
<br />
In previous versions of windows after the system starts, the default input method is English, but you can use ctrl + space to switch Chinese input method (windows 98 xp 7)<br />
However, in windows10, if you usea a third-party input method,you can't ctrl + space switching.<br />
windows 10 comes with Microsoft Pinyin input method,you can set the"IME default mode"in English,then in any window by ctrl + space to switch input methods.<br />
But any other input method can not be moved, I searched the Internet did not find help.<br />
<br />
<br />
If the windows 10, set the third-party Chinese input method as the default input method, then each boot or open a program will automatically activate this input method, if you set the default input methods in these third-party input method in English , it was
 only displayed in English, input method is actually still active. this is obviously not what I want. (the input method can not be used in contana in.)<br />
<br />
These input methods including Microsoft's Bing input method<br />
