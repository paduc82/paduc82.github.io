    <title>DirectDraw emulation still broken in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            DirectDraw emulation still broken in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello, Microsoft, please fix DirectDraw, considering Windows 10 is your last OS, and loads of people have complained about this in Windows 8, and it's STILL NOT FIXED IN 10. most games DX8 and below run horrible thanks to this, either screwed up colours
 and/or a very bad framerate to other problems such as sprites not loading. This is odd considering it was fine in Windows 7.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
An example is Red Alert 2, it's unplayable unless you use a 3rd party directdraw emulation such as WineD3D.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another example is Commandos 3, the graphics are corrupted and it crashes on some missions making it unplayable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And no compatibility settings don't fix any of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All we need is Windows 7's DirectDraw emulation back since that was fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cmon microsoft fix this!<br />
</p>

            Bump! just fooling around with more games and found plenty that are unplayable on Windows 10, even the directx 8 and 9 emulation seems to be off too, why brake it when it was near perfect in Windows 7 and earlier, please just give us back windows 7's way
 of emulating old directx/directdraw games, especially if this is going to be your last OS.

            <p>Red alert 2 has no digital version as far as im aware, but theres a freeware version of C&amp;C Tiberian sun which has problems with framerate and invisible menus:</p>
<p>http://www.gamershell.com/download_55872.shtml</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Commandos 3 is available via GOG and Steam:</p>

<p>https://www.gog.com/game/commandos_2_3</p>

</p><p>Also Commandos Behind enemy lines doesn't work atall it gives me an error saying (directx5 not found), this can be found at GOG and Steam too:</p>

</p><p>Another game that had framerate problems was an old turn based strategy game called Panzer General 3D assault:<br />
https://www.gog.com/game/panzer_general_3d_assault</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had all these problems on Windows 8 too, but in Windows 7 they were fine, theres plenty more games that had problems when I tried but can't remember which from the top of my head&nbsp;</p>

            I am unable to start ANNO 1602 in Windows 10 from GOG.com. It reports that DirectDraw needs to be installed, and the .NET 3.5 installer starts. It goes thru an installation progress and then fails. Subsequently the game is unable to run afterward. If I
 tell the initial dialog box to skip the install, then the game also never starts.

            <p>This is a huge issue that was also in windows 8. The same exact machine using windows 7 plays the games better in terms of framerate and working. Something changed around then and I hope you guys can fix it. Here is a link mentioning the issue which I believe
 you saw but just curious if it's still being looked into.</p>

</p><p>Some other issues include games running a window and you cannot force full screen either. examples of this are **** II, Max Payne 1. Also the original Splinter Cell has flickering issues.</p>

    <title>XBox One 14 Day Trial and 2 Day Trial not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yeomanhades  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBox One 14 Day Trial and 2 Day Trial not working</h2>
                    
<p>I recently purchased a new official XBox One Controller. &nbsp;In the box was a "2 Day XBox Live Gold Trial" card. &nbsp;When I activated it yesterday morning, it said that it was for "Durango with ARGO". &nbsp;I don't have that game so it's no use to me, and wouldn't
 work with Titanfall. &nbsp;Why was it bundled with an XBox One Controller, and how do I know what it supports just from looking at the card (it wasn't mentioned anywhere on it)?</p>
<p>I then applied a 14 Day Trial code that came with a new XBox One. &nbsp;That activated fine as a "14 Day Trial to XBox Live Gold". &nbsp;However, when I try to play Titanfall it still asks me to sign-up to an XBox Live Gold subscription.</p>
<p>I chatted to a Support representative yesterday morning who said that it was due to the ongoing issue with the XBox Live servers. &nbsp;When I followed this up this evening, I was told that it was because the code is limited to Arcade games only. &nbsp;Which of these
 two answers is correct, if either? &nbsp;If the latter, then how am I, as a customer, supposed to know this? &nbsp;I'm sure that I've had a 14 day Trial code working with Titanfall previously.</p>

<p>2 day and 14day trials only give you temporary gold access and basic multiplayer access for the games they were purchased with</p>
<p>If you want full benefits you Ned a paid membership</p>
<p>Also Dlc codes sometimes comes with time codes</p>
<p>However they do not stack</p>
<p>You would have to wait till the 48hour trial period ended before entering the 14day trial as it does not stack
</p>
<p>Entering it during the time period wont affect the original end of the trial</p>

<p>I have similar problem. I activated my 14 day trial and it only worked once with NFS Rivals. Now it keeps asking I need to sign up to Gold Live even though I already am and still well inside 14 days?</p>

<p>Before I go forward with a year subscription I redeemed a 14 day subscription. &nbsp;I did this through the Xbox 360 and it stated I had a 14 day Gold trial. &nbsp;However, nothing happened. &nbsp;I called tech support who was not helpful. &nbsp;I went on line and looked at
 my account and there was no record of the 14 day trial. &nbsp;On my 360, I am not considered gold and there is some kind of error as in my account settings it says 14 day trial but I have no gold status or abilities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I then decided to use another one of my codes that I have never used before. &nbsp;Directly into Xbox Live's website, I entered the 14 day code hoping this would resolve my issues. &nbsp;Although the code was accepted and I was to have a 14 day GOLD trial... Nothing
 changed and there is no mention of the subscription anywhere.</p>
<p>Lastly, I have lost trust in my entering a code. &nbsp;I have a one year subscription card that I can use that a family member said they would give me.... However, I believe it would just be swallowed up like the last two attempts.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Yep however you don't understand how 14day trials work</p>
<p>14day trials dont change your status to gold </p>
<p>You remain free account and you get certain modes use only as stated above</p>
<p>It will only show on your billing account not gold status</p>
<p>Best rule of thumb is to use the games you purchased it with and only use non ranked matches
</p>
<p>You can use the one year subscription but it will only overwrite your 14day trial &nbsp;and give you full benefits</p>
<p>the 2nd code will have overwrite the first 14day trial as they don't stack</p>
<p>Gold memberships do stack</p>

<p>(3rd time trying to get the below posted) - As with yesterday, there are a little too many Xbox Live availability issues....</p>
<p>Problem Resolved -</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;Xbox Gold Live paid membership of 1 month or more are listed within an account. &nbsp;48 hour, 7 day, and 14 day trials are not listed anywhere except the profile on the xbox. &nbsp;This obviously causes confusion and concern that another code may or may not take....</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;Destiny does not honor 48 hour, 7 day, or 14 day trial Xbox Live Gold subscriptions. &nbsp;Citation -

    <title>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate not working on PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cg90  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Game Pass Ultimate not working on PC</h2>
                    <p>I was an existing Xbox Live Gold and Game Pass subscriber. When the Game Pass for PC launched, I upgraded to Ultimate. I upgraded my PC to the latest version of Windows, downloaded the Xbox app, and made sure that I was logged into the same account that
 I use on my Xbox. Whenever I try to download a Game Pass game on PC, I get a screen prompting me to sign up for Game Pass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something that I'm doing wrong? Why does the Xbox PC app not recognize my Game Pass status? Is there another way that I'm supposed to download these games for PC?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried signing out and back in. I've restarted the app. I've restarted my PC. I've dug through Microsoft's site trying to find a place that I can email support because the Virtual Assistant and FAQs are completely useless in this case.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>can you double check your subscription status at <a href="http://account.microsoft.com/services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://account.microsoft.com/services</a> to verify your Ultimate subscription is active and without issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also please double check if the app shows the same Profile (and GT) compared to the Xbox One.</p>
<p>Also check if the region on the console is the same as the region on the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results</p>

            Ultimate subscription, Profile/GT, and region are all good. After posting this, I discovered that I could download Game Pass games directly from the Microsoft Store, and that works fine. The only problem seems to be with the Xbox app itself.&nbsp;

<p>Hi CG,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for letting us know you can download games. You need to go through the game pass on PC to download these games or through the MS store. They will not work going through the app as it is different. I will go ahead and lock this as it has been resolved.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Upload the zip containing the .DMP files to Onedrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply. Prefered sites: Onedrive, Mediafire, Dropbox, etc. Nothing with wait-timers.<br />
<br />
<strong>4 (optional):</strong> The type of .DMP files located in the Minidump folder are known as Small Memory Dumps. In %systemroot% there will be what is known as a Kernel-Dump (if your system is set to generate). It is labeled MEMORY.DMP. The difference
 between Small Memory Dumps and Kernel-Dumps in the simplest definition is a Kernel-Dump contains
<em><strong>much </strong></em>more information at the time of the crash, therefore allowing further debugging of your issue. If your upload speed permits it, and you aren't going against any strict bandwidth and/or usage caps, etc, the Kernel-Dump is the best
 choice. Do note that Kernel-Dumps are <em><strong>much larger </strong></em>in size due to containing much more info, which is why I mentioned upload speed, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/add-photos-files-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upload photos and files to Onedrive.</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete .DMP files upon use.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Patrick

            <p>Hi songod1,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are glad to help you regarding your concern. I understand that you are having a problem with attachments on Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would like to ask some information first so we can properly isolate the cause of this issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>I would like to clarify first, are the email with attachment not being received entirely, or just the attachment for that email?</li><li>Are the attachments not also being received when you try to view your account on the webmail?</li><li>Is your account a Microsoft account, or other 3rd party email account?</li><li>Does the sender receive any bounce messages?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We appreciate your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

            <p>Thank you for your response. </p>
<p><br />
1. No email&nbsp;message at all is being received, although I&nbsp;do get an audible indication that an email has tried to come in.&nbsp; But nothing appears in any of my email boxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The attachments are received when I log in through my account on the mail2web.com.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. My email account is through Century Link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Apparently the sender does not receive a bounce message.&nbsp; I know that I do not get one when attempting to forward a message as an attachment from another email account such as hotmail.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an effort to fix this problem, I removed an expired version of Norton antivirus.&nbsp; Currently I am using "Avast".&nbsp; I stopped the different functions of it temporarily and sent test emails but my problem still remains.&nbsp; I am running Windows defender and
 Windows firewall.&nbsp; I am not sure how to suspend those to run a test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankyou so much for your help I have run out of ideas.</p>

            <p>Hello songod1,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the information that you've provided. Since the issue only happens within your attachments on Windows Live Mail and not the account itself, we would like to verify if the issue can be fixed by reconfiguring your account. This troubleshooting
 step will refresh your account and can potentially fix the issue. To do this, r<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">emove and re-configure your account by following the steps within this

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case the issue persists, please verify if the same issue happens when you use a different user on Windows Live Mail or, if you use your account on a different computer with Windows Live Mail installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let us know the results afterwards.</span></p>

            <p>Cesar_E, Thank you for your response.&nbsp; As of April 5 my email started working again.&nbsp; Presently I am receiving emails with attachments.&nbsp; I received quite a large number of back emails.&nbsp; I have no idea where they may have been stored in the cloud, but all
 of a sudden they all started coming in.&nbsp; I will keep this link info. in case this situation comes back in the future.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I had been talking with another individual from a windows 8 forum who had the same problem as I had and his email cleared up all of a sudden as well, without any apparent fix being applied,&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your expert help it is much appreciated. </p>

                    <p>When&nbsp;I&nbsp;wake my computer from sleep I get BSOD with message VIDEO_SCHEDULER_INTERNAL_ERROR. I am getting the message consistently and tried a clean install of windows 10 with nothing, but windows updates installed and I still get the error. I have latest
 graphics drivers and BIOS updates installed. Using the Nvidia supplied driver or latest beta driver help either. Otherwise the computer seems to be working normally. I have tried everything I can find through internet searches. I have posted my&nbsp;dmp file below.&nbsp;Does
 anyone have any ideas on how to fix this?</p>

Most new machines come with a recovery partition allowing you to go back to the time of purchase, you will have to check your user guides (or the manufacturer's Web Site) for instructions.&nbsp; Choosing that path requires you to save all valuable data first.

<h2>            Taskbar Keeps Popping Up and Down &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have set my taskbar to auto-hide so that I can have more room space. But even when the taskbar is set to auto hide, it keeps on popping up and then back down around more or less than 30 seconds. This happen even when my mouse is stationary and far from
 the bottom of my screen where my taskbar actually is. &nbsp;This problem interrupts my activities as an example when typing this question, when the taskbar pop-up, it would hinder my typing and then it resumes back once the taskbar pops back down. I cannot pinpoint
 the exact problem. What is the possible solution to this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it helps, I have a Lenovo 920 Yoga.</p>

<p>In addition to your mouse pointer, the taskbar will also show up if any running application requests to be seen (we call this a "needy app" or "program in a needy state".&nbsp; &nbsp;Examples include IM clients, Outlook getting new mail, Team Viewer receiving incoming
 connections, calendar event reminders, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Programs can optionally start flashing their taskbar icon to get your attention even more noticeably than just forcing the taskbar into view, but they don't have to do that -- so sometimes the only way to figure out what program is begging to be seen is
 to check each running program (in the main taskbar and the notification area near the clock) until you find the one that is raising the needy state flag.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you are facing issues with Windows 10 on your phone.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the following suggestion and see if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to install all the latest windows updates and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, try doing Soft Reset and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Soft Reset</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The soft reset is the same thing as pulling your battery (on devices where that is possible). This method will not remove anything at all from your
 phone and is completely safe to attempt in any problem situation.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You perform the soft reset by having your phone turned on. Then press and hold the
<strong>volume down + power</strong> buttons until your phone vibrates and restarts. Note that you should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Example of situations where the soft reset should solve the problem</span></span></strong><strong><span>:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>An app that usually starts won't start.</span></p>
<p><span>The camera won't open.</span></p>
<p><span>The device starts using too much battery.</span></p>

<h2>            How can I reset my installed fonts to the default font list&#63;</h2>
                    I have a couple hundred fonts that I have installed over the years and I would like to remove them all and go back to the default fonts. I am running on Windows 10 Home edition. I have gone into the control panel to access the fonts and have even used
 the "Restore default font settings" option, but all of my added fonts are still there. I am able to remove them manually, but that is going to take a really long time. Is there anyway to remove all of the non-default fonts at once?&nbsp;

                    I have received an update to 8.12.0.14 today and now I can't find chat notification settings anywhere. I had set up notifications for trigger words, but as I can see the new version doesn't support this feature anymore, only mentions of my account or replies
 to my messages. Is this setting buried somewhere or has it been removed?

<p>This doesn't help, unfortunately. What I was asking is whether the new Skype version supports notifications based on specific words as the previous version did. For example, I had some group chats muted except for mentions of my name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see the "Notifications" in the chat settings between BOTS and GROUP GALLERY, but it's completely empty. The only thing I found are Smart notifications, which isn't quite what I need.</p>

</p><p>In the new Skype, if you muted a group chat and they mentioned your name (@username) you will be notified, but this will not be applied to any other specific word. There's no option to do that in the new Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since that option is not available, install the classic Skype instead:</p>

<p><span><strong><span>Hi evicheck,<br />
<br />
</span></strong><span>1. What happens when you try to connect to the Network with battery plugged in?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Do you get any error message?</span></span></p>
<p><span>Run in Battery mode and change the Wireless Adapter settings in Power Options to maximum Performance.</span></p>
<p><span><span>To do that follow the steps below:<br />
a. Click on Start, type <strong>Power Options</strong> in the search box.<br />
b. Click on<strong> Balanced</strong> plan and then select <strong>Change Plan Settings</strong>.<br />
c. Now, select <strong>Change Advanced Power Settings</strong> option.<br />
d. In the Power Options window, select the Advanced settings tab.<br />
e. Click on Change settings that are currently available.<br />
f. Look for the option <strong>Wireless Adapter settings</strong> and then select<strong>Power saving mode</strong> and set it to<strong>Maximum Performance.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>Hope this should make a difference.<br />

<h2>            Having trouble opening .jar files, specifically a program called OSBuddy</h2>
                    <p>I am on windows 8.1 Pro. Since upgrading a number of parts in my PC, I have been unable to run .jar files. I have tried all sorts of different options to fix this including turning off the firewall, uninstalling and reinstalling java and the program itself.
 Nothing seems to work. This is the error message I receive;</p>

<p>I don't know what else I can do to fix this. :( Please if there is anyone who can help it would be much appreciated.</p>

</p><p>You need to create a new Windows user. My previous user was called "Me!" but Java does not tolerate special characters in your /users/filename directory.</p>

<h2>            Gamestation Extra 50&#37; on Trade In&#39; for cash&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    Hello, i remember reading something about Gamestation offering an extra 50% when trading in games for cash, just wondering if anyone can confirm this as the official website doesnt say nothing (well i cant find anything). I'm just hoping to trade in BLUR
 for a fair price, whilst im on the subject- anyone traded in BLUR recently?<br />
<br />
Thanks, Curtis.

<p>Before they do any "extra" deals they always knock the value down first. Sometimes you'll get even less than you usually would.</p>

    <title>Surface PRO i5 vs i7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josue cid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface PRO i5 vs i7</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is Josu Cid, from Mxico. Because an&nbsp; IT project I am working with, I am planning on getting around 10 Microsfot tablets so Id like to get some help for an objective comparission between Surface PRO i5 vs i7.
</p>
<p>Doing some research, I have found lots of references about tablets with i7 processors, which seem to be devices with a performance oriented&nbsp;to hard processes&nbsp; like gaming in high quality and graphis; which despite the fact of a better performance in comparisson
 to i5, this high performance lasts for short periods of time due to some overheating.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The tablets i will get, will be used&nbsp;for common office apps like MS Office or Adobe; and checking some references, it seems that the performance between both processors ar very similar and even in some cases i5
 is better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Josu Cid.</p>

            Dear Josue <br /><br />You may have already seen the benchmarks at <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Microsoft-Surface-Pro-2017-i7-512-GB-16-GB-Convertible-Review.236968.0.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.notebookcheck.net/Microsoft-Surface...</a> - they also took into account the performance on benchmarks after the tests were run several times to account for power throttling. Josher14 is another surface pro user who posts gaming benchmarks on YouTube that is a good indicator of how they perform under sustained gpu/cpu load.<br /><br />Essentially, both i5 and i7 will power throttle, but i7 is still significantly more powerful than the i5 after that. Both are suitable for office work, but you may prefer the stronger integrated GPU in the i7 for Adobe applications. May I have more details about how you plan to use the tablets?

<p>Hi Rusell,</p>
<p>Hope you are doing fine;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary, the tablets will be delivered to VIPs of the company I work for, you know like managers. They already work with their laptops, so this will be more like a plus; and I dont think that the apps they commonly use will be a big challenge to the
 processors.</p>
<p>Below I list the apps that will be installed:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Antivirus McAfee</span></p>
<p><span>Adobe Reader DC</span><span>MS Office PLUS 2013 (WORD,EXCEL,POWERPOINT, OUTLOOK)</span></p>
<p><span>Skype for Bussines</span></p>
<p><span>JAVA plugin</span></p>
<p><span>Cute PDF (pdf printing)</span></p>
<p><span>Password manager</span></p>
<p><span>SAP GUI 740</span></p>
<p><span>WinZio</span></p>
<p><span>Dameware Client</span></p>
<p><span>Pishme reporter</span>As you can see, ther are not like dedicated and specialized apps but more standard and commono in an office
 environment.</p>
<p>So at the end, if we get i5, i cant to have the evidences that due to the use thay ther are planned for, this choice might be the best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And thanks for the help,</p>
<p>

                    I am trying to use the window + g button to screen record with audio on my surface pro, and there is an error coming up saying it cannot record because of an XBOX game overload. It told me to make an XBOX account, so I did, and it didn't fix the problem.
 An error code came up, so I typed in the error code in multiple different ways. It told me that the error code didn't exist. It is difficult to work through my own problem when the error code that I am given doesn't work.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 Update 1803 has ruined my computer</h2>
                    <p>Friday 5/19 </p>
<p>12pm ... Allowed Windows 10 1803 update to proceed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took about an 1-1.5 hours to complete.</p>
<p>After completing the update, I signed in, and it went into a "Preparing Windows" for about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>After 10 minutes, it abruptly stopped, with the following error:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>"C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\Desktop refers to
 a location that is unavailable. It could be on a hard drive on this computer, or on a network. Check to make sure that the disk is properly inserted, or that you are connected to the Internet or your network, and then try again. If it still cannot be located,
 the information might have been moved to a different location."</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The desktop was black, and useless, as nothing was working.<br />
</p>
<p>After several hours of trial and error (and lots of yelling!), of trying to fix it, I decided to reset my computer.</p>
<p>After the 1 hour reset (and keep personal files option), same location error as above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So around 10pm, I decided I had to reinstall windows, meaning I had to give up all my personal files.</p>
<p>I am a software developer, and I have all my development tools, notes, bookmarks, and lost it all.</p>
<p>The reinstall worked (?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>7am Saturday 5/20&nbsp;</p>
<p>Logged in, and configured my external monitor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soon after received blue screen of death.</p>
<p>Rebooted, received blue screen of death a few more times.</p>
<p>Installed Chrome.</p>
<p>Installed Windows office 365/2013 subscription.<br />
Office seems to be working.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Installed MySql as I need it for development.<br />
Blue screen of death, a couple more times.</p>
<p>Installed the eclipse IDE (java dev environment).</p>
<p>12:30pm ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to look at a word doc, so I go to open it ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing ... no errors, no delay, just nothing ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Excel works ... but Word nothing ... but wait ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I do research on how to fix Word not working issue, and nothing helped.</p>
<p>So I try to uninstall Office, and &nbsp;immediately&nbsp; I get the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"Couldn't stream Office" Sorry we ran into a problem, please try again later...&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been a nightmare, and a waste of my time.&nbsp; Still not out of the woods ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know what to do, find an alternative to windows!?!&nbsp; &nbsp;Just Great!!</p>
<p><br />

            We need to hear from Microsoft about this widespread problem.&nbsp; They must realise that&nbsp;incidents like this will lose them customers.&nbsp; I had the same problem with a laptop.&nbsp;This rendered the laptop unusable for weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tried many fixes suggested here and
 elsewhere but none worked.&nbsp; Eventually I had to reinstall W10 from scratch.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As well as being unusable, some important items were lost.&nbsp; This affair is appalling and while nothing can turn the clock back, I want to hear some acknowledgement from Microsoft.&nbsp;
 As policy, it made&nbsp;automatic updates virtually unavoidable.&nbsp; On my PC, I still have W7 and always wait a week or two before accepting Updates.&nbsp; Has MS provided a proper response to this?

            I am having major issues since update. Bluescreens, crashes etc. cannot use my computer for more than 20min. I looked into the log, and it is writting multiple errors and warnings every second! I did not have one error &nbsp;since i buimy pc over a year ago.
 Last check i had over 30,000 errors....... MS support had me reinstall windows saying it was corupt files(which i knew was not the case) with the update again, and of course, i am having the same issues. Its a nightmare. &nbsp;Is there a way to reinstall, without
 1803? Thank you

<p>Hi Curt99,</p>
<p>I would suggest you to uninstall the drivers for the device and reinstall it again. Also uninstall all the USB devices and restart the computer.<br />
i.&nbsp;Click start-&gt; Type Device Manager in the Search bar.<br />
ii.&nbsp; In Device Manager, locate the device, and then right-click the device name.<br />
iii.&nbsp;Select uninstall and restart the computer.<br />
iv.&nbsp;Let vista detect the device and install the drivers by itself.<br />
v.&nbsp;If that does not help, install the latest drivers from the manufacturers website</p>
<p>Check the link <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p>Hallo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>das ganze Prozess mit dem Wiederherstellung des Passwortes ist <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">zu komliziert.
</span></strong>Ich meine es ernst we ich sage, dass ich privat mit meine Eltern auf Skype spreche, denn ich 2000 km von Ihnen weit weg wohne. Skype aber als Program ist die schlechteste nicht bis zum Ende ausgedachte Software, dass ich gesehen habe (und ich
 bin ein Architekt). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Wiederherstellen mit 2 accounts von skype (alt) und microsoft (neu) und am Ende hat man 2 skype acounts anstatt, dass man die alte
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Machine translation:&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<em>The whole process of restoring the password is too complicated. I mean it seriously, I say that I speak privately with my parents on Skype, because I live 2000 km from them far away. Skype as a program is the worst not up to the bad software that I have

<br />
<em>Restore with 2 accounts from Skype (old) and Microsoft (new) and at the end you have 2 Skype accounts instead of that and you can't use the old account anymore.</em>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It doesnt matter. I give up on skype and am trying other software. You either are incompetent, don`t care or are doing this **** intentionaly. Dont bother replying, or even opening this E-mail!</p>

            <p>the problem persists on all apps of windows 10. including settings app, because ms-settings doesnt run. my build number is 10586.318. Im right now trying to fix the solution by repairing the os with the media creation tool. And had already tried method 1,
 which did not work. </p>
