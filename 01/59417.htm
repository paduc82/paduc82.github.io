<h2>            After using recovery option in Windows 10, start menu, control panel, edge and many more apps do not show up</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the title says, I recovered my Windows 10 on my Surface Tablet (6 I believe) and now my start menu, control panel, Edge, etc are not showing up. When I try to access any of the resolution settings from the desktop I receive an error telling me the default
 apps are not selected correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My WiFi works fine. I can also open, windows app store, windows explorer, power shell and task manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to restore it again and the same situation happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I please get some help with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Amin</p>

            Hi AminEd 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />How to Boot from a USB Flash Drive in Windows 10 - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            Hi Amin
<br />
<br />That Restore operation doe not seem to have gone well, did you use one of the options, like Windows Reset or a System Restore?
<br />
<br />If so, honestly to get that device working like new, you should backup your data, then download the recovery image for your Surface and use that to clean install Windows 10, you will however need to re-install all your 3rd party software after that completes . . .

<p>Thanks Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did use the Windows 10 built-in back to factory setting option twice , once removing everything and once keeping my files with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for the link, bery helpful, i have downloaded the zip file , but steps afterward are nit clear. I guess I need to create &nbsp;a bootable USB using that zip file but I am lost on how to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the zip file is on a second machine, i have a 32 GB USB ready, do you have any recommendation on how to use the zip downloaded to create a bootable USB so i can make clean install on my surface pro please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks again,</p>

            Hi Amin,
<br />
<br />Here is a step-by-step for creating the bootable installation media for a Surface device:

<p>Thanks Dave, I followed the link you shared and was also able to find the Microsoft way, but none could help<br />
<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-nz/help/4023512/surface-creating-and-using-a-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-nz/help/4023512/surface-creating-and-using-a-usb-recovery-drive</a><br />
</p>
<p>The link you shared talks about moving the image file as a zip to usb after formatting the USB to FAT32, and the zip file is larger than 8GB, and FAT32 cannot handle that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a recovery USB from the microsoft link above, moved the image files to the USB, and then boot the surface using the method described in the video, but no matter what I do, it does not boot from USB. how can I check if my bootable USB is even working.
 also can you please think of any other way I can get the image written to the Surface Pro please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Amin</p>

<p>| Server Semi-WhiteListed to Players on my friends list only |</p>
<p>Welcome pvper to DroidCraft! In Droidcraft we are a hardcore faction server with that in mind maps will be off so we can maxamize Faction wars and raiding but on the good side you cant be raided if you travel and hide your base well and on the topic of bases
 every base sould have a farm of either sugarcane,carrot or potato because grinding those out makes you max profit in the shop along with Mining and getting Mob Loot and with that profit you can make your faction more powerful and you will be able to buy xp
 bottles,Armor,Weapons,Perks and whatever else you need SO when you do raid aim for the farms right after you get the chests also the shop and spawn look great and are a fair size with a good seed so when you build your base you can build however you want just
 i recomend traveling for a bit and hiding it well and have good extra space for farming so please make sure you follow the basic rules and thats about it for now just also know There are also loot chests all around the world filled with good gear for all pvpers
 plus when you raid let me know so i can record it and upload it to my youtube because then we can make your awesome raid viral! see you on DroidCraft!</p>

<h2>            Activate windows watermark after update</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone! So I have a genuine copy of windows (originally 7) upgraded to 10.&nbsp; Today I had an update (my windows is set to update regularly)</p>
<p>and out of nowhere, I got an "activate windows" watermark. I tried to re-activate using my number but it says it "didn't work".</p>
<p>any suggestions? should I just contact support?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,
<br />sometimes this happens after incorrect update installation.
<br />You may try to restore system to a previous state and install update again.

<h2>            ends of clips cut off after exporting video</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have edited a video using Windows Live Movie Maker with several clips cut together, when I play the video in WLMM everything is fine but when I save it as a movie in wmv format each part where a clip ends it loses about the last second of the clip which
 ends up cutting off the words. &nbsp;I have no idea why the video plays fine in the program but then after saving as a movie it does that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can anybody please help me?</p>

            <p>What's the format of the video?&nbsp; It sounds like Movie Maker is having trouble correctly decoding the file to determine the start/end points and to then split it correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One quick workaround would be to convert the clip to another format that is more compatible with Movie Maker (e.g. into .wmv format).&nbsp; I've used Freemake Video Converter to convert to .wmv.&nbsp; If you do install that, or any other freeware, be sure
 to choose the Custom Install option so you can uncheck any add-ons you don't want installed.</p>

            <p>For every video clip - check the end time and start time of the next clip- maybe they overlap each other.</p>
<p>Cut off words you mentioned - &nbsp;maybe "caption" is cut off at end of clip - copy the caption and paste it to the next video clip. Try it - what is the result.</p>

            Hi Mr.WilsonY,
<br />
<br />I'm Nathan, a fellow Microsoft customer and expert user here to help.
<br />
<br />Are you graphic drivers up to date? 
<br />
<br />If you open a game, and then open Task Manager, can you see what is heavily utilising your hardware (CPU, MEM, Graphics)?
<br />
<br />Some games run better or worse with Game Mode. If you haven't tried disabling this, I would recommend seeing if this helps your FPS: <a href="https://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/disable-game-mode-in-fall-creators-update-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/disa...</a>
<br />
<br />Please let me know how this goes so I can further advise. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan

<h2>            Windows 10 Photos App is missing add Narration Feature</h2>
                    <p>I am creating a video project in Windows 10 Photos and wish to add a voice over narration but the&nbsp;add Narration Feature is not available on the app (just ad music).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using windows 10 Prop on a 3 year old dell laptop 64 Bit and the audio and microphone recording works when used by itself ie not using the Photos App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reviewed some Microsoft videos such as&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ns0JPLpN8t8<br />
</p>
<p>These show show an audio drop down which shows the music and narration feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know why this is or how I can upgrade my version of Photos.</p>

                    <p>Original title" Stuck on "Choose your keyboard layout"</p>
<p>
</p><p>On 1/1 I updated to W.10 it has been working fine til today.. I had finished playing CS:GO and my PC was acting a little wonky..</p>
<p>I was about to click the power button until I saw something that said "Update and restart" I figured that's why my PC was acting a little weird.</p>
<p>It shuts down and updates. Reboots, pretty normal. Until I get a message that has a :( face on it</p>
<p>The page read something like "There has been an issue we will restart your PC for you"</p>
<p>The PC restarted and the brought up a message saying "Preparing Automatic Cleaner" or something like that. Then another screen pops up saying "Choose your keyboard layout" My PC seems to not be reading the mouse or keyboard.</p>
<p>My PC is an HP pavilion. I called HP and my warranty expired which meant they were going to charge me. Is there any fix?</p>

<p>"<span><strong>netsh winsock reset catalog</strong></span>"</p>

<p>I would be&nbsp;leery&nbsp;of the registry changes mentioned at the end of the post though. &nbsp;You can&nbsp;<strong>really</strong> mess your computer up if you are&nbsp;reckless&nbsp;changing the registry. &nbsp;</p>
<p>"JohnWill" also recommends the above command at:</p>

<p>again try to avoid changing your registry if you can. &nbsp;Please just stick to the command mentioned above if at all possible.</p>

    <title>How do I change the size of of what Scan scans&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> isabelbrinck  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I change the size of of what Scan scans&#63;</h2>
                    When I scan any docment as a PDF, it appears HUGE in Scan. Like, if I put the PDF to 100%, you would not be able to print it, it's too big. For printing, i know you can choose "fit to page" but even the files are huge (9MB, for example, for a 6 page PDF)
 and I can't email them. Where can I tell Scan to just scan in the same size as what is being scanned. I am already choosing the right paper size.

<p>Set of test utilities for DIY computer builders:</p>
<p>Note: If you are OverClocking or use any automatic overclocking BIOS features <br />
then drop back to the stock speed as a starting point.</p>
<p>First try running Memtest86+, this runs from a boot disk or CD and should eliminate or<br />
confirm if your one or more of your memory sticks are bad or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct.<br />
Let it run for as long as you can: 2,4,6,8 or more hours, if no errors by then your ram is OK.<br />
<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a></p>
<p>If you have a copy of Windows XP around try installing it temporary (if not Windows 7 will work as well)<br />
"No need to activate as you get a 30 day grace period which is perfect for testing"<br />
and then use the following tools (this assumes the memtest shows no failures)</p>
<p>Prime 95:<br />
<a href="http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft/</a><br />
It's a stand alone .exe file contained in a .zip archive.<br />
Just choose to run the "stress test" option for 3 hours or more.<br />
If your PC can pass this test both your memory and CPU<br />
are fine (close the case cover to maintain proper ventilation)</p>
<p>Core Temp: <br />
Monitor the temperature of each core of your processor. <br />
For non overclockers using the stock Intel/AMD heatsink and cooling fan <br />
you can expect a temperature of 35 to 40C at idle and up 60C to 65C when running Prime95.<br />
<a href="http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/</a></p>
<p>CPU-ID (CPUZ): <br />
Shows the clock speed of the CPU under various load conditions <br />
(when using Intel's EIST speed step technology). <br />
Also has two tabs (Memory and SPD) which show the actual memory speed <br />
and 'SPD' tab shows the rated speeds for each memory slot that is populated.<br />

<p>You reported details of a bugcheck caused by a double fault kernel trap. &nbsp;Do you happen to have ZoneAlarm installed on your system (specifically, a file named vsdatant.sys)? That seems to be a popular product that is involved<span>&nbsp;in
 similar situations (<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itproperf/thread/8011a1a3-1e7d-4465-897e-3d5efb0a87f1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">1</a>),
 (<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itproperf/thread/8815d4e4-e539-410e-9206-8e336117dffc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">2</a>).)
 &nbsp;If you have ZA installed, consider uninstalling it and checking the behavior, or disabling&nbsp;&nbsp;NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NBT). &nbsp;Then check the behavior.&nbsp;</span>You can find details about disabling NBT&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/313314" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>As auggy suggested, c<span>an
 you upload the contents of c:\windows\minidump to&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SkyDrive</a>&nbsp;and
 provide a link?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>Consider
 the following general guidance for dealing bluescreens (first start with ZA as described above, though, if that applies to you):</span></p>
<p>Consider running chkdsk on all partitions. &nbsp;Let chkdsk complete on each partition and see if that helps.</p>
<p>Also consider running SFC /SCANNOW.</p>
<p>If you boot into safe mode, do you still experience bugchecks? What about if you do a&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean
 boot</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itprohardware/thread/6115cb34-2890-46b5-8c1e-c934c56ecfe4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">device
 clean boot</a>?</p>
<p>Consider testing memory with Windows Memory Diagnostic or memtest86. Note that memory that passes tests is not necessarily good memory - it just hasn't failed a test. &nbsp;Consider systematically eliminating RAM from the system - run with a couple of
 modules for a while, and see how things go. Then try the other modules.</p>
<p>Other common suggestions include ensuring drivers are up to date, as well as ensuring that you're using the latest BIOS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It can be helpful to use Driver Verifier. &nbsp;To enable Driver Verifier... start-&gt;verifier.exe-&gt;OK-&gt;Create standard settings-&gt;Next-&gt;select driver names from a list-&gt;Next-&gt;sort by Provider-&gt;select all non-Microsoft drivers-&gt;Finish, and OK your way out
 of the dialog.</p>
<p>Then, reboot and use the system as you normally would, and wait for a problem. &nbsp;In the event that the system does not boot completely after enabling driver verifier, boot into Safe Mode and run driver verifier, and tell it to delete the changes.</p>
<p>Wait for a bugcheck to occur after enabling verifier as described, and then upload the dump to your SkyDrive, and provide a link.</p>

            Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />Reinstall the Store:
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (Admin) 
<br />At the command prompt, type the following then hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /F /FI "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.
<br />
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If the problem persists, then I recommend attempting a repair upgrade:

Hi</p>
<p>This feature was available in the My Pictures Slideshow Screensaver in Windows XP, but this screensaver is not included in Windows 7.</p>
<p>If you have access to a system with XP installed, you can copy the </p>
<p>C:\Windows\System32\ssmypics.scr&nbsp; file and place it into the same folder on the Windows 7 system and this will work the same way as it did in XP.</p>
<p>If you do not have access to a Windows XP system, you can download the ssmypics.scr&nbsp;file at the following link.</p>
<p><br />
<a href="http://www.dsi123.com/download/ScreenSavers/ssmypics.scr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dsi123.com/download/ScreenSavers/ssmypics.scr</a><br />
</p>
<p>If you have the 32bit version of Windows 7, copy the file to the&nbsp; C:windows\system32&nbsp; folder.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If you have the 64bit version of Windows 7, copy the file to the&nbsp; C:\Windows\SysWOW64&nbsp; folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right click the Desktop and select Personalize / Screen Saver icon.</p>
<p>In the Screen Saver options, it will show up as My Pictures Slideshow. Click the Settings Button for the options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<h2>            Windows XP 2018 Edition</h2>
                    Is the Windows XP 2018 Edition Clickbait or can i actually download it? because google says that you can download it but i'm not sure how to. Do i have to pay for it, or can i just download the update from a website? As i love Windows XP (I miss those
 days), I hope that this is actually true. I shall keep looking through the internet about this "Windows XP 2018 Edition". Please keep me informed.

<h2>            Cortana - Connected Home</h2>
                    The latest update (Creators Update or whatever it's called) is supposed to include updates to Cortana that allow you to control things like your Nest thermostat. However, after successfully updating my machine, I still don't see the "Connected Home" option
 in Cortanas notebook. There are no other updates available, so how do I get this feature?

<p>Hello Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We need to do further investigation on your concern so that we can identify the cause of the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the version of Windows that is currently installed? You can get this information by pressing Windows key on your keyboard, then type
<strong>winver</strong> in the Cortana search box, then press <strong>Enter</strong> on your keyboard.</li><li>Please take a screen shot of the result after typing <strong>winver</strong>.</li><li>Are you signed into Cortana?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For the meantime, can you click-on the <strong>notebook</strong> icon and check if the
<strong>Connected home</strong> item is available? You can check the screenshot below for your reference:</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for your reply but my original question stated that I don't have the "Connected Home" option in Cortanas notebook. This is what I have been looking for but it hasn't been added. The issue applies to both my laptop and desktop, both of which have been
 updated to the latest version of Windows 10 available to me - the last of which was the big Creators Update - which was supposed to contain the new cortana capabilities. The exact version on my laptop is: 1709 (OS build 16299.19)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would expect this is a regional thing because others have posted that they don't have it yet. I expect Microsoft have not released it to the UK yet? Thanks again. Chris</p>

</p><p>I see based on your screen grab that you are located in the UK.&nbsp; Microsoft appears to have only rolled this (and other) functionality out to the USA.&nbsp; I'm in Canada and I don't have it either.&nbsp; Nor do I have lists, skills, music and that other icon that
 is the screen shot that Jap Jay posted.&nbsp; Why Microsoft continues to alienate people in other countries in beyond me.</p>

</p><p>If Microsoft are not going to roll out a feature globally, then they should at least let the rest of the world know. I've just spent a good hour trying to enable the feature on my Windows 10 Pro. I'm too annoyed at that loss of time and frustration to be

I am too from the UK, it seems as if you are right it is currently (as of 20.01.2018) restricted to US. It is incredibly frustrating that Microsoft seemed to have kept that a secret, even their 'competent' agents/advisors from their support team didn't seem
 to know and continued to waste my time. Slow clap to you Microsoft...

<p>I've too have wasted lost of time looking/waiting for this functionality.. Started to look at using Google Assistant (on W10) instead... However, the Windows Magazine published in the UK, issue 146, March 2018, arrived yesterday states, p7, 'Get Smart with
 Windows' ... Cortana', At press time, Cortana is compatible with Nest thermostats, Philips Hue ..' which as everyone on this page knows means that they must think 'Connected Home' is
<span>available </span>or will be&nbsp; imminently. Does that mean in the UK March update? Can Ms tell us, please?</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in UK, trying to connect my LIFX bulb to Cortana. Winver 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click windows 10 start icon (bottom left), select Cortana app, click Menu (3 horizontal bars initially) select Notebook (latter on this icon appears below menu) then select Manage skills then Connected Home. Configure your device....&nbsp; Recheck above steps,
 to see if your device (in my case LIFX) is connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Lifx has login connection issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><div>Hey Cortana switch off office lights.</div>
<div>Cortana says: You do not have any devices I can control"</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So I am struck at this point?</div>
<div>
<p>Hope this far can help some of you to carry on...</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Regards</div>

    <title>XBOX RECORD THAT delay - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tohellnbak  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX RECORD THAT delay</h2>
                    
<p>last few days.... it seems like the record that feature is not as precise as it was...for instance &nbsp; in BF4 a good fight happened....I waited about 10 seconds before I said record that.. but yet it still seems to capture seconds BEFORE I need it...and misses
 the last 10 seconds...</p>

<p>&nbsp;IE</p>

<p>say I am counting &nbsp;1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 "Record that" &nbsp; what should be recorded is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10?? correct</p>

<p>&nbsp;what is saving is this</p>

<p>-5 -4 -3 -2 1- 0 1 2 3 4 5</p>

<p>&nbsp;see my issue?</p>

<p>As of today, this is still happening. I had an epic moment where I was in a T-90 and took out 2 choppers and a jet on golmud within 30 seconds of one an other. Went to go show my friend and it's stopped the clip just before I took out the first chopper.
 I have no idea why it's doing this, but it only seems to be in Battlefield 4. Which is frustrating to say the least. I hope this gets fixed soon.</p>
