<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1.</strong><br />
The Fix it in the article below automatically diagnose and repair when you cannot print, or for problems installing a printer, connecting to a network printer and related errors. Click on the green button (Run Now) and check.<br />
<strong>Printing problems and printing errors</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/printing_problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/gp/printing_problems</span></a></p>
<p><strong>Method 2.</strong><br />
To restart the Print Spooler service, you must be logged on as an administrator, to perform these steps:</p>
<p>a. Click start and in the run type service.msc and press enter.</p>
<p>b. Right-click the Print Spooler service, and then click Properties. <br />
c. On the General tab, next to Startup type, make sure that Automatic is selected.<br />
d. If the service is not already running, under Service status, click Start, and then click OK. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
e. Now Under properties click the Dependencies tab. Look for the “Dependencies” under “Print Spooler” and make sure all the dependency services are running and set to “Manual” or “Automatic”.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

    <title>HP dv9000 laptop Synaptics Touchpad not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anonymous individual  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP dv9000 laptop Synaptics Touchpad not working</h2>
                    
<p>My laptop was working fine until I got the black screen of death. I had restored everything back to its original factory settings, but even doing that the laptop's touchpad was no longer working. While I was restoring the laptop, the touchpad worked fine,
 but after I'd completed the restoration -&nbsp;the pointer no longer moved, clicking didn't work and there is a button on top of the touchpad that disables the touchpad, and THAT is not working either. It's completely broken.</p>
<p>I've installed every sort of driver you can think of for the synaptics touchpad, I'd uninstalled the drivers and reinstalled it to no avail. The keyboard works fine, and I can navigate my way from there, but the mouse is completely unresponsive.</p>
<p>I'm certain it's not a hardware issue with the touchpad because it worked just fine during the restoration process of my laptop. The computer runs Windows Vista if that helps at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help,</p>

<p>If this doesn't take you to the download page because it uses cookies, use the drop downs to select Satellite, P500, then All Operating Systems,, Touchpad.... and you'll get only two options, the Alps driver and the Synaptic one.&nbsp; Download the Synaptic one,
 although I'm using a Toshiba, not an HP, it works fine on Windows 7 64 bit here.</p>

<h2>            Issues with connecting two Xbox one controllers to windows 10 PC via any connection &#40;USB&#47;Wireless dongle&#41;.</h2>
                    
<p>Both controllers work fine on their own,</p>
<p>Can connect one controller just fine, it works in all games and input is great, but when two controllers are connected the one that was connected last gets no input, looks like both controllers are connected (no lights blinking) but one gets no input at
 all.</p>
<p>This seems to be an issue with the actual computer since it works fine with just one controller. Also tried on another computer (win10) and there both work flawlessly.</p>
<p>What I've tried so far:<br />
* Tried multiple USB ports (both usb2 &amp; usb3)<br />
<span>*Tried to Uninstall the adapter driver in device manager unplug the adapter then connect the adapter and re-install the driver.</span><br />

<p>Thanks for posting to answers.microsoft.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When installing the new drive was an image just installed on it from the previous drive?<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verify that the drive information is shown as unallocated space in Disk Management.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click StartORB / Right Click Computer and select Manage<span>&nbsp; </span>

<h2>            Just got brand new 500GB hard drive...so what do I do next&#63;</h2>
                    Ok I got a new 500GB HD and I want to take EVERYTHING on my old drive and put it on the new one. There's one problem though-I'm on a Dell computer that has a power hook-up for a slave drive but nowhere to actually tie it into the computer. I do have this
 old external drive thing that I can put an internal drive into but will it copy my operating system and everything else I need to make it my primary drive? Thank you for your help and time.

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
What is the make and model of the new hard drive? Also please tell us the model number of the Dell computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you are planning to copy operating system to another drive and boot from it then, it’s not going to be possible.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You have to install operating system on the new hard drive in order to boot from it. If the cable, used to connect external hard drive, supports internal hard drive then, you may connect the new hard drive and copy files to it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Check the below article which might help you in installing hard drive on your computer.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Install-or-remove-a-hard-disk-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Install-or-remove-a-hard-disk-drive</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may also try converting old hard drive (which is connected to the computer) to primary and then connect the new hard drive as secondary. Later you may try copying files.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Please check hard drive manual to change the jumper settings. Any incorrect changes may cause hardware failure or system crash.<br />
<div><br />
Also have a look at the below article.</div>

<p>If it's SATA, their has to be more than 1 SATA connector on the Motherboard. You only need,&nbsp; even if you have to "temporarily use" an existing DVD's connection on the motherboard.</p>

                    Ii just downloaded the app, figuring my grandson would enjoy it. However, there's no instruction manual, and the tool buttons don't tell you what they'll do. There's a camera option, but no "take a picture" button to click. Not all of us are kids--some
 of us old geezers need directions. <br />

            The problem I have is there's no "help" or "right click to figure out what things do" in the app. It's total trial and error, and perhaps if I were 5 like my grandson, I'd be able to figure it out. There are choices on the top of the screen, and more choices/icons
 on the bottom. The camera on the bottom opens up the 'real' camera on my computer, but there's no 'click here to take a picture' (not to mention I have no idea what to do with one.&nbsp; I'd rather see a tutorial of some sort than have to keep wading through forums
 to get a question answered. As for 'dropdown' I have no idea where that is? The top menu? The bottom menu. Windows 8 is hardly intuitive, and the apps, while great in theory, don't have enough information provided for how to use them.<br />

            <p>Hello:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just bought a new computer loaded with Windows 8. It is not a touch screen computer.&nbsp; I realize that Windows 8 was made more for touch screens.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded the Fresh Paint app and can not find out how to do anything. In old Paint I could draw lines and circle that were straight. I can find absolutely nothing on the new version that does this.&nbsp; All it has are free hand painting. It is difficult
 to draw a nice straight line or circle free hand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are few icons for anything except a camera. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I ask where these capabilities are located?.&nbsp; Or doesn't the new version do any of this?.&nbsp; Only free hand painting/drawing?.
</p>

Hi agan.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; I found 'regular ol' Paint' by typing "mspaint" in Run by pressing the Windows key and R simultaneously.

            I totally agree. Even my 14 year old who is working with computers everyday at school is having trouble understanding how to not only use these programs, but then explain them so that her dad and I understand and can work the computer for ourselves. Plus
 we seem to have a bug on our computer where it won't offer/allow me to set the right time on the computer itself. It is all done through the settings area........I want my START button back!!!!!!!! HELP!

            <p>My apologies, I've been away on holiday break.&nbsp; Digging through the forums, I see a couple recurring questions.&nbsp; I hope to help alleviate some frustrations:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8 is very touch-centric, but there are keyboard/mouse backups for the interactions.</p>
<ul>
<li>In Windows 8 it’s called “edgy.” It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you get the hang of it it’s quite nice.&nbsp; Just swipe down from the top of your screen and the menus will appear. If you are using a mouse you can right click.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will bring up the application toolbar.&nbsp; If you 'edgy' in from the right of the screen, you will bring up the charms.</p>

            Indeed, Paint is the "regular ol' Paint" whereas Fresh Paint is the new, realistic painting simulation.&nbsp; Each application has its own strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp; Paint is great for drawing lines and circles using their tools.&nbsp; Fresh Paint is great for finger
 or brush painting to produce a realistic simulation of real oil on canvas interactions.

            <p>I have read <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/6626ea6f-fb45-4ea1-a5af-750db2b81afd">
<font color="#0072c6">Jeff Herold</font></a>'s FAQ, and it is better than nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second "Reference" you&nbsp;included is a pointer to the app description, which I would hope everyone read before they downloaded the app (as it is really short).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There isn't anything in the FAQ for a person who has been using Win8 for more than a week. I'd like to learn more about painting, as I don't know squat about it. I keep getting hung up on stuff like using images and painting over them - my image just disappeared
 and I want to get it back (undo doesn't do it)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that either the Win8.1 version has this or someone will create it. I know it isn't your job to teach me to paint, but perhaps some links to 'the basics of&nbsp;oil painting' would be useful. You know, how to blend colors, when to use a fan brush vs. another
 brush, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I don't know much (almost nothing)&nbsp;about painting I will let someone that knows what they're doing pick links that would be good for beginners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm going to show it to my mother-in-law, she has painted about eighty protraits (she uses acrylics [spelling?] instead of oil, but I think it is the same thing)</p>

            <p>There does not seem to be any way to open a file in Fresh Paint, other than in the Gallery. For example, I used my son's Surface Pro to take a photo of his bedroom, and took photos of all the potential colors we are going to use. I did a "Save As" of all
 of these into separate files with the intent of loading the bedroom photo, applying the different colors, so we could choose which color we liked best. All "Save As" files are .png. A "right click" on a .png does not show Fresh Paint as an option under "Open
 With", and I can't find the .exe to force the issue. How can I open a file in Fresh Paint? BTW, I'm using Windows 8.1...</p>

            <p>I didn't get upset with my SURFACE WIN8, now 8.1, until this app! It looks awesome, but you have to have ESP in order to use it!&nbsp; Whether I'm using the touch screen or the mouse pointer on the keyboard, I can't seem to get any info on what each object does!
 I point to it, and nothing. No finger, info box or anything!&nbsp; Just the pointer arrow. I feel like I'm on LET'S MAKE A DEAL. You don't know what it does until you click on it!
</p>
<p>Am I that stupid that I should just dump this program? I really thought it would be great.</p>

<h2>            Getting Error Code 8C150009 on Console</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am not having any problems signing in to Xbox Live, playing on xbox live or purchasing and downloading content.</p>
<p>But when I go to "Account Management" on my console, in the area where it would normally say Gold Membership, it says "Cannot list your membership details at this time. Please try again later" Then a pop-up window comes up and says "There is a problem with
 the Xbox Live Service. Please try again later. Please see http://xbox.com/errorhelp for more details. Error Code 8C150009." I have been getting this message for a few weeks now.</p>
<p>Now when I go onto xbox.com, it says I am a Gold Member paid up to July 2013 and shows all my details without any problems. When I go to http://xbox.com/errorhelp and put in the code 8C150009 it gives a response "Error Code not found."</p>
<p>Why am I getting this error on my console and also why won't it list my membership details on my console? How do I get rid of this error?</p>

<p>Hey there, MattBuzz1969. The good news is that I am seeing your account here over Xbox.com and you do appear to be Gold. What happens when you attempt to redownload your profile onto an alternate storage device such as a USB drive configured for use with
 your console? Do you still receive the same error code?</p>

<p>I haven't tried that yet, I was a bit cautious about doing that with the recent problems that have occurred with users downloading profiles.
</p>
<p>I might try doing that then and see what happens :)</p>
<p>Do I have to move or delete my profile that is already on my hard drive in order to re-download it to USB or can I leave it on there while I download it?</p>

<p>I don't have any problems with the xbox.com website, everything shows correctly. I have even been on to the Microsoft Billing website and all details show correctly there too. It's weird because the only problem I am having is displaying my membership details
 on the console. I play on Xbox Live and have no issues, I can play online multiplayer and gold exclusive events so the system obviously knows I am gold but it just won't display it LOL
</p>
<p>Anyway, i will try downloading my profile to a USB and see what happens. I will post back once I have done this :)</p>

<p>Well it is a mystery :) I tried downloading my profile to USB and also deleted it from my xbox hard drive and re-downloaded it again to there. There were no errors when doing this and no problems.
</p>
<p>I have cleared the system cache and checked all my details are correct. But I still get the error 8C150009 when trying to display membership details on the console.... I think I will give up now LOL
</p>
<p>I am not having any other problems with accessing or using xbox live so it's a puzzle.

                    <p>hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have been using windows 10 for a couple of weeks now and since a couple of days i can't see if there are updates available or anything it only shows the loading animation(gray balls going from left to right) and that's it.</p>
<p>i looked in the services menu and saw that windows update and update orchestrator service both display status being stopped and i can't start them or anything else.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>also as a side observation, in the windows store i'm not able to download or install things...</p>

<p><strong><span><span>Windows Update Error code: 80073cf9</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The first thing I have seen to resolve this issue is to check your regional settings.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can do this by going to settings &gt; region.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you have made any changes to this since you got the phone, try changing this back to the original setting you had used.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Once you have done this, go to the active downloads and stop any that are stuck or pending and then try again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue continues the next thing to do is go to settings &gt; location.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Here I would like you to start by setting this to ON and then trying the updates again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Make sure to allow location services when prompted during the application update.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you continue to get this error, try turning this OFF and then trying again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Next, I would like you to go to settings &gt; storage sense.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you have a SD card in the phone, please check to see what you have set for "store new apps on my".<span>&nbsp;
</span>If this is set to SD card, please change this to phone and try again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If this allows you to complete the update/install, you can they attempt to move the application to the SD card after this completes.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The final thing I will suggest at this time is to do a soft reset of the phone.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can do this by going to settings &gt; storage sense &gt; phone &gt; temporary files &gt; delete &gt; Internet Explorer settings &gt; delete history.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Once this is done, press and hold the down volume button + the power button until the phone vibrates and reboots.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What type audio files are you adding to your Video Studio 10?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you tried to open the audio files using Media Player?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does it happen only with Video Studio 10?</span></p>
<p><span>Give us more information on the issue so that it will be helpful for us to understand the issue better and work on the same.</span></p>
<p><span>It appears that Visual Studio does not have a right CODEC. Make sure that you have right CODECS installed.</span></p>

<p><span>Also try playing a different audio file and check.</span></p>
<p><span>You should also consider using Movie Maker to create a Movie and check if you get the same error.

<h2>            Inaccessible boot device</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 10, upgraded from Windows 8 for many months on my HP Pavillion desktop. After adding the most recent updates in July my computer became very slow and I could not get some of my apps to run. I tried to unistall the upgrades. Now I get
 a "Stop Code" with the message |naccessible boot device. I have read most of the posts on the subject and have done the following: Made a Windows 10 ISO image and ran &nbsp;bootrec/scanos and /rebuildbcd and /fixmbr and /fixboot. I also ran checkdsk/f/r. I set
 the bios to default. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If I choose "Install" instead of repair would it wipe out my other programmes? I have a large no. of programmes I use on a regular basis and I would hate to have to reload them all on a clean disk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope there is an easy fix for this.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Hi Haroon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to confirm if you have tried to select other options from Windows Recovery Environment. You can try to click
<strong>Startup Repair </strong>or <strong>System Restore</strong>. If none of these will resolve your concern, we may need to reinstall Windows. You still have the option to keep your personal files by not formatting your partition. It will then create a folder
 called Windows.old which will contain all your data from previous installation, however, all third party software will be uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>Nie pobierzesz z innego konta niż to, na którym je zakupiłeś.</p>
<p>Gra jest przypisana do konta i prawdopodobnie też do pierwszej konsoli, na której zostanie zainstalowana. Nic innego nie wymyślisz. Ewentualnie przeniesienie licencji, ale to też chyba dopiero po pół roku można zrobić.</p>

<p>Już powiadomiłem kogo trzeba i domagam się zwrotu kasy za zakupioną ale nie pobraną grę. Z tym też nie jest łatwo bo potrzebują numer ID konsoli. A takiego nie mam, bo konsola jeszcze fizycznie nie została zakupiona. Zakupu gry dokonałem przez PC i chyba
 takiej opcji nie brali pod uwagę. Mają więc poważny problem do rozwiązania.</p>

<p>Po co w takim razie wykorzystałeś kod, skoro nie masz konsoli, na której mógłbyś tą grę zainstalować?</p>
<p>To tak jak byś kupił 50 litrów paliwa nie mając samochodu ani innego pojazdu/urządzenia na to paliwo LOL</p>
<p>Poza tym w warunkach i informacjach o grze jest napisane kto i gdzie może ją zainstalować?</p>
<p>Obstawiam, że jakiekolwiek powiadamianie kogokolwiek i Twoje żądania nic nie dadzą, tak to jest jak się nie czyta informacji albo czyta je&nbsp; nie rozumiejąc co jest napisane.</p>

<p>Czytamy ze zrozumieniem! Nie wykorzystywałem żadnego kodu, kupiłem grę, bo takie mam prawo. Mam prawo kupić paliwo do auta nawet gdy go nie mam. Potrzebuję je np. do kosiarki, picia itd. Jeżeli usługodawca dał możliwość zakupu gry przez PC to niech swój
 system przystosuje do takich warunków. I nie chodzi tu o granie na PC, bo gra jest na Xbox ale o możliwość odstąpienia od zakupu nie posiadając ID konsoli.</p>
<p>W warunkach zakupu gry nie jest napisane, że zakupu może dokonać TYLKO właściciel konsoli lub osoba posiadająca na niej konto.</p>
<p>Zgodnie z prawem KAŻDY ma możliwość odstąpić od zakupu przed upływem z góry określonego terminu. Własne i wewnętrzne regulaminy są w takiej sytuacji bezsilne, bo prawo jest dla wszystkich jednakowe.</p>

<p>[quote user="Janusz Wo"]Za pomocą PC i utworzonego konta kupiłem grę. Chciałbym teraz za pomocą Xbox i innego konta pobrać i zainstalować tą grę. Czy jest taka możliwość? Gdzie znaleźć kod zakupionej gry?[/quote]</p>
<p>Grą możesz pobrać tylko za pomocą konta, na którym grę zakupiłeś. Po pobraniu każde inne konto na danej konsoli może korzystać z gry.</p>

<p>Niestety nie masz racji. Zgodnie z prawem, w przypadku umów dostarczania treści cyfrowych, które nie są dostarczane na trwałym nośniku (czyli VOD, Steam, czy ten tutaj Marketplace) nie przysługuje prawo odstąpienia od umowy, jeżeli spełnienie świadczenia
 rozpoczęło się za uprzednią wyraźną zgodą konsumenta i po przyjęciu przez niego do wiadomości utraty w ten sposób przysługującego mu prawa do odstąpienia od umowy. Twoją wyraźną zgodą było kliknięcie przycisku "kup" (musiałeś kliknąć nawet 2 raz, żeby potwierdzić
 zakup). W regulaminie, który zaakceptowałeś przy tworzeniu konta jest mowa o tym, że zakupy elektroniczne w Marketplace nie podlegają zwrotowi. Poza tym chyba taka informacja wyświetla się także przy potwierdzeniu zakupu, nie jestem pewien, dawno nie kupowałem
 tutaj.</p>

<p>Kod nie jest potrzebny. Gra zacznie pobierać się automatycznie przy podłączeniu konsoli do internetu, przy aktualnie zalogowanym na niej profilu, na którym grę zakupiłeś. Nie pojawi się żadna informacja o tym, ale postępy pobierania będziesz mógł sprawdzić
 w opcjach konsoli. Adnotacja pojawi się, gdy gra zostanie pobrana całkowicie. Jeśli z jakiegoś powodu pobieranie się nie rozpocznie, wejdź
<a href="https://live.xbox.com/pl-PL/download/history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">tutaj</a> i kliknij "dodaj do kolejki" przy danej grze.</p>

<div>Having a problem with &nbsp;multiple cmd.exe *32 running in background on Win 7 Home Edition 64 bit. I also work on mainframe and have installed a 3270 emulator (Bluezone) and WSA. WSA (work station agent) is a little app that runs on the PC and intercepts
 commands from the mainframe. WSA is part of the mainframe ISPF Client/Server.</div>

<p>Never mind people I have found a Solution: It occurred tom my Xbox may still be under warranty luckily because it is still under warranty I used the online service center and am getting a replacement part as soon as I get the faulty part shipped to them!.</p>
<p>btw for those of you with the same problem and not covered by warranty you can buy a new AC adapter with them using the service center!.</p>
