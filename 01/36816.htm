<h2>            In Windows 7 explorer.exe is sudddently taking a huge amount of memory &#40;more than 1.5Go instead of 200K &#33;&#33;&#33;&#41;</h2>
                    Dear all,<br />
<br />
Since yesterday, my Windows 7 PC is almost unusable, because it's extremely slow until explorer.exe is not responding anymore and I have to kill it and restart it from Process Explorer !<br />
<br />
Every half-hour I have to kill explorer.exe because it uses something like 1.5GB, once it even went upto 2.1GB !!!<br />
<br />
If someone is able of analyzing it, I did a dump file...<br />
By the way I am a power user but I don't have any clue about what it could be.<br />
The PC has 8GB memory and two harddisk (one SSD and one plain SATA) and is a Lenovo Thinkpad T520.<br />
<br />
Any help would be really helpful because I don't understand at all where it could come from !<br />
<br />

            <p>hello magix_CH, and welcome to the Microsoft form&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>before posting the dump file attempt to do a system file checker, this might correct the error by itself</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>goto start -&gt; type "cmd" -&gt;right click -&gt;click " run as administrator"</p>
<p>type "sfc /scannow" without the quotas and press enter</p>
<p>let the scan complete</p>
<p>type "exit" without quotas and press enter</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>see it windows corrected the error, if it did not then please create a new dump file, windows may have corrected some but not all of the error, and post the new dump file&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>i hope this helps, good luck</p>

            Hello crazzy_,<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your quick answer :-)<br />
I followed your advice and tried "sfc /scannow" but it found no issue...<br />
<br />
Denis<br />
<br />
P. S. In my original email I should have said "more than 1.5Go instead of 80MB", of course.<br />
<br />
P. P. S. I also checked ShellExView but it's not very useful

            Dear all,<br />
<br />
Just to keep you updated, the last update on my system (the only one in the last 2 weeks) was "Adobe AIR". Just to test I uninstalled it completely, and the problem seems to have vanished. In fact explorer is still growing, but after 2-3 hours it's "only" at
 400MB which is nothing compared to before.<br />
<br />
I'll test 1-2 more days and keep you informed.<br />

            Dear all,<br />
<br />
Since I uninstalled Adove AIR it's a little better but the problem is not solved.<br />
<br />
explorer.exe now takes one day to reach 1GB of memory, it's slower but the problem is still there.<br />
<br />
crazzy: about clean boot, the problem is that I don't know what I should/could remove because I only have useful software.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 rip off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terryhalcrow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 rip off</h2>
                    When offered the win10 upgrade like millions I did it. and mostly it worked fine until the free period expired. Within a couple of days it started hanging then it sopped regognising some drivers on my pc. After soending hours trying to fix it I decided
 to revert back to win7. because I needed to reboot I used my original win7 disc and product key. ive now been told by microsoft support that to activate it I need to pay $119. this is such a con. first give away a new product . remove the old perfectly good
 product. then make new product not work and sell old product back to unsuspecting customer SCAM, RIP, OFF, CON,

            Since your machine had Windows 10, you can re-install it any time free of charge. You do not need any Windows 7 CD or product key but maybe a refresher on how to express dissatisfaction.

            <p>If&nbsp;you're getting ripped off you can yell at the top of your lungs. I had windows 7 pro on a newer machine which is supported by Microsoft past 20 20 although that could change. I did the free upgrade which was automatically download as an update and activated.
 my windows 7 was genuine so my win10 should be genuine until Microsoft stops supporting it. Windows 10 license will expire to me that means I'm getting robbed of 4 years genuine windows 7 and now have win10 that is not genuine. okay here is what I have found
 out so far and it is a little technical good thing I have some working knowledge . So far if you keep your genuine windows 10 updated to the newest build it will stay activated and so far mine is . Now here is the rest of the story and where technical know
 how is important . seems Microsoft has some issues with the current version update accidental maybe. you must know how to use services how keep adjusting background intelligence service. windows module installer, and windows update and it has to be done throughout
 the entire update. BTS HAS TO BE SARTED AND SET TO AUTOMATIC DELAYED SART AND WILL KEEP NSTOPPING THROUGHOUT THE UPDATE SAME THING WITH WINDOWS UPDATE AND WINDOWS MODULE. WINDOWS UPDATE NEEDS TO BE STARTED AND SET AT AUTOMACTIC DELAYED START , AND MODULE AT
 AUTOMATIC . EXIT AND THEN CHECK AND RECONFIGURE DURING UPDATE AND BEFORE RESTART. NOW I HAD TO GO THE&nbsp; PROCESS OF UDATING TO NEWEST VERSION THREE TIMES BEFORE I SUCEEDED AN SO FAR SO GOOD.
</p>
<p>NOW ON REINSTALLING WINDOWS 7 IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH WINDOWS 10 HERS THE RUB. YOU USE YOUR WINDOWS 7 DISC IT ASK YOU FOR YOUR PRODUCT KEY AND YOU ENTER THE LICENSE ON THE SIDE OF THE COMPUTER THAT CAME WITH TH TOWER WHEN YOU BOUGHT IT 4 YEARS AGO.
 WELL SUPRISE IT DOESN'T WORK MICROSOFT TELLS YOU TO CONTACT MANUFACTURER BECAUSE SUPPOSEDLY IT IS NOT A MICROSOFT ISSUE HMMM !! OKAY YOU DO BUT HERE IS THE NEXT RUB YOUR COMPUTER IS OUT OF WARRENTY SO YOU GUESS IT FOR A FEE YOU CAN DO A REMOTE WITH YOUR MANUFACTURERS
 TECH TAKING CARE OF EVERYTHING ON THE SPOT OR YOU CAN WAIT FOR DISK IN THE MAIL TO DO IT YOUR SELF ALL WITH YOU PAYING FOR SOMETHING YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO. NOW I COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT HOW WRONG THIS IS BUT WHY. NOW IF GOOGLE FLOODE THE MARKET WITH SAY $50.00
 OPERATING SYSTEMS WITH UNLIMITED SUPPORT MICROSOFT STOCK WOULD PLUMMET ;NEW RUBB THEY MAY ALREADY OWN GOOGLE SECRETLY LIKE A SHELL COMPANY WITH MAJORITY SHARES WAITAREN'T THEY GETTING IN BED WITHWHAT IS IT AZURE AND SOME LINUX TYPE THINGY . CAN YOU SAY MONOPOLY
 I WANT TO BE THE DOG . ANYWAY THAT IS THE STORY TRUE YOU BETTCHA BUT FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF . INDEPENDENT THINKING WITH A LITTLE DEDUCTIVE REASONING THROWN IN . NOW I NEED TO TAKE MY MEDS I'M GETTING A SICK HEADACHE.</p>

<p>Hello, my name is William Lucas and I am currently a senior in high school. Every senior in my school must do a senor project. For my senior project I am building a computer. I have already gone a bit over budget for what I wanted to originally pay. I still
 need an OS and was wondering if Microsfot woudl give me a copy of windows 7 for educational use. Please tell me if anyone thinks they may or how I can get ahold of them to ask formally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a ton guys,</p>

            Hi Bryan, yes you can update offline using the Windows 10 ISO
<br />
<br />Please do not update at this time . . .
<br />
<br />Microsoft have pulled that update, it is no longer available on the download page and has been removed from Windows Update, a bug was found in that update, where for some users, all the users files were deleted and were not recoverable. 
<br />
<br />So, until this bug is resolved, do not update . . .
<br />
<br />Keep an eye on the link below, 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />When that reports that the October 2018 Update is available download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Then on the other PC, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<p>Hi, I actually ran the latest tool but it seemed to run through the 1803 update again.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>So if I am right it will be the same process but use the 1809 download when it becomes available.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Bryan, yes it will be the exact same process when 1809 is re-released - you will need to re-download the media creation wool and ISO . . .

            Ok I fixed it. If anybody has this problem just goto control panel&gt;Programs and Features&gt;Turn windows features on or off&gt;Media Features.. expand it and uncheck media player this will dissable it from windows. Reboot then re enable it by rechecking it.
 Thats what worked for me.

<h2>            Xbox One making noise while off</h2>
                    <p>I was woken up by this nightmarish, high pitched buzzing sound. I thought it was an alarm, or maybe someones fire alarm was going off, but it was coming from my xbox! It was turned off, I wasn't installing anything, and I had to unplug the power supply to
 make it stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is my xbox one dying? Do I need a new power cord? What's going on?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, it's possible your power settings are set to instant on. When that is on the Xbox is only in standby mode, so the fan will still move and sometimes may make a noise. If you don't want that, then change the power setting to power saving mode, and that
 will completely turn the Xbox off.

 just add. Depending on your power settings, you might have it set to turn off when activity is done. Some activities would be, downloading&nbsp;a game or an update.&nbsp;</span></span><br />

<p>Hey GamerCat492!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yeah, the console is not supposed to make any high pitched sounds at all. </p>
<p>If changing your power mode doesn't help, it could be very well that there is a mechanical issue with your console and you might want to talk to support about your repair options for it.
</p>
<p>You can check what kind of options are available on your side by going to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/devices</a> or you can contact&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;support directly at
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Customer Support</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Look that info through and let us know if that helps with the issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Everyone,<br />
<br />
Hi have Windows Vista Home Premium, with WMP 11 version 11.0.6000.6336. When i open TVU player, which is a TV streaming program, i get the error "Failed to Invoke Windows Media Player Object. Please re-install your Windows Media Player." , so i was wondering
 if there is a way to re-install it, of repair it, because i cant find a way to remove it. Also, when I open another program called Easy Wifi Radar, it says "Component 'wmp.dll' or one of its dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid"
 . <br />
<br />
<br />
Please Help</p>

<p><span>Hi ermal9000,</span></p>
<p><span>My version of Windows Media Player 11 is 11.0.6001.7000. Please make sure that you have the most up-to-date version through Windows Update. Do the following:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In ‘Start Search’ type Windows Update, press Enter (provide administrative credentials if prompted)</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click <strong>
Check for updates</strong> in the top left-hand corner</span></p>
<p><span>Also see if you need the following update:</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/941651" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>KB 941651:
<span>Cumulative update for Windows Media Player 11 in Windows Vista</span></span></span></a></strong></p>
<p><span>That update should come through Windows Update, but if for whatever reason it doesn’t, you can double-check that you have it by trying to download it as a
 standalone. It should tell you that it doesn’t apply to your system if you already have it. Make sure that you download the correct version; there is a 32-bit and a 64-bit which is dependent on whether you are running a 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows
 Vista. You can check which version you have by doing the following:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click<strong> Start</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Right-click
<strong>Computer</strong>, then click<strong> Properties</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under System type: you will see either “<strong>32-bit Operating System</strong>” or “<strong>64-bit Operating System</strong>”</span></p>
<p><span><span>If that still does not resolve the issue, let’s run the
<strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong> tool to see if there are any missing or corrupt system files that it can fix or replace. To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In ‘<strong>Start Search</strong>’ type
<strong>cmd</strong>, then right-click <strong>cmd</strong> and click
<strong>Run as administrator</strong> (provide administrative credentials if prompted)</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>At the command prompt type “<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>” (no quotes), and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When the SFC scan is complete test to see if the issue is resolved.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We look forward to hearing back from you with your results.

<h2>            What&#39;s Happened To The Split On-Screen Keyboard Layout&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a Surface Pro 2 which has been upgraded to Windows 10. I applied all the latest updates when I first got it but now I have noticed that the only useful on-screen keyboard mode, the split keyboard, is no longer available. Is there some way
 I can get it back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, it is the one and only useful mode for the OSK because it is the only way you can type when you are holding the device (given that a Surface is way too heavy to hold one handed while you type). I'm sure it was there in the release version of Windows
 10 because I remember being really impressed by the changes, especially the repositioning of the auto-complete choices where you could actually reach them. It beggars belief that Microsoft would remove something that actually worked.</p>

    <title>Flash symbol pops up in the bottom right-hand corner of my screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nuria0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Flash symbol pops up in the bottom right-hand corner of my screen</h2>
                    <p>Ever since a recent Windows update that occurred on my desktop (the update took over an hour which was really strange), system functions have been extremely slow. On top of this, every minutes or so the flash icon (puzzle piece) appears inside a white box
 in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. It only appears for a second, then disappears. I am worried that it is a virus. On one occasion, I hovered my mouse over the spot where it usually pops up and quickly clicked on it when it appeared. It didn't
 do anything, but the mouse loaded for ages which made me worry that it had to do with a virus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing that has been happening recently is when I go to a link from Outlook. When going to the desired link, another tab opens up in chrome along with it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://--disable-features%3Dloadingwithmojo/</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am very worried that these are viruses. Does anyone have any idea what they are and whether they are harmful or not?</p>

<p>Hi Nuria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing this to the Community. There's a possibility that your Flash was automatically updating that time. We suggest that you ran a full scan using the
<strong>Windows Defender</strong> to make sure that your device is safe. For details and process, you can check and review our article from our support site on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17464/windows-defender-help-protect-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the opening content on Outlook with Chrome issue, upon checking it with Google site, you need to uninstall a certain program. Please try the following steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Type <strong>"Control Panel"</strong> on the Search box.</li><li>Go to or click <strong>Uninstall Program</strong>. </li><li>Look for <strong>Trusteer Endpoint Protection</strong> (if you have it) and uninstall it.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We will wait for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Leviozar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Trusteer what has been causing the issue? I have it and I always thought that it was a good thing to have as it protected any websites I went on that may ask for my credit card details or other discrete information. Is this app safe?</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, on a good note, I managed to get rid of the Outlook issue! I went into the McAfee application and a notification came up saying that a virus or trojan was found and that I needed to restart my computer to get rid of it. I did this and it worked.
 Unfortunately, the Flash icon still constantly pops up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to scan, will my computer turn off because the function says that the "full scan" could take longer than an hour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My apologies, I have two accounts under the same email address and this one is from years ago that I forgot I created (under a false name). I am now unable to access the account that I posted my original comment with because apparently it is only this one
 that is connected to my email address.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have it set up for Gmail, yahoo, verizon and netzero mail accounts. However, the outlook.com account which uses my ureach.com log on as an alias in logging in there and for Microsoft doesn't sync. Neither does the ureach.com mail using either its registered
 pw or the MS pw. Also, another e-mail account (iwon.com which I use for junk mail and internet requests for an e-mail) won't work.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems you are managing multiple accounts in Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; Are you facing an issue with ureach.com account or Outlook.com?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say" I cannot get e-mail from this free account " Are you referring to Outlook.com?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ureach.com is the third party email provider, nothing to do with Outlook.com server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide more clarity so&nbsp; that we can proceed with the next step.</p>

            <p>I cannot get mail from either ureach.com or outlook.com. Let me explain further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My ureach.com e-mail address is my primary alias for MS Live and outlook.com (yahoo.com e-mail is a secondary alias) and both of the latter have a single, distinct password to log in to MS Live and oulook.com. I just tried these logons and they work outside
 of Windows 10 mail app. My ureach.com e-mail account has its own distinct logon and, just this instance, I logged in outside of Windows 10 e-mail app and there are 2 unread items in my inbox. When I now try to access ureach.com e-mail through Windows 10 Mail,
 I see a message " We didn't find anything to show here."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, I again tried to add my outlook.com e-mail just now and it accepts the afore mentioned id and password, says it added the account but the account does not show in the listing of accounts aggregated by Windows 10 e-mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another problem with those accounts that do work on inbox access (G-mail, yahoo.com web mail, verizon.net mail (through yahoo verizon) and netzero webmail),&nbsp; I cannot view "sent" mail or other folders in each account.&nbsp; I followed the server address listings
 for pop or imap per the providers when they were set up. In the case of netzero, it combines my inbox with junk mail as well.</p>

            Thanks, but I am not running Windows Live mail. What I have is the Calendar and Mail app from the Microsoft store which is installed by default with Windows 10 Home when installed by the Windows Update method.

<p>It might help if you were to explain what you mean by <em>MS Live</em>. You posted in the forum for Windows Live Mail, but it turned out two weeks later that you're not using this program at all, but in fact using the Windows 10 app called Mail. So where
 does <em>Live </em>come into it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This confusion is not at all of your making: blame Microsoft for using such similar and easily-confused names for wildly different programs and services. I've now moved your post to the appropriate forum.&nbsp;</p>

<div><br />
<div>If they can't be read in any computer. Download and install the <a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/Hard-Disk-Utils/HP-USB-Disk-Storage-Format-Tool.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            User name and password</h2>
                    I have recently opened a skype account and had to reset the password a few times as skype was not recognising it. I tried to access the live chat option in sky support to solve the problem and discovered that my username is not being recognised either.
 What can I do to sort this problem?

<h2>            Ricoh printer is seen by Win7 but won&#39;t print.</h2>
                    Win7 Home Premium 64-bit. Ricoh Aficio c210SP Color Laser .<br />
<br />
Machine sees printer, can't find driver. Went to Ricoh site, DL driver, tell Win7 where it's at. Can't find it.<br />
<br />
Go to driver location, start install process. Gets to a point and stops.<br />
<br />
WinXP laptop sees this printer and plays nicely.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance?<br />
