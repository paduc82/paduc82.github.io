<h3> ms ky user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Force Display Output via HDMI Port</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Question:&nbsp; The goal is to display two screens (same video screen) from the computer to two projectors for a presentation using Power Point Slides.&nbsp;&nbsp; Attaching to one projector works fine, but when I attach a HDMI splitter to hook up the second
 projector, the computer no longer detects the display and will use the HDMI port as an output.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thus, can you force a video output from the HDMI port using Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Windows 2.1 sound issue</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Hi. I'm having an issue regarding my sound system for PC (Windows 10). My two speakers (R &amp; L) are connected to a sub, which through a 3.5 cable is connected to my PC. The problem is that my sub is recognized as my right speaker and the sub itself, and therefore
 my actuall right speaker is completely silent. I've tried anything and everything to get this solved but nothing has helped me out, but perhaps someone here could assist me.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Is there any way to "Re-route" the channels so I can separate the subwoofer from the right speaker?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
When I plug in my phone to the 3.5 connector it works like a charm so it's no hardware issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Hope you can help me!</p>

<p>I've not made any recent updates. Issue has been on both Windows 8 and now when I upgraded to windows 10 it still exists. I've tried to reinstall realtek drivers like 10 times with no luck and tried every different sound-option availble
 both in windows and bios.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue has existed for 2 months roughly. Before that I wasnt using my speakers at all for a while but it did work once, maybe 6 months ago&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            online credit limit reached&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>ok so first off, I took a break from reach awhile back and now i keep on hearing about these credit bans, but let me explain. I was playing all day yesterday trying to complete the weekly challenge (which i did). I started around 6 AM took a four hour break
 at 1 and kept going til about 9:30 or so and around that time it said "online credit limit reached". I got so many credits that day! it was awsome. I went from like a commander grade 1 up to a colonel in one day. I hit the 24,000 cr jackpot in team objective,
 then I got the weekly challenge, I at least got around seven 3,000 jackpots, and advanced 9? or so commendations to their silver state so i was swimming in money at the time (plus all of the other credit bonus's you get for completing a game). does anyone
 know why they are doing this? is there a daily limit? have i reached that limit? do i have no life for reaching the limit of credits you can earn in one day!? I havn't gone on to check if i can receive credits yet, but man i wasn't expecting this to happen
 at all. makes me kind of sad really...</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;They implemented a daily credit limit to keep the game balanced. It stops people from boosting credits all day long. I believe the limit is currently set at 120,000 Cr. It will reset itself around 6:00 A.M. Eastern time the next day.&nbsp;

<p>It's put into place to stop boosters (or at least limit) from progressing to Inheritor in a short amount of time. Games such as Call of Duty don't have an XP cap, and therefore boosters could literally reach max rank in a few days. It's just there to limit
 people from playing the game incorrectly.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>120,000 cR is also something most people will never see in one day. It's set there because it's a realistic goal, but people aren't going to hit it very often. However playing for 11 hours in one day would probably do it. Let's say you get 10,000 cR an hour
 (pretty easy for a higher ranked player), that's 110,000 cR right there. Commendations are included in the cap, and some (but NOT all) jackpots are too.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I said a realistic <b><i><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">goal</span></i></b>. As in, "I bet I can hit the cR cap today!". You just proved that. The cap was set for a majority of the community, and the majority aren't earning 5k-7k per game as most
 people are not in the high ranks. I do think Bungie should either increase the cap limit or just get rid of it before Bungie Day (or maybe FOR Bungie day) before they completely hand everything to 343i since a lot more people are going to find that the cap
 is getting easier to hit. But, I'm still getting like 2k-3k per game at Field Marshall (70k away from Hero), so it's not much of a problem unless you're higher like your current rank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think the big jackpots (like the 24,000 one over the weekend) count towards the cap. Or at least they usually don't. Commendations are of little significance once you're a high rank. In most cases, it takes much longer to rank up your commendations,
 and most don't give you that much of a bonus anyway. For a lot of them, going from Gold to Onyx gives you like 2500 cR. And the dailies usually add up to less than 7k cR per day, and you can only get one weekly each week (obviously), so they're also not really
 significant in hitting the cap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mean it's definitely a good system and works well in preventing a lot of boosting. I would like to see it raised though to maybe like 400,000. That way most people will never have a chance at hitting it, and it will still provide a barrier to boosting.</p>

            Hi dporter4,<br />
<br />
In my opinion, you can try to update your BIOS, and Chipset driver as a test. If it's convenience to remove a Memory, you can try to remove one as a test. In addition, you can try to reinstall the driver controller.<br />
<br />
<strong>BIOS DISCLAIMER:</strong> <br />
Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings
 can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<br />
<br />
<strong>But first, use the Keyboard</strong> <br />
=============<br />
First, please disconnect all USB devices. Then, go through the following steps:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Press "Ctrl + Esc" to open the Start Menu. <br />
2. Type Device Manager in the Search bar and press "Enter". Click Continue if necessary.<br />
3. In Device Manger, press Tab and use "Up" and "Down" to move the highlight to "Universal Serial Bus Controllers".<br />
4. Press "Right" and expand it.<br />
5. Press "Down" to move to the first item and press "Delete" to remove it. <br />
6. Repeat the step 5 and uninstall all items under "Universal Serial Bus Controllers".<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Then, restart your computer and Windows 7 will reinstall all controllers automatically.
<br />
<br />

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to effectively assist you, can you confirm if you are trying to install Windows updates but those specific KB updates are failing? Also, are you using any third party antivirus programs? if yes, have you tried to disable them and see if it helps?
 Have you also tried to visit the links provided and see the steps provided in there?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Antivirus software can help you protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn’t disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you’re done. If you’re connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>I have observed an issue with KB4022719 on 7 hosts, all Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my scenario, I was receiving 0x80004005 in the Setup Windows Log as well:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Package KB4022719 failed to be changed to the Installed state. Status: 0x80004005.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>After examining the first 4 hosts, looking at the logs, I thought the issues were caused by lack of disk space on the system recovery partition. The clue which led me to think it could have been the lack of space in the system recovery partition was the
 0x70 error reported in the CBS log:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>BFSVC: Error copying boot files from C:\Windows\boot\PCAT to \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolume1\Boot! Last Error = 0x70 "][gle=0x80004005]</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The error code 0x70 means ERROR_DISK_FULL, which is self explanative. Over the years, I have seen that connected with the issues due a full system recovery partition in a number of scenarios.
</p>
<p>Most of this scenarios have been due the unusual (weird? unexpected?) use of the system recovery partition from a backup solution, Dell AppAssure. There is a well known issue with the AppAssure logs filing up the system recovery partition. As a couple of
 years ago we moved away from AppAssure (for this class of hosts, we are still using it for some other hosts), we have deleted the AppAssure logs in the vast majority of hosts, but apparently not in this bunch, and for some reason this specific update seems
 to be using more system recovery space than the recent updates.</p>
<p>I have delete the AppAssure logs from a couple of the hosts, and I then succesfully reapplied KB4022719:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>Package KB4022719 was successfully changed to the Installed state.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>After applying KB4022719, Windows Update in one of the hosts requested KB3177467, the other KB3042058.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>Any idea's on how to resolve this issue please?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>When did this issue started. For example, did the issue occur after you installed some windows updates or third party software?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Generally, this kind of issue can be caused by the following factors.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. Third party software conflict.<br />
<br />
2. Virus and spyware.<br />
<br />
3. Corrupt Windows components.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Based on the situation, let’s try the following steps to troubleshoot the issue.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<br />
regsvr32 msmpeg2vdec.dll<br />
<br />
regsvr32 msmpeg2adec.dll<br />
<br />
exit<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Step 2: Upgrade Windows Media Player security<br />
<br />

<p>Bonjour à toutes et à tous,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Par avance je suis désolé si je poste au mauvais endroit, si je dois me présenter dans une catégorie bien précise avant de demander de l'aide. N'hésitez pas a me fouetter et a m'envoyer le lien vers l'endroit ou me présenter. Je ne sais pas si on parle également
 Français par ici, si non, je vais faire un petit coup de google traduction ;-) <br />
<br />
Bon.. je tourne en rond depuis maintenant 2 heures, je commence a en avoir marre, donc en attendant de pouvoir téléphoner au support, je vous demande de l'aide en espérant pouvoir réussir a me connecter a Xboxlive !
<br />
<br />
J'essai depuis tout à l'heure de connecter ma Xbox360 à internet... j'ai eu plusieurs problèmes. Il y a différent cas ; j'ai fais des tests de connexions :<br />
<br />
1) Ma xbox ne veut pas se connecter à internet <br />
<br />
2) Ma xbox se connecte à internet mais n'arrive pas a se connecter au XboxLive<br />
<br />
3) Ma xbox se connecter à internet / xbox live, me demande de faire une mise à jour de ma console, la mise à jour bloque. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Donc là je bug un peu..... <br />
<br />
Précision : <br />
<br />
- Ma xbox est connecté en filaire sur ma box free</p>
<p>- J'ai accepté le partage réseau <br />
<br />
- Je n'arrive pas a entrer le code (à 8 chiffres) sur le Windows Media Center <br />
<br />
- J'ai ma Xbox et mon PC qui utilise la même IP ? <br />
<br />
- Je n'arrive pas a ce que la Xbox soit accepté dans le réseaux, pourtant elle arrive a se connecter dessus...
<br />
<br />
Voilà, je suis perdu, à bout de force, limite a ce que ma manette traverse la télé. Donc si une âme charitable, Anglosaxon, Français, Turque, Martien... pouvait me donner un coup de pouce, ca serait bien.
<br />
<br />
(Si j'ai quelques réponses, si vous avez besoins d'informations complémentaires afin de mieux cerner le problème que je rencontre, je ferais une vidéo directement, que je posterais ici)<br />
<br />
<br />
Par avance, un big up à tous ! <br />
Merci, Corentin3D<br />
<br />
(et ne me fouettez pas trop fort please)<br />

<p>Bonjour, </p>
<p>Tout d'abord merci à toi pour l'intérêt que tu as porté a mon problème. </p>
<p>Il s'agit en effet d'un conflit de IP lorsque la connexion réseau ce fait.</p>
<p>Pour testé, j'ai tout simplement débrancher le câble internet de mon PC à ma box, puis j'ai branché le cable internet de ma box à ma Xbox360, cela a fonctionner correctement, j'ai pu me connecter, aller sur le live, jouer...
</p>
<p>Après avoir regardé plusieurs tutoriels (écrits et vidéos) sur la modification d'un IP, je n'y arrive pas. Aurais-tu un tuto qui explique correctement comment changer l'IP afin que je puisse me connecter et sur internet avec mon PC et sur le live avec ma
 360 en même temps ? </p>
<p>En te remercient sincèrement, </p>
<p>Corentin3D</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>ANGL TRAD :</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Firstly thank you to you for the interest you paid to my problem.</p>
<p>It is indeed a conflict of IP when the network connection that fact.</p>
<p>For testing, I just unplug the internet cable from my PC to my box, then I plugged the internet cable from my box to my Xbox360, it has run correctly, I was able to connect, go to live , play ...</p>
<p>After watching several tutorials (written and video) on the modification of an IP, I do not. Would you have a tutorial that explains how to properly change the IP so that I can connect with the internet and my PC and on live with my 360 at the same time?</p>
<p>Sincerely thank you,</p>
<p>Corentin3D</p>

<h2>            Minimize&#47;Maximize &#34;button&#34; gone from apps</h2>
                    There are several threads about this button, in addition to the close "button," being missing. However, only my minimize "button" on the top right of my screen is gone. I still have the close "button" This is only happening with Netflix and Yahoo Mail.
 My Google Chrome browser still has the minimize option. I changed my screen saver and theme today, as well as changed some of my task bar options. I have gone back and tried to choose every option available- in case I inadvertently changed something. Does
 anybody have any suggestions of how to fix this? Thanks. &nbsp;As a side note, I'm not sure if I even picked the right topic to post under, but this was what I was doing when I screwed this up, so hopefully I'm posting in the right place.

<p>My Jigsaw Puzzle HD app&nbsp;on windows 8.1 PC cannot download any pictures for use. The daily pictures, the in-app purchases, nothing downloads.</p>
<p>Is there a setting I can change so it can properly connect and download? I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling.

<h2>            Windows 10 1903 - Blue Screen after Hibernation</h2>
                    <p>After installing Windows 10 1903 I started getting Blue Screen after Hibernation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop code: SYSTEM THREAD EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED.</p>
<p>Event Viewer error: Windows failed to resume from hibernate with error status 0xC0000001.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That didn't happen before installing an update. My previous version was 1803, not 1809.</p>
<p>I've also checked for latest updates and tried to run 'Troubleshoot settings - Power', it didn't find any problems.</p>
<p>Link to minidump:&nbsp;https://1drv.ms/u/s!Au7MOnGn-rJzgotojHt3ZbRgN8HfeQ?e=bnD3Vw</p>
<p>What other info I can provide to identify the cause?</p>

            Updating BIOS didn't work well with another OS, so I have to roll it back. It seems that restore from hibernate works fine if I set Windows Boot Manager as default in BIOS instead of selecting Windows in another loader. Looks like the only way for now
 is to keep Windows Boot Loader as default and switch to another one manually when needed
