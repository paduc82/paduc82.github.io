<h2>            Installing Windows 10 onto a USB device</h2>
                    I reserved my free upgrade of windows 10 and I was wondering if I could install Windows 10 (from the free upgrade) onto a flash drive and install it on a new gaming computer I'm building in the future. Also if I decide to install Windows 10 on my current
 pc would I have to reinstall my drivers? Thanks in advance.

    <title>BUG&#58; Right hand side of touchpad unresponsive to tap-to-click. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#123;jfs&#125;  say:</h3>
<h2>            BUG&#58; Right hand side of touchpad unresponsive to tap-to-click.</h2>
                    <p>When the "...help prevent cursor accidentally moving while you type..." setting is set to anything other than no delay, then the right one-third of the touch pad is unresponsive to taps (tap-to-click) if the touchpad hasn't been touched for a little while.
 This behavior is independent of whether any keys on the keyboard have been pressed or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the "...help prevent cursor accidentally moving while you type..." setting is set to no delay, then it works fine (but of course the touching the touchpad while typing becomes an issue).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Physical clicks (not tap-to-click) work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is on a Suface Book i7 256GB dGPU, with all updates to date, including TH2.</p>

            After finding that "No Delay (Always ON)" is the only way to have sensitivity everywhere, I've retrained myself not to drag my thumbs on the touchpad when I type. &nbsp;Retraining old habits is tough to do, but now my touchpad works like I want.

            <p>This was driving me nuts.&nbsp; If you set touchpad delay it should only disable tap to click from the edges of the touchpad.&nbsp; This is reasonable and how it works on my wife's dell xps 15.&nbsp; However, on the surface book it only disables the *right* edge of the
 touchpad and *doesnt* disable the left, bottom, or top edge of the touchpad.&nbsp; Worse, it disables the right edge by roughly 4x what it should.&nbsp; So if you are tapping on the right 3/8 of the touchpad it won't tap to click.&nbsp; Basically, instead of disabling the
 left, bottom, and top edges it seems to be adding to and disabling more of the right edge and making it unusable for tap to click.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:&nbsp; now that I observe how my hands brush the touchpad while typing I'm starting to think this might actually be intended functionality.&nbsp; While typing, my left hand barely hovers over the left side of the touchpad whereas my right hand hovers over the
 right 3/8 of the touchpad.&nbsp; I think the solution they came up with (to disable tap to click on the right 3/8 of the touchpad) starts to make sense, although you would think you should still be able to tap to click after some "delay".</p>

<p>Nice attempt at explaining the problem, but unfortunately it's an intermittent problem that seems to almost be non existant at times, so it must just be a bug, or simply a few of us have faulty touch pads, and not intentional programming by MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to those people who have had success with adjusting delay times, I haven't found that to be a solution. It's far too inconvenient and only seems to work for a brief time. I have, however, had far more success with disengaging 'pinch to zoom'.
 I found that to be far more&nbsp;effective for a much longer duration with only very occasional malfunctioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also noticed that the problem seems to occur only when using office 365 programs, such as Outlook and Word. I'm using 64bit. Anyone using 32bit and noticed problems?</p>

            I've had this problem since I first bought my surface book. However, since upgrading to the"creators" release and seeing the touchpad sensitivity to"medium" (touchpad sensitivity is new with this release) the problem has pretty much gone. &nbsp;Touchpad sensitivity
 has replaced the Palm check settings so I'm not sure if this has some other negative side effects but we will see. Anyway the dead right hand side of the touchpad problem is much better.

</blockquote>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>It's true that Windows 95 is no longer supported.</p>
<p>However, you should still be able to transfer files from Windows 95 to Windows 7, as long as you are careful.</p>
<p>Make sure that you do not transfer any System, Utilitiy, Configuration,&nbsp;or Program files.</p>
<p>Only transfer personal data files, such as documents, images, and other personal data. You will need to make sure that all of the files you transfer have Windows 7 compatible programs that can use them, or that they can be converted to a file type that is
 compatible.</p>
<p>You have some homework to do.&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            can&#39;t stream files to ps3 &#34;there are no titles&#34;</h2>
                    Dear Community: I like to stream videos (and pictures, music, etc) from my desktop via wifi net to my PS3, which works great almost always (PS3 Meida Server on an i3 3.2ghz&nbsp; 1tb HDD in Win 7). I recently added Avid's Pro Tools SE software &amp; keyboard (hardware)
 and the drives and file names show up on the PS3 media crossbar (XMB), but when I try to see a file PS3 returns "There are no titles". Online searches (including on Avid,s FAQ support site) have given no answers to this specific situation. A Restore operation
 to just before the Avid was installed brings the titles back again (I have done this twice now). I would like to use my new music keyboard and software on this machine without giving up my ability to stream media to Ps3. Obviously there is a conflict, but
 I haven't been able to find it. Anybody?&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>What is the make and model number of the keyboard you are using?</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> I would suggest you to uninstall the Avid software, place the computer in clean boot and then install the Avid software and check if you can stream
 media:</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span><b>Note</b>: After troubleshooting, make sure to set the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</p>

<p><b>Method 2:</b> Make sure that the files you access are file types that are supported by the PlayStation 3; otherwise, the PlayStation 3 will not be able to read
 it.</p>

            Dear Imran Chand - Thanks for taking time to try to help me with this (and on a holiday no less, at least where I am - don't know where you are of course). Your questions suggest a closer reading of my post is in order. The make is Avid, as I said (don't
 know model number - not listed anywhere, not even on the unit - part# and S/N are there, but suffice to say it's a 49-note polyphonic keyboard). Also, I already said I uninstalled the software (twice) when I said I did a Restore (which uninstalls it). Have
 tried the Clean Boot route before also, without success. However, the entire question is somewhat moot now since I successfully installed the whole thing on both my laptop (running Win 7 Home Premium) and my old desktop XP machine, so putting it two places
 is probably enough. I wanted it everywhere so I had lots of flexibility, but I guess I'll just swallow my pride and leave it off the big machine, which does stream video files beautifully without the Avid software (BTW, the laptop doesn't h

<h2>            &#91; Windows Firewall &#93; Cant block incoming connections by IP</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to block incoming connections for specific IP addresses. But any inbound rules doesn't work. Even if I remove all inbound rules remote computer can still connect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I did:</p>
<p>1- I defined a rule to allow all incoming connections.</p>
<p>Rule settings as below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc66842a-ed85-4012-9501-04fd5ac29719?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc66842a-ed85-4012-9501-04fd5ac29719?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>2- I defined a second rule to block all incoming connections from some specific IP addresses.</p>
<p>Rule settings as below:</p>

<h2>            Frequent BSOD, relating to Memory</h2>
                    Hello everybody!<br />
<br />
I have been plagued by frequent BSOD's with the following errors:<br />
<br />
MEMORY_MANAGEMENT<br />
PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA<br />
PFN_LIST_CORRUPT<br />
<br />
I have tried updating drivers but that didn't get me anywhere, I have done several memtest runs and they couldn't find anything wrong with the hardware.<br />
<br />
Any help, please?<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is a link to my recent dump files;<br />

<br />
any other information that I would need to present? :)<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

</p><p>These three were related to memory corruption (not video) but verifier didnt catch the problem.&nbsp; It may be an OS driver that is at fault and you can check that by changing the set of drivers being verified to "all".</p>
<p>
</p><p>That will give you a better chance of catching it but it will slow your computer down a bit.</p>

<p>Hey there FireStar! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are running into this with Forza Horizon 4 </p>
<p>If you are not playing on the Xbox One I would assume you are playing on the Windows platform, is this correct?
</p>
<p>Also if your account is a "Child" account you might want to take a look at the Parental Controls that have been placed on your account. You can always do this by going through the support article
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12439/microsoft-account-set-child-restrictions-windows-10-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
"Set restrictions for your child on Windows 10 and&nbsp;Xbox One" </a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps! </p>

<p>Hey there FireStar! </p>
<p>
</p><p>We were&nbsp;able to find some more specific information on this specific issue straight from the
<a href="https://forums.forzamotorsport.net/turn10_postst47430_Locked-Privilege-This-feature-is-blocked-per-your-XBOX-LIVE-parental-control-setting.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Forza motorsport Forums</a>. Now it's not for the exact game but it is for the Forza Franchise so&nbsp;we hope this helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would have to go through the Online Security &amp; Safety and just make sure that the option labeled "you can see and share content" is set to "Everybody" and after switching this just try and restart your PC and then give it another try.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if this works! Thanks </p>

<h2>            How do I unlock some songs that were ripped from CD&#39;s and then locked unexpectantly&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A couple of months ago, I was making some new CD's to replace the ones that were skipping. I tried Windows Media Player but it didn't work for some reason, then Windows Explorer and lastly, Roxio Burner which I think made some of&nbsp;my songs locked-up suddenly.
 Ever since; I've been having problems with them, even I can't play these songs anymore. And the worst part is whenever I try, a window keeps popping out saying 'The license cannot be downloaded because your Web browser is not supported. To download a license,
 you must Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 or later.' I would have downloaded a new version of Internet Explorer but the last time I did gave me a virus. What should I do about my locked song files? Please help me, anybody!</p>

<p><span><font><font color="#000000">How to Convert Write Protected WMA to MP3</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000">1- Open your preferred CD burning software and insert the rights-protected files you'd like to convert. Depending on the software, you can open the files in the burn pane
 or drag and drop them from another folder into the pane. You can also reorder the files in the pane as necessary.
</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000">You must obtain the rights for all files you're trying to convert. If the software cannot find the rights on your computer, it will prompt you to download them from the
 Internet. In some cases, they might already be free, but in others you might have to pay for the rights. Remember that the software will not burn anything until it makes contact with the digital rights on your computer.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000">2- Insert your disc of choice (CD-R or CD-RW) into the computer's CD drive. Wait for the software to recognize the CD, and press the "burn" button or command to start transferring
 your songs. Close out of any other applications, including Internet browsers, email management software and games, beforehand, as they can hinder the quality of the burn process.
</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000">When the process is complete, the software usually ejects the disc by default. If it doesn't, manually eject the disc when prompted by the software that it is finished.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000">3- Put the disc back into the computer and open the ripping software. Navigate to the "Options" menu underneath the "Rip" tab to specify the type of format (such as MP3),
 the quality file you desire (such as "medium," "good" or "best") and the folder where the songs should be ripped and saved. Press the "Rip" command and again, do not have any other programs open while this process is running.
</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000">Your new MP3 files will be rights-free, so you'll be able to burn them to disc or use them on any media player or device.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000">4- If you opted for burning onto a CD-RW, you can now erase it by opening up your file explorer, right-clicking on the disc drive letter and selecting "erase."</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000">Refer to this article.</font></font></span></p>

<p>I think its more about trying to prove the Kinect is awesome.Which it very well might be.But the decision to include it puts the One of of the price range I want to spend.For me to spend 500 bucks it better come with a few games.</p>

    <title>Merging free space partition with main partition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cclar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Merging free space partition with main partition</h2>
                    I recently uninstalled ubuntu and as part of this, deleted the partition for it. Now I have:<br />
<br />
-9.77GB recovery partition<br />
-194.68GB main partiton (boot, system, flies. Basically everything)<br />
-28.44GB free space.<br />
<br />
How can I get rid of the free space, allocating this space to the main partition (so I would have a main partition of approx. 233GB)? Will windows do this automatically when the main partition gets full? And what happens if I simply delete the (blank) free
 space partition? This is what I see in disk management:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The DVD in the drive is the windows installation CD.<br />

            <p>No it wont do it automatically</p>
<p>In Disk Management expand C (assuming free space is adjacent to C) if it isnt you will need to use a third party tool eg</p>

            Thanks, that worked. For those who have a similar problem, I figured out that you need to first mak this free space into a partition. Do this by right clicking and selecting the top option, to create a partition out of this space. Choose 'primary' as the
 type of partition. After this is done, right click the partition you want to merge it to and select 'merge partition if you right click the blank partition, this won't work). Tick the partitions you want to merge and continue&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>That's it. Make sure you save the changes when prompted on exiting the program.&nbsp;</div>

            Hi
<div>Thanks for contacting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Why do you have to uninstall DW WLAN Card Utility? It is the driver for the WLAN card to work properly with Windows. If you you uninstall them, WLAN card may not work properly.</div>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            folder ... doesn&#39;t contain a compatible software driver... make sure it is designed ... for x64</h2>
                    Couldn't find it in the forums.&nbsp; Also tried a google search.<br />
<br />
I get this error when trying to install a monitor driver:<br />
The folder you specified doesn't contain a compatible software driver for your device. If the folder contains a driver, make sure it is designed to work with Windows for x64-based systems.<br />
<br />
System: Windows Vista 64bit - driver signing enabled/on<br />
Driver/Device: Viewsonic VP2030 series LCD monitor<br />
<br />
Why I need this driver: I think the graphics card is having trouble because it doesn't know my monitors refresh rate limits.<br />
<br />
Ok, I downloaded the driver from the Viewsonic website (see here):<br />
http://www.viewsonic.com/support/downloads/drivers/?prod_name=vp2030<br />
I tried the second and the last one.<br />
<br />
I also tried the driver from the Microsoft Catalog (see here):<br />
http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=display%20viewsonic%20vp2030<br />
<br />
So, none of them will install.&nbsp; The installation method I use is to go to "Add Hardware" and use "Have Disk" button.<br />
<br />
I also check this page that talks about the inf being decorated and the driver being 64bit.<br />
Well, as you can see, it does appear to be decorated properly:<br />
<br />
<strong>[Manufacturer]</strong> <br />
%ViewSonic%=ViewSonic,NTia64,<strong>NTamd64</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>[ViewSonic.NTamd64]</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
%VP2030%=VP2030.Install,Monitor\VSC131C<br />
<br />
<br />
So, what can i do now?

            I found a way to get it to install... although it is quite convoluted (considering all the other methods wouldn't work).<br />
<br />
<br />
1. In device manager, right click on current monitor and select Update<br />
2. Tell you have a disk<br />
3. Pick the inf file/folder for the monitor.<br />
4. Select it and install.<br />
