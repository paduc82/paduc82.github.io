    <title>Windows 10 Boot Up Brightness Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aviator52  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Boot Up Brightness Problem</h2>
                    <p>I have a late model HP laptop computer which came with Win 8.1 and upgraded to Win 10 within the last two months. The problem is during boot-up, you see the "hp" symbol for a few seconds then the screen goes dark. What appears to be going on is the screen
 brightness is being changed to it's minimum setting during startup and the real head scratcher is you have to press the "lower brightness" button (F2) to make the screen bright. The brightness setting window that opens when you press the buttons (F2 or F3)
 is inverted with the 100% brightness symbol at the bottom instead of at the top where it should be. When checking the display settings page, the slider is all the way to the left which shows 100% and to the right is 0%. Just opposite of what it should be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem just started. Any help would be appreciated as I have never seen this before and don't know how to resolve.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your concern. Let me help you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To assist you better I would like to know, what is the model number of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The issue you are facing could be due to the display driver is outdated. Let’s try simple troubleshooting steps and check if this helps in resolving the issue. Follow the below methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I recommend you to uninstall/reinstall the display driver and check. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and click on <strong>Device manager</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Locate for <strong>display adapter</strong> and click on it to expand.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Right click on the <strong>device </strong>and click on <strong>uninstall</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Once you are done uninstalling the driver, restart the computer. It will automatically install the generic display driver.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>If this doesn’t help to fix the issue. I suggest you to update the display adapter driver. Skip step3 from the above steps and right click on the
<strong>device</strong> and click on <strong>update.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above method did not help to fix the issue, I would suggest you to<strong>
</strong>go to the computer manufacturer website and download the latest display adapter driver. If the display driver is not available for Windows 10, try installing the available driver in compatibility mode and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Right-click on the setup file of the driver and select<strong> Properties</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Select <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Check Run this program in <strong>Compatibility mode</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Hope it helps. Keep posting us with the status we will be glad to help you.</span></p>

<p>Worked fine in W7... but in W10, the PC boots on the lowest brightness settings (even at the Windows logo) and I have to turn brightness down and up again (or pull-out and reconnect my battery cable) for Windows to reset the brightness to the correct value</p>

    <title>Receive &#34;Error loading DVD Maker project file&#34; when opening - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fastarii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Receive &#34;Error loading DVD Maker project file&#34; when opening previously working msdvd files and brand new ones.</h2>
                    
<p><span>Every msdvd project file I've I previously created, which have always opened successfully, AND new ones I create now, receive the following error message when opening: Error loading
 DVD Maker project file: “The menu audio file is not accessible. The setting has been cleared.”</span></p>
<p><span>I click the “OK” button and the msdvd project file opens but there are no video files in the file list. After adding a video file and clicking the “Next” button I receive the following
 error message: “Error loading DVD Maker project file: The background video file is not accessible. The setting has been cleared.”</span></p>
<p><span>I then also click the “OK’ button and the msdvd project file opens but ALL fields have been cleared except the “DVD Title” field. The “Play button”, “Scenes button”, “Notes button”,
 and “Notes” fields are cleared. The style type is the previous style used and not the style type which was saved in the msdvd project. The file names and paths have NOT changed for any of the resource files, the video, audio or the background files. Even when
 I create a BRAND NEW msdvd project and save it, I receive the same error messages when opening. The new project previews properly but after saving I can’t reopen the project file without receiving these error messages and cleared fields.</span></p>
<p><span>I have received error messages such as these in the past when the path to the error reported resource&nbsp;file has changed. I would then just reselect the appropriate resource file,
 resave, and the msdvd file would reopen properly.</span></p>
<p><span>This started out of nowhere.<span>&nbsp;</span>No programs or other changes to the computer have been made. However, when the last dvd I created finished, the mouse pointer
 (when hovering the DVD Maker window) appeared as the “busy” pointer instead of&nbsp;the “normal select” pointer I would expect.</span></p>

<p>Hi <strong>FastarII</strong>,</p>
<p>1. Any changes made prior to this issue?<br />
2. Is there any other 3rd party burning software installed on the computer?</p>
<p>If “Yes”, uninstall and then use Windows DVD maker and check if that makes any difference.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Change the Windows DVD Maker DVD-Video settings and check or create a sample DVD.</p>
<p>Refer to “<strong>Change Windows DVD Maker DVD-Video settings and check”</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Change-Windows-DVD-Maker-DVD-Video-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Change-Windows-DVD-Maker-DVD-Video-settings</a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Refer:</strong></p>
<p>“Troubleshoot problems with creating a DVD-Video using Windows DVD Maker”http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-problems-with-creating-a-DVD-Video-using-Windows-DVD-Maker</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>Run System File Checker (SFC) scan to fix any corrupt system files. To do this, follow the steps mentioned in the link below:</p>
<p><strong>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></p>
<p>If the issue persists,</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong></p>
<p>Disable and Re-enable Windows DVD Maker. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, click Control Panel, and then double-click Programs and Features.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Turn Windows Features on or off.</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand media feature <br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clear Windows DVD Maker from the checkbox and click ok <br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the same steps as above, this time place a check mark against Windows DVD Maker check box<br />
f.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Ok and then restart the computer</p>
<p><strong>Now, try to open windows DVD Maker and check to see if the issue is resolved<br />
</strong></p>

<h2>            Runtime error r6034 microsoft visual c&#43;&#43; runtime library explorer.exe</h2>
                    Hi!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I encountered a problem with my Windows 7 SP1 Professional x64 computer. Problem started two weeks ago after I installed the monthly Windows updates. After the updates every time I restart or login to my computer I get the error message saying "Runtime
 error r6034 microsoft visual c++ runtime library C:\windows\explorer.exe".&nbsp;&nbsp;After I hit "ok" in the error screen I can use Windows normally. &nbsp;I also get the same message when I try to use Explorer in different programs, for example notepad. Only difference
 is that now the path in the error refers to notepad. And again, I can still pick a file to be opened after I press ok in the error screen.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Problem occurs also in Safe mode and clean boot didn't help either. I also tried system restore to a previous configuration with similar results. I re-installed Visual C++ Library 2010, but it didn't help. I tried to install every single Visual library
 version (both x86 and x64 ) from 2005 to 2012 without success. Event log shows no errors so no help from there.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can you give me any advice, what to try next?</div>

            Here's a simple solution which worked for me:&nbsp; I right-clicked on the offending program, selected "Properties," clicked on the "Compatibility" tab, in the "Privilege Level" section, I checked the box for "Run this program as an administrator", then clicked
 the "Apply" button.&nbsp; Presto.&nbsp; Problem solved.&nbsp; I have no idea <em>why </em>this worked, and I don't want to hurt my brain trying to figure that out.<br />

<h2>            Problem applying multiple tags to one photo</h2>
                    I work &nbsp;a lot with group photos of children and when viewing thumbnails in a folder using File Explorer, I use the tagging feature in the Details Pane to tag the photos. I like the feature of being able to apply multiple tags at once, for instance when
 I start by typing the letter "M", all the names beginning with that letter (Max, Marty, Mark, Mary,etc.) show up with a check box next to them. I can then check all the boxes next to the names I want and then clicking on the name of my last choice inserts
 all that I have selected into the field next to "Tags:", then I click save to apply them all. This worked fine until I updated Windows 8 to 8.1 and then selecting multiple tags stopped working. When I try to check the box next to a name it instantly places
 it into the Tags field and I have to "type then select, type then select" on each name before saving. The check boxes next to each name no longer have any value or function. I have reinstalled Windows on my laptop...the function w

            <p>Thank you very much for your reply. &nbsp;I need to give some background info about what happened prior to my post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In an effort to resolve my problem I had an online chat with a tech on Microsoft Help Desk Support. &nbsp;I gave him remote access to my computer to allow him to run different tools, etc. with the result being that I needed to purchase Premium Support to allow
 him to use some advanced tools. &nbsp;After he did some more work the problem was still not resolved. &nbsp;He scheduled me with a callback from level 2 support. &nbsp;I received the call at the scheduled time. To make a long story short that tech could not help. He suggested
 that I post here with my problem and kindly agreed to refund my Premium Support Payment. &nbsp;I then made the post. &nbsp;I noticed soon after the first tech had used his tools, deleting files, etc. that my computer was having more problems. Programs and functions
 opened very slowly, I could no longer connect to the internet, etc. so not really knowing what all the first tech had done to my computer, I decided the best thing I should do was to start over and do a complete reset...so that's were I am now. &nbsp;I will post
 back if and when the problem reappears as make my way through all the Windows Updates to get current...especially when I update to 8.1. &nbsp;I will not install any programs or my Norton Internet Security until after I have done all updates and checked to see if
 the problem reappears. If you have any suggestions, let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks for your help and I'll let you know how things go... &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Amit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have finished my reset now after a long day. I had to start again with Windows 8, first I uninstalled McAfee that came pre-installed and then had to apply 140+ updates...I found I couldn't apply too many at once or they would fail. I finally found that
 if I applied no more than 8-10 in chronological order they would update successfully. The last update before going to 8.1 was KB2920189 and it refused to update failing every time. The solution I found online that worked was to disable Secure Boot in the BIOS
 and restart, install the update, then re-enable Secure Boot. Up until then I was able to select multiple tags and apply them. Then I as soon as I installed 8.1 my problem reappeared. I ran Method 1 that you suggested which showed no problems and my problem
 remained. Then Method 2:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: I booted in Safe mode and then there was NO option to select multiple tags.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2: I did a clean boot and had the option to select multiple tags but I still had the same problem. It wouldn't allow me to multi-select. Instead it would inserting each tag one at a time, each time I tried to select the selection box next to the tag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I have only reinstalled Windows on my computer. It has the programs that it came with minus McAfee. I have installed all updates. I still have the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am curious if you or anyone you know using Windows 8.1 is able to select multiple tags before applying them on their computers...or is this a Windows 8.1 bug/problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help and I'm looking forward to your suggestions/help.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>have you tried adjusting the display settings on the console? If you're not able to connect the console to a different monitor or tv and are therefor unable to adjust them, you can always reset the display settings of the console to factory defaults via these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Reset the console display settings</em></p>
<p><em>If the display problem is still not resolved, reset the display settings of your console. Here's how:</em></p>
<p><em>1.Remove any discs from the disc tray.</em></p>
<p><em>2.Turn off the console.</em></p>
<p><em>3.Turn on the console.</em></p>
<p><em>Note If you are using an Xbox 360 Wireless Controller, turn on the console by using the Guide button on the controller. Make sure that you use the player 1 controller when you do this. The player 1 controller will have the upper-left light illuminated.</em></p>
<p><em>4.As the console starts, on the controller, press and hold Y while pulling the right trigger. The display settings are reset to the default settings, and then the console automatically restarts.</em></p>
        </p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This behavior can occur if Task Manager is running in Tiny Footprint mode.
</span><span>When you double-click the empty space in the border around the tabs, Task Manager switches to this mode. You can still go back to its normal display mode by performing the steps in this article:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/193050/task-manager-menu-bar-and-tabs-are-not-visible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p><span>In case that didn't help, we suggest performing again the SFC scan and DISM to see if it does the same. You can visit this

<h2>            spooler subsystem error</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to install a Lexmark S405 printer on windows Vista (32b).&nbsp; Whenever I try to install the driver the spooler subsystem app stops working.&nbsp; And I get an error code 0x000006be.&nbsp; I have tried both fix it 50126, and the automated printer troubleshooting
 for Vista, Fix it 100003.&nbsp; I also tried to alter the directory manually as per http://support.microsoft.com/kb/324757.&nbsp; I even tired to change the Window Features by turning on LDP and LPR and turning off Internet Printing Client.&nbsp; Nothing works.&nbsp; The above
 fixes just clean up the system and when I go to add new printer I get the same error over and over again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have run out of options.&nbsp; Please help</p>

<p>Hi Iwil,</p>
<p>I&nbsp;would suggest you to completely clean the partial installation of the lexmark driver/software by the same way as your did earlier using the fixit from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Thereafter, instead of adding a printer&nbsp;I will suggest you to start installing the software from the disc that came with the printer.
<br />
&nbsp; <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Note</span></strong>: Make sure you disconnect the printer while installing the software and only connect the printer when asked by the software installer.</p>
<p>If this is also not working out, you may&nbsp;try the suggestion given by <strong>Shekhar S - Microsoft Support</strong>&nbsp;in the given article:<br />
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7hardware/thread/f47b10d6-fba4-412e-bf49-5daaba31c601" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7hardware/thread/f47b10d6-fba4-412e-bf49-5daaba31c601</a></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check chan vu's message here - the very top one.<br />
<br />
fixed spooler subsystem app stopped working<br />
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/itprovistaprinting/thread/460f297a-dd66-4476-a176-542e1519ca3e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/itprovistaprinting/thread/460f297a-dd66-4476-a176-542e1519ca3e</span></a><br />

===================================<br />
<br />
If the above did not help :<br />
<br />
Use this method to clear the spooler then uninstall and reinstall your printer (check with the maker for<br />
the latest driver).<br />
<br />
Check the Mr Fixits here and if you have to use the other methods go back and try them again afterwards.<br />

            <p>Hi Kent,<br />
<br />
Have you tried to uninstall and reinstall your Broadcom Wireless Adapter with the latest driver? We suggest doing so, for us to properly isolate the issue. If you have an external wireless adapter as well, try using it and see if it encounters an error. By
 the way, have you also tried rebooting the PC? Please turn it off then turn it back on and see how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

<h2>            How to backup OS and drivers on windows 10 laptop&#40;Lenovo&#41; &#63;</h2>
                    <div>I recently installed windows 10 (upgraded from win 7). If there is a system failure, I would like to format my computer and reinstall windows. But I would also like to install the drivers(which were already installed earlier) while installing windows.
 I cannot search for all the drivers on the net. Is there any way to backup just my OS and drivers, so that I don't have to search for updates again and reinstall the drivers? My pc has hardware like NVidia 630m, intel hd graphics 4000, realtek hd audio, Lenovo
 pointing device (synaptics touchpad v8)</div>

<div><br />
One of my cousins suggested me to "create a recovery drive". But I am not sure If drivers are saved too. also how much space is required on pen drive for creating recovery drive? I will purchase one accordingly.</div>

</p><p>Hi Utkarsh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general&nbsp;a recovery drive can help you troubleshoot and fix problems with your PC, even if it won’t start. It will also takes back up of all files, settings and drivers. To create one, all you need is a USB drive. Moreover the&nbsp;size will depends on the
 size of the Back up you're trying to take. </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>From the taskbar, search for <span>Create a recovery drive</span> and then select it. You might be asked to enter an admin password or confirm your choice.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When the tool opens, make sure <span>Back up system files to the recovery drive</span> is selected and then select
<span>Next.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Connect a USB drive to your PC, select it, and then select <span>Next &gt; Create.</span> A lot of files need to be copied to the recovery drive, so this might take a while.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When it’s done, you might see a <span>Delete the recovery partition from your PC</span> link on the final screen. If you want to free up drive space on your PC, select the link and then select
<span>Delete.</span> If not, select <span>Finish.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>In simple recovery drive will be mirror image of your system.</p>

</p><p>Using a 16GB USB drive it says it cannot create the recovery drive.</p>
<p>

            <p>I suspect the 16GB is far too small. Try a 32 GB flash drive and see if that works...</p>
<p>And FYI a Recovery Drive does NOT restore data. A Recovery drive just backs up the hidden Recovery Partition. Using a Recovery drive sets the computer back to factory specs even if Windows won't boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A System Image does however include data.</p>

<p>win10 claims it can't find the drive.</p>

                    <p>For some time now I have been unable to see the Windows "Documents" folder on C:\users.&nbsp; All I see is the C:\users\OneDrive\Documents folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does OneDirve somehow interact with the Windows Documents folder and somehow combine them?&nbsp; I can't imagine that to be the case since Memory on OneDrive is proprietary, available for a fee, which is why I tend to avoid putting everything on OneDrive, even
 though I have more than enough memory on my OneDrive account.</p>

            Hi Micheal.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />OneDrive introduced some features recently that were set as default for some users without their knowledge, so be aware and adjust as necessary
<br /> 
<br />If the new Folder Protection is chosen in OneDrive Settings &gt; AutoSave Tab, then Documents, Desktop and/or Pictures folders will be moved into the OneDrive folder. See Folder Protection details here to change this or read more:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn-off-folder-protection-onedrive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn...</a>
<br />
<br />Another setting designed for smaller hard drives removes files from the hard drive and stores them only in the cloud if Files On Demand is chosen in OneDrive Settings.  This feature is described here:
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h3> lizzard123  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I add and manage Group Contacts in Windows 10 Outlook&#47;Mail</h2>
                    <p>I have group contacts set up in Outlook on my work laptop &amp; my mobile however when I try to send an email using the mail icon in Windows 10, the groups do not show up.</p>
<p>I have tried to set up a group through Outlook Windows 10 icon but the only option I get is People. There is no option for groups. I tried to set up a group as a person and add each email address 1 by 1 to the email field (tedious!) but it does not seem
 to save them all. eg. *** Email address is removed for privacy ***; *** Email address is removed for privacy *** etc.</p>
<p>I've tried to research how to do this but there are SO many different versions of Outlook and instructions on how to do this it gets confusing to know which one corresponds to what I need not to mention none of the instructions I found work.</p>
<p>Can you please assist and/or update the Outlook Windows 10 app to easily add &amp; manage group contacts.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            Hi Cappe,
<br />
<br />If your app/game was purchased within the last couple weeks, you should be able to request a refund. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10558/microsoft-account-refunds-for-purchases-and-subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10558/...</a>
<br />
<br />Sign into your MS account - account.microsoft.com - Payment and Billing - Order History - Find the app you want a refund for and there should be a “request a refund” option.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!
<br />- C

<p>For anyone reading this later, I was able to refund it but microsoft doe not make it very easy.</p>
<p>First I called the microsoft store support, after explaining my problem, they said they couldn't do anything unless I got proof from the developer. Which meant a whole lot of work for a small chance for a refund.</p>
<p>I asked to speak to someone else and eventually ended up with the xbox support and there they were almost immediatly able to refund the game. Also they said "refunding can only be done once", but that won't be a problem AoE DE will be the first and last
 game I ever buy from the Microsoft store.</p>

            Thanks, Cappe, for reporting back your experience. It is important because there are consumer advocates here recognized by MS as MVP's who do have some influence and everything we know about how customers are treated allows us to help you better.
<br />
<br />
As suspected, there are exceptions to the policy we frequently see here of no store refunds. But even these allowances are framed such that the consumer doesn't leave feeling MS puts the customer first, that they are grudging about it. I notice that airlines
 have recently begun training to always make these interactions actually please the consumer - especially when they're making an exception for them - and build goodwill rather than just make them never want to talk with anyone from their company again.
<br />
<br />
I promise you this will not be forgotten, and that it will be brought up in our never-ending effort to put customers first here.&nbsp; That's an important reason why MVP's are here.

 Maintain the rage. </p>
<p>Having said that. Steam had to be pulled into line by countries with strong consumer laws a few years ago (after refusing refunds</p>
<p>for years), and from what I read here some months ago MS was also trying to avoid giving refunds.</p>
<p>Looks like they've resorted to stonewalling to try and wear people down. Is MS channelling insurance companies ?</p>
<p>Steam may do the same. I've never sought a refund on a digital version of a game, yet. I have returned three retail disc games</p>
<p>to ever helpful EB games (Oz) over the years though.</p>

<h2>            My Apps are too big Windows 10</h2>
                    This morning when I went to go type up a paper in word I noticed that the everything on the screen was too big. The backstage view only showed the one type of format for documents at a time, my recent files tab took up half the screen, the ribbon took
 up a third. I checked the screen resolution and the magnifier, but they are both normal. This just happened randomly, as I had used word two days ago and nothing was wrong. The Apps seem to be the only thing affected as my internet browser is normal. Does
 anyone know how to fix this?

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
There are a few reasons why a blue screen occurs after an upgrade like incompatible device drivers, overheating of components and hardware running beyond its specification limits. For us to elaborate the issue further, kindly answer the questions listed below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you receiving any stop code error on the blue screen that you're experiencing?</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Were there any changes made on your PC before this happened like software or update installed and hardware changes?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For initial troubleshooting, we recommend that you visit this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14238/windows-10-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>. From there, you'll see a walk-through guide on how to resolve blue screen issues in Windows 10.<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your reply.</p>

<p>thanks in advance for the reply<br />
i just see driver_irql_not_less_or_equal stop code without any number or anything attached to it and then it just restarted, sometimes it boot right up and into the windows sometimes windows attempt to do startup repair</p>
<p>as far as i remember there is no change apart from the windows update (creator if i recall correctly) but the problems started to occur even before i do the windows update. i already did a windows reset and reinstall all the drivers from manufacturer website
 but the problem still there.</p>
<p>could it be a faulty ram? or motherboard?</p>
<p>weirdly enough the bsod only occurs randomly when i was browsing or was just started playing 5 minutes of dota 2, but sometimes it works just fine. to add into the confusion i never had any bsod when playing more demanding offline games on high settings.</p>

    <title>Applocale issue Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vladislav trofimov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Applocale issue Win 10</h2>
                    <p>Good afternoon to community.<br />
</p>
I'm again came, searching for solution.<br />
Due to the work, I'm very often need to run non-unicode applications from other countries onto my work and home PC's. So I've installed Microsoft Applocale at both PC's. But Home PC, which have Win 10, isn't work neither with Applocale nor NTLEA (which I'd
 tried to use when fails with Applocale).<br />
Both applications not functioning properly even in compatibility mode.<br />
Is there any way to emulate different locale in Win 10? Cause I'm very pleased by renovations in win 10 and don't want to downgrade it up to win 7. But if isn't exist, I'll have no other way.<br />

            <p>Hi Vladislav,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Applocale is compatible with Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP only. Installing in compatibility mode is a workaround and an application compatible with only Windows XP is not very likely to run on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the "System Requirements" section in the following link:</p>
