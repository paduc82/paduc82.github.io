<h2>            Hard drive working fine, to going unreadable and corruptible. still new</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
First time posting, I received an error message saying my hard drive is corruptable and unreadable. It was working fine then my computer froze, rebooted and gave the above message.&nbsp;<br />
Just wondering how I can possibly fix this?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Have tried right clicking the drive, tools, go to error checking, comes up with 'the disk check could not be performed because window cannot access the disk.'\<br />
<br />
Went to command prompt and ran a disk repair (chkdsk :g /r) and this occurred.<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>Tried doing it once again then this occurred.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Has anyone managed to fix this? This hard drive is still under warranty so it shouldn't really be happening, dont want to lose all my data on it... Thanks</p>

            <p>I found the answer by checking the forum for the same issue in Windows 8.1.&nbsp; The following is what I found by users posted on the forum and appears to work with Windows 10 Pro:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the registry and go to HKEY_USERS\DEFAULT\Control Panel\Keyboard</p>
<p>Look for Initialkeyboardindicators in the right panel</p>
<p>The value I observed was 21474836<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">48</span></p>
<p>Change the last two digits from 48 to 50 as underlined above</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to everyone that posted an answer for the same issue in the previous editions of Windows.</p>

            <p>Sadly none of the suggested registry edits work in this case. Microsoft are still working on this problem and have acknowledged its an unresolved Win 10 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you consider that they are also actively promoting PIN entry at Login, it us an issue that is/will affect more and more Win 10 users in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p>This suggested edit of the registry worked for me.&nbsp; Part of my initial log in password includes numbers so it was annoying to have to input my password, realize the NumLock key was not activated and have to press the NumLock key and input my password again.&nbsp;I
 was apparently slow to realize that this was something Windows 10 was doing - upgraded from Windows 7 so didn't know this had been a known problem with the last versions of Windows.&nbsp; A simple search for "Windows 10 and NumLock key" showed me that many of us
 are/were having the same problem and it was being caused by the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This "fix"&nbsp;must be a bit of a pain for those who aren't comfortable working with the Registry and it seems hard to believe that Microsoft has been dealing with users complaining about this annoyance since Windows 8 but still didn't&nbsp;bother to change&nbsp;the behavior&nbsp;in
 Windows 10 when they had plenty of time to do so before rolling out their "brand new....but still based on DOS, lol..." operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Slightly off topic:&nbsp; Guess I shouldn't be surprised by Microsoft and their&nbsp;habit of introducing new products that really aren't quite ready for prime time.&nbsp; Their own gaming site, the MSN Game zone, lets you know that you should be using Internet Explorer
 instead of their new browser, Edge; apparently they haven't bothered to optimize their own site to make it compatible with Edge!&nbsp; The site doesn't recognize that Flash is integrated in Edge, either, says you need to download the latest version of Flash....&nbsp;
 Silliness!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>8/14/2015 update - well, I thought the registry edit worked.&nbsp; I had restarted my system after doing the edit yesterday and the numlock key remained activated, but when I booted up my system this morning, same old problem, the NumLock key was not activated.&nbsp;
 I did some more research, found the below "fix:"</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to your lock screen - restart your system or click on the Windows key + "L" key to get to the lock screen.</p>
<p>2.While on the lock screen, press and hold the NumLock key.</p>
<p>3. Go to the power options icon on the bottom right side of the screen and&nbsp; click&nbsp;the&nbsp;"restart"&nbsp;option while still&nbsp;holding down&nbsp;the NumLock key.</p>
<p>4.Theoretically, the NumLock key will remain activated for ever and ever now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure why this would work, and it didn't work for me, but apparently some people have had luck with it so it might be worth a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's arbitrary decision to override our personal preference to have the NumLock key&nbsp;always activated is beginning to **** me off!&nbsp; There is a reason why we have it set to "always on" in the BIOS.&nbsp; Sure, it is easy enough - once you get into the habit
 of doing so - to activate the number key after your system has booted into Windows so that you can put in your correct password - with numbers - &nbsp;but why should we have to?&nbsp; Setting this in the BIOS has been all we have needed for YEARS, until Windows 8.&nbsp;
 You would think they had received enough complaints about that, and yet they programmed in this same behavior in Windows 10 AND somehow have disabled the end users' ability to apply any of the fixes found&nbsp; previously.&nbsp; WHY????!!!!?????&nbsp;&nbsp; (I know shouting doesn't
 help, but it made me feel better!)</p>

            <p>Yes. I'm fully at ease editing the Registry. But the suggested fix did not work for me. Win 10 sets a lot of defaults in their revised Login screen with the new Pin Code option. The majority of the laptops and desktops we've "upgraded" to Win 10 suffer the
 NumLck bug.</p>

            <p>Hi Robert - I had to edit my previous reply.&nbsp; The registry edit didn't work for me, either, as I discovered today when I started up my system.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There doesn't seem to be any sort of way to fix this problem; Microsoft apparently did something sneaky to take away the end users ability to customize their own computers - must be that old "Microsoft knows best" attitude.&nbsp; I have no idea why they think
 having the numlock key inactive at boot up is a good thing and necessary, or why, on the other hand, they think having it always activated is a bad thing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does&nbsp;anyone know why they made this decision in Windows 8 and insisted on keeping to it in Windows 10, despite the numerous "give us a&nbsp;NumLock fix" threads and posts by unhappy users?&nbsp; Perhaps we would all feel better about it if we knew there was some sort
 of logical reason for the programmers and developers&nbsp;to have done this.</p>

            <p>Finally found a solution that DOES work to keep the NumLock key activated under Windows 10 - disabling the "Fast start up" option.&nbsp; I had seen this posted before but for some reason never tried to implement it until today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what worked for me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Go to the Control Panel (right click on Start button and choose "Control Panel" or press the&nbsp;"Win-x" keys to get to the same menu and choose Control Panel.)</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Click on the "System and Security" setting and then click on the "Change what the power buttons do" option under the Power Options heading.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Click on the "Change settings that are currently unavailable" link near the top of this window.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Under "Shutdown settings" uncheck the box in front of "Turn on fast startup (recommended)"&nbsp; (logical to have a start up option listed under shut down options, right?!?)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shut down my system and rebooted it to make sure this worked; it did.&nbsp; I am hoping that it continues to work - never know when a new update may disable this again, since for some reason MS doesn't want us to have the key activated at Windows start up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At some point, or so I have read, Microsoft plans to phase out the Control Panel in favor of their new "Settings" application, but I would say the Control Panel seems to have more functionality than Settings, at least, this couldn't have been done with the
 current reiteration of Settings.&nbsp; Makes me wonder what&nbsp;other personal preference options for our systems&nbsp;we might lose when MS gets rid of the Control Panel.&nbsp; :-(</p>

            <p>Sadly, Holly, didn't work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have had Fast Startup unchecked for weeks, and tried all combinations of Registry Edit as well. &nbsp;No lasting success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But maybe it might work for others (it's certainly been mentioned in many web pages). But you're right, WHY do Microsoft want the NumLk disabled at start up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Illogical. &nbsp;I mean WHO ever uses the keypad for anything other than numeric anyway!</p>

            <p>:-(&nbsp; So sorry this trick didn't work for you either, Robert.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though this NumLock key activation problem seems to be intrinsic to the OS itself, the fix - and whether or not it works - must somehow have to do with our different system configurations and the way the OS&nbsp;interacts with the BIOS.&nbsp; I&nbsp;can't think of&nbsp;any
 other reason these suggested fixes don't work universally.&nbsp; If it&nbsp;was&nbsp;just a question of something in&nbsp;OS itself causing the problem, theoretically,&nbsp;the same fix&nbsp;should fit all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, it wouldn't be Windows if there weren't&nbsp;annoyances that the end user has to deal with; thus far someone has been able to find a work around for many of the problems found with various operating systems, so hopefully someone will come up&nbsp;with something
 that works for Robert and the others who have no luck with the fixes currently 'discovered.'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We may need to accept the fact that the "next best OS"&nbsp;will always come with its own built-in frustrations; no matter how "improved"&nbsp;the OS&nbsp;may be, some things get skipped/missed/screwed up or changed in ways that long time users don't like.&nbsp; (What ever
 happened to the philosophy "if it ain't broke, don't fix it?"&nbsp; They didn't need to mess with the NumLock key behavior, Windows users had been happy with the way it worked for years, and then Windows 8 came along...)</p>

    <title>A few questions about upgrading to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff51_a  say:</h3>
<h2>            A few questions about upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have been waiting for my Windows 10 upgrade to come automatically, but I've gotten impatient and want to upgrade with the Media Creation Tool. I have a few things I am uneasy about, however:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-If I upgrade with the Media Creation Tool, will I have to use a product key to activate or will it go automatically?</p>
<p>
</p><p>-After installation, how much space will Windows 10 take up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>-How long does the installation generally take?</p>
<p>
</p><p>-If a product key is required, do I use the one I used to activate my current Windows 7 install (I did a clean install with a new disk I bought) or the one on the OEM sticker on the bottom?</p>

    <title>Dell&#47;Logitech bluetooth mouse setpoint failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a1_2 canadian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell&#47;Logitech bluetooth mouse setpoint failure</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell XPS M1530 laptop running Vista from 2008.&nbsp; Last May I managed to set the two left side buttons on its little wireless mouse so I could just press them to copy and paste, which I seem to do a lot of.&nbsp; Somewhere along the line they quit that
 capability and reverted back to "forward" and "back" functions, probably during one of the many times I've had to reboot the mouse because it kept losing its connection to the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason when that happens, I can't find one or more of the tabs on the Mouse Properties window that should be there to allow checks and adjustments;&nbsp; the bluetooth tab or the buttons tab may be missing, or the wireless mouse may not be listed.&nbsp; That
 hasn't happened for awhile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But for some months, perhaps since May, whenever the computer is restarted a window pops up that says, "Logitech SetPoint Event Manager (UNICODE) has stopped working".&nbsp; Windows fails to find a solution, as usual, and I exit the window.&nbsp; The mouse works fine,
 except now I cannot find a window for reconfiguring those two side buttons like I did before.&nbsp; They're stuck apparently in page forward/page back mode, and the only configuring allowed for buttons is for the two main top ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noted today while trying to resolve things, that when I click on the SetPoint Settings tab of the Mouse Properties window, it reacts by popping up that same window that says it's stopped working.&nbsp; I thought maybe that was the route to reconfigure
 the side buttons, but the pop-up won't allow access to the SetPoint Settings window hiding behind it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling the mouse driver and reinstalling it and updating online, but to no avail.&nbsp; The original disk's software is still the current driver apparently.&nbsp; Upon computer reboot, that pop-up eventually reappears.&nbsp; It seems that some of the software
 is LogiTech, some Microsoft, and I get the impression the Dell mouse itself was actually built by LogiTech, I dunno.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just get annoyed by the occasional failure of some of this laptop's components and the difficulty and time out of my days trying to track each down for some sort of resolution.&nbsp; I tried using Microsoft FixIt, but there are several categories there that
 it no longer even&nbsp;attempts to fix on this computer.&nbsp; Many glitches I've just come to live with as unresolvable.&nbsp; But I wonder if there is some approach I can take to get back my button adjustments and purge whatever is upsetting the LogiTech SetPoint Event
 Manager so I don't get that pop-up at every boot.</p>

            <p>Sorry if my inquiry was too involved and wordy; &nbsp;perhaps it put potential help off. &nbsp;There's been no replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wondered why </p>
<p>1) I get a pop-up at every boot that says LogiTech SetPoint Event Manager has stopped working; and
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) why I can no longer find a way to change the settings on the two auxiliary side buttons on the wireless laptop mouse. &nbsp;I assume that is related to the supposedly no-longer functional event manager?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your query to Microsoft forum. I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be due to some interference of some other hard drives. Also you may need to change some setting in BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: I would like you to&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>remove all external devices apart from mouse and keyboard and try to initiate the&nbsp;Windows installation.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2:&nbsp;Disable Advanced Host Controller Interface (AHCI) from BIOS, you can contact your computer manufacturer to do the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems
 resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to help you further.
</p>

<p>Thanks &amp; Regards,</p>

<h2>            Cannot get past the sign-in page through Microsoft account. I can&#39;t use my PIN as password. Try again.....password......incorrect</h2>
                    <p>I do appreciate ANY help I can get with this problem, but PLEASE understand......</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded Windows 10.</p>
<p>I turned my computer on - HP Pavilion Lap top.</p>
<p>I clicked on my screen (which has only a picture of a cute little kitten) and the page changes to my sign-in page. &nbsp;This is NOT unusual - it does this every time I turn on my computer.</p>
<p>Up comes "Welcome" and my e-mail address, and a space to enter my password.</p>
<p>I enter my password and that's where everything goes for a ______!</p>
<p>First....I can't use my PIN as password. Try again.....password......incorrect! &nbsp;Try again, after checking that it was entered correctly....incorrect!! &nbsp;Forgot your password? &nbsp;NO problem! &nbsp;Just go to this site and reset your password!</p>
<p>I reset my password.....and think...ok! &nbsp;WRONG!!! &nbsp;The prompt says I cannot sign in my with NEW password....I must FIRST sign in with the last password used prior to download. &nbsp;I sign in with my PIN.....Prompt says I cannot use a PIN - I must sign in with
 my old password!</p>
<p>SOOOO.....contact Microsoft Community - they suggest I change my e-mail address and password. &nbsp;I do this.....but it will take up to 48 hours to change on all of my devices. &nbsp;So, I wait.....5 days....still no change to the e-mail that comes up on my sign-in
 page.</p>
<p>So, today...I check 'Devices' <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ON</span> the microsoft site! and it seems I have NO devices! &nbsp;Go to 'register a device' - my lap-top....all goes well......until I'm asked if I just registered a device. &nbsp;'Check here
 for your device'.....and there are still NO devices registered!!!</p>
<p>Would somebody please help me sort out this problem! &nbsp;I desperately need my computer!</p>
<p>I have been without access at all for probably close to 10 days now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am writing this on my husband's computer.....as I have done everything in an attempt to gain access to MY computer!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Stuck in Windows Update Purgatory</h2>
                    <p>My Alienware Alpha has been trying to run the Windows Update for almost two weeks.&nbsp; Windows reboots, installs an update to "100%", reboots, says it's finished but just freezes at the PC logo screen spinning its wait pointer, for hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the only way for me to stop it is to reboot (usually 3 times or more) to get back to the OS.&nbsp; Then it's back to another "update" in a few days and starts this all over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have taken these steps just now...</p>

<p>I think I have it...</p>
<p>I used msconfig.exe to get into Safe Mode and turned off several non-Microsoft services and startup items (I suspected maybe MalwareBytes service was interfering, but maybe not).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also rand the Storage Sense manually, and the update troubleshooter which deleted the update install cabinet files (may have been corrupted).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took a while for that to run.&nbsp; I restarted in Normal Mode - I made it there!&nbsp; and after a while Windows sought to install an update (gulp).&nbsp; I rolled the dice and let it run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Success!&nbsp; Normal boot, and it's running a little faster!&nbsp; So far so good!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestions!</p>

<p>Well I was good for a couple weeks!</p>
<p>It even seemed to finish the previous update.</p>
<p>Now it's on to another, and the same thing happened again.</p>
<p>After 12 hours I had to reboot it 3 times, at which it told me it could not finish the update and rolled back.</p>
<p>I went into msconfig and turned off the startup items, but that didn't help when it tried again.</p>
<p>So here we are now.&nbsp; I need to see what non-Microsoft things are loaded and try getting them turned off too,

<h2>            Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor scans forever</h2>
                    I'm presently running Vista Home Premium and downloaded the windows 7 upgrade advisor.&nbsp; It downloaded and installed OK.&nbsp; The first time I ran it, it scaned and gave me a report.&nbsp; A couple of weeks later I tried to run the scan again but now it scans forever
 and never gives me a report.&nbsp; Any suggestions.&nbsp; I tried uninstalling and reinstalling with no luck.&nbsp; It continues to scan with no report.

What version of 7 do you plan to upgrade to or do you need to know which versions are valid upgrade paths?<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Upgrade Paths<br />
Microsoft has published a downloadable MS word document with a list of upgrade paths for Windows 7.<br />

            The upgrade advisor may not work if there is a conflict with the third party program or service. I would suggest that you try to run the Windows vista upgrade advisor after disabling the third party program or services by following clean boot procedure<br />
&nbsp;Perform clean boot and check if you have the issue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User Account Control permission<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If the issue is resolved check which third party is causing the problem, referring the link given below:<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135<br />
Reset the computer to start as usual<br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />

            Thanks Andre<br />
<br />
I tried your suggestion but no luck.&nbsp; Still scans forever.<br />
<br />
The reason I wanted to run the Upgrade Advisor a second time is it did not address all the programs on my comuter as far as&nbsp;are they&nbsp;compatible or are there issues with Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; It just plain out did not mention some of them.&nbsp; I thought I would run it again
 just to see what would happen.&nbsp; That's when I ran into the problem where it just scans forever.

            How do you know which files are important and should not be deleted.&nbsp; I have several different type of files in this folder, TMP, Text Document, SQM, Application Extension, and Bitmap Image.&nbsp; Should I only delete the TMP files.<br />

I have noticed something that may help.&nbsp;&nbsp; When the windows 7 upgrade advisor scans forever I usually just click the X in the upper right corner to close the application but if&nbsp;I click on the cancel button at the bottom, I get another window that says<br />
<br />
The webpage cannot be displayed:<br />
<br />
Most likely cause<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some content or files on this webpage require a program that you don't have installed.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know why I get this.&nbsp; I have not deleted any programs.&nbsp; If this helps let me know.<br />

<p>When attempting to run scheduled tasks in Task Scheduler in Windows 7, the tasks will not execute.&nbsp; They will run from a command prompt, so we know the scripts and programs are working properly.&nbsp; Scheduler will display "Running" yet nothing happens.&nbsp; After
 they time out, Scheduler will restart them (per one of the options), and they again time out.</p>
<p>These same tasks worked fine in XP.&nbsp; 7 does have multiple 'libraries' in the left pane.&nbsp; The tasks are in the WPD directory.&nbsp; Does this matter?&nbsp; Any other ideas what would keep them from working?&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any information.</p>

            Thank you for replying. That's the thing I am not seeing any sort of screens at all. My Xbox is on but is wont connect to my TV. If it helps I did reset my console due to an E105 start up error. I shut off my Xbox when I left home and when I came back
 it didn't wanna load and an a start up error showed up I looked up the error on the support website and after a few hard resets it basically said you had to completely reset it.&nbsp;

<h2>            &#39;OS not found&#39; after installing a second operation system along with Windows 8</h2>
                    Hi! I bought a laptop with preinstalled windows 8. I tried to install another operating system to run along with windows 8. After installing the other OS I disabled secure boot and changed UEFI mode to Legacy. After that I can't get into windows 8, neither
 into Ubuntu. I can see a black screen with message "Operating System not found". What can I do? Have I erased windows?

<p><font color="#000000">Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums. We are here to assist you with all your Windows related issues and queries.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000">As per the<span>&nbsp;
</span>issue description, you have installed Ubuntu on your Windows 8 preinstalled laptop to work with Windows 8 as dual boot and then later you disabled the Secure Boot and also changed the UEFI Mode to Legacy from the computer BIOS. Now, when you start your
 Laptop you get the error: "Operating System not found" on a black screen and you are able to boot into neither Windows 8 nor Ubuntu.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">I don’t think that the Windows 8 is erased from the hard disk. This had happened only because of the changes that you have done in the computer BIOS. You have mentioned
 that you had disabled the secure boot and also reset the UEFI Mode back to Legacy. Due to these changes, the Windows 8 cannot be loaded or detected and thus you have this error.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">So, I would suggest you to revert the changes that you have made in the BIOS and then check the issue. You can contact your Computer Manufacturer for this as it
 is not recommended to make any changes in the computer BIOS by yourself, unless you are a computer expert.</font></p>

            Thank you very much for your answer. I have already solved the problem. I reverted all the changes and everything is back. I was confused and couldn't find the BIOS but fortunately there was this 'magic' button ASSIST that did the work. So I managed to
 get into BIOS and now everything is OK! Probably I must be more careful!&nbsp;

<h2>            Limited desktop access</h2>
                    <p>Hello all and I hope you can help with my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to copy programs and files over to a newly formatted disc running windows 10 from my present HDD that is also running windows 10.</p>
<p>I swapped over HDDs and placed my daily used HDD into a USB caddy, and the newly formatted win 10 HDD into my desktop PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I copied all of the files and programs over to the new drive and then placed my usual drive back into my desktop PC.</p>
<p>However when it booted up it just had a black desktop and a recycle bin icon. Clicking on that item I could access a file explorer type screen, and could access the internet by going to program files and opening the browser.</p>
<p>Somehow placing my drive into the USB caddy has caused this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some research and I copied and pasted 'Desktop' into it's rightful location in system32 and got my desktop back again.</p>
<p>My problem now is that 'Start' does not show any apps, file explorer can only be accessed by pressing windows key+E, and some of the settings now do not work such as personalizing desktop background.
</p>
<p>Also the PC keeps crashing and leaves the Blue screen stating that my computer will be restarted after repairs, this just sticks on 0% and I have to just switch off the PC and restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried many of the suggested fixes without success these being chckdsk/R &amp; F , the Microsoft troubleshooting tool, a powershell command (powershell promt does not recognise 'powershell'!!), and another command that starts with something like DCIM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried a system restore from the safe mode screen without success and the two working restore points prior to this issue have now disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>James.</p>

            <p>Hello Amit and thanks for your quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the media creation tool which is a .exe file and not an ISO so I'm assuming that my PC will not boot from that .exe file?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is the same thing as the tool, when this issue occurred I booted from my Win 8 installation disc which brought up some rescue options for Win10, such as Restore, Refresh and advanced options.
</p>
<p>When I try the startup repair option I just get a message stating that it cannot perform a repair, this when I went to advanced options, opened cmd, and tried (unsuccessfully) to run sfc/scannow/r and f and some other suggested fixes from cmd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was also with these advanced options from the boot disc that I attempted a system restore which failed and then deleted my only two working restore points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>

            <p>I'm still trying to resolve this issue but have got no further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all of the DISM cmd prompts without success. I still cannot change my desktop background except for solid colours, pinned taskbar apps disappear &nbsp;on reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To more or less stabilise the situation I just leave my PC switched on permanently so that I do not have to go through routine of pinning file explorer, my browser etc. to the taskbar.</p>
<p>Updates are only performed for office 2013. The last Windows update was at the time when this problem occurred, so I suppose as defender is not being updated my PC is at risk? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created another user account that works perfectly, so there must be a working disk image somewhere, I just can't get it onto my own account!</p>

<h2>            My Computer keeps bluescreening after I play games for a varied amount of time, what can I do&#63;</h2>
                    Hello there Windows Forum,<br />
<br />
Recently my computer that I built 9 months ago has been blue screening most of the time I play games on it. This varies from game to game, some games, such as Hit-man: Blood Money, don't Blue Screen the entire session, others, such as Sonic Generations, may
 Blue Screen or may not, but most importantly, Borderlands 2 Blue Screens 5-15 minutes after I start playing. Some are steam games, others are not. What is especially interesting is the fact that I had been playing Borderlands 2 for two weeks without having
 installed anything else on my computer when it started these Blue Screens. At first it was infrequent and only happened once in a blue moon, but after a while, it happened all the time. At first, I thought it was because I didn't download a firmware update
 for my Solid State Drive, so deleted almost everything on my computer except drivers and the such through an option in the SSD firmware update toolbox, then I applied it, re-downloaded steam and played Borderlands 2 again, only to get the Blue Screen again.
 After this, I uninstalled my nvidia Drivers and downloaded an earlier version, still to no avail. At this point in time, I believe the problem to be an error on the part of a hardware component, but I don't know which one it is. I have a picture of the blue
 screen on my phone and have a mini dump file in my possession, so if someone needs those in order to figure out the problem, just tell me.<br />

<span>only one</span> <span>memory module</span> in your computer <span>and</span>

<span>be</span> <span>defective.</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have only <strong>one module</strong> in the computer can you try some <strong>

                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I usually use my PC for gaming, and have today had 3-4 different full crashes. These crashes cause a flickering grey screen and audio looping.&nbsp; Immediately after the first crash I have been observing CPU and GPU temperatures to make sure it isn't an overheating
 issue.<br />

<p>I have three hardware error reports from today:<br />

            Hi Scot
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />If its custom-built, what is the make and model of the motherboard?
<br />
<br />Its possible you might need to update your BIOS and chipset drivers to improve stability.

            Hi Scott
<br />
<br />Your GPU is not failing . . .
<br />
<br />You are on the right track by suspecting your GPU device drivers . . .
<br />
<br />If updating your video card device driver does not resolve this, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running, it will however, be compatible . . .

<p>Hi,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
thanks managed to sort the boot problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I can't seem to run the chipset update? It keeps saying fptw64 is not recognised.<br />
<br />
I'm just using the guide on this site, and the download for the appropriate motherboard.<br />

            If its not installing, don't force it. 
<br />
<br />Can you monitor the system for the rest of the day, play your games and let us know if it still crashes?
<br />
<br />If it does, it likely means there is a defect with your video card.

            <p>Build 10586 and still no fix? I mean how hard can it be? Every single user in my shop has two monitors. There must be many many more users with two monitors. Believe me they notice things like this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess since most people didn't know how to use Windows 8.1 you guys decided to not care about those who did. I just find it amazing how many things Windows 10 cannot do, and how much harder it seems to be to do simple tasks when compared to windows 8.1.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            My xbox 360 Slim internal memory shows unformatted. Should I reformat it&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>I woke up this morning to play gta v, and when I turned on the console, the system did not have any profiles. I use a 16 gb flash drive for game saves, but my internal memory had my profile data. So I can see my game saves though the system settings, but
 I can not access them without a profile. Should I reformat? That is the only option that the system gives me. Place help!&nbsp;</p>

If your internal memory is acting this way it's time to get a replacement HDD.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is really strange... Last thing I played on my Xbox 360 slim was GTA:V too. A few days later, I turn on my Xbox, and my saves are all gone. I go to the storage in settings, the first drive is my 16G usb, and the second just shows unformatted. There
 is no hard drive, I never got one, it was just the xbox 360 slim with 4gb of internal storage. Why is it showing up as unformatted, if it worked perfectly not more than 2 days ago? As for reformatting, that does nothing. Another thing, I lost my AC:IV saves
 too, so I restarted on that one. The game is really choppy, and slows down to an almost pause when it goes to cutscenes. It has never done this before. I've only had the xbox for a year, never played it longer than 2 hours, never dropped, hit, spilled on,
 idk never did anything to it besides play it.</p>

<p>Don't think anything will ever come of this.. Guess I'm just out 200 bucks.</p>
<p>More info though. When I turned on my Xbox slim and first found out the internal storage was shot, it was asking me to install an update. I started playing AC:IV and GTA:V on my white xbox 360 (old as hell, sounds like a vacuum cleaner, but I use it for
 DLC), there was no update to install. A few days later I'm trying out the Xbox slim again, and there is no update, but the storage is still messed up.

            I get an Error with no description.&nbsp; My guess is that since Lenovo put the license key in the BIOS for the original Win 8.1, the OS can't access it.&nbsp; Also, the free-upgrade Win 10 never asked for a product key and according to MS documents, it shouldn't
 be asking me for one

<p>Shenan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the tool reference.&nbsp; It displayed a product key--my assumption is from the original install of Win 8,1 Pro, but when I entered that as the product key, I got a message stating, "We couldn't activate Windows on this device right now. You can try
 activating Windows again later or go to the Store to buy genuine Windows..."</p>

<h2>            Unable to email from Snipping tool</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a Windows 10 machine b.16299 the snipping tool is not using the default email application which is set to be Outlook.</p>
<p>First when starting, it gave the New profile wizard although there was already an Outlook profile created.</p>
<p>I've went through the first steps of the setup and then it started opening a new email message with the snip but unable to send it saying no local profile existed to send from.</p>
<p>I've ran Office 2016 repair and now I get:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The snip could not be sent. Check that an email program is installed and then try again.</span></p>
<p>Checked all the settings in the registry - looked as they should be.</p>
<pre>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Clients\Mail</pre>
<p>Seems that it cannot read what the default mail program is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does someone know which registry setting Snipping tool reads/refers to?</p>
<p />

            When you make a snip , you can send it by email by going to File -&gt; Send to - Email Recipient. I am having the described issues with that option in the Snipping tool.

<p>Hi Vickie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Corrupted system files is one of the possible reasons why some icons on the task bar is missing. To help you in resolving this, I would suggest that you run the<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">System
 File Checker tool and DISM</a></strong> to scan for some file corruptions and fix it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If running those didn't work as it should, then I would recommend <strong>performing a clean boot</strong>. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10. To do so, click
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here.</a></strong></p>

            This is all well and good, however, for someone that is NOT tech savvy, the links you provided is like trying to read a foreign language. I did not understand any of that. I have Windows 10, I don't have a start thing, I typed in the search bar in the
 bottom left corner by the windows symbol CMD but nothing came up. Guess I'll just deal with no icon. Thanks.

<p>Let's make it simple for you, Vickie. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To add the battery icon to the taskbar, select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Settings</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Personalization</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Taskbar</strong>,
 and then scroll down to&nbsp;the notification area. Choose <strong>Select which icons appear on the taskbar</strong>, and&nbsp;switch the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Power</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>toggle to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>On</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check battery by selecting the battery icon in the taskbar at the bottom right of your screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Notes:</strong></em><span>&nbsp;</span><em>You may need to select</em><span>&nbsp;</span><em><strong>show hidden icons</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;on the taskbar before selecting the battery icon.&nbsp;Power is not an option on systems without a battery.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do get back to us with the result.</p>
