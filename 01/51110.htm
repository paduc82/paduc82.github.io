<h2>            Windows update error&#58; 0x8024401c.  I&#39;ve tried everything</h2>
                    <p>I am on windows 10 and when I try to run windows update it says :</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>"There were some problems installing updates, but we'll try again later. If you keep seeing this and want to search the web or contact support for information, this may help: (0x8024401c)"</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to resolve this for days and can't seem to figure it out.&nbsp; I've read through the forums and tried numerous things to fix this: the 'net sh' comman, 'sfc /scannow', everything on this website : http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-update-error-0x8024401c,
 turned off the fire wall.&nbsp; Nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did more investigating and tried to figure out if this was truly a network problem or a windows problem.&nbsp; I unplugged my ethernet cable and plugged in a WIFI modem to my PC.&nbsp; I connected via wifi to the same router which I connect to through ethernet,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>windows update works perfectly fine when the pc connects to network via wifi</strong></span>.&nbsp; This lead me to believe it's something with the ethernet, or how windows works with ethernet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated my Ethernet drivers, I've reset my pc and deleted all applications.&nbsp; I have no antivirus installed&nbsp; I don't know what else to do, but I'm almost convinced that it's a bug with my particular network card, or some configuration issue specific to
 windows 10 and ethernet</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have intel I-218v internet.&nbsp; Any help would be very appreciative</p>

            <p>Thank you for the response.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried re-installing the ethernet driver already, I updated the driver to the windows 10 official Intel I-218v ethernet driver (from Intel website).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 'update driver' from device manager did not find the newest driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a total loss for what Ethernet is being treated differently than WIFI.&nbsp; Any other ideas?</p>

<p>Hello, sorry there is no one that can give you a free name change. You will need to spend $10 / 800 Microsoft Points to change your name if you'd like to.
<br />
<br />
You will need to file complaints against the people sending you these messages and block communications with them, the XBOX Live Enforcement Team will deal with them in a timely manner.<br />
<br />
Please follow the directions located <strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/account-banning-and-player-feedback/chat-terms-of-use-conduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> to learn how to file a complaint and block communications with other players. We do
 not allow people to name and shame others on the forums, and if people are bothering you, this is the way to go about getting them to stop. Once you've blocked communications with them they won't be able to send you further messages. You can also mute them
 in game as well and appearing offline if someone is following you around from game to game.</p>

<h2>            Win 10&#58; How to go to system restore when the key boad is not responding</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was running a driver call Zadig to replace the Win USB driver in order for my RTL SDR Dongle to work on SDR#.&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-quick-start-guide/</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the process I have wrongly selected the device as Keyborad (Interface 0).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result, the key boad cannot be detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know for sure that this problem will be fix if I run a System Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier on, my mouse became unresponsive, I mange to go to Advance Start up by the TAB Key on the key board.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At present, I can only go to Win 10 Login Screen. I cannot key in my password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time the how should I do it ? Can I use the On Screen KeyBoard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you show me the way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Games should come with a Digital Download in the Physical - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Games should come with a Digital Download in the Physical Copy&#38;&#35;39&#59;s</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>This may be a little extreme but with the recent purchase of the BLU-RAY/DVD combo of Frozen I received a digital download so now we can watch the movie online if we don't have the actually DVD on us. So why can't we do the same with games?!? Lets say I
 was to buy Titanfall and it came with a digital download so that I didn't need to insert the disc to play the game. I insert the code with Xbox Live and after the initial game install with the disc I no longer need to put it in the system. Now of course you
 need to limit this so that you don't have 1 person buying the game and sharing with 5 other people so here is my idea. If the game is put into another system the digital download stops working and you need to insert the disc again to play. This gives people
 the best of both worlds, you can go digital with the security of having a disk to trade in if you don't like the game. Then if you trade the game in the next person that buys the game can buy the digital download for say $5 more and it would work the same
 way with them.</p>

<p>I'd rather they just had digital and phsyical versions on shelf, buy a code or buy a physical disk, if i could trade the disk in then it wouldn't be tied to my code so i can effectively get every game half price just by going halfs with my mate, me nor him
 are to concerned about it being digital or physical so surely ms would lose a lot of money offering both in the same box ? All i can see is that i get mine installed and running digital my mate keeps his phsyical, we both pay 20 quid each and if he wants digital
 convenience he pays an extra fiver but ms is already out of pocket by 40 quid on every game we'd undoubtedly do this with.</p>

<p>That's almost exactly how the Xbox One was SUPPOSED to work before internet crybabies forced Microsoft to change it. You could even share the digital game with friends so that you both could play it. It would have been great.</p>
<p>However, that's now in the past and it wont be back for awhile till people finally move on from the past, so I think a nice option would be to offer a discount on a digital copy. Say I buy an Xbox One game at retail, and decide I want to go digital, there
 would be a code included that would make the digital version cheaper. Like around $30 or so. That way nobody cheats the system. Developers still get their money, and so on.
</p>
<p>That's what I did with Rock Band 3 on the Xbox 360, Harmonix launched the digital version at $15(a temporary sale) and encouraged fans to go digital. I jumped on that and gave my retail copy to a friend!</p>

<p>This way you wouldn't be able to share with friends, as soon as the game gets put into another console then you would lose your digital version. So in reality its only 1 person that owns the disc is able to play the game. Even if this way was limited to
 Xbox Live users with internet connectivity, I think it would be worth it. The price would stay the same $60 you would just get both versions. Once you trade it in if the 2nd person using it wanted to own both versions they would have to pay $5 to get the digital
 version. After its traded in you no longer have access to the digital version of the game.</p>

<h2>            Window&#39;s 10 Login Help</h2>
                    <p>After Installing Window's 10 for my friend, I was prompted to create an Outlook account. I did not think that it would be important, so I just made up information for the account such as the password, date of birth, phone number and the rest of the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize after restarting the computer that they would not let you sign into the computer without signing into the Outlook account that I created. I could not remember that 8 character password and when I signed up for a password reset, I did not remember
 the information set up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Window's support and got a case number&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">1298836243 And the only solution they offered me was to go through the verification
 again for the reset which is impossible since I do not know any of the information I used to set up the Outlook account.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">I worry that the information on the desktop will now be lost if we do a hard reset of the computer and am wondering is there a way
 to reset the password if I do not know the information to verify it. I will attach the information that Microsoft Sent me but I fear there is little I can do.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">I wish Microsoft had let us know about this Log In through Outlook, in a clearer way...</span></p>

<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">"I was prompted to create a Outlook account as part of installing Windows 10. I quickly inputed information and did not remember the
 information I put in. I did not expect to have to put in the password I created for the Outlook account in order to log in to the computer. I can not log into the computer because I do not know the password to my microsoft account. The birthdate, phone number
 and other information was made up very quickly to fulfill the need of creating an account for Windows 10. I called customer support and they can not reset the password for me and I have to do it myself. I tried to using another email but I could not give enough
 information because I did not know the phone number or birth day I put in to create the account. I remember that May was the month I put for the birthday. The reference number from customer service is: 1298832799. Please help me get back to your account".</span></p>

<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Hi Martin,</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Thank you for seeking assistance here at the Microsoft Private Support! We are really sorry that we’re not able to respond to you in
 a timely manner and for the inconvenience this may have caused you. My name is Apple and I am glad to be of service today.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Based on your post, you cannot access your account that you were using with your Windows 10 PC. In line with that, I have also checked
 and reviewed all the recovery attempts but it is not sufficient to determine account ownership and/or identity. As a result, I suggest that you need to undergo account validation recovery process again. Account validation is the best recommended option that
 can help you regain access to your account once you've passed the validation since you do not have access to your security proofs. This process will allow you to choose a working alternate email where we can send the reset link once you've passed the validation.
 We need it to establish the account ownership first before we send the password reset link as we take our valued customer's security at utmost care.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">In addition, here are some suggestions that can assist you in submitting a new request:</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">- Answer questions using the information you used when you created the account or last updated it.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">- Submit the recovery request from a computer you frequently use for Microsoft services.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">- Answer as many questions as you can and be as precise as possible.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">- For questions with multiple answers, such as email subjects and contacts, provide as many answers as you can.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">I am really encouraging you to retake the account validation process via the online form (https://account.live.com/acsr) for a chance
 of passing it, since if you pass, you will automatically be given a password reset link sent to your contact address. Don't forget to copy and paste the link in your browser's address bar.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Once you have successfully regained access to your account, that's the time we strongly suggest that you update your security information
 by going to the link provided below.</span><br />

            Age gates in Korea and Japan are set at either 20 or 21. If its the website not being translated that's not something I can help you with unless you have like a google translate chrome extension installed. The age gate is an easy fix you just need to put
 in that you are over 20. If you can't get into it at all you're gonna want to contact customer support on Microsoft's website and maybe request to actually call someone. If you type in refund or something their website should route you to the right spot.&nbsp;

            In Korea you have to be 20 to be considered an adult.&nbsp; It is unique to that country.&nbsp; If there is any way to get around it you will probably have to get someone on the phone or chat.

<p>The easiest way to get some space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean up the Windows WinSxS folder. This&nbsp;is all your update history and what allows you to uninstall updates. You can not just delete files from this folder. If you do the update service will never work again.</p>
<p>You can cleanup this file and probably gain 2 GB. The catch is you can not uninstall an update after your do.&nbsp; You decide.</p>
<p><strong>AnalyzeComponentStore&nbsp; </strong>Takes less that 15 minutes and gives you the information</p>
<p>
</p><p>StartComponentCleanup may take 45 minutes</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can gain almost 3GB by creating a USB recovery drive from the recovery partition on C:.&nbsp; All you need is a 4GB USB drive and

<p>You do not have to do the ' find out how much space'&nbsp; part. An RT needs less than 4GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With those two you can gain 5 G. If you do both, create the recovery drive first so the cleanup of WinSxS whill have some drive space to work with.</p>

                    I keep getting emails from Family Safety asking if I wish to grant access to a website to my children (lon.gamib.net/x/hollywoodbeautysecrets/x.html?z=0iv) - it even happens when they are not even at the computer.&nbsp; I'm unclear why this is happening.&nbsp; The
 email notifications are coming frequently - however, simply reducing the frequency of notifications will not address the key questions - why and how do I stop it - help please

<h3> mikegeorge1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype calls not connecting but messaging still possible</h2>
                    <p>I tried several times today to connect with a student in Hong Kong to have a video call. We could not connect by video or just by calling but we could message each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The App gave the impression it was making the call, the image in the centre of the screen was moving in and out and it said it was trying to connect, but there was no sound - not the usual notes that usually accompany attempted calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone got any ideas? When I tried to go into settings the App has frozen twice now and I just have to shut it down. I haven't used my Skype since December but prior to that was using it regularly with no problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not changed internet provider or location. I am using a PC with an Ethernet cable attached direct from the router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Mike</p>

            Try these basic troubleshooting steps first and check after each step and please update me. (Please note your data is stored on the cloud, hence you won't be losing data)
<br />
<br />1. Reset the Skype
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Apps &gt; Locate Skype &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Reset
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall and reinstall Skype app (Note - You will not lose any Skype data because of this)
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below, paste into Powershell &gt; Enter 
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.SkypeApp | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />Reinstall
<br />Copy and paste below and Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.SkypeApp | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}
<br />
<br />3. To isolate the issue, can you make call using either Web Skype or Classic Skype (Download)
<br />
<br />Web Skype - <a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Download and install Classic Skype - <a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />

<h2>            Games for Windows live Fable 3 как изменить регион&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>При подсоеденении в сетевой игре Fable 3 друга ко мне gfwl пишит что у нас разный контент, хотя он полностью идентичен. Как выяснилось после звонка в поддержку это из за того что у нас разные регоны и вправду, видимо при регистрации я толи ошибся толи просто
 не заметил региона, и вместо России в учетке Games for Windows у меня стоит United States. Вот скриншот http://s017.radikal.ru/i439/1111/96/816561f9754f.jpg. https://live.xbox.com/en-US/Account/BillingAccountInformation?returnUrl=https%3a%2f%2flive.xbox.com%2fru-RU%2fRedeemToken%3fxr%3dsocialmenav&amp;abortUrl=https%3a%2f%2flive.xbox.com%2fen-US%2fAccount&amp;skin=
 Вопрос: как можно поменять регион чтобы я смог поиграть в мой Fable 3 с другом у которого регион Россия? Ну или как можно по другому решить проблему?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You can do a System Image and put it on the SSD. However if the current disk is C: then the SSD will need to be the C: drive. Or you can do a Clean Install on the SSD and it will be activated by the Digital Entitlement. And you can format the original drive
 afterwards to remove the OS there since you only have one license.<br />
<br />

    <title>Win 7 versus Win 8 handwriting Input Panel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> duckwagon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7 versus Win 8 handwriting Input Panel</h2>
                    <div>Hey. &nbsp;I've been trying to get my Wacom tablet to work with the touch handwriting panel for a while now, and it's just not working. The input lines have disappeared, and it will draw in the box but it won't keep or recognize any gestures, or show the mouse
 when over the buttons. &nbsp;The issue isn't the wacom driver, and it's the same across any program I try to use, so I'm guessing it's a windows issue. &nbsp;<b>Any thoughts on where the issue might lie?</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Not that it really matters, as the windows 8 replacement for the win 7 Tablet PC Input Panel is virtually useless for pen input.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<b>Can I download the windows 7 Tablet PC Input Panel anywhere?</b> &nbsp;It <i>should</i>&nbsp;be&nbsp;compatible, considering the desktop side of things is almost identical to win 7. &nbsp;I just can't find it anywhere. &nbsp;I realize they replaced the built-in features from win
 7; I have explored that fully. &nbsp;It's not practical for me to re-install windows, or use that junk panel if I could get it working. &nbsp;I know how to troubleshoot, I'm just about done doing it though after about a month of searching. &nbsp;Google is my friend, but...
 not a very knowledgeable one at the moment.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sorry for the grumpy attitude, I'm a little frustrated right now. &nbsp;Any help is appreciated.</div>

</blockquote>
<p><br />
It's Ok for bulk pen input, e.g. the handwriting recognizer works.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where it fails is in its (incomplete and clumsy) integration with the other keyboards and the ClipBoard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, why does the IE Address bar change the Insert button to a Go?&nbsp;&nbsp; That is usually
 unwanted I suspect.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. I find corrections much easier to make with a keyboard than with the TIP gestures but if I can't just Insert something into the Address bar but have to also force an Enter I can't fix it up that way.</p>

<p>I do like many of the features but not nearly enough to give up my refined Win 7 Handwriting recognition.&nbsp;&nbsp; They should have announced the end of highly trained handwriting recognition for windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am certain it is because they were too busy working on other things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solid 2 sized tiles of the start menu are also very unpleasant.&nbsp;&nbsp;A step down&nbsp;for desktop use.&nbsp; OK for Phone/tablet.&nbsp;&nbsp; I find them harsh, ugly and basically a form of Advertising where apps attract you with
</p>
<p>updating distracting, unwanted movement.&nbsp;&nbsp; I far prefer an environment where my applications exist behind small graphically interesting icons. on a motionless screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the Microsoft developers meeting<em>&nbsp; read </em>&nbsp;the tiles were introduced as always solid, non-gradient and monochromatic.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Give me back disciplined functionality and not shiny moving objects waving in front of me to attract sales.</p>

            So an update... I realized the keyboard sticking issues are merely a setting issue on the Easy Access options. &nbsp;Oops. &nbsp;Fixed it now; it's clearly a driver issue.
<div><br />
<div>Also, thank you for the replies... I suppose I should have named the thread a little more clearly. &nbsp;I'm looking for possible answers, or similar issues, with the two&nbsp;<b>bolded&nbsp;</b>questions in my original post. &nbsp;I'm all for discussion about win8, but here
 I'd prefer to find answers rather than opinions.</div>

            Agreed on many points. &nbsp;I don't personally like it for my uses. &nbsp;I would have liked the training, the smaller panel, etc. &nbsp;If I could get the panel working in the first place; hence my second question.<br />
<br />
At the same time, I can understand, and even agree with the premise of building Win8; for that purpose, I think the interface, and even the input panel, match up extremely well. &nbsp;Considering the unifying of mobile and desktop platforms, Windows has made the
 first big effort, and a very well-done one at that.
<div><br />
<div>The downside is, because focus has been so much on making a dual-platform more accessible in a tablet-based environment, some oversights have been made as far as desktops are concerned. &nbsp;So, yes, I agree that the issue is that they were working on other
 things.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As far as the style goes... well, as far as I'm concerned I think that's an issue of marketing and opinion. &nbsp;I like it, personally. &nbsp;It allows for a sleeker, simpler, less confusing interface; but also allows for about the same amount of customization.
 &nbsp;Apple has always been good at being the leader in 'trendy' and casual-use looks, (if sacrificing anything a 'power-user' such as I might like) and I think Windows is finally seeing how simplicity has its good points. &nbsp;A good compromise if you ask me.</div>

Are you trying to write cursively using your mouse, e.g. by dragging the dot pointer around in the input area?&nbsp;&nbsp; FWIW that works but as I mentioned I think using the pen for bulk input is better.&nbsp;&nbsp; ICIM in Mouse Pointers I am using&nbsp; Scheme Magnified (system

            Hello. I'm aligned with you on this. <br />
<br />
I'm a long-time Wacom tablet user, and I've owned Windows Tablet PC's going all the way back to Windows XP Tablet Edition. It appears to me that MS may have decided on more or more the following...<br />
<ul>
<li>Almost no-one uses a stylus anyway (that is probably correct - for a couple of decades, my workplaces have been littered with Wacom tablets abandoned by 'designers' with no pre-digital art training)</li><li>Anyone who is serious about using a stylus probably has a Wacom already<br />
</li><li>The phone will eventually replace the PC, so it's OK to take up half the screen with a clunky keyboard/writing pad that is at home on a phone but not on a real computer<br />
</li><li>An increasing number of customers can barely write and certainly cannot type with all of their fingers - they can only type with their thumbs. Handwriting recognition - who cares?<br />
</li></ul>
<p>The Windows 7 soft keyboard/notepad is a rare thing to get from Microsoft - elegant, adaptable to many different types of users and to many different screen sizes. Why
<i>did</i> MS decide to throw all that away and replace it with an ugly behemoth that looks like it was designed and built by MIT interns? Just a couple of wild guesses...</p>
<ul>
<li>Did the lobotomized version of Windows 8, i.e. Windows 8 RT, falter when dealing with something as advanced as the Windows 7 soft keyboard/notepad?</li><li>Did Microsoft license this component from a vendor, then get greedy and decide to cut the vendor out of its percentage in the next release?<br />
</li><li>Did Microsoft hope to accelerate user adoption by enabling manufacturers to offer hobbled Windows 8 devices at a slightly lower price point?</li></ul>
<p>If the latter, they certainly failed with me. I've tried Windows 8 several times and then abandoned it entirely because of its yesterday soft notepad.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Microsoft, why oh why did you throw away one of the very few truly great features you've ever developed?
<br />

<p><br />
In fact, I find the recognition part better in W8 than in W7.&nbsp;&nbsp; What's worse IMO is the rest of it but I never got the hang of using the TIP to "edit" my typos anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attempts to use it&nbsp;always seems to make things worse.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then rather waste time trying to
 fix it then, I just note the "typo" and go back later with a Touch Keyboard to fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FWIW I think Handwriting recognition is just great for bulk input but too fiddly to be used for anything else.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. it seems to be least accurate when recognizing single letters without any context for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well said.&nbsp; For stylus users, there is no point to adopt Windows 8.&nbsp; Microsoft has been a leader in stylus based interface and near perfected it under Windows 7.&nbsp; What&nbsp;a bad decision to get ride of it.&nbsp; Well, let's hope that the next iPad&nbsp;will have an innovative
 stylus support that is&nbsp;at least as good as&nbsp;what Windows 7 has.</p>

            <p>To <strong>Windows R&amp;D teams</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several people have mentioned that the Windows 7 Input Panel had the capability to adjust the panel size, where the 8 version is in a fixed size, not adjustable. This is very annoying when we are trying to write in the panel, but the huge panel size is covering
 too much of the screen, obscuring the page on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please listen to us that the Windows 7 Input Panel was superior to the Windows 8 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Especially noting the ability on <strong>Windows 7</strong> to be able to <strong>
adjust the sizing of the panel</strong>, and have only one line of text, <strong>
so it does not cover as much of the screen </strong>when writing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please consider an update to fix the sizing problem (the inability to adjust the size of the panel) on the Windows 8 Input Panel!</p>
<p>
</p><p>( and fix this for the next Windows 9 version!)</p>
<p>

<h3> tomerlahav  say:</h3>
<h2>            Superfetch does not exist on my computer</h2>
                    <p>Background: Recently while playing different PC games I ran into massive fps drops occasionally and sometimes even the game just froze for a few seconds.</p>
<p>This started happening right after a followed a fps increase guide in which one of the steps where to disable Superfetch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I returned to the video to revert the steps since I noticed that these fps drops and freezes started occurring after I followed instructions in said video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: I searched windows for "Services" and then started looking for Superfetch and noticed that I do not even have Superfetch, it just doesn't exist in my services at all.&nbsp; Is it hidden? Does it not exist? How can I make it visible/regain the superfetch
 service?</p>

            Hi Tomer.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You can start with Steps 7 and 11 to check System file integrity first, but I would complete the entire list which almost always finds and solves the problem in toto.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p><font><font>Sir,</font></font></p>
<p><font><font>In Windows fonts, Mangal had font for De<span>vanagari Script. This font isn`t look like very sharp &amp; good. Its edges are not good for reading smartly. Arial Unicode MS font &nbsp;is very good font for Devanagari (and other Indian languages). Please
 edit Arial Unicode MS to Mangal.ttf with keeping English and Devanagri characters.</span></font></font></p>
<p><span><font>&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><font><font><span>Mangal font MS &nbsp;</span>V<span>OLT programming also not good for Devanagari. (36 rigion writes Devanagari script -my 'Aagari' language not included in it- in India and its talking languages are different). Mangal font needs MS &nbsp;</span>VOLT
 programming like Arabic fonts. One font, One kbd dri<span>ver, and many contries writes same character but different srokes</span>. But Devanagari had one font many kbd drivers like kbdinhi.dll, kbdinmr.dll. and for Marathi Language, we need typewrighter keyboard
 to wright.</font></font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font>In usp10.dll or UniScribe, we need alternate character, for example; u+0945 (dev_ChandraE, two bites) + u+0902 (dev_Anuswara or Bindu,&nbsp;</font></font><span>two bites</span><span>) = u+0901(dev_candrabindu,&nbsp;</span><span>two bites</span><span>)
 or u+093E(dev_matraA,&nbsp;</span><span>two bites</span><span>) + U+0947(dev_matraE,&nbsp;</span><span>two bites</span><span>) = U+094B(dev_matraO,&nbsp;</span><span>two bites</span><span>).&nbsp;</span><span>In ms volt there is fiture named 'standard ligaturre'. If we type latin
 'f' and then 'i'. here we get result joined four bit'fi' ligature., this is standard ligature? Where is ligature standard(standardizatation)</span></p>
</font><font>
<p><font><font>Please I beg to you for my language to create its font without error.</font></font></p>
<p><font><font>If you need contact please call me +091 8108355651 in Marathi or Hindi language.</font></font></p>

<p>Brink didn't do as well as some people had hoped, but it wasn't a flop. With free DLC on the way and a patch to hopefully fix the network/performance problems, the game will spring back to life and probably end up with a solid community.</p>

<br />If this doesn’t work try this fix by Kapil Arya:
<br />
<br />Try these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Open the Command Prompt with administrative privileges. 
<br />
<br />2. Type the following command and hit Enter key: 
<br />
<br />reg.exe add “HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\atapi\Controller0” /f /v EnumDevice1 /t REG_DWORD /d 0x00000001 
<br />
<br />3. Exit the Command Prompt and reboot. Insert a disk to test and the optical or DVD drive should be visible now.

<p>Repeating obsolete information everywhere in reply to this extremely common complaint is not helpful for the current situation, and just wastes customers time. Please stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These steps and multiple remove/reinstall drivers do nothing for the issue at hand, which is that the inability to correctly recognize that a CD or DVD is in the drive and to read the media with the appropriate protocol. It originated with the 1809 update.
 That is where the problem lies. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please find and issue a fix for this update defect.</p>

    <title>Where are the Wireless Display settings&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Where are the Wireless Display settings&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo All-in One PC which is running Windows 10 Pro, and has Miracast/Wireless Display capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having issues displaying to another device wirelessly, and I'm suspicious the issue is the other device. However, that's only the background, not the problem I'm wishing to solve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got the wireless display setup to only project to that device (don't ask me why) and turn off the monitor of the projecting computer (my all-in-one) while projecting. Since the other machine is having issues displaying, any time I want to troubleshoot
 that problem, I'm hamstrung because when I go to connect, the main display goes dark, and I can't really work on the problem. I end up having to turn one or the other devices off in order to sever the connection and give me my main display back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I cannot find the setting that would allow me to toggle back to a mirroring or extending setting for wireless display unless I'm connected to something that has wireless display.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Question</strong></span>: Are there registry keys or some other setting in Windows 10 that would allow me to reset that setting without having to connect to a device for the settings to be available?</p>
<p />

            <p>Arun,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This actually isn't helpful at this point. All those steps have been tried. I've even dealt with drivers, etc. I'm really just trying to find those settings. There's nothing wrong with Miracast per se, it's just that I've made a change that I cannot undo
 via normal circumstances that are beyond the control of my PC and Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in order to troubleshoot that issue, I must revert a setting that disables my PC's display whenever I attempt to connect to the 3rd party device in a wireless manner. Let's focus just on that issue for now, thanks.</p>
