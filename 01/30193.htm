<p>This worked for me to get 8.1 updates working:</p>
<p>Ran Trouble Shooter until it says problems fixed (but Update still did not work as usual.)</p>
<p>Restarted and then went to Microsoft Update Catalog and searched for kb3172614</p>
<p>Selected kb3172614 and open. Downloading did not work for it to run from my disk.</p>
<p>After installation and its restart, I ran update with selections automatically install and for windows only.</p>
<p>The search for updates ran awhile and then displayed a hundred or so updates.</p>
<p>I selected install and the down load started, but there was no progress bar or display of the updates as they were displayed. I saw that the router was downloading so I just let things run.</p>
<p>The screen switched to installing updates after time, but still no progress bar or display of updates being installed.</p>
<p>Somewhere during the installation the update that fixes the progress bar and display was installed and the bar and display appeared from then on.</p>
<p>The update finished and after its restart, I set the options to all updates. (Be sure to do this to allow Defender updates to be caught.)</p>
<p>I ran Update with no problems then. I checked and ran Update about seven times to get current.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All updating has worked now for a couple of weeks since this fix.&nbsp; I had had the continuous searching problem for a long time too and tried everything posted here.

<h2>            U torrent slows my PC</h2>
                    I have read loads of post , it seams that no one has the problem tat I have - When I start to use u-torrent everything works fine but lets say 15 to 20 minutes later my PC is so slow it takes about 5 minutes for a action to happen.&nbsp; I just want to make
 it clear that it is not the Wi-Fi that slows down, it is the performance of the pc. It's like the PC does not like u torrent and then the pc decides to strike by going on a go slow. What I have worked out is that if one goes to task manager and close u torrent
 from there the PC is back to full performance as soon as it was ended. The problem is also that when one press ctrl alt delete it take ages before task manger pops up and to get the pointer on u torrent because it take so long to respond. It use to work just
 fine but since last year the problems started. First u torrent or bit torrent would tell me every time I add a torrent that "this torrent is already running" but noting was in the download list. I uninstalled and reinstalle

<h2>            How Accessable is Street Fighter X Tekken for new Players&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>You know, for shooters you can generally pick it up, aim and shoot some guys.&nbsp; Basic formula.&nbsp; You know, you can play it for a bit then jump online and do ok against guys that have been playing the game longer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Haven't played a fighter for a while.&nbsp; Or a Street Fighter more specifically.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does it do enough to teach new players or will it be pretty difficult to get into?&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's made to be very accessable. &nbsp;I'm an average or below fighting game player, using the PS3 SSFIV controller for it and I do ok. &nbsp;It has the best training mode that takes you through things step by step and the arcade mode is actually pretty easy, even
 the last boss. &nbsp;It's probably the easiest to get into fighter. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want a more easier fighting game to get into Id recommend Mortal Kombat.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Its not that SFxT is hard, but the fighting mechanics are a bit more complex, also you won't get very far if you use a regular Xbox controller for it since the buttons and d-pad are horrible for it.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I suggest investing in a fight pad.</p>

<p>No, it does not teach new players enough but I'd don't believe there has been a fighting game that has. The level of difficulty would depend on how much effort your willing to put in to learn new things, and how much you already know about fighting games.
<span>To me fighting games are similiar to Chess.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Street Fighter x Tekken in my&nbsp;opinion is easier then most Street Fighter's because of the combo system&nbsp;"e.g.", chain combo's, quick-combo's, easy input's, and easier super art's then previous installments.</p>

The issue might be with the filename.<br />
Check the following link that talks about deleting a file. Which might be applicable for copying as well:<br />

                    I've been trying to get my computer to work. I formatted my Hard Drive and setup Windows. After that, I get to the Windows Logo with "Getting Ready" below the spinning circle. The getting ready is written in a pixelated font. My computer was fully clean,
 so I cant access Windows 10 normally.

            Check to ensure there is disk activity (look at the hard disk LED light to confirm. If there is, keep waiting. If setup goes beyond 2 to 3 hours, try the following steps.
<br />Power down the computer. Unplug it, then wait 20 seconds.
<br />
<br />If you are using a laptop, remove the battery if the option is available.
<br />Disconnect it from the Internet (unplug Ethernet and/or turn off Wi-Fi).
<br />
<br />Plug it again, ensure it remains disconnected from the Internet then start computer.
<br />See if it completes setup.
<br />
<br />If setup completes and you see the desktop with the ability to click Start and launch programs, proceed to reconnect to the Internet.

    <title>Xbox 360 vs Xbox 720 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox 360 vs Xbox 720</h2>
                    Is it true that Xbox 720 games will not work on Xbox 360 and vice versa? Is it also true that when Xbox 720 comes out all companies will stop making games for Xbox 360? Same for kinect?

<p>According to rumors from "sources" the names ms is considering is xbox 8, xbox, xbox infinity, and xbox Next. Though ms killed xbox when 360 came out, I dont see the same thing happening with 360, they Mae too much money off of it to scrap it. They'll make
 it cheap (think ps2) don't know about backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>The next Xbox will come out in 2015. There is always a new Xbox or new design to a pre-existing xbox every 5 years. In 2000, the original Xbox released. In 2005, the 360 was released. Then, in 2012, The 360 S hit the market.</p>

<p>Original title: <span>File transfer </span></p>
<p>When moving files such as an avi or jpg file from one hard drive to the other, it takes too long if there are more than two files, the first file moves fast enough but the second, third, fourth etc.. it slows down considerably, it slows down to about 3.50&nbsp;MB
 a sec. per file<br />
how can I fix that?</p>

<div>Hi RasterRyder,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Are you referring to transferring files to from within the computer's hard drives or to and from external drive?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. What are the sizes of the files that you are transferring?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. Are you transferring the mentioned files through a network?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In the meantime, I'd suggest you follow the steps given below.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Turn off Windows 7's search indexing function, which runs in the background of your computer at random times and slows things down noticeably.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Click on the Start Menu, and in the search bar, type "Services."</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>b. Select the program that comes up called "Services."</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>c. A window will appear; scroll down to the "Windows Search" service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>d. Right-click on it, select "Properties," and next to "Startup Type," select "Disabled."</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>e. Press "Apply," then "OK."</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>f. Then, right-click on the "Windows Search" service again and select "Stop."</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> Start the service once you are done transferring the files.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'd also suggest you run <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Delete-files-using-Disk-Cleanup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
disk cleanup</a> and check if the transfer speed improves.</div>

<p>Hi Azeez:</p>
<p>I'm refering to files from within the pc hard drives and like I said before, the first avi file moves real fast but the second and third and so on they slow down to a snails pace.</p>
<p>and I have to brace myself when moving my jpg files from one drive to the other, those take forever.</p>
<p>Thank you for answering, I'll try stoping the services while transfering files and I'll let you know if that helped me.</p>

<p><span>Hi Klaxonken,
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What exactly happens when you try to print?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is the printer detected on your computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you receive any error message when you try to print?</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, I would suggest you to
</span><span><span>run the Printer troubleshooter built in Windows 7 and check if it helps you fix the issue. To start Printer troubleshooter Click on the
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span> button, and then clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span></span><span><span>. In the search box, type
</span></span><span><span><strong>troubleshooter</strong></span></span><span><span>, and then click
</span></span><span><span><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></span></span><span><span>. Under
</span></span><span><span><strong>Hardware and Sound</strong></span></span><span><span>, click
</span></span><span><span><strong>Use a printer</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Also access the link below and follow the steps to check for
</span><span>some common problems with printing.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Why-cant-I-print" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Why-cant-I-print</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also if you think that the printer drivers are not installed properly for Windows 7, you may access the link below to download
 the drivers from the manufacturer’s website and install it. Later check if the printer works fine. before you install the drivers uninstall the printer drivers currently installed on your computer and later reinstall the drivers.</span></p>

<h2>            Movie Maker, Trouble with Video clips, Rotating when saved</h2>
                    Every time I save my project (which consists of about 5 video clips) my videos become rotated sideways. I can't figure out what the problem is. The clips themselves are saved on the computer in the correct orientation, they are edited in Movie Maker in
 the correct orientation but when I click save project, they get turned sideways. I have tried saving the project under many different settings. I have tried to convert the original files (.mov) to .wmv files and then reuploading them in the project but then
 they do not play at all. I'm lost as what I can do.... please help!!

                    Skype keeps 'Not Responding'. We use Skype for our business.&nbsp; Several of us have had the same issues.&nbsp; Skype chats come in, but you suddenly can't click on any part of Skype to make it work.&nbsp; You have to force a shutdown through the Task Manager.&nbsp; We have
 checked that we have the latest update.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Backup critical data NOW to removable media.<br />
<br />
Once backed up, open and elevated command prompt. To do this, click start and type CMD, then right click the menu entry that appears and choose 'run as administrator'. Click continue at the UAC prompt. From the prompt, run:<br />
<br />
chkdsk /r c:<br />
<br />
You will get a message that the drive cannot be locked, followed by a prompt to run this routine when the system is restarted. Type Y and hit &lt;enter&gt;. Finish and exit the command prompt and reboot the system. This extensive routine should then run and correct
 file system issues.<br />
<br />
There is a chance that it may not be able to correct them, in which case you will need to start from scratch with a fresh install after removing and rebuilding the installation volume (which is why you backup data before beginning this process as sometimes
 it is not recoverable from a failed chkdsk).

<h2>            Couldn&#39;t create a new partition  or locate an existing one &#40;SSD &#43; HDD ASUS Zenbook&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,<br />
</p>
<p>I got this problem few hours ago and I'm not able to solve it. Well, from start I would like to say that I format both...SSD (22GB) and HDD (500GB), which was probably the biggest mistake right here. But whatever, it happened and I can't take it back. So
 actually I tried to clean partitions in diskpart, changed positions of disks in BIOS and tried to install Windows 8 again. When I opened Setup log files, I saw something about that boot disk is not on my computer or something like that AND that my partition
 is too small (24GB is not enough?). Everything failed and I didn't have another option so I'm asking here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for my bad english. I tried my best</p>

<p>Hi Dan, </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a possibility that the reason why you're having this concern is because of the recent update you have on your PC. There could be some corrupted file or data on the system that causes you some issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to isolate this case, we suggest that you try to roll back to your previous update and install again the latest update on your PC. Let's check if the same issue persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, don't hesitate to inform us and we'll be happy to further assist you.<br />

<br />
This will bring about a list of startup options. Select <strong>option 5</strong> (Safe mode with networking). The computer will boot up in safe mode and desktop will be visible now.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Press <strong>Win+ R</strong> and type <strong>msconfig.</strong></li><li>In services tab, select <strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> at the bottom.<strong><br />
<br />
</strong>If you see non Microsoft services, please disable them all.<br />

<p>Hiya!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul from the Xbox Forums Team here to assist with the issue, It looks like the game Soul Calibur VI is currently not launching properly on your console. What I suggest we do is to troubleshoot the console. The best thing to do first would be to
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Perform a Power Cycle on the Xbox One.</a>&nbsp;The second thing to do would be to try and uninstall the game and reinstall it. I&nbsp;do hope this information helps in fixing the issue, please let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy Gaming!</p>

    <title>Windows folders show up in my Smart TV connected to the same network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rogeroriginals  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows folders show up in my Smart TV connected to the same network</h2>
                    <p>I tried casting a movie to my Samsung Smart TV (Not the Android TV Version), and it worked fairly well. I disconnected it after some time, turned off my laptop and attached my external HDD to the TV to watch some movies on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next day, the main problem started. My TV now always shows my PC name in the 'select source' menu on my TV, and it randomly disconnects from the internet. Even my HDD also disconnects every 1 minute. I have disabled all forms of network sharing in my PC,
 but it still shows up in my TV. I have to manually remove it in TV, only then the internet and HDD works. I restart my TV, and all the problems repeat again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried formatting my TV many times, but the issues start again the moment my PC and TV are connected to my home WiFi. I contacted Samsung, and a technician checked it up and determined that there's something wrong with Windows 10, not the TV. A quick
 search on the internet showed up many sites where users complained of their Samsung Smart TV having problems with Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So clearly it's a Windows 10 issue; I'm tired of formatting my TV again and again. I have to disconnect my PC from the WiFi to properly use my TV. I have turned off every single sharing setting on my PC, but the issue just doesn't go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to explore all my options before finally reverting back to my good old stable Windows 8.1.</p>

<p>Hi Roger,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that other devices on the network can still see your laptop. Aside from disabling the sharing options and disconnecting from the Wi-Fi network, what other troubleshooting steps have you performed on the laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>While waiting for your reply, please turn off the Network Discovery option on your laptop. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Navigate to <strong>Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet</strong>.</li><li>Since your laptop is connects wirelessly, select <strong>Wi-Fi</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Manage known networks</strong>.</li><li>Select the network where the laptop connects, then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li><em>Toggle off</em> <strong>Make this PC discoverable</strong>.</li><li>Close the Settings page.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you have additional questions, or if the issue persists after the troubleshooting steps above, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            Hello Margaret L.,<br />
<br />
Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers Community.<br />
<br />
Before you jump to purchase a new lcd, try to determine if it is the system board, lcd or cable.<br />
<br />
Try connecting a external monitor and see if the same thing is happening. If you still see it, then it is the system board.<br />
<br />
However if you do not see it anymore, more than likely is the cable or lcd. <br />
<br />
If you feel comfortable with it, try disconnecting the cable from the&nbsp;system board&nbsp;and the lcd and reseating it to see if that fixes the problem.<br />
If not, you can try purchasing a new cable, since they are less expensive than a lcd, and see if that fixes the problem.<br />
And lastly, purchase a new lcd.<br />
<br />
I simply would not jump to say that it is the lcd.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted a User Account in Windows 10 under settings but it continued to exist in the drop down menu when looking at the file folder. All my pictures, downloads etc were put under this User by default. The account was my Ex and I.. so I am a bit fed up
 of seeing his name all the time in the file path. I thought it would just be a case of changing the User Name but as it doesn't exist as such I cannot change it. I have slowly been passing all the files from that User Account to my own User Account. I have
 the problem that there is a folder called App Data which I cannot move as it says it needs administrator permission. I thought I was logged in as the administrator so not sure what I can do to move the file or can I delete it?</p>

            Hi Go'Jo,<br />
<br />
<br />
Microsoft does not recommend relocating, moving ProgramData, Program Files, Program Files (x86) and Windows folders. Too much is depending on information and data stored on these folders and relocating them might cause serious issues. However, there's simply
 nothing preventing us from moving the user's folder and everything it contains, including the Temp and AppData folders. To guide you on moving data only for AppData\Roaming folder, you may follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
1. See what is your current "Roaming" folder by typing %AppData% in a command line. Surely it will show C:\&lt;Users&gt;\&lt;User&gt;\AppData\Roaming.<br />
<br />
2. Create a new folder in the desired location or use xCopy to create a copy of its original with same security attributes, FreeFileSync and so on.<br />
<br />
3. Right-click on both folders and check attributes. Ensure that the new folder has exactly the same security attributes than the original.<br />
<br />
4. Use Windows Explorer to right-click on current Roaming folder and right-click on "Location" tab. Set the new location and follow the assistance when it suggests you move the content of the folder to the new location.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.

            Properties and attributes are almost the same as it defined as PROPERTYKEY structures with two parts: a category GUID, and a unique ID for that category. Properties that describe related things share a common GUID (Globally Unique Identifier).<br />

            Do you have any unallocated space to the right of the partition you want to extend? Are you trying to extend your system partition? I recommend you use a third-party utility such as
<a href="http://www.easeus.com/partition-manager/epm-free.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
EaseUS Partition Master Free</a> instead of Disk Management.
