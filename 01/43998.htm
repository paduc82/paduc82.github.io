            Hi, RoianRainbows 
<br />
<br />My name is Mays and I am an Independent Consultant. I would love to help you today.
<br />
<br />Perform the procedure to repair the system files:
<br />Follow these instructions: press the Windows + X keys and select Command Prompt (Administrator) or Windows PowerShell (Administrator), in the window that will open, you must type the commands in their respective order:
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />• DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•  sfc /scannow 
<br />
<br />Each of these actions can take a few minutes, so it is important to execute one at a time. When finished, you must restart the PC.

    <title>How to keep bluetooth headset paired. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> magnoliasoutherly  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to keep bluetooth headset paired.</h2>
                    <p>This is really annoying. I can pair the headset fine with my Windows 10 computer. However, I have my headset paired with my phone as well. It cannot connect to both, which I don't really see why it can't, but it simply can't. Fine. The answer is to shut
 the bluetooth off when it's not in use. That makes sense, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after I shut the bluetooth off on my computer and then turn it back on, guess what doesn't work? I can see that the headset is supposedly "still" paired with the computer, but it simply doesn't connect. Why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately, I have to remove the paired device (headset) then repair the headset again each and every time I ever use it in my life! Again, why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is not the headset because I can turn my bluetooth on and off a dozen times on my phone and I don't have this problem. I don't even have a fancy phone. I have a cheap and very out of date LG L90 and this headset has 4.1 bluetooth! This is strictly
 a Windows 10 issue. Period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it matters, this is the headset I have:&nbsp;http://www.jarvmobile.com/productdetail.asp?productid=34878</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me? This is really annoying.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How to correct mistake where printer security is set to deny permision - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to correct mistake where printer security is set to deny permision to everyone</h2>
                    <p>Please help. I screwed up bigtime. I've a stand-alone PC running Win 7, no network. I changed the security setting on printer to allow permissions for Administrators and some users, but also denied for Everyone Group. Didn't really understand resultant warning
 -- and now no matter what account, I can't change or delete printer. </p>
<p>Is there a work-around? I'd be happy to delete the printer and then re-install it. As it should be obvious by now, I'd like a low-risk fix so I don't make more of a mess.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Problem with dual boot xp and windows 7 64 bit, pc booting onto x&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 4mb3rw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with dual boot xp and windows 7 64 bit, pc booting onto x&#58; repairbcd can&#39;t find any windows installations.</h2>
                    
<p>I have recently tried to set up a dual boot system on my pc between XP home and windows 7 64 bit.&nbsp; I originally had xp home installed on drive C and a slave Drive E, I installed a new hardrive which in xp was F.&nbsp; I formatted the drive in xp and then installed
 windows 7 64bit onto it.&nbsp; It installed fine and seemed to work fine except I never got the dual boot menu?<br />
<br />
In windows 7 the new drive F was named C, my xp C drive was now D and the slave didn't have a name as it had the same drive letter as the cd rom, I went into disk manager and assigned it a drive letter (i) and it showed up. (not sure if doing this has messed
 anything up as I did it the same day as changing the boot loader) <br />
<br />
Occasionally if an application would crash in windows 7, the restart would automatically reboot into xp.&nbsp; A normal power up would boot automatically into windows 7 and restarts would boot into windows 7.&nbsp; I searched google on how to set up the dual boot menu
 and got the recommended easybcd software.&nbsp; The BCDEDIT only showed one operating system, windows 7.&nbsp; I followed the instructions here http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/8057-dual-boot-installation-windows-7-xp.html I added windows xp and saved the changes
 (i think I may have set the drive to be D as on the windows 7 system the drive was named D I think that was a mistake) then I wrote the changes to the MBR.&nbsp; Then I nervously restarted my pc and nothing, it won't boot into either os.&nbsp; I get the dual boot screen,
 if I select xp I get an error "\NTLDR 0x000000F selected entry could not be loaded application missing or corrupt".&nbsp; If I try and boot windows 7 it starts but then goes to a black screen where it should have gone into the welcome screen. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have tried to fix xp by booting from the xp disk, if I go into repair it asks me which version of windows I want to repair E:// or F://&nbsp; Now in the xp system E is my slave drive with no OS on F is the windows 7 drive in windows 7 E is the cdrom and F is an
 external drive so I assume it is using the xp setups drive names.&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran this again after doing the bootrec.exe sequence below and now it gives me the option to repair 2 versions of windows D:\Windows and E:\WINDOWS however I have to enter the administrator
 password and it won’t recognise my password (it is definitely correct).&nbsp; In XP D:is my cdrom E is the slave in Windows 7 D is my C drive in xp&nbsp; and E is my cdrom. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If I go into the advanced boot menu of windows 7 (F8) it lets me go into the system repair (same happens if I try to repair from windows 7 disk).&nbsp; If I go into startup repair it tells me the OS booted successfully, I get error codes of 0x0 for every test it
 did but they completed successfully.&nbsp; It says the operating system is windows 7 on C: and names my drive. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
In command prompt it shows x:rather than C: <br />
<br />
The bcdedit output shows: &nbsp;<br />
<br />
boot manager device partition=E:<br />
<br />
Boot loader <br />
identifier &lt;default&gt;<br />
device partition C:<br />
path \windows\system32\winload.exe<br />
description windows 7<br />
os device partition=C:<br />
systemroot\windows<br />
<br />
Real-mode boot sector<br />
device partion=E:<br />
path \NTLDR<br />
description windows xp<br />
If i go into command prompt and try bootsect.exe and scanos it doesn’t find any windows installations. &nbsp;<br />
I have tried the following procedure in command prompt<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;bcdedit /export C:\BCD_Backup<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;c:<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;cd boot<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;attrib bcd -s -h -r<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ren c:\boot\bcd bcd.old<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;bootrec /RebuildBcd<br />
but when I get to cd boot I get the error “the system cannot find the path specified”<br />
<br />
I have also tried \fixmbr and rebuildbcd fixmbr says its done successfully, rebuildbcd finds no versions of windows.<br />
<br />
I have tried so many things now I can’t remember how I did this but at some point I could open a directory and could see my system all the files were there including some newly created files by easybcd.&nbsp; The windows directories were both there on the c and
 f drives.&nbsp; I’d accessed this by being asked to locate drivers?&nbsp; I could also see the X drive? Not sure what this is, I’ve never seen it before.&nbsp; If it is the windows 7 install that I’d read somewhere it could be, surely the bootrec.exe commands would work
 on it?<br />
<br />
I have no system restore points and didn't know about making an image of my system so I can't restore to those.<br />
<br />
I’m thinking the problem is that it isn’t looking in the right place on the drives or even at the right drive for windows, but I don’t know how to change this.&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem seems to be with it looking for xp on E?&nbsp;&nbsp; I really want to avoid a clean install as
 the whole point of the dual boot was to keep my original system and software in case things didn’t work on windows 7.</p>
<p>Hope you have plenty of information and hope someone can fix my problem!<br />
<br />

<p>You most likely will need to rebuild the BCD store. Depending on which OS (XP or Windows 7) was installed first, the BCD store will either be part of a small 100MB 'System, Reserved' partition (when Win 7 is installed first) or if XP was the first OS installed
 was XP then the BCD store will be a folder C:\Boot and a file named 'bootmgr'.</p>
<p>See if this article is of any help as to how to rebuild the BCD store: How to repair a Windows 7 Dual Boot computer after a hard drive failure<br />

    <title>Getting Windows Explorer to save settings and views. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scorpio2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting Windows Explorer to save settings and views.</h2>
                    I did a clean install of windows 7. I would like to save my settings in Windows Explorer. After opening the program I have to click on Documents then My Documents and I have to move the preview pane over so it does not cover the details of my files. Next
 time I open Explorer it is back to the default screen and I have to do all that clicking over again. How do I get it to open and look the same as it did when I closed the program?
<br />
Any help would be appreciated. <br />

<p><span><span>Hello Scorpiogirl,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to the Microsoft Answers Community!</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>The reason you see the Apply to Folders option grayed out is because you are inside of a Library, either the Document, Video, Music or Pictures
 library. </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>A library is very similar to a folder with the exception that no file is actually stored inside of the library. Instead the library displays the
 files of the locations it is set to pull from. For example, I set the User Profile’s
<strong>Documents</strong> folder and a folder on my desktop named <strong>
Important Documents</strong> as locations for my Documents library. When I open the library I can view all of the files in both the User Profile’s<strong> Documents</strong> and the desktop folder
<strong>Important Documents</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>You can edit the way your folder is display and save the layout in the actual folder that the documents are stored, but the library will always
 be set as it is by default.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>hard drive getting smaller - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rogerbusey  say:</h3>
<h2>            hard drive getting smaller</h2>
                    Everyday something on my hard drive increases by almost 3gig, using up space. All my programs together add up to about 75 gig on my 279 gig hard drive, but my system says I only have about 20 gig of space left. I keep deleting stuff to get space back,
 but I am fighting a loosing battle. I have tried programs to look at what's on my hard drive, the closest I could find was using spacesniffer program, and there was a huge chunk, about 180 gig that was not access able. Is there anything I can do, to get access
 back or maybe delete something that is apparently running wild on my hard drive.

<p>You should be all set. Some of the maps are the same maps but optimized for a different game mode. You unlock new weapons and equipment by progressing through the multi-player. There are weapon skins/player outfits and kit shortcuts you can purchase if you
 want but it is not worth it. </p>

    <title>Status code 807b01f4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pigheadediowa1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Status code 807b01f4</h2>
                    
<p>I'm getting the status code 807B01F4 when trying to download demos for my Xbox via Xbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although I managed to get around this problem by downloading demoes through my PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I viewed the sticky post, but the credit card billing issue shouldn't effect me, because I'm trying to download free demoes. I entered the billing address though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still haven't managed to solve the problem. Help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>OK, so I did some digging and I have a few things for us to try. First of all, do you have an extra USB memory device we can use? You'll need to format it for use with the console (<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/7/t/11.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../11.aspx</a>),
 then turn off your console, remove the HDD, restart, and then try to recover your profile to the USB device. Once that is complete, try your download again.

<p>I came on here to see if anyone knew why i was having this Status Code problem but seems were all confused &nbsp; &nbsp;..I think i KINDA know why im having the problem &nbsp; &nbsp;..Not sure why but im only getting the Status Code when i connect to my phone's wireless HotSpot
 (which is faster than my home WiFi so i use it to download demos etc only) i have no clue why the Status Code now because ive done that for a while with no Status Code or problems until today &nbsp; &nbsp;..Im usually connected to my home WiFi so i switched back to
 my home WiFi and the problem went away so to test this theory i went back to my phone's Hotspot and status code came back &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;..Hope this helps</p>

<p>I am also experiencing this. &nbsp;Cleared the cache, recovered my gamertag,recovered my profile, verified it`s an adult account, its not a billing issue, as I have only downloaded demos since I bought the console brand new in March of `11 Still the same problem
 and still no fix. Its not region oriented as its always been in the US &nbsp;The "community xpert" said only Gold account users can download free demos! &nbsp;What a load of crap! &nbsp;I can get around it and get game demos to download to my console from my PC. &nbsp; I am still
 waiting for a response to my support ticket. &nbsp;This is lame, pathetic and a whole slew of other expletives come to mind. &nbsp;I was only planning to buy points cars to get DLC but now I`m so pissed off with this BS.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Sysinternals Diskmon LED -- Run As Administrator checked but still asks to make changes to computer.</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Sysinternals Diskmon LED -- Run As Administrator was checked, but it still asks to make changes to computer:&nbsp; By way of explanation:&nbsp; My desktop's disk activity light is hard to see, so I wanted some indication on my display.&nbsp; The command "C:\Users\computername\Documents\Sysinternals
 Tools\Diskmon.exe" /l is supposed to show just the LED in the system tray.&nbsp; I have the properties checked to run as Administrator, even for all users.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; When I click the program or its shortcut, it still pops a window asking permission to make changes to the computer.&nbsp; Update:&nbsp; I now understand this is normal, depending on your UAC settings.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I have the shortcut in the Startup folder, but it won't appear at startup.&nbsp; My workaround is to have the shortcut in my taskbar.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All contributions and suggestions gratefully accepted.&nbsp; Update:&nbsp; I have now come to understand you get this request to make changes even when you are the Administrator (depending on your UAC settings).&nbsp;

            <p>When you select Run as Admin, you are confirming to the computer that Admin permission&nbsp;is going to be required** - you are issuing a warning not granting that permission.&nbsp; The dialog you then see is asking for&nbsp;Admin permission; this dialog cannot be bypassed
 -&nbsp;this has been a fundamental protection component since Windows 7 was introduced.&nbsp; This behaviour is the same whether you are logged in to an Admin account or a Standard user account [only the content of the dialog that appears is any different].</p>
<p>[** <em>Fully compliant applications will initiate the dialog seeking Admin permission in any case if they need it.&nbsp; Selecting Run as Admin first is just a precaution to allow you to work correctly with applications that are not completely compliant such
 as old applications.]</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If SysInternals DiskMon needs Admin permission every time it runs because of the way it works then that is a limitation that might be annoying but results from the design of the utility.&nbsp; Given the age of the current DiskMon, I would not expect any updated
 version to be developed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know why the shortcut in the Startup folder is not doing the same as the shortcut you have put on your Taskbar.&nbsp; It ought to.&nbsp; The two startup folders you can use are</p>
<p>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp [to run the shortcut for all users]</p>
<p>C:\Users\<em>YourUserName</em>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup [for your own user account only]</p>

</p><p>Check the SysInternals download page in case it has any advice about Admin permissions [but I doubt it, it's too old].&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Search for <em>SysInternals DiskMon</em>&nbsp;&amp; <em>SysInternals Disk Monitor</em> in this forum, TenForums and possibly
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet</a> as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible that somebody else has developed a similar utility that only requires Admin permission for its installation rather than its normal running.&nbsp; If these
 searches do not yield any useful references to similar utilities then your next best bet might be to Google something like
<em>SysInternals DiskMon</em>&nbsp;<em>alternative</em>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know of any alternative and I cannot imagine one that would not need Admin permission every time it ran - Admin permission is needed because revealing disk activity to you is potentially revealing the activity of other users i.e. it is exceeding
 the normal bounds of what is allowed without permission.</p>

                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like assistance on the above mentioned error which I get when I try to start desktop icalendar software. Although I received some help from the developer but to no avail. I see the above error pop up on Event Viewer. The full error is posted below.
 I use windows 8.1 on a laptop. The application does not seem to start each time I double click to start it creates an event in Event Viewer with the following error in detail. I can see the mouse pointer showing some kind of activity just after double clicking
 but it is not for long and dont see it either in the task manager.</p>

<p>I just created a new profile and the old profile is still there since I am still using it to finalise transfer of all files, etc. before finally removing it.</p>

<h2>            How to remove advertisement in the microsoft apps like Bing weather, Bing Travel and so on&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, i just installed windows 8 professional on my pc and to my astonishment i am being spammed with advertisements in Microsofts "metro" apps like Bing weather, Bing Travel and so on. Two of my friends who also installed it have no advertisements in those
 apps. So my question is now, why do i have those advertisements there and how can i remove the advertisements so that i wont have them like my friends dont have them? I understand that if i paid for something is should not have advertisements in it... (we
 all took the 30 euros upgrade option from windows 7) Thanks

<br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft community!<br />
<br />
You've reached the right forum for your question. As I understand you want to remove the advertisement from Bing weather, Bing Travel.<br />
<br />
The advertisements are specific to the location. These advertisements cannot be removed.<br />
<br />
Hope this information is helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.<br />

I understand your wished business model but I would kindly suggest option of buying full app without advertisement. Otherwise I will be forced to suggest joint action of Slovenian Consumers Organization against forced advertisement and company's products which
 advertise in described manner.<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7c868ce1-2f7e-44bc-a09a-a36f2f9e0486"><br />

    <title>Windows cannot see drive file system - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffbillington  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows cannot see drive file system</h2>
                    <p>I have a Samsung M3 2TB External USB Hard Drive. It is around 95% full of video files. A few days ago, I noticed certain folders were very slow to respond, and on Sunday, a folder would not open, say it had failed Cyclic Redundancy Check. I ran 'Check Drive
 for Errors' (from Drive &gt; Properties) and following this, Windows 10 (I have tried 2 different machines) cannot see any of the files or folders. It will detect the drive (but not the volume name) but if I try to open it, it will say 'Drive must be formatted
 before it can be used'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the files and folders are still there. On Monday I ran CHKDSK /f which found a few errors, and I could see the original filenames. After about 98% it just stopped (which took around 24 hours), and after a further few hours I stopped it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded Minitool Partition Wizard. This sees ALL the files and folders, the volume name, and lists the drive as an NTFS partition. I tried various options within this software including checking/repairing the file system (which found and fixed errors)
 and recover partition (which found a lost partition and restored it), but Windows response is still the same as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Disk Management lists the partition as RAW, and suggests it is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT here's the thing - if I plug the drive into my BluRay player, I can see ALL the files and folders, access them quickly (including the folder that was causing the CRC error that started this off in the first place), and play the videos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So - how can I fix this so Windows can access the file structure again? I don't have a spare 2TB of drive space nor do I have any drive recovery software.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sometimes the issue might occur if the USB driver has become unstable or corrupt or if your PC requires an update&nbsp;for issues that may conflict with a USB device and Windows. This may also occur if your USB controllers may have become unstable or corrupt.
 So, I would suggest you to try the following steps and check if the issue persists.</p>

            I have tried this - and again, I have tried it on 2 different Win10 computers - but it has not solved the problem. Again, the issue is that Windows cannot see the file system, but other devices (and other utilities) can see it.

    <title>Program install and uninstall troubleshooter does not analyze - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> curtwe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Program install and uninstall troubleshooter does not analyze</h2>
                    I keep getting a low disc space notice and tracked down the cause to installer files. When I attempted to run the program "install and uninstall troubleshooter" it would begin analyzing but would never get done. At one point I closed all my programs and
 left it run for several hours while I worked and it had done nothing, continued to say it was analyzing. I'm fairly certain this would correct the problem if it worked. Now when I shut off the PC it won't install updates. I'm running XP with a 34GB drive and
 only 1.34 MB free space. About 75% of the space is in the installer files. I'd appreciate any help that you can offer. Thanks!

            I finally got the file down to 1.1GB using msizap. Everything seems to be working fine. Thanks for all the help. I did have problems using the tool as it would only flash on the screen for a second and then was gone. Finally after searching I found a post
 on another site that opened the door for me. The following is a copy of that post.
<p>"http://www.pagestart.com/msizap.html</p>
<p>First: Open a command window:<br />
Next: Change the default folder to: C:\Program Files\Windows Installer Clean Up&gt;<br />
Then: At the command prompt enter:<br />
msizap !g &gt; zapresults.txt<br />
Press the ‘Enter’ key.</p>
<p>Changing the default folder was the trick. I used the program Folder Sizes 4 to open the command from this folder. Running msizap from here was like magic. My Installer folder is now982 Mb instead of 72 Gb!!!!!!"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
Thanks again for all the help. I learned a lot from all your suggestions and advice!

    <title>GPT Protective Partition. Moved 6TB SATA drive from Windows 7 64 bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wavyd  say:</h3>
<h2>            GPT Protective Partition. Moved 6TB SATA drive from Windows 7 64 bit to Window 10 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Western Digital Black 6TB SATA hard drive that has been formatted as a single large partition with GPT on a 64 bit Windows 7 PC. It is not a boot drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to move the drive to different PC which has 64 bit Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, on the Windows 10 PC's Disk Management console, the drive is showing one partition as 2049GB GPT Protective Partition, and 3541.03GB unallocated. Thankfully, when I put the drive back in the original PC, everything still works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read that the&nbsp;GPT Protective Partition can happen when moving from 32 to 64 bit systems, but both of my systems are 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The motherboard on the second PC is an Asus P5K-E/WiFi-AP. It's BIOS drivers are up to date although the most recent release was in 2009. The motherboard's manual shows that the SATA connectors are Intel ICH9R.&nbsp;I have run the Intel Driver &amp; Support Assistant
 and this suggests there are no software updates available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the app "Drive Controller Info", it shows shows that "Standard SATA&nbsp;AHCI Controller 10.0.17134.1" is being used. I believe this is a standard Windows driver, and this is apparently up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest what might be going wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>David</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes ICH9R sockets and AHCI mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the problem has something to do with the controller driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The motherboard was supplied with the "Intel(R) Matrix Storage Manager Driver". The last release was in 2009 but it is no longer supported and it has no Windows 10 support.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This means that Windows' own "Standard SATA&nbsp;AHCI Controller 10.0.17134.1" is being used instead, and this shows a date of 2006.</span></p>
<p>I think I will have to get another drive and try initializing it on the Windows 10 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>

            For security you cannot, it's hard coded into the loginui.exe process. &nbsp;But you can avoid mis-detections by training your finger again. &nbsp;It won't remove old learned data, but rather continue improving recognition for faster and more reliable recognition
 in the future.

<h2>            Battery Life Icon has disappeared from Windows 8 taskbar.</h2>
                    Until yesterday my Toshiba Satellite laptop running Windows 8 showed the Battery Life icon and Wifi strength icon.&nbsp; Now both are missing from the taskbar.&nbsp; I&nbsp; re-instated them both using the Control Panel (Icons + Behaviours) and they still won't display!&nbsp;
 I need to fix this immediately. I cannot even see if the laptop if the laptop has fully recharged before removing it from my desk.&nbsp;

<br />Also sign into Skype for Web to confirm if you are still unable to send messages.

<h2>            Games no longer launch Xbox games pass pc</h2>
                    I have been playing games through the Xbox app, then I took a break for about a week. I returned to the app and attempted to launch a game, but games will not launch, even games I have played already.<br />
<br />
I have followed the procedures listed in the FAQ's tried to launch game from start menu, attempted to repair the game through the app settings, and then I uninstalled the game, which was suggested. But after I uninstalled the game, I can no longer install it,
 so great advice. <br />
<br />
Navigating this website is a nightmare, I attempted to use the AI chat but none of the prompts took me in the right direction and it eventually just dead ended.<br />
<br />
I am giving you until the end of this month to iron out these issues before I cancel.&nbsp;

<p>LOL is this a joke, reset the app, there is no way to reset the app on Windows 10, delete it and reinstall maybe, but it was literally working 4 days ago, now no popular games will download or play even if they are downloaded, only indie trash games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say this is a beta test, then why am I paying for this service, if it is this buggy, it should be free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again you have until my initial month expires before I leave this service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initially figured out how to download games by searching the web, as Microsoft is useless when it comes to customer service. I thought I had it sorted but literally 4 days later everything was broken again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been 3 days since I have been unable to play, or download any popular game. I have followed all the troubleshooting suggested to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again if you are claiming this is a beta why am I paying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can reset the App by going to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Xbox (Beta) and press the "Advanced options" link and then scroll down a bit and hit the "Reset" button, which will reset the app. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you provide some more details on what happens when you try to launch the game?&nbsp; Does nothing happen?&nbsp; Does it start to load and then crash?&nbsp; And how are you trying to launch the games?&nbsp; Directly from the start menu, or from the App itself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please note that the app is in Beta still, highlighted by the name of the app "Xbox (Beta)".&nbsp; If you have constructive ideas for feedback on how to improve the experience and service, you can do so at the Xbox Feedback site, or directly from the app,
 by clicking on your profile icon in the top right and selecting "Feedback".</p>

<p>Yes I reset the app, I even uninstalled and reloaded the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to start a game, even one that I have successfully downloaded and played before nothing happens, literally nothing. I tried to start the game from the start menu and from the windows store, nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it seems like the indie trash games will download and play, it is only the AAA games like Metro, Wolfenstien, Prey, etc that do not download, or play after download, even if they worked before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the 5th day in a row now, no resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have until the 17th of next month when I will cancel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was excited to get into this program to get access to Metro Exodus, but I could give a rip about some indie platformer from 2008.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a problem with the developers not wanting their games being played for 4 dollars a month then remove them from the store front.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is false advertising.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And again if your excuse is this is a beta, why are you taking money for it. I have payed for a service, and I have yet to be provided that service.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            hp pavilion with vista won&#39;t upgrade to windows 7</h2>
                    Have vista home prem 64 bit on a hp pavilion a6700y, circa 2009. &nbsp;I tried to upgrade to win 7- 64 bit AND I did all the things the win 7 upgrade&nbsp;advisor&nbsp;recommended to do--upgraded or uninstalled as suggested.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I even tried an "ignore plugins" code--and that got me far enough for the windows 7 setup to install, but it won't go beyond the "starting" point without an error--can't continure installation message.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I would like to upgrade and not do a clean install, so has anyone ever had anything similar happen?<br />
<div><br />
