<p>Hi Reav57,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting your question on answers.microsoft.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What kind of SD Card Reader is being used?<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Is it a SD Card Reader or a SDHC Card Reader, what type is it?<span>&nbsp; </span>
Brand?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the screen that pop's up or icon that pop's up is it to a recognized program like Canon or any such like?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the general information, if this has ever worked before, it sounds like something has been downloaded that is taking the association away from the files that are on the SD Card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a file of the same type that is on the SD Card on your hard drive, right click on it , select Properties and see what program is associated with it to open that file.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then open that program and check it's settings for what formats it handles and remove the one that is not the desired association.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In essence, what the program is that the file that is on the hard drive has associated with it to open it is the same program you want on the files on the SD Card files to open them.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So right click on the files in the SD Card reader and select properties and select associate file with - and select the program that you saw listed on the hard drive fil for this file.<br />
<br />
Let us know if this resolves the issue or if further assistance is needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this doesn't work</p>
<p>
Reset AutoPlay Defaults:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Go to Control Panel -&gt; Default Programs -&gt; Change AutoPlay Settings and then choose at the bottom to reset all defaults. -remember any settings will be reverted back to default so there may be configuration changes.</span>
</li></ol>

            Amazon still has some XP copies for sale. Usually the upgrade goes smoothly but back up your data to external media first because Stuff Happens.<br />

susie47,
<div><br />
<div>I would just add that the Windows XP Professional upgrade path from Home to Professional is the least painful of all the path's I have seen. You generally just need to use the Professional CD to install&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;XP Pro over top of your Home edition and
 (with your new CD-Key) and Windows will have the new capabilities.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As Malkeleah says, be sure to backup all the data you have (just in case) and just for the upgrade, remove your Anti-Virus&nbsp;package&nbsp;(as I have seen the conflict). Reinstall it after the upgrade is finished.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I wish you luck with the process,</div>

<h2>            After my Windows 10 laptop went into hibernation, I no longer have a logon prompt.</h2>
                    I have an upgraded Windows 8 to Windows 10 HP laptop. &nbsp;On Thursday, after my laptop went into hibernation mode, I no longer have a logon prompt where I can put my password. &nbsp;I have rebooted in safe mode and disabled the "boot in safe mode" option by running
 msconfig which has worked in the past. &nbsp;I found some blogs on trying to disable fast start, but that option is not available in my power options. &nbsp;I am right in the middle of trying to finish my taxes and need to get this working. &nbsp;I have tried everything
 I can think of. &nbsp;I am a technical support person, so do know a lot about computers. &nbsp;

<h2>            How to include a KB Update into a WIM in order to point to the WIM when using DISM &#40;details inside&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been struggling to fix a corrupted file. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Context: &nbsp;I feel that something is not right with the computer, so I started poking around.</p>
<p>I used "sfc /scannow" from an elevated command prompt and the result was:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log&nbsp;</strong><strong><var>%WinDir%</var></strong><strong>\Logs\CBS\CBS.log.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I looked in the log. &nbsp;This message appears 4 times:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Cannot repair member file [l:36{18}]"Amd64\CNBJ2530.DPB" of prncacla.inf, Version = 6.3.9600.16384, pA = PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE_AMD64 (9), Culture neutral, VersionScope = 1 nonSxS, PublicKeyToken = {l:8 b:31bf3856ad364e35}, Type
 = [l:24{12}]"driverUpdate", TypeName neutral, PublicKey neutral in the store, hash mismatch</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>There is also the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">This component was referenced by [l:186{93}]"Microsoft-Windows-Printer-Drivers-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.3.9600.16384.INF_prncacla"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not positive what to do next, but I have been led to believe the problem is that Flash files in version 6.3.9600.16407 are corrupted, that I need to find which KB updates Flash to this version, download the file, add it to a new WIM, and point to it
 when using DISM. &nbsp;I'm not positive this is correct, but it was suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the KB update: kb2889543, but I do not know how to add it to a new WIM or what the repercussions of doing so will be (e.g. Will I lose everything and have to restore my documents, etc from my external drive by doing this?). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the question is:&nbsp;<strong>How can I include a KB Update into a WIM and tell me what the result will be when once I do and point to it when using DISM?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondarily, if this is a bad way to move forward with the issue, would some kind soul offer sage advise on how to move forward with resolving the original issue?</p>

<p>Where?&nbsp; FWIW what I have speculatively asked more than once is why not try removing that Printer Drivers package?&nbsp; Sounds like something an OEM would have had its fingers in so avoiding that confusion might allow the rest of the update to progress.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I showed someone my DISM.log and the contents of the C:\Windows\logs\CBS folder. &nbsp;From that, I was told the problem was that the Flash files in version 6.3.9600.16407 were corrupted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>I was actually thinking more about removing the whole package that the problem files were contained in.&nbsp; The idea would be that if there was no more reason to go looking for those files the&nbsp;update wouldn't be trying to do something with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So,&nbsp;the first
 objective of such a test would be to change the diagnostics.&nbsp; However, now I realize that I suppose we had better have a complete inventory of what is in that package first and I'm not exactly sure how to do that.&nbsp;&nbsp; TBD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise I think it would be useful to know why WU is not providing a download for the missing files.&nbsp; But I don't know what the appropriate diagnostics would be to determine that.&nbsp; FWIW I just noticed that Joseph has another blog about making CBS.log verbose.&nbsp;
 So, we could turn that on and then use ProcMon to correlate it with everything else for the best clues we could have (so far).&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>

            <p>Here is the blog post that I think you are talking about:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://blogs.technet.com/b/joscon/archive/2010/11/18/how-to-enable-verbose-cbs-logging.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, let's assume I'm a 5 year old who needs explicit instructions :)</p>
<p>I am assuming the instructions will work on Windows 8.1, but it's not explicitly stated in the blog post.</p>
<p>Here are the steps in the blog post (My interpretations are in parentheses):</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
1. NET STOP TRUSTEDINSTALLER (interpretation: put these words in an elevated command prompt, hit enter)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
2.&nbsp; Add the following&nbsp;system environment variable:&nbsp;WINDOWS_TRACING_FLAGS with a value of 10000.&nbsp; *NOTE: This does not require a reboot to take affect. (I understand how to do this)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
3. NET START TRUSTEDINSTALLER (put these words in an elevated command prompt, hit enter)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
OK, you mention doing those steps, then using ProcMon. &nbsp;That would be the same ProcMon that I can download here?:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
Then, once I download it. &nbsp;I should call "sfc /scannow" from an elevated command prompt and then run ProcMon and provide the results?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that correct?</p>

<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>No.&nbsp; ProcMon needs to be running first.&nbsp; You are trying to use it to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
capture and supplement</span> the events involved in the generation of all the&nbsp;diagnostics that the&nbsp; SFC&nbsp; (or DISM) &nbsp;command will be adding into the CBS.log.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, it might be an idea to reduce the level of tracing first to get used to using ProcMon in that manner.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, DISM has a /LogLevel: parameter that we can use to reduce the amount of output that it generates, presumably leaving the essential
 information if that is enough for someone who can "read between the lines".&nbsp; But if you were running ProcMon then you could make it easier for yourself to find the events where interesting messages were being generated.&nbsp; The point is that once you find where
 in the trace a message that you are interested in was probably written you can use other preceding events as clues to what the message contents are saying, e.g. other registry and file accesses would then be given a clearer context.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The filter that I usually recommend as a preliminary one when all you have is a collection of log messages is:&nbsp;
<em>Operation Is WriteFile</em>.&nbsp; &nbsp; E.g. before letting ProcMon run, Add that filter and then reproduce whatever it is that you want to trace.&nbsp; Note that what is traced is the write of the record only, not its content.&nbsp; So you have to
<p>
</p><p>It's sometimes tedious making sure that you have found the right trace record to match the log message you are interested in but that is mostly a problem for the first one, since others can then be judged relative to that, e.g. by counting and matching lengths
 quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other real benefit of having the ProcMon trace is that you can use its Count Occurrences... tool to get a summary list of all the files that were written to and how many writes were done to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.g. count unique Path fields while viewing the Operation
 Is WriteFile display.&nbsp; You may find significant diagnostics you weren't aware of that way.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

            <p>I appreciate your answer. &nbsp;Would you mind formatting it in a step-by-step fashion? It would probably be very clear if the answer was a full set of steps to follow. &nbsp;For example:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. From elevated command prompt, call: NET STOP TRUSTEDINSTALLER</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Add the following&nbsp;system environment variable:&nbsp;WINDOWS_TRACING_FLAGS with a value of 10000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Back to the command prompt, call: NET START TRUSTEDINSTALLER</p>
<p>4. Add "<em>Operation Is WriteFile</em>" as a filter by doing X,Y, and Z</p>
<p>5. Turn on ProcMon</p>
<p>6. Call the following from the command line "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">/LogLevel</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">7</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">. etc.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that since you didn't tell me "no," that the ProcMon available here:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx&nbsp;</span>is what I need to download in order to move forward.
 &nbsp;When in the process am I supposed to call sfc /scannow again? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may just have to give up on this, as it seems I'm having trouble following instructions and understanding what to do.</p>

<p>First, make sure all your firewall(s) are Low, off, or in "game mode" with Age of Empires III (and the expansion packs) as an exception.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also refer to this article for more information. </p>

<p>This article also holds good for Windows 8</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also post the query in Age of Empires community forums to know more information.

    <title>Too much RAM usage out of nothing&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 0mostafa0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Too much RAM usage out of nothing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I bought a custom Flip 15 with 8 GB of RAM lately, I upgraded to Windows 8.1 right after I started the laptop.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed was too much RAM usage, I was doing nothing, haven't even installed anything (the laptop came with a lot of Sony softwares tho) and had 40% taken. Now that I use some more stuff (a simple game, a web browser) it goes up to 60% or
 so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One extra thing I noticed today, is that the running processes aren't even using up that much RAM. I opened Task Manager, Processes tab, added up the memory each process is using and got around 600 MB for the total, yet task manager says total taken is 60%
 (4.3 GB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a look here:</p>
<p>http://i.imgur.com/mR264v7.png</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, 60% (5 GB) used up, yet the processes (sorted according to memory) aren't using that much. Only the first 6 are using much, and the rest is all weak. You can also see that I'm not using any special RAM-consuming softwares.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Mostafa,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Mostly likely cause of this error is defective or mismatched RAM (Random Access Memory). See if the problem exists with combinations as you swap it in and out.</span></p>
<p><span>Since the Task manager shows the web browser processes are consuming more memory, letâ€™s try the following steps and check.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may try running the Windows Updates and install all the available updates including the optional driver and firmware updates and check.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update: Frequently Asked Questions</a>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may try to run Memory Diagnostic tool and check:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press <strong>
Windows + W</strong> keys to get the search option.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type <strong>
Memory Diagnostic</strong> in the search option.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click on the <strong>
Memory Diagnostic tool</strong> to run.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click on Restart to check for problems and follow the prompts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Letâ€™s try running Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> and then type â€œ<strong>iexplore -extoff</strong>â€ without quotes and press
<strong>ENTER.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If you are not faing any high memory usage, then add-ons may be causing the error.</span></p>
<p><span>You may try the steps provided
</span><span>in the article
</span><span>to enable add-ons individually to determine which of the add-ons may be causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/manage-add-ons#ie=ie-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Manage add-ons in Internet Explorer</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Perform these steps to boot in Safe mode with networking and check<strong>.<br />
</strong>a.<strong> </strong>Right click at the bottom left of the desktop and select Run.<br />
b.<strong> </strong>Type <strong>msconfig </strong>and hit Enter.<br />
c.<strong> </strong>Now click the <strong>boot</strong> tab. <br />
d.<strong> </strong>Place a check mark on the <strong>Safe boot option </strong>and select<strong> Network</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Click <strong>
apply </strong>and then <strong>ok. Restart </strong>the computer<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Note: You need to uncheck the safe mode option by performing the above steps to boot in normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>For further information, refer to the article:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">If you are not facing the issue in
</span><span>Safe mode with networking<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">, then you may
</span>perform a clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.</span></p>

</span></strong><span>After you have finished the troubleshooting, refer to the section â€œHow to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean bootâ€ to boot the system in normal
 start up.</span></p>

            I'm not familar with ChessMaster 6000 , but if you are looking for a strong opponent I can recommend Deep Rybka 4. There are two versions of Rybka 4 available - Rybka 4 and Deep Rybka 4. The difference between the two versions is that Deep Rybka 4 will
 make use of all the cores on a multi-core PC in order to speed up thinking time.

<p>Hi Lauren,</p>
<p>
</p><p>An incompatible touchpad driver or a hardware failure might have been the cause of this issue. To continue troubleshooting this issue, we suggest downloading the latest touchpad driver from Acer Aspire's support website and install it to your Windows 10.
 This step is to ensure that your touchpad driver is the latest one that was tested by your device manufacturer that can be use with the latest version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

    <title>Allow users to rename desktops - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the tek guy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Allow users to rename desktops</h2>
                    Just a suggestion to people who may be able to do something: In the new windows 10 update, Microsoft allowed you to have multiple desktops for doing different things at once, while staying organized.&nbsp; One nice touch to add would be to allow users to rename
 their desktops (one for GAMES, one for WORK, etc.)&nbsp; it's not a lifesaver but it would be useful for people who are not familiar with your layout or to keep even yourself a little more organized.

    <title>Kernal power error 41 random shutdown, windows update won&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> katieeeh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kernal power error 41 random shutdown, windows update won&#39;t install, USB freezes randomly &#38; taskeng.exe keeps popping up</h2>
                    <p>So I've had been having a few problems with my custom PC for a while. Firstly I should probably explain that it has been randomly shutting down with kernal power error 41 - even after I've basically replaced all hardware components. It used to be related
 to overheating before replacing the components but now it shuts down when its only been on for a minute or so sometimes. I've taken it to a PC repair guy and he couldn't figure out why this keeps happening (he did clean out and reset my PC components and it
 started happening less often). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Lately my USB keyboard and mouse randomly freeze and don't respond (although they still get power as they are lit up). Usually I can just restart and they're fine again but the last time I went to manually restart the shutdown button wasn't working properly
 - the screen would go blank then come up frozen exactly as it was. I even turned it off from the power switch and left it for 15 minutes and when i turned it back on it STILL came up frozen as it was... Eventually it restarted after a few tries, no idea why.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I have reinstalled windows 7 (to be sure it wasn't a problem with the OS) windows update KB3109103 won't install even when I download it and try and install it manually. I'm pretty sure I also had an issue before reinstalling the OS with some windows
 updates not installing (360 security always came up with the same security patches from 2014/15 every time i restarted). Also since I reinstalled it, on start up/restart it occasionally comes up with a screen similar to the 'start windows normally/start windows
 in safe mode' etc. asking me to select between 2 'Windows 7' options (i always just select the top one) - the first time I reinstalled windows 7 it didn't work so I did it again and it worked fine (unsure if this is related to any of the problems at all).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, yesterday taskeng.exe kept popping up quickly as a blank (I think) cmd prompt window - I scanned for malware and viruses and doesn't seem to be infected - file location is in system32.</p>

            Hiya, the kernal power event comes up after the PC has randomly shut itself down (as if the power switch has been turned off - no blue screen or anything). I haven't tried it in safe mode because it only happens occasionally... sometimes many times in
 a day, sometimes nothing for a week or so - trying to replicate it is difficult and just leaving it on safe mode wouldn't provide any insight to the problem unless it actually shuts down. The problem has been ongoing for a couple of years (PC wasn't in use
 for a while then I upgraded the graphic card and hard drive to use it again - hoping the hard drive was the issue as that was the only part that was the same as before). All hardware has been replaced now. The only thing I've noticed since replacing the hard
 drive and OS is that the problem no longer seems to be related to overheating as it was originally... a couple of years ago (i think before replacing the CPU) it used to shut off when the temperature reached 80 (i think). I've looked at the

<p>Can you clarify the second bulletin point for me please? Does it mean to remove any surge protectors or to just swap which outlet they're plugged into? My PC's power supply is plugged into a surge protected 4-way multiplug/power strip.</p>

<p>Hello Matthew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to make sure that the <strong>UPS (uninterruptible power supply)</strong> is working well and that it provides enough power to the PC. So you can try a different UPS, remove any surge protector, or swap which outlet they're plugged in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, try to install all the updates while in <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>.
<span>Safe mode starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers.<span> Check this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17419/windows-7-advanced-startup-options-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>
</span></span>and then follow the instructions provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance.&nbsp; <span>

<h3> reza5240  say:</h3>
<h2>            Repeated Skype Update Everytime, Headset No Longer Works Skype 8.37.098 on Win7</h2>
                    <p>1) Folks, I was using Skype 7.41 classic and resisted updates.&nbsp; On Feb 1st, Skype forced me to update to the newest version 8.37.098 which I hate.&nbsp; Now every time I launch Skype it downlaods the gosh-darn program and installs itself.&nbsp; Every single time.&nbsp;
 Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Also, ever since the update, my headset will no longer work while using Skype.&nbsp; I can hear the other party but they can't hear me unless I unplug my headset and use the built-in microphone on laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Has anyone figured out how to use the earlier versions of Skype without being forced to upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be most appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your kind assistance.&nbsp; I followed your directions and it fixed the problem.&nbsp; However, when I shut down Skype and re-launched it an hour later, it forced me to update the software back to the buggy version!!&nbsp; So I have the exact same problems
 again.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

<p>Ruwim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your replies.&nbsp; I did all of this and the problem persists.&nbsp; &nbsp;Why does Skype update itself to 8.37 when 8.38 is available?&nbsp; Why does it want to update every single time I launch the program?&nbsp; Is there no freaking way to get Skype classic
 (version 7) back at all?&nbsp; This is so painful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reza</p>

<p><span><span>Skype will not "update" itself to 8.37 when 8.38 version is already installed. There must be something peculiar with your computer's system, as e.g. a 3rd party software updater.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please, run the <strong>System Information</strong> tool (<strong>msinfo32</strong>)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Go to Windows Start and in the Run box type <strong>msinfo32.exe</strong> and press the OK button. This will open the System Information window.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In this window click on <strong>File</strong> and select <strong>Export</strong>. Save the msinfo.txt file to your hard drive and
<strong>post this file on a File Sharing site.</strong></span></p>

<p><span><span>The msinfo32 diagnostics file shows that you have installed and running Skype 8.38.0.138 version. There is no indication on that Skype installation was reverted to the
 older 8.37 version.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since yesterday, the latest version is 8.38.0.161. You can update to this version using this direct download link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://download.skype.com/s4l/download/win/Skype-8.38.0.161.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://download.skype.com/s4l/download/win/Skype-8.38.0.161.exe</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If after installing the latest version you will still exhibit repeated update prompts, then I would suggest to uninstall
<strong>Norton Security</strong></span><span> and any traces of the previous
</span><strong><span>Avast</span></strong><span> installation.</span></span></span></p>

<p>The&nbsp;<span>Skype 8.38.0.138 is there because I have to install it using your previous instructions every time I power up my PC.&nbsp; I will follow your instructions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Is there a utility for uninstalling Skype and all its traces?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks a million for your time.</span></p>
