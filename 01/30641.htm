            <p>When he purchases a game on his console the download will also go to your console because he has it set as his Home console and this should work vice versa for him as well.</p>
<p>However, if you want to download previously purchased games on his account your brother will need to sign into his account on your console and go to My Games &amp; Apps then scroll right until he gets to Ready to Download. &nbsp;From there he'll be able to download the games to your console.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 won&#39;t boot after frozen update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexhh88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t boot after frozen update</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I hope you can help me with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I got the free Windows 8 to 10 upgrade, I've been having issues with updates, mainly the system downloading them but not being able to install them, but this is the worst one I've had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**I'm going to give a detailed explanation of what happened, if you want to read what the problem itself is, please skip to the marker I'll leave further down**</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago, I got a screen telling me the system needed to install the latest version to also be able to install the latest security updates. A program or app called "Windows Update Assistant" was then downloaded and a shortcut added to my desktop, then,
 another window opened to let me know that the update itself would be downloaded. Later, I got yet another message saying that the system needed to restart to install the update. I decided to allow it since I was going to bed, but before falling asleep I saw
 that the progression had reached 17%. When I woke up, at least 5 hours later, the screen was still stuck at 17 so I shut my laptop off using the on/off button. A few minutes later, I turned it on again, during boot I got a message saying that the system was
 trying to resume the update but soon after, it gave up and said it was reverting to the last system version. It took a few minutes but it finally booted normally again and I could use my computer as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, due to heavy work load, I didn't have time to allow the system to attempt to update again so part of the problem was that every time I turned off my laptop without allowing it to attempt to install the update, it had to download the whole thing again,
 slowing down on and offline navigation to some degree. One or two days later after the first failed attempt I tried to let it update again, after using methods found on this same forum to stop Windows from getting stuck while updating. It did not work. The
 progression went a little further, but got stuck again at 21% for about four hours. After that I had had a lot of work and not enough time to oversee the process so I just clicked on "remind me later" on the restart to update screen and shut off my computer
 like normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**End of detailed explanation**</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night I finally had time and allowed it to attempt the update one more time, but it got stuck on 17% again. It froze like that for about two hours before I used the on/off button to shut the laptop off. I decided to turn it on again after a couple of
 minutes to let it perform the restoring process so I could get back to work quicker today, that's when the big problem happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned it on, it showed the Lenovo logo, then it started to load, showed me the message saying "Attempting to resume update", then went to the one saying "Reverting to last version". After a couple of minutes, the screen went black and the system restarted.
 Lenovo logo again, then load, then "Attempting to resume update", then "Reverting", black screen, restart and it kept going on in that loop over and over. I let it do that for about half an hour to see if it fixed itself but it didn't. I shut it off and went
 to bed, today I tried again but the loop still happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only differences are that when the loop started, the very first time it happened, it actually took some time between the "Resume update" and after the "Reverting" message for the system to react, like it was really attempting to boot, now both messages
 show up only for a second before the screen goes black and the system restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to access the bios, but I don't really know my way around there so I don't know if that helps and since the system is stuck kind of in a limbo between the failed update and the last version, I can't access the advanced boot options to attempt to
 boot in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not change any system settings before the last failed attempt and I did not install any new hardware or software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really love to be able to restore my system without losing my files and again, I hope you can help me with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 may have encountered a corruption on the system files or this can also be due to a hardware limit. For us to help you with this, kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the current build and version of your Windows 10? To check type in <span style="font-weight: bold">
winver </span>on the search bar and press <span style="font-weight: bold">Enter</span>.</li><li>What is the make and model of your machine?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we suggest that you perform a startup repair to correct the boot loop that you're experiencing on your Windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Boot to Advanced Startup Options from a hard reboot. Press and hold the power button on your PC until it powers off and until it powers on.</span></li><li><span>Wait until you see the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows logo screen</span><span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Please
 wait </span><span>during boot. Usually it may take repeating up to 3 times.</span></li><li><span>Select </span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">See advanced repair options</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Under </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Advanced Startup Options</span><span>, select
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Troubleshoot</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Select </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Advanced options</span><span>. Under Advanced options, select
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Startup Repair.</span></li><li><span>If prompted, select an administrator account to provide credentials for approval, type in the password and click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Continue</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;Startup Repair will now start
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Diagnosing your PC</span><span>, and will attempt to automatically repair it.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your reply.</p>

<p>Hello and thanks for the reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I can't answer the first question since I don't have access to Windows at all, but my computer is a Lenovo Y50 laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't access the avanced startup options either since the loop of resuming update/reverting to previous version doesn't let the system get to the point where it shows the windows logo and hard rebooting doesn't work either (tried it several times already),
 all I can do is access the bios by pressing F2 before the loop starts</p>

            We appreciate your response. Since you can't access Windows Recovery Environment even after a hard reboot and the machine is still stuck on an update loop, we recommend that you perform a
<em>clean install</em> on this machine. Kindly see this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> and follow the steps given on the section that says <strong>Using the tool to create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) to install Windows 10 on a different PC (click to show more or less information).
</strong>We also suggest that you check <strong>MVP Andre Da Costa</strong>'s <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10/how-to-create-a-recovery-drive-for-reinstalling/58df9c7d-84de-4652-9952-8bac34abc6c5">

    <title>Printer issue, there was no communication between PC and Printer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Printer issue,  there was no communication between PC and Printer</h2>
                    <p>Original title: laptop/printer issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP ProBook 4430s and a Lexmark X2690 All-in-One Printer. &nbsp;A few weeks ago, my laptop and I went away for about a week, which left my printer disconnected. &nbsp;When I returned, I did my usual and plugged my printer's USB Cable into my laptop. &nbsp;When
 I tried to print a document, I got an error stating there was no communication between PC and Printer and listed a series of things to double check. &nbsp;Everything was connected properly and securely but I kept getting that same message. &nbsp;I then completely uninstalled
 and reinstalled my printer and got the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Incorrect Port Detected</li><li>Print Job Canceled</li><li>This printer is designed to work with USB Cables only.</li><li>The current software setting is not set to USB Port.
<ul>
<li>Make sure using USB Cable.</li><li>Make sure printer is set to a USB Port. </li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>I have been confused since this printer issue started a few weeks ago. &nbsp;Through the Lexmark Productivity Studio, my laptop can communicate with the printer to scan a document but not print. &nbsp;I have also noticed the USB Virtual Printer Port is no longer showing
 in the list of ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did nothing out of the ordinary when I reconnected my printer to my laptop after that week away. &nbsp;I have considered one of the Windows 10 Updates possibly being the cause of all this but just don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas, suggestions, or thoughts as to what is going on with this equipment? &nbsp;I really need some help here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Damaged windows store cache causes freezing&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lvhm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Damaged windows store cache causes freezing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Just a few days ago I got a brand new Lenovo Ideapad and soon noticed that it would sometimes freeze for about a minute when I tried to run applications on it: everything from Documents to Firefox. This often happens when I try to watch Youtube videos. I've
 tried resetting the system, installing all available updates, updating to Windows 8.1, but nothing seems to help. I ran a windows apps diagnostic and I get this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://postimg.org/image/466r1lrkj/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already updated the drivers as far as they'll update, I've tried resetting the store, and I still can't seem to fix the store cache. In the meantime, my computer is still freezing intermittently. I feel like the only thing I can do is switch back to
 Windows 7 to get rid of the store altogether. Does anyone know what the problem is?</p>

            Thanks for the help. The sfc scannow found no integrity violations. I ran the store fix but my app stills finds the same damage to the cache. That being said, I have not had any apparent problems with the store, so maybe it doesn't really matter. What
 I have noticed is that these freezes almost always seem to occur when I have Firefox running. I wonder if Firefox is the problem.

            <p>Just going to post here again, since I'm still having this problem a week later. I've been trying all sorts of things and I'm still getting intermittent freezing. Eventually I tried doing the clean boot, but it's a pain to use since I can't make the computer
 freeze. I think it tends to freeze more often after booting up or coming out of sleep mode, but I can go hours or even an entire day without seeing one. Other times I can get 3 or 4 freezes in as many minutes. As a result, it's hard to tell what service or
 device is causing the freezes, and it's even harder to spend hours on the computer with half the services not working waiting for it to freeze.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, if anyone knows what this is about, I would be very grateful.</p>

                    Recently, in the past 2 - 3 weeks I have seen a magnifying glass in a red box appear when I highlight text. It seems to some kind of quick search engine. It does not seem to be very good. Can I get rid of it? If so, how?&nbsp; (Windows 10, April 2018 update)

            Hi. It is not application specific. It appears when highlighting text in Office applications, Web pages, Wordpress, Blogger and even if I highlight text in this query form. The text is highlighted and at the end of the highlight a small red box, with a
 magnifying glass appears. Clicking on the icon opens a floating "search results" window. Thanks

            Aha ... problem solved. It was Cortana's Cloud Search function. Once I had turned that off and rebooted, all was good again. Must have been turned on during the last update.

<p>1) Download the .Net 4 Standalone installer from here <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17718</a></p>
<p>2) Double-click the downloaded file to start the installation process</p>
<p>3) Continue with the installation as far as the .Net splash screen where you are asked to tick the box to accept the T&amp;Cs, but don't click OK.</p>
<p>4) Open Windows Explorer and navigate to your C drive.</p>
<p>5) Locate a new directory that the .Net installer created and extracted the install files to. It'll be named something like 780d92faf7f5c32970.</p>
<p>6) open the directory and locate the setup.exe file. Right-click it and select properties.</p>
<p>7) Click the Digital Signatures tab and click the Microsoft signature then click Details.</p>
<p>8) Click View Certificate, then click Install Certificate.</p>
<p>9) After a few seconds you'll get a "Certificate Successfully Installed" message.</p>
<p>10) Continue the installation from the splash screen and all should proceed OK.</p>
<p>without success.<br />

                    After another update my sleep mode wakeup has defaulted and requires a password to re-enter.&nbsp; In settings/accounts/sign-in options, is the question, "when you've been away, when should windows require you to sign in again?"&nbsp; The option block, which says
 "when pc wakes up from sleep", is greyed out.&nbsp; What to do?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the option isn't available in Settings, we can use the Group Policy Editor to stop the OS from requiring a password when waking up. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows key + R </strong>and type <strong>gpedit.msc</strong>.</li><li>Press <strong>OK</strong> and the <strong>Local Group Policy Editor</strong> window should open.</li><li>&nbsp;Navigate to the following path: <strong>Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; System &gt; Power Management &gt; Sleep Settings</strong>.</li><li>Double click the policy you want changed. Here, we want to change the option <strong>
on battery </strong>and while <strong>plugged in</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Disabled </strong>on the top left corner. Hit <strong>Apply </strong>
&gt; <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Restart your PC to let the changes take effect.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, check if your PC still asks for a password after waking up from sleep. If it does, kindly let us know.</p>
<p>

<p>Are you using Windows 10 Home? Group policy (gpedit.msc) is only available on WIndows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to manually edit the registry (Group policies is just a fancy way of editing the registry)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop registry key, change the value of ScreenSaverIsSecure to 0.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Desktop Icons Displayed as Black Squares &#38; Windows Explorer Icons Not Working Properly</h2>
                    <p>This problem began on my computer shortly after the lastest Windows 10 update was installed on my computer - I am currently running Version 1511 (OS Build 10586.494).</p>
<p>The icons that are associated to Programs I have installed to my PC ARE displaying correctly (Adobe, Kindle, Mozilla Firefox, Chrome, Word, Excel, Dropbox, etc.).</p>
<p>The icons that are associated to FILE FOLDERS and COMPUTER APPS that came with the computer are black squares (i.e. Ower, This PC, Network, Recycle Bin, Control Panel, Documents, Pictures, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4888f355-c67e-4306-879d-4e5633b80cef" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4888f355-c67e-4306-879d-4e5633b80cef" /></a></p>
<p>This problem is also affecting Window Explorer. &nbsp;I also cannot get the NAVIGATION PANE to show the folder tree on the left side - it is completely blank. The folders and files show in the middle pane, but the folders as mentioned above have black squares
 instead of icons, and I cannot apply new icons.</p>
<p>When I try to change the icon for a folder, I get an error message, but if I click OK the window with the icons to select from comes up. I can select an icon, and click apply and the new icon updates to the icon on the Shortcut Tab of the Properties folder,
 but does NOT update to the file folder itself. The next time I open the same properties window, the icon is back to the black square again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0bcec14-8339-4556-a130-48fa9e30cb3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0bcec14-8339-4556-a130-48fa9e30cb3f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I believe many other people have similar problems on previous versions of Windows. Perhaps this information will help someone at Microsoft to troubleshoot a fix, or does anyone know if a fix is available? I cannot find any reference to a patch for this problem,&nbsp;</p>
<p>specifically for Windows 10. Thanks for any help - I can live for awhile with the desktop blackouts but I am really annoyed with the issue affecting the view panes in Windows Explorer!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that you are facing the issue with the icons in Windows 10, let me assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the drivers are corrupted, outdated or it might occur if there are any software conflict in the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before proceeding to further steps of troubleshooting, try updating the display drivers and check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key <strong>+ X</strong> key and select&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Find and double-click <strong>Display adapters.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Right-click</strong> the device listed and click
<strong>Update Driver Software.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong> and follow the on screen instructions.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Restart</strong> the laptop after updating the drivers and check if it helps.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists,&nbsp;check and let us know&nbsp;if&nbsp;the issue persists&nbsp;in Safe Mode with Networking.</p>
<p>Refer to the below article on <strong>Start your PC in safe mode in Windows 10.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue doesn't persist in Safe Mode with Networking, perform a clean boot and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Clean boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the below article on <strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>After performing clean boot, refer to the section <strong>
How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting </strong>
to boot the system in normal mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Kindly write back to us with the updated status of the issue for further assistance on Windows, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

            <p>Hello Mohan.</p>
<p>My display is a NVIDIA GeForce GT 630, upon search for update the answer was "The best driver software for your device is already installed".</p>
<p>Therefore I performed the "Start your PC in safe mode with Networking" step and the problem still remains.</p>

            <p>I tried to do an SFC scan and repair under the administrator command prompt but that wouldn't complete: sfc /scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beginning verification phase of system scan.</p>
<p>Verification 35% complete.</p>
<p>Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also wondering why my System Information / System Summary report lists my Hardware Abstration Layer as Version 10.0.10586.420 when my OS Build is listed as 10586.494.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the File Explorer issue I used Task Manager to end the process, then ran EXPLORER.EXE to reset - didn't fix the problem of no file folder (left) pane either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI my PC is an i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz, and was purchased with Windows 8. I did the free online ugrade to Windows 10 a few months ago. My computer ran fine until the last update was automatically done in July.</p>

            <p>1) Further to the File Explorer problem: I have found out that there is no file tree (left pane) when I open file explorer. However, if I am in Word, the file tree is visible when I Save / Save As files. Does this help at all with solving the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I ran a virus check on my PC and there were a few threats found and quarantined but no viruses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I made an ISO file (using the MediaCreationTool.exe program) to reinstall Windows 10. Is this a new file off the internet, and is safe to use, or will it still contain the errors that I am experiencing because it used my PC to build some of the system
 files?<br />
</p>
<p>I could really use some advice on how to reinstall Windows 10 on my PC, as this looks like it is going to be the only solution to fix my problems.</p>

            <p>No update from me, but I too have the black squares on my desktop icons. I don't have them in Explorer, nor do I have the missing file tree. I thought I had fixed them by a) increasing the size of the icon cache, and b) rebuilding the icon cache. That lasted
 through two reboots, but now the black squares are back, and the rebuilding no longer works. All desktop icons except for the recycle bin (which is a custom icon) show the black square.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too ugraded from Windows 8; I have a Yoga 3 Pro with a Core i5, with Intel HD 5300 graphics adapter. Drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>

<h2>            How to Sync A Flash Drive Using SyncToy and Task Scheduler</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to set up Task Scheduler so that every time I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
insert my flash drive</span>, it runs SyncToy, which then syncs my flash drive with a folder on my C: drive. &nbsp;I need help creating the task that would cause this to happen, I am not to savvy in the Task Scheduler area unfortunately.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated, thanks.</p>

<p>It is not possible to capture the "flash drive inserted" event and use it as a trigger to begin a task. &nbsp;You could however use a shortcut icon on your desktop to start the sync, so you could just click that shortcut after plugging in your drive.</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing this inquiry to our attention here on the forums. The Xbox One Console stores all game progression to the Cloud automatically as long as it is connected to the internet. Hope this helps!</p>

    <title>FALLOUT 3 BROKEN STEEL WONT LOAD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> balls133  say:</h3>
<h2>            FALLOUT 3 BROKEN STEEL WONT LOAD</h2>
                    
<p>I have never actually posted in a forum before so if i do something i shouldn't just lemme kno &gt;.&lt;"
</p>
<p>but anyways, i have the game fallout 3. i am addicted. so i bought the broken steel dlc. it worked great for the most part, just a little laggy occasionally. and then i beat it and it still worked pretty good. i had to disconnect my 360 from internet recently,
 idk if thats relevant, it still worked until today. it starts up fine and says "loading extra content. please wait." until i try to play it, and right before i load a save file (after or during broken steel) it says "this save relies on content that is no
 longer present. some objects may no longer be available." and it either freezes 100% and i have to reboot my 360, or it freezes for like five minutes and then places my character maxed at level 24 in front of vault 101 with missing items, stats, perks etc
 and unfinished quests that register as finished. one of them still says to activate project purity; funny thing, when i go to the jefferson memorial, the giftshop door is gone and theres only an empty space.</p>
<p><b>I TRIED:</b></p>
<p>* clearing the cache</p>
<p>* running off a pre-dlc content savegame</p>
<p>* loading a save right before i activate project purity (the game just ends like normal without initiating broken steel)</p>
<p>* deleting the game and running it off the disc</p>
<p>* reinstalling the game to the hardrive</p>
<p>WHAT SHOULD I DO?</p>

<h2>            Skype Video</h2>
                    <p>When I start the new version of Skype and check Audio &amp; Video i find all is in order and i have a picture of myself on screen. However when I call someone - and I've tried with three contacts - whilst the light for the webcam on my laptop is on no picture
 is transmitted to the contact and my onscreen&nbsp; iindication panel is just a black oblong. Anyone had the same problem? Is it a Skype bug in the latest update? Any suggested fixes?</p>

            Hello Tara<br /><br />I am a fellow Community member here to help. I am very sorry to hear that you are experiencing this difficulty. I know that it is extremely frustrating to say the least.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the new version of Skype is still under development and as such is lacking many of the features and functions of classic Skype and contains many bugs.<br /><br />While there is not yet an ETA, it is expected in the very near future that Microsoft will begin rapidly releasing updates for the new Skype in order to add features and functionality and correct known bugs.<br /><br />In the meantime, Microsoft has listened to user feedback and has decided to continue supporting classic Skype into the foreseeable future. If you are interested in returning to classic Skype for the time being it can be gotten here<br /><br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a><br /><br /><br />if you should choose to retu

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Give this a try:
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera 
<br />Toggle on Allow apps to access your Camera
<br />
<br />Scroll down and make sure Skype is toggled on
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows Key+X 
<br />Click Windows Powershell (Admin) 
<br />
<br />Enter the following command then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.SkypeApp | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />  Open start menu
<br />    Type in "powershell" 
<br />    Right click on "Windows PowerShell"
<br />    Run as Administrator
<br />
<br />Then paste the following command
<br />
<br />get-appxpackage -AllUsers Microsoft.SkypeApp | foreach { Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml" }
<br />
<br />Press Enter
<br />
<br />After the install process finishes, you have the Windows 10 Skype app back
<br />
<br />If the problem persists, I suggest you install Skype Classic:
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

    <title>Windows 10 games wont load past splash screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dyl6886  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 games wont load past splash screen</h2>
                    <p>Some of the games I have installed through the Windows 10 store will not open, it will open the splash screen for the game but no process will start and eventually it will close itself. The games that won't open are Forza Horizon 3 and State of Decay 2 while
 for some reason Minecraft Windows 10 Edition will open fine. I tried reinstalling State of Decay and it worked right after the update finished but when I tried to play it again it did not.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to fix this?</p>

            So after following all the steps from the link and checking to see if the app will start after each one, State of Decay was still unable to get past the splash-screen. The troubleshooter said that it found problems with 'hanging or crashing apps' but was
 unable to automatically fix the issues.&nbsp;

<p>I have avoided using the MS Store and only know there are tons of threads regarding issues with MS's AAA titles .</p>
<p>The MS Store client software is apparently buggy too, but if you use the search bar at the top of the forum page you may find a fix</p>
<p>for your problem trawling those threads responses ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Often when a game runs the splash screens and setup menus but crashes when loading the gameplay it is an indication that</p>
<p>the system is not handling the load for some reason.</p>
<p>However, if you have installed any non-MS AAA titles that are running properly the issue is more likely directly linked to the games
</p>
<p>rather than hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Did you use drivers/BIOS from an installation disc that came with the motherboard ? If so, you will probably find newer motherboard</p>
<p>drivers and BIOS on the motherboard mfg's web site.</p>
<p>Equally if you let Windows Updates install your Nvidia or AMD gpu drivers you may want to download and install the current drivers directly</p>
<p>from Nvidia/AMD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>btw - In future you would do best to include your system specs as there are heaps of laptop users who post here with underwhelming systems.</p>
<p>As Minecraft is working it was a fair assumption that the machines specs may not meet the minimum requirements for Forza.</p>

            Problems with the OSD (menu appears and disappears randomly, or flashes 'locked and unlocked' on and off - Or other faults) are caused by the buttons themselves.<br />
These monitors (especially Philips) use poor quality buttons that after 2 or 3 years wear out and go semi-short circuit. You can measure them with a meter.<br />
The permanent fix would be to replace the button (open up the monitor, de-solder, and then resolder) - A quicker / less exact fix would be to just pull the cable off the button panel inside and do without the controls altogether - again, involving opening the
 monitor up.<br />
You can still operate the monitor without these buttons, using automatic on and off.
