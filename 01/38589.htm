<h2>            System Restore blank page</h2>
                    On Windows XP, when clicking on System Restore all I get is a blank page. How do I retrieve System Restore? (Incidentally a reoair man once told me that System Restore can actually damage the computer - is that right?) The Search facility has also gone
 missing.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">System restore reinstallation from José Ibarra</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Here are my usual directions for how to reinstall System Restore:<br />
<br />
If you have already run MBAM and SAS, temporarily disabled your antivirus and antimalware applications and tried your System Restore in Safe Mode and you still can't get System Restore to work, you should just reinstall your System Restore.&nbsp; You do not have
 to reinstall XP - just reinstall the System Restore part.<br />
<br />
System Restore is a frequent target for malicious software attacks. <br />
<br />
When you reinstall System Restore, all of your current Restore Points will be removed and you must restart your computer when the installation is complete.&nbsp; After the restart, one new Restore Point will automatically be created as a new System Checkpoint in
 your SR calendar.<br />
<br />
If your system had a malicious software infection, it could be that some of the files in your old Restore Points are also infected so wiping out the old ones and starting fresh is often a good idea so you don't wonder if the old Restore Points are infected
 or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
Assuming your XP is installed on the C drive of your machine:<br />
<br />
As you go through the reinstallation of SR, the reinstallation will ask you for some files as you go along and ask for your XP installation CD.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do not have a genuine bootable XP installation CD, you can change the path of where the installer looks
 for files one at a time as they are needed.&nbsp; More on that later.<br />
<br />
Navigate to the following folder:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\inf <br />
<br />
Locate and right click the following file:<br />
<br />
sr.inf<br />
<br />
Choose Install<br />
<br />
If you have cannot see the sr.inf file, configure your system to show hidden files and to show file extensions.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Click Tools, Folder Options, View and enable "Show hidden files and folders" and uncheck "Hide file extensions for known file types" then you should be able to see the c:\windows\inf\sr.inf file.<br />
<br />
The installation may ask for files from the c:\windows\inf\386 folder.&nbsp; That would be your genuine bootable XP installation CD if you have one and the Service Pack installed on your system needs to be the same as the CD you are going to use.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You do not absolutely need a CD to do the reinstall since the files must already be on your system some place if SR was ever working before.<br />
<br />
If you are asked for a file and you can't find it where I suggest in my example below (it works on my system), you will have to search your hard disk and find where the files are on your system.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If asked for a file and you don't know where it is, leave the installation waiting and click Start, Search and search for the
<br />
requested file and find it on your system.&nbsp; If SR ever worked before, the file is already on your system somewhere.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
When Search finds the requested file, switch back to the installation and enter the path to where you found the requested file and click OK.&nbsp; The installation may ask for several files along the way, but you can find them all.<br />
<br />
Here is how my system works when I reinstall SR when I pretend I do not have a genuine bootable XP installation CD:<br />
<br />
When asked for:<br />
<br />
sr.sys<br />
<br />
Point the install to c:\windows\system32\drivers<br />
<br />
When asked for:<br />
<br />
srclient.dll<br />
<br />
Point the install to c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
When asked for:<br />
<br />
filelist.xml<br />
<br />
Point the install to c:\windows\system32\restore (or c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386)<br />
<br />
When asked for:<br />
<br />
srframe.mmf<br />
<br />
Point the install to c:\windows\system32\dllcache (or c:\windows\system32\restore)<br />
<br />
When the installation completes, you will get a message that you need to restart your computer.<br />
<br />
Restart your computer and look at your SR calendar.&nbsp; You should have one new System Checkpoint in your calendar.<br />
<br />
When you get SR working again, I would run MBAM and SAS to be sure your system is reasonably clean of malicious software.<br />
<br />
The day you think you need System Restore to help you is not the day to find out System Restore doesn't work, so you should test it.<br />
<br />
After the reinstallation, manually create a Restore Point and test the restoration process and be sure you are convinced it works from end to end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>===============</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">System Restore check</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p>Create a new restore point named TEST.</p>
<p>Create a new shortcut on the desktop and point it to My Computer or any other file of your choice and name it TEST.</p>
<p>Now restore to the Test restore point.</p>
<p>The system will now reboot, and you will receive a message if the restore was successful, and the Test shortcut on the desktop will be gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em><span>Note:</span></em> This should be conducted on a regular basis. Once a month should do. Or if the system has been subject to virus or malware/spyware infection but only after the system has been fully cleaned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=====================</p>
<p>Open Explorer and go to the Windows\Inf folder. Locate the srchasst.inf file. Right click it and select Install. You'll need your XP CD or the files from the I386 folder. (This fix will require you to have your Win XP CD).</p>
<p>
</p><p>unhide system file in Folder Options so you will see the inf folder and also open the dll cache folder and when you are asked for a file you should be able to redirect the path to the dll cache as a copy of the required dll's should
 be in the cache.</p>

            Hi Rogelio.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />In Device Manager find the External under Disk Drives, on Driver tab choose Uninstall, restart PC to reinstall driver. 
<br />
<br />Test the drive with diagnostics:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>.  Best is Seatools bootable Long Test which works on all models: 
<br /><a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>.
<br /><a href="https://www.seagate.com/manuals/software/seatools-bootable/using-seatools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.seagate.com/manuals/software/seatoo...</a>
<br />
<br />Follow that up with a full Disk Check, from the Command Prompt if necessary:   <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />If those don't help go back into Device Manager and uninstall all USB drivers.  Program the Power button to Shut down at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do, so you can restart after uninstalling USB.
<br />
<br />If that fails go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>
</p><p>1. On your keyboard, press the Windows key and the R key at the same time to invoke the Run box.</p>
<p>

<p><br />
3.&nbsp;View By <strong>Small icons</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p>4. Click on AutoPlay.<br />
</p>
<p>5. Uncheck the box next to <strong>Use AutoPlay for all media and devices</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Check to see if the problem is resolved.</p>

<p>Hello Samantha,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you, that will minimize the nuisance of multiple attempts in opening the external usb hard drive.&nbsp; I would still need to solve the issue drive error, which is really just ON and OFF because I could still open files in it, in between the pop-ups notification
 about the drive error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello Patricia, Thank you for the link, I created a restore point and Oct 10 2018 version 1809 as I reply. &nbsp; I will let you know if this fixes the problem (drive error)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello Greg.&nbsp; Thank you also for the trouble shooting tips.&nbsp; I will try those if the suggestions of Samantha and Patricia fails.&nbsp;

<h2>            Japanese IME dvorak not working on Start Search, after anniversay upgrade</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 10 was working perfectly well, then I upgraded to the anniversary edition.</p>
<p>I use the Dvorak keyboard layout, and the Japanese IME (built in [Microsoft])</p>
<p>I have gone into the system registry and changed the Japanese keyboard from qwerty into dvorak. This is working fine everywhere, except the start search... When I attempt to type into the Start Search, my keyboard uses Qwerty instead. The language bar still
 shows that it's using Japanese.</p>
<p>If I switch my keyboard to English Dvorak, I can use Dvorak in the Start Search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recap:<br />
Japanese IME - modified to Dvorak via registry</p>
<p>Typing in Start Search uses Qwerty<br />
Everything else uses Dvorak</p>
<p>English Dvorak is working in Start Search</p>

Unfortunately, if your console is not fully updated, you won't be able to install games from your "Ready to Install"&nbsp;list until you update it totally.

            This is the most unsympathetic response I have ever heard. I am having the same issue and Microsoft could care less.&nbsp; I will never buy another Xbox because of this type of customer service. "Sorry that our product is a brick without internet connection.
 Why don't you lug it down to a friend's horse or coffee shop to update it?" Here's a novel idea, fix your busted system requirements for continued updates and required connectivity. Customers have made a sizable investment in the product and it is reasonable
 to want to be able to use it. I'm sure your design team is actually quite intelligent and can provide a patch.&nbsp;

<h2>            limited wifi connectivity - can&#39;t download or stream &#38; I&#39;ve read previous posts</h2>
                    <p>This is frustrating. I've read loads of posts, checked for updates, repeatedly troubleshot internet, network, and adapter. Switched my modem&nbsp;off and on.&nbsp;One post from Microsoft suggested turning off firewall. That didn't work either. This sucks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A brand new Samsung ATIV XE700T1C-A02AU touchscreen Smart PC Pro, fully up to date, with Windows 8. Automatic updates set and done; Samsung updates fully up to date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I connect to the internet via wifi and whenever I stream YouTube it stops after a few minutes due to "limited connectivity".&nbsp; I bought a movie through the Video app on Windows 8 -&nbsp;it stops streaming after a few minutes,&nbsp;the same when I try to download the
 movie I just purchased! Every time I have to connect &amp; reconnect to my wifi network. The suggestions on these forums are getting repetitive - I've checked for updates and troubleshot as recommended; now I want WIndows 8 to connect properly via wifi; this is
 basic functionality!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My old HP dm-1 with WIndows 7 - no problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This only seems to be a problem on my Windows 8 when I stream or download. General surfing works much better and doesn't seem to trip the "limited wifi" failure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't got it sorted yet, though I have&nbsp;found the wifi is fine on a couple of other&nbsp;networks, just not the one I use most at home.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope I can get it sorted. Samsung have said the warranty will cover any network adapter issues, but they've also asked me to contact my ISP to try and check for&nbsp;any IP address conflict which they suggest is a possible cause of the limited wifi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't tried resetting&nbsp;the modem yet (there's a tiny slot at the back of mine for this). Did you try that?</p>

</p><p>I have tried driver verifier, but it wouldn't let me go much further, so I had to go into safe mode, disable verifier, and start windows normally. Surely there is some serious driver error somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have problems with PC crashing and restarting itself very often, anywhere from simply browsing the internet to running intensive programs like Sony Vegas.&nbsp;I'm running windows 10 Pro PC 64 bit. My assumption after a whole day of this is that there are problems
 with my RAM sticks&nbsp;which is a 32gb DDR4 Viper&nbsp;kit from Patriot.</p>

<p>MSPoints are region locked but XBL membership is not region locked. If you buy your points though the marketplace then you will get the right points needed for your region. However if you dont, then you will need to buy points which match the region you

    <title>NIC settings are replaced or static IP address settings are lost after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            NIC settings are replaced or static IP address settings are lost after recent Windows 10 Patch</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a support article about the issue we've been having here:&nbsp;https://tinyurl.com/y8ah675e However this is directed at machines running Windows 7 or Server 2008, and the updates for those operating systems. The exact same issue with the exact same fix
 (involving removing hidden network devices from device manager) applies to us, however on Windows 10, not 7 or Server 2008.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the Device Manager &gt; Hidden Files fix may be quick and easy for private users, it most certainly is not when remotely managing hundreds of devices, as the only way we've managed to solve the issue is to instruct the end user verbally on how to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What changes do I need to make to which patches to either prevent this issue from continuing to crop up in the first place or to resolve the issue once it is apparent? Preferably there would be a way to mass deploy a script or patch to all the devices running
 Windows 10 that we support, preventing any further issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi Hunter Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I just would like to know, do you still need assistance with this issue? Because if so, there are a few factors that might hinder you from removing network devices on your computer like permissions placed, settings that needs amendment, or at some cases
 configurations on the system. In order for me to better picture what you experience, I would like to know the following for me to provide you the right steps or refer you to the correct channel:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are the computers you're working on connected to a domain?</li><li>Just to clarify, when you said patch are you pertaining to the cumulative updates?</li><li>When you mentioned scripts, are you pertaining to server scripts that you can use to apply to a server?</li><li>What is the build and version of your <strong>Windows</strong> <strong>10</strong>?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, if your computer is not connected to a domain nor a <strong>Windows Server</strong>, you might want to consider
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware-winpc/how-to-install-and-update-hardware-drivers-in/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">reinstalling your network drivers</a></strong> on a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">new user profile</a></strong> that you can name as test to see if are there any changes. You can also perform a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong> just to ensure that there are no
<strong>3rd party programs</strong> that might be hindering the installation of your drivers. Just don't forget to
<strong>revert the clean boot</strong> <strong>state</strong> after the troubleshooting which is also stated on the article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to me on your thread.</p>

                    My microphone does not work with Skype (Windows 10, Realtek High Definition).<br />
<br />
I have updated the drivers, I have switched automated audio settings on and off, I have checked microphone settings within Skype and on the computer.<br />
I also made sure I have the newest version of Skype.<br />
The microphone works perfectly fine for Facebook's video chat.<br />

Please help, otherwise I will have to switch!

<p>System Restore fails at times because it is unable to deal with the contents of certain folders. Why this happens I do not know. Microsoft recommends that some of these cases can be fixed by renaming the problem folder so that the restore action does not
 need to overwrite it.</p>

<p>I got the same restore error message after renaming VFS.&nbsp; I needed to go through the process again and rename the VFS folder back because it caused many other problems.&nbsp; I wasn't able to open apps (system not configured for app), when I tried to close some
 apps I'd get a debug message, my taskbar icons were blank folders, and other errors too numerous to list. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying to help.</p>

<h2>            Photo and other Window apps not working</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p><span>After I had to add this computer to my Microsoft account in order to reinstall HP Scan I was no longer able to transfer photos from my phone (via cable) to PC.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I did a system restore but it froze and after two + hours of it 'processing' I restarted the computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>(Asus, Windows 10, x64)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, when trying to use or open the Photo app it says:
<em>This app can’t open.<span>&nbsp; </span>Check the Windows store for more info about Photos.
</em>The same applies for the apps: Camera, Feedback Hub, HP Smart, Translator, Video Editor.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Each of those, when looking at them on Powershell<span>&nbsp;
</span>Get-AppxPackage, say that their status is: DependencyIssue whereas those apps that are working say: OK</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On troubleshooter the current result is:</span></p>
<div>

</div>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have done the following with no success:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>- Settings - App troubleshooter – both repair and reset – no change</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>- Reinstalled Windows 10 using Create Windows 10 Installation Media</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>- Since I couldn’t uninstall these apps via troubleshooter I went to Powershell (administrator) to reinstall all apps on this computer as well as:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">‘</span></strong><em><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">sfc
 /scannow’</span></strong></em>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; E<strong><span>verything said it was fine. (but the issue was still unresolved)</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>- Uninstalled Photo app via Powershell Administrator<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><strong><span>Get-AppxPackage *photo* | Remove-AppxPackage</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>- Reinstalled Photo app from Windows Store, however; the app says it is installed and but only on Windows Store.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It does not show up as a working app and remains unable to open (still the same message:
<em>This app can't open..</em>.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have restarted the computer and nothing has changed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Please advise as to how to repair especially the Photo app so that I can transfer photos from my phone (via cable) to my PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your assistance.</span></p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Follow these steps:
<br />
<br />1) launch powershell 
<br />2) Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
<br />3) Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}

<p>Thank you, John. Getting started on that with 2) it asks me:&nbsp;Execution Policy Change<br />
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose<br />
you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic at<br />
https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?<br />
[Y] Yes&nbsp; [A] Yes to All&nbsp; [N] No&nbsp; [L] No to All&nbsp; [S] Suspend&nbsp; [?] Help (default is "N"):</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose I put Y and then after this is solved change it back?&nbsp; to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier I did run something like 3) but without changing the execution policy; perhaps that makes a difference?</p>

<p>ya, being an expert 20 years in business and do about 500 plus pcs and networks a year, i told you how to fix your issue. your operating system is most likely corrupt.

<p>Thank you. I have done as you suggested up to reset pc, and the non-responsive apps are the same. I agree that it sounds corrupted and hope that the reset pc takes care of everything.&nbsp; I had never heard of system image before, but will take note for next
 time.</p>

            If none of the Powershell ways work then at this point I would recommend running a repair upgrade.
<br />This will not wipe your data or applications.
<br />See link by Andre on how do this.

<p>a system image is a MUST.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it is a copy of your drive. if anything happens, you restore the drive back to exactly how it was when you made the image.</p>
<p>I use the one in Windows 10. </p>
<p>Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Backup and Restore (Windows 7)</p>
<p>CREATE A SYSTEM IMAGE</p>
<p>CREATE A REPAIR CD, 1ST TIME ONLY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some people use a 3rd party app for them. But I stand behind windows imaging as it has not failed yet one time on Windows 7, 8 or 10 on hundreds of PC's. Microsoft is pushing people to using 3rd party imaging software. if you use the windows imaging, then
 you also create a repair cd on the first image and use that to access the start up options to restore the drive with your image. an image must be saved on a separate location other than your C;\ System drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>now, you can try and use the upgrade assistant to repair the OS instead of using reset pc</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 reset on a Mac</h2>
                    Hi. I'm currently trying to do a reset on Windows 10 on my Mac mini and I keep getting an error stating that Windows 10 could not reaet die to an error. Which error? Who knows. Anyway I've reset Windows before when I had Windows 8 and 8.1 and never ran
 into this issue any help would be appreciated. I regularly reset Windows every year to keep the machine running smoothly and not let it get bogged down with useless files.&nbsp;

            It's probably happening because Windows 10 wants to delete the entire hard drive. &nbsp;With Mac OS X in there also, windows won't do this as Mac OS X is probably restricting it on doing so because Mac OS X has to stay there otherwise you'd only have Windows
 on your Mac Mini. &nbsp;My suggestion is to reinstall Windows 10 with the CD or somehow find a recovery in Windows 10 to return to a beginning state when you first time installed it. &nbsp;Or there is one more way, buy a service that protects Windows like a virus malware
 remover also could be named by a company as a service that helps your Windows run faster. &nbsp;I know about if you install the CD only up to 5 times and than the key letters numbers in no good anymore.

<h3> juansaol  say:</h3>
<h2>            Explorer crash loop after upgrading to Anniversary, clean boot doesn&#39;t fix anything</h2>
                    <p>So, to make things short; I have the problem described in the article https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-troubleshoot-common-setup-and-stop-errors/324d5a5f-d658-456c-bb82-b1201f735683 named
<strong>"</strong><strong>Blinking or Flashing desktop after log in</strong><strong>"</strong>. However, the instructions provided do not help me fix my problem as I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not have Norton or any other third party antivirus</li><li>Already uninstalled the display driver<br />
</li><li>Also tried the option to disable all services from msconfig.exe<br />
</li></ul>
<p>And yet, none of these options got rid of the issue on normal boot, the system works on safe mode normally, as a bonus, installing the latest video driver for my card from either microsoft or the manufacturer leaves my system unbootable in normal mode, the
 only solution to this is going to safe mode and rever to either the generic display driver or install any driver from before 2016 from the official AMD website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's also this thread I already made on another forum from when my issues started and where I describe the solutions I have been trying, which I link just to give more insight into my situation:</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 x64 - Windows 7 Platform Update will not download</h2>
                    


Hello everybody, 


I had recently built this new PC and I installed Windows 7 Professional x64 on it. It has been validated via the code that was inside of the disc's case. I also own an Elagto HD60 capture card, and when I downloaded the software, it said I needed a Windows Platform Update. The software linked me to a download link for the standalone installer. I ran it, and for the past hour, it's been stuck at "Searching for updates on this computer..." and it's starting to **** me off because I have important things to do with the capture card. If anybody is aware of any sort of fix, please let me know. If any other information is needed, please ask.

<p>Hi kentuckycat,<br />
<br />
1. Restart the computer in safe mode and check if you get the error message.<br />
NOTE: If you do not get the error message, then it confirms that the non Microsoft program is causing the issue.</p>
<p>2. If the non Microsoft program is causing the issue, then perform clean boot i.e. disable the non Microsoft services by following the article:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>3. Restore the computer to an earlier time when it was working fine.</p>
<p>Let me know if this worked.<br />
<br />
All the best!<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards:<br />

A problem caused caused the program to stop working corectly.

<p><span>Hi
<span>stanley262,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Who is your computer manufacturer?
<span>&nbsp;</span>Do you recall making any changes to the computer before this happened?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The issue is related to synaptic touch pad,
</span><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps to narrow down the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong><span>:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Check for any conflicting program that is causing this issue, Put the computer in clean boot and test<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Follow
<strong>Step 1 </strong>in the link below,</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.
</span></p>
<p><span>After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software
 you can consider uninstalling it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> - Remember to put the computer
 back to normal startup <strong>follow step 7</strong> in the link.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists,
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Download and install the latest drivers for your device (touch&nbsp;pad)&nbsp;from
 the computer manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may to check with the computer manufacturer for any known issues.</span></p>

<h2>            Get Blue Screen Bad Pool Caller c2 when switching users on laptop</h2>
                    I have a Win7 laptop that every time I switch users I get the Blue Screen Bad_Pool_Caller c2 error. It started a few weeks ago and have yet to identify the cause.&nbsp; Based on information I've read in this forum and others, it seems like it must be a recent
 driver or update that's making an invalid driver check.&nbsp; I put the files from the most recent error below along with .dmp file!&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Upon switching users I'm greeted with a message like the following:<br />

<h2>            Powercfg &#47;batteryreport issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to run the "powercfg /batteryreport" command on my system (HP Probook 4540s, Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit) but it keeps returning "Invalid Parameters" error. When I issue the command "powercfg /?", the output is cut short so I can only see commands
 that start with 'c' downwards. Now I've tried this also on 3 other systems running windows 7 and got the same error.. But it works fine on windows 8 PC..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be so much appreciated.</p>
                </div>

</p><p>instead of "<em>powercfg /?</em>" do&nbsp; "<em>powercfg /? <strong>&gt;</strong>filename_of_your_choice.txt</em>"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when the command has finished, navigate to the file in explorer and open the file and read it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I cannot see <em>batteryreport</em> in the file. Maybe its a 'W8' parameter? Maybe
