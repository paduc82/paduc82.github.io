<h2>            Parent account troubles &#40;URGENT&#33; PLEASE ANSWER WITHIN 7 DAYS IF POSSIBLE&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>So, I'm having some issues with paren accounts. First and foremost, my family has multiple accounts and none of us can reme which one is my parent account. Is there any way I can see this without logging into the account? Second of all, what happenes if
 a parent account is deleted (not&nbsp;<em>closed</em>, DELETED, as i permanently) will it automatically be removed as the parent account and force my parents to make a new one, or will I be stuck in security limbo, with my deleted parent account still the only
 one linked to my account and leaving me with no way to change my settings? (i would like to avoid logging in to the parent account of at all possible for reasons i can explain if necessary). I would like to hear from an official Xbox support rep. Thanks.</p>

<p>When a child account became orphaned for any reason, you need to contact Xbox support. they'll be able to investigate your request and, if elegible, to re-add an adult account to your child account</p>
<p>Note: In these case, the adult account owner must contact support for this request, not the child, and inform and verify both accounts</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<p>When I click on my digital copy of Far Cry 4 it reads in quotes "do you own this game or app" I purchased this literally last Saturday and now I cant play it. Another post on here shows the same problem&nbsp;I'm&nbsp;not happy at all I&nbsp;paid about 90 for the gold edition
 I would like to know where this issue came from and how long before its fixed.</p>

<p>Same thing with me! I finally have the time to relax and play my game and it doesn't work! I'm really *** about this and they better resolve it quick! As a matter of fact, my Xbox one has many issues, like sometimes it won't sign me in, I can't get a different
 account for my family &nbsp;members.In &nbsp;Xbox 360 it was easy to do so my kids can play the same game I'm playing until I'm done with it. I guess is time to just buy the disc! We better get compensated for this screw up!</p>

<p>This is why so many people were skeptical and suspicious of digital copies vs discs; this garbage is proving them RIGHT!!! On the UBI Forums, the UBI people are telling people to call Xbox Live, and the Xbox Live people are telling them to call UBI; this
 is garbage.</p>
<p>And It shouldn't matter if it's still in the MS Store or not, we bought it, we own it. In the past there have been several titles that were removed from the xbox store for various reasons (the old Defender arcade game on the 360 as an example) but those
 of us that bought them prior were still able to play them and even re-download them, all while they were no longer available in the MS Store.</p>
<p>I hope UBI and MS are looking into this seriously and with a very high priority. Otherwise, give us our money back!!! We apparently bought a product that doesn't work!</p>

<p>If it was resolved, it was in the last 30 friggin seconds, because I tried to play the game that I BOUGHT and I OWN and your stupid friggin' system STILL WON'T LET ME PLAY.</p>
<p>You guys at XBL are the ones that wanted all of us to embrace digital-download gaming. The hard-core disc players said we were crazy to go all-digital. But we did embrace it, and as it turns out, we shouldn't have trusted MS; the disc people were right.</p>

    <title>User Icon distorted at Login Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> atomic axoltol  say:</h3>
<h2>            User Icon distorted at Login Screen</h2>
                    
<p>I've been attempting to have a custom icon for a while now, which is of course a feature that Windows 7 readily provides. However, once I chose the image I want to use, it becomes distorted at the login screen. No matter how clear the image is, or what size
 it's at, it is always distorted at the login screen. I've tried sizes ranging from 150x150 pixels to 350x350 pixels, but all of them failed. My resolution is 1920x1080, but I don't see why that would be the problem. I don't see why I'm having this problem
 on my laptop, since my previous laptop (exact same make, but a lower res screen) could display my icon perfectly clear.<br />
<br />
I would provide a screenshot, but the Print Screen key doesn't work at the login screen.</p>
<p><br />
This isn't an urgent, major problem, but it's distracting and it makes my login screen look unappealing and takes away from the overall sleekness of the design.</p>

<p><span>Hi Atomic Axoltol,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The most common factor for the images to look distorted is the resolution.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It seems like the image that you are using for the user icon is of lower resolution compared to your screen resolution. I would suggest you
 to use an image which has a higher resolution and check if it looks fine. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you mentioned that it worked on your previous laptop then it is because of the lower screen resolution it had. Since this one has a higher
 resolution, you may have to use a high resolution image.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!</span></p>

            Regardless of image resolution, the login screen still distorts the image. I have used images almost 1000x1000 pixels, and it still distorts them.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your query to Microsoft forum. I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it a wired mouse or wireless mouse?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a wireless mouse, check if the batteries are full of charge. Also try replacing the batteries and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try connecting the mouse to different port on the computer and check if the issue still persists. You may also try connecting the mouse to different computer and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also try this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows+P key </strong>on&nbsp;the keyboard.</li><li>Select <strong>PC Screen </strong><strong>only </strong>or <strong>Duplicate</strong></li><li>Then Select <strong>Extended</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Restart </strong>the computer and check. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Try changing the mouse settings which might help you to fix the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change how the mouse pointer works:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open <strong>Mouse Properties </strong>by Pressing&nbsp;<strong>Start </strong>on the keyboard, and type
<strong>Control Panel</strong>. In the search box, type mouse, and then click Mouse.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Click the <strong>Pointer Options </strong>tab, and then do any of the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; •To change the speed at which the mouse pointer moves, under Motion, move the Select a pointer speed slider toward Slow or Fast.<br />
&nbsp; •To make the pointer work more accurately when you're moving the mouse slowly, under Motion, select the Enhance pointer precision check box.<br />
&nbsp; •To speed up the process of selecting a choice when a dialog box appears, under Snap To, select the Automatically move pointer to the default button in a dialog box check box.<br />
&nbsp; •To make the pointer easier to find when you move it, under Visibility, select the Display pointer trails check box, and then move the slider toward Short or Long to decrease or increase the length of the pointer trail.<br />
&nbsp; •To ensure that the pointer doesn't block your view of the text you're typing, under Visibility, select the Hide pointer while typing check box.<br />
&nbsp; •To find a misplaced pointer by pressing the Ctrl key, under Visibility, select the Show location of pointer when I press the Ctrl key check box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer the link to learn more about mouse settings: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/how-connect-multiple-monitors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>This is the screen I get on my Acer Aspire laptop. I have tried some of the suggestions listing in other posts with this error, but I can not get to ANY other screen than this and it only will stay on for 60 seconds. (I timed it). I have tried booting and
 hitting the F11, F12, F8, esc and so on, when the Acer logo first pops up, actually I have started hitting the keys as soon as I hit the power button. It goes to the blue screen in about 15 seconds, will stay on for 60 seconds then shuts down. No where in
 the posts online have I found anyone having this issue with this error. &nbsp;Any help or ideas of how to fix this or if it can be fixed would be greatly appreciated!

            <p>Hi Katper,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the Windows Boot configuration files are corrupt or missing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to rebuild the boot files and check fi it fixes the issue. Follow the methods listed below:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Let’s run Automatic Repair operation to troubleshoot the issue using a Windows 8.1 media.
</p>
<p>To know how to create a media using a different working computer, refer to the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</a>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You will require the product key to create a media. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps to proceed further:</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Before you proceed further, make sure that the boot priority is set to DVD drive (or a USB media depending on the drive that you may have created) under BIOS. Disclaimer:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</p>
<ul>
<li>Insert the Windows 8 installation DVD in the DVD ROM and restart your computer.
</li><li>After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "<strong>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD</strong>". Press any key.
</li><li>Select the correct time and Keyboard type. </li><li>Click <strong>Repair your computer</strong> in the lower left corner.</li><li>Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> from Choose an option screen.</li><li>Click <strong>Advanced options</strong> in <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> screen.</li><li>Click <strong>Automatic Repair</strong> from <strong>Advanced Options</strong> screen.</li><li>Next, choose the operating system.</li></ul>
<p>Check if it fixes the issue. If not, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Follow the steps given below to rebuild the boot files using Bootrec commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "<strong>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD".</strong> Press any key.
</li><li>Select the correct time and Keyboard type. </li><li>Click <strong>Repair your computer</strong> in the lower left corner.</li><li>Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> from Choose an option screen.</li><li>Click <strong>Advanced options</strong> in <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> screen.</li><li>Click on <strong>Command Prompt</strong>.</li><li>Type the following command:</li></ul>
<p><strong>Bootrec /fixmbr</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bootrec /fixboot</strong></p>
<p><strong>bootrec /scanos</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bootrec /rebuildbcd</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please keep us posted. </p>

            Locate a reliable copy of Windows XP ______ Edition (OEM type most likely) that matches the edition you have installed (friend, family member, acquaintance IT person you generally trust.)&nbsp; The CD is not so important (beyond matching the product edition
 and type) as the product key.&nbsp; Make a copy of that CD and keep it safe.&nbsp; You can use&nbsp;that CD&nbsp;to install the operating system at your leisure given you have the product key- which should either be evident on the physical computer itself (on a sticker that would
 even tell you what the edition of WIndows XP is) or you can gleam using Belarc Advisor (free download) and gain the added benefit of having a good list of what is installed, other serial numbers/product keys and a nice list of your hardware components for
 getting drivers later.

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since you are facing startup issues on the computer, perform
<strong><span>Startup repair</span></strong> using a
<strong>Windows ISO image</strong> by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Startup Repair</span></strong><span> is a Windows Recovery tool that can fix certain system problems that might prevent Windows
 from starting. <strong>Startup Repair</strong> scans your computer for the problem and then tries to fix it so your computer can start correctly.
<strong>Startup Repair</strong> is one of the recovery tools in the <strong>System Recovery Options</strong> menu. This set of tools is located on your computer’s hard disk and on the
<strong>Windows Installation disc</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Create a <strong>
Windows 10 Bootable media</strong> (i.e. USB or DVD) using </span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Media Creation Tool</span></strong></a><span><span>&nbsp;to
 repair the PC</span></span><span>.&nbsp;Once you're ready with
<strong>Bootable Media</strong>, follow the below mentioned steps and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Insert&nbsp;the <strong>
Windows&nbsp;installation disc</strong> in the disc drive or connect <strong>USB media</strong> and then start the computer.</span></li><li><span>Press a key when the&nbsp;message
<strong><span>Press any key to boot</span></strong>&nbsp;from CD or DVD appears.<br />
If your PC does not detect the media automatically:</span>
<ol>
<li><span>During the restart process, read the screen for any instructions that explain how to&nbsp;interrupt normal startup and enter the basic input/output system (BIOS)&nbsp;setup utility. Most PCs use the
<strong>F2</strong>, <strong>F10</strong>, <strong>ESC</strong>, or <strong>DEL</strong> key to begin the&nbsp;BIOS Setup.</span></li><li><span>Look for a tab in the&nbsp;<strong>BIOS Setup Utility</strong> that is labeled
<strong><span>Boot&nbsp;Order</span></strong>,
<strong><span>Boot&nbsp;Options</span></strong>, or
<strong><span>Boot</span></strong>. Following the directions on the screen, use the arrow keys to go to the
<strong><span>Boot Order</span></strong> and press
<strong><span>Enter.</span></strong> </span>
</li><li><span>Locate the CD, DVD, or&nbsp;USB flash drive (this might be called
<strong>Removable Device</strong>) in the <strong>Boot list</strong>.&nbsp;Following the directions on the screen, use the arrow keys to move the&nbsp;drive up so that it appears first in the Boot list. Press
<strong><span>Enter</span></strong>. The boot order sequence is&nbsp;now changed to boot from the CD, DVD, or USB flash drive.</span></li><li><span>Press <strong>
F10 </strong>to save your&nbsp;changes and to exit the <strong>BIOS Setup Utility</strong>. Select
<strong><span>Yes</span></strong> in the confirmation window. The PC will
<strong><span>restart</span></strong>. Allow the PC to restart&nbsp;normally. The scan will take a few minutes and remove any malware that&nbsp;may be infecting your computer.</span></li></ol>
</li><li><span>Select a <strong>
language</strong>, <strong>time</strong>, <strong>currency</strong>, <strong>keyboard</strong> or another input method and then click
<strong><span>Next</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>
<span>Repair your computer</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click the operating&nbsp;system that you want to repair and then click
<strong><span>Next</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>On the <strong>
<span>Choose an option</span></strong> screen, select
<strong><span>Troubleshoot</span></strong>.&nbsp;Select
<strong><span>Advanced options</span></strong> from the window&nbsp;and click on

            <p>Open the first document and make sure it is not maximised - you should have one square box left of the red X, topright of screen, place your mouse pointer on the left or right side of the doc so you see the pointer change to an arrow pointing left and right,
 click the left mouse button and hold it down then slide half way across the screen and let go. Then open the second doc and do the same in the opposite direction. You can do the same top to bottom if you wish and in the coloured bar at the top you can click
 - hold down and move around the screen.</p>

<h2>            Remote connection to Windows 10 machine &#40;after upgrade from W8&#41; is terminated instantly</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've upgraded 2 of my home computers to Windows 10. Both were updated from Windows 8.1 via Windows Update. When I try to connect from one PC to another via RDP it's connecting nicely but after a second it's disconnecting because "... another user logged
 in". Of course no one is logging in at the same time to that computer. It was working fine on Windows 8.1. The computer that I'm trying to connect to is using local account and has no password. I tried login with "computername\accountname" or "localaccount\accountname"
 but in both cases it keeps disconnecting instantly. Both PCs are in the same LAN. I also RDPing from my Android smartphone using MS application - no difference, instant disconnect.</p>

            Shamely bumping because it's still an issue for me and no answer was provided. To add some more input I've upgraded another PC to Win 10 (from Win 8.1) and it's the same story as the other one - it connects via RDP and disconnects a second later.

            Thanks for the idea, but it's not the solution I'm looking for. It always worked like that without password. I even changed some setting in gpedit.msc to allow logging in without password but it didn't help. It looks like when I'm logging in via RDP it
 also "relogs" into the same account locally on the computer I'm RDPing to.

<p>It doesn't look like it's available for digital purchase currently. That's actually something that is up to the publisher. If you have questions on that, I recommend reaching out to them (Activision) for possible digital availability.</p>

                    Hi, my utorrent keeps on saying "newer version already running" and won't download anything. Says I need administrator access to uninstall. I downloaded Revo and Windows Fix Now but neither can find utorrent on my system. Fix Now looking for product key
 but don't have that either, I bought my laptop brand new with Windows 8.1 already installed. How can I fix this problem, I am not tech savvy so simple explanations please?

<p>
</p><div>
<p>I&nbsp;am using a Surface with Windows 8.1 RT. I have the same problem that the Weather app is unusable because an error banner covers it saying&nbsp;it should be updated.&nbsp; Then the App Store states that no update is available.</p>
<p>I have followed Michelle Her's&nbsp;advice - uninstalled the Weather app, typed&nbsp;'WSReset.exe' into the search bar, downloaded &amp; run it, to get an error message to say 'this software will not work on your&nbsp;computer'.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now the Weather app is uninstalled (the tile has gone), the App store says that it is 'Installed' and will not replace it.</p>
<p>What next?&nbsp;How do I clear the Windows Store Cache? How replace Msn Weather?</p>

<h2>            Xbox One S Noise When Off </h2>
                    
<p>basically I've had a torrid time with Xbox one consoles I had 5 of the original black consoles before I had one which didnt sound like a bag of nails and now I decided to upgrade to the Xbox One s and after 3 consoles I have found one which sounds half decent
 and not like a bag of nails (I'm very ocd about my consoles so I apologise if you think I'm being too picky) basically my current Xbox one s is on energy saving mode yet when it is off if I put my head to the fan vent on the console I can faintly here sort
 of electrical current or some noise which dissapears once the power cable is removed. I was hoping somebody could tell me it's normal so I can stop fixating on this issue lol or at least advise me on this.</p>
<p>the noise is very quiet and not audible from anywhere other than having my ear to the console&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greatly appreciate all feed back&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks alot</p>
<p>Jordan</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>From the way you describe it I think the noise is probably normal. The console power supply has to maintain power to the console even in energy saver mode so it is able to recognise when you request to switch the console on.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t &#34;save as&#34; a picture or a link in browser under windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I use windows 8.1 on a lenovo laptop. I use windows IE 11 and Chrome (the newest whatever version). This problem appears for both browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I try to save a picture or a link, I right click the object and select "save as", the windows explorer doesn't show up asking me where to save or what to name. the browser just freezes. can't click through things, can't close the browser by clicking
 the upper right corner red "x". </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then right click the browser in the task bar and try to close it. the browser doesn't close, instead, the explorer shows up asking me where to save or what to name, just as normal and i can save picture again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been happening for 1-2 months. googled the issue. Doesn't seem like anybody else have it, which concerns me. Pls let me know the reason/fix. It's really annoying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks!</p>

<ol>
<li>On your Start screen, type <strong>regedit</strong> and run the regedit.exe&nbsp;search result that shows. After this the Registry Editor Program window will open.

<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel </strong>registry key ('folder').&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose the Desktop key below Control Panel.</li><li>There on the right-hand side of the display screen, set and double-click on the
<strong>ForegroundLockTimeout </strong>item.&nbsp; Edit the value to <strong>30d40</strong>. (those are numeral zeros).&nbsp; Then press OK and then shut Registry Editor.
</li><li>Now you need to Reboot your computer so that change you have made take effect.&nbsp;</li></ol>

            <p>That is odd.&nbsp; You might try experimenting with this value. When you edit the value, change it to decimal display with the radio bubble in the box, then try a value such as 1.&nbsp; Unfortunately you have to reboot for the change to be effective, but give it a
 try and see if it helps the dialogs show up.</p>

            <p>if i set it to 1, it actually popped out as normal. but&nbsp;30d40 somehow doesn't work. I don't want to overwrite the default value to random number though. So I did more research and found this</p>

</p><p>see post #2 and point 2. I overwrite the&nbsp;ForegroundFlashCount to 3. It was 7 before. I kept the&nbsp;ForegroundLockTimeout as 30d40 (or 200000 decimal). Now everything seems working.&nbsp;</p>

            That's odd that the Flash Count was the resolution, because that should just determine how many times a waiting program will flash the taskbar button before it just stays "lit up" and orange on the bar.&nbsp; The LockCount is actually how many seconds to wait
 until it allows the waiting window to come to the front.&nbsp; But hey, I can't argue with results, glad it's working for you.

<p>Hey, when ever i am moving a window around and maybe I'm just messing about and i move the mouse fast (shake the window) all other windows current up will minimize. This is simply annoying. We already have a button on the bottom right and "windows + D" for
 this. is there a way to turn it off.</p>

<p>Hi George9012,</p>
<p>This is called Aero shake. In order to disable it you will need to edit the registry. Don't worry I'll explain this step-by-step. Here are the instructions:</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hkey_Current_User\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Create a new key Explorer under Windows key so that the new path would be:
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hkey_Current_User\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>*Note: Create the key by right clicking and selecting "New" and "key". Type in "Explorer".</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Now Select "Explorer" key and in right-side pane, create a new DWORD value</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>"NoWindowMinimizingShortcuts" and set its value to 1</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>*Note: Create the DWORD value by right clicking and selecting new and "DWORD (32 bit) value"</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Restart or log off and back on to disable Aero shake</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>*Remember that regedit is case sensitive and be careful not to alter any other registry settings while in the registry.</span></span></p>

            Hi, I've taken a look at your attached dump file.<br />
<br />
It's a C5: DRIVER_CORRUPTED_EXPOOL bugcheck, which essentially means that a device driver has a bug that attempted to access memory either nonexistent memory or memory it is not allowed to access.<br />
<br />
The faulting driver in the dump is kbdclass.sys which is a general Windows driver, and is likely not the true cause of the crash - but something else drove kbdclass.sys to fault, likely another 3rd party driver that we'll need to enable Driver Verifier to catch.<br />
<br />
First off though, Service Pack 1 is not installed - <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/installwindows7sp1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Find out how to install that here.</a><br />
<br />
<p>Driver Verifier:</p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><b>What is Driver Verifier?</b></p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Driver Verifier is included in Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver by flagging it and causing your system to BSOD.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b></p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" </p>
<br />
<p><b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>3. Check the following boxes -</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Special Pool</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Pool Tracking</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Force IRQL Checking</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Deadlock Detection</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Security Checks (Windows 7)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Concurrentcy Stress Test (Windows 8)</p>
<p><br />

<p>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</p>
<br />
<p>- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for
</p>
<p>example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows
</p>
<p>because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause / force a BSOD.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>If this happens, do [b]not[/b] panic, do the following:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Choose the restore point you created earlier.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get
</p>
<p>back into normal Windows:</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.</p>
<br />
<p>- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.</p>
<br />
<p>- Restart and boot into normal Windows.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b></p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend
</p>
<p>keeping it enabled for at least 36-48 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b></p>
<br />
<p>They will be located in C:\Windows\Minidump</p>
