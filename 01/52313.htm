<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the exact runtime error message you receive?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I tried to verify the compatibility of print shop pro publisher 23 with windows 7 and was unable to find any information about the compatibility.
 Access the link below to check the compatibility with Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=print shop pro publisher 23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=print%20shop%20pro%20publisher%2023</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, you may first try to uninstall the program and try to install in compatibility mode and check if it helps you fix the run time
 error issue. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below and follow the steps to manually change the compatibility settings and install the program in compatibility mode and check
 if it helps. </span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>If the above steps do not work I would suggest you to contact the program manufacturer to verify if they have any updates about the issue and a fix
 for it.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.</span></p>

    <title>Lego Dimensions X360 Achievements Unlocked, But Still Locked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spookcentral  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lego Dimensions X360 Achievements Unlocked, But Still Locked</h2>
                    <p>I have all current 71 achievements for Lego Dimensions on the Xbox 360, and it shows that on my console's game achievements screen, but on the console's main achievements page, it only shows 68 out of 71.&nbsp; The same for xbox.com and other gamertag sites.&nbsp; Lego Dimensions is also not included in the "100% Completed" section on my console.</p>

<p>These three achievements were unlocked on 11/27/2016, but are not counting towards the game's total:</p>

<p>* More Shinier Than A Niffler - Achieve Rulebreaker in any Fantastic Beasts story level.<br />* I Usually Collect Emeralds - Collect any Minikit in the Sonic Dimensions level.<br />* Ring Breaker - Achieve Rulebreaker in the Sonic Dimensions level.</p>

<p>I tried to re-achieve all three, but I can't because to the game, they are already unlocked.&nbsp; I even went so far as to start a new game, and while I did the required actions, it did not help to get them to properly unlock.&nbsp; I should also note that at the time the bug first appeared (on 11/27), I had only completed the first Fantastic Beasts story level and only went halfway through the Sonic level.&nbsp; Since then, I've done the remaining Beasts levels, all with Rulebreaker status, and none popped the achievement properly.&nbsp; I've also completed the Sonic level, but to no avail.</p>

<p>I have taken a bunch of photos to show that all achievements are unlocked on my console, and to show that the three that Xbox.com claims are locked are unlocked on my console.&nbsp; Those photos can be viewed here: <a href="http://tinypic.com/a/axiv84/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://tinypic.com/a/axiv84/2</a></p>

<p>I think someone at Microsoft Xbox support will need to fix this for me.</p>

            <p>Thanks to the crew on the Xbox Support Twitter account, I was able to solve this problem.</p>
<p>I followed the advice they pointed me to here: <a href="http://xbx.lv/achsticky" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbx.lv/achsticky</a></p>
<p>Then I started a new game in save slot #2, played through the opening Wizard of Oz level, then played each of the Sonic and Fantastic Beasts levels until I for Rulebreaker and one minikit.&nbsp; That allowed me to get the three glitched achievements.</p>

Be sure to let them know if you get a survey from them.</p><p><br /></p><p>When it comes to achievement issues, be sure to follow the steps there thoroughly. If they don't help you out, there is a survey at the bottom that we want users to fill out. This is sent to the team that investigates issues with achievements in a bigger picture. While it won't resolve your individual achievement issues, we will reach out if we know how to resolve your issue. :) The downside is that these are the only steps we are able to provide for achievement issues.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you have any other support issues, be sure to post up a new detailed thread so that our community can work on helping you out.

    <title>Computer screen goes black or white and freezes when watching movies - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> esbwn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer screen goes black or white and freezes when watching movies from HDD&#59; also while listening to mp3&#39;s.</h2>
                    Hello All! Thanks for looking and the help. I upgraded from Vista to 7 32bit a week ago. I have a acer aspire x1300 with the geforce 8200 video card hooked up through HDMI to my 47" LCD TV. We use it as our home entertainment pc. Everything works great
 until we open up a movie to play or try to listen to our music collection. It doesn't freeze right away. It might get the first five mins of the movie or it could be 3/4's of the way done. It doesnt matter which movies it is either. While listening to our
 music collection it will also freeze up.<br />
All of our movies are .avi and music is .mp3. I have tried Windows Media Player, Xvid player, Winamp; everyone freezes.<br />
I thought it was my video card because I never get the blue screen of death or error notices from windows. To try to fix this I installed the latest drivers from Nvidia.com for the card and nforce. Plus every windows update that there is. It didnt help.
<br />
I dont want to go back to Vista because I like 7, but the whole purpose of this computer is a media pc. I need it to work. Here are the specs to my pc:<br />
<br />
Acer Aspire X1300<br />
AMD Athlon X2 7450 / 2.4 GHz <br />
3 GB Ram<br />
1 x 320 GB - standard - Serial ATA-300&nbsp; Hard Drive<br />
NVIDIA GeForce 8200 <br />
220 Watt&nbsp; Power Supply<br />

<span><span>Hi esbwn,</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>I would suggest you to download and install the latest drivers for HDMI and check.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>If updating your driver software doesn't solve the problem, try reducing (or turning off) video hardware acceleration by doing the following.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Screen Resolution by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>, and then, under
<strong>Appearance and Personalization</strong>, clicking <strong>Adjust screen resolution</strong>.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Advanced Settings</strong>, click the <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> tab, and then click
<strong>Change settings</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Note that some video card drivers do not permit you to change settings.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Move the
<strong>Hardware acceleration</strong> slider toward <strong>None</strong> to reduce or turn off video hardware acceleration.</span></span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Not Able to Close a Skype Account. Unable to reach Skype Support.</h2>
                    <p>I have two Skype accounts, account A1 and account A2. I had thought that I closed account A1 a year and a half ago... Anyways, I tried the closure link in the suggested help, however I was prompted to merge account A1 with my Microsoft account, which I can't
 because my other Skype account, account A2 is already merged with it. I also am unable to reach any Skype support other than it directing me to the Skype Community forum. I was unsuccessful at getting any help from Microsoft and very disappointed that I cannot
 just email my problem to or chat with someone and have them close account A1 for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f1d14279-1b8f-40df-9143-558c5d8528e5" title="BreezySavage">
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the migration of Skype to Microsoft, we are required to merge the Skype account we&nbsp;want to delete&nbsp;to a Microsoft email before we can proceed closing it. But that doesn't mean that you have to merge the Skype account to a working email address of yours.
</p>
<p>You can create a <a href="https://signup.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
dummy email address</a> in this case. So that when you will be asked by the Microsoft page to link your Skype account to an email, you can choose the option to "<strong>use another email instead</strong>", and type the dummy email you created just to delete
 the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the link for the steps on how you can close your Skype account: <strong>

<h2>            How can I print out a list of my albums from WMP</h2>
                    How can I print a list of my albums from Windows Media Player. Whilst I understand that WMP will not do this directly (as iTunes does or did), reading various posts I understand this should be possible. But I cannot find a recent post giving instructions,
 and the links I have clicked in earlier posts no longer seem to work.

            Hi!<br />
<br />
This is a way to print a playlist:<br />
Open Notepad.<br />
Open Windows Media Player and right-click your saved play list. Choose Open Path.&nbsp; In the new Window left-click your saved play list and drag it into the open notepad-window.<br />

<h3> zackwa  say:</h3>
<h2>            The number keypad on my Microsoft Comfort Curve 2000 keyboard will not after I sign in as administrator for Windows 7. </h2>
                    
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Question:</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>When I sign in as the account user (and I am the administrator) the number pad works entering part of my password.&nbsp; After getting to the desktop and in programs where I can enter a number the numberpad doesn't work.&nbsp; Num Lock is ON.&nbsp; The numbers at the
 top of the keyboard work okay.&nbsp; I have loaded the latest driver.<br />
<br />
What now?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; Answer:</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>Hi ZackWA,<br />
<br />
As you have already updated the latest driver for your keyboard, now you may use hardware and device troubleshooter and check if you come across the same problem.<br />
<br />
Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Hardware and Sound, click Configure a device. If you're prompted for an
 administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
For more information on hardware and device troubleshooter, you may visit the link mentioned below:<br />

<br />
<br />
I would also suggest you to update the driver for the again and check if the issue still persists.<br />

            I printed out your instructions and went through them one by one...<br />
The onscreen keyboard options box did NOT have the Numeric Keypad checked.&nbsp; So I checked and then used the onscreen keyboard number pad (with the calculator) and it was fine.&nbsp; BUT the number pad on my actual keyboard did NOT work...in the calculator or any
 other&nbsp;program that I could enter numbers.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I did the computer start in Safe Mode and the number keypad still did not work.<br />
<br />
I did the System File Checker and it went to 100% and reported no problems found.<br />
<br />
I can't use the restore point service because the most original restore point is when I loaded Windows &amp; and since that time the number pad on my keyboard did not work.<br />
<br />
So I am back to the problem:&nbsp; My number pad works when I log in my administrator password (because there are some numbers in the password) but after the welcome screen and log on the number pad doesn't work.<br />
<br />
This is VERY frustrating as I use my number pad alot!

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you unplug the keyboard from the computer and plug it back.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are using an USB keyboard, then try connecting the keyboard into different USB ports and check if it helps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If this does not help, then try connecting the different keyboard to the computer and check if the same issue occurs with the other keyboard.<br />

            Thank you for those suggestions, however, as I pointed out in the original post I have tried switching USB ports for the Microsoft 2000 Curve Comfort keyboard and I have tried a generic HP PS/2 plug keyboard and the problems remained.<br />
<br />
I will try the other links...<br />
<br />
Okay the software drivers offered are already currently installed.<br />
There is NO F-Lock key to toggle on/off, no light for it either...Doing the mskey diagnostic SHOWS:<br />
The F-Lock key is "unknown" and<br />
That the number keys do NOT work when NUM LOCK is pressed.&nbsp; They DO work when the NUM LOCK is off.&nbsp; All other keys light up in the box and show they were press in both windows.<br />
<br />
Just to add another thing...the Left hand Microsoft Start key also didn't work but&nbsp;after restoring the DEFAULT for the keyboard it does.&nbsp; I MUST SAY AGAIN THAT THE NUMBER KEYPAD ON THE KEY BOARD DOES NOT WORK WHEN THE
ON</span>, EVEN AFTER RESTORING DEFAULTS.

            Hi ZackWA,<br />
<br />
I apologize if you've already mentioned this, and i missed it but, have you checked to make sure there isn't a hardware issue with your keyboard?<br />
<br />
If you hook it up to another computer, does the same issue happen?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Also, is the cable in the back secure?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Finally, what has changed&nbsp;since the last time the keyboard worked correctly?<br />
<br />
Please let us know, thanks!

<p>4.&nbsp;Accessibility&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Accessibility Center</p>
<p>6. Find the ease of use of keyboard</p>
<p>7. Under control mouse with keyboard uncheck "activate mouse keys"</p>
<p>8. Restart!</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

    <title>Duplicate screen off center - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sethstephenson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duplicate screen off center</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I updated my laptop to Windows 10, and because my laptop's screen is cracked and hard to see, I have been duplicating the display on to my TV by a 15 pin video cable. The problem is that on my laptop, the display is fine, but on the TV, however,
 everything has been&nbsp;shifted a few centimeters to the left&nbsp;which hides a few folders and stuff on the left and leaves a pointless space that I cant put my cursor over on the right.
</p>
<p>I don't know if I have the wrong resolution or something, but I would like it if somebody could tell me a way to fix it. This problem is irritating when it comes to trying to relax and play pc games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Seth.</p>

            <p>Hi Seth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you face issue with the resolution, we should check what is the resolution set for the 2nd monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try to press Win + P and then select second screen only to check if you get the desired resolution.</p>

    <title>KB4038788 Crashes P3D Programs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tedklemm  say:</h3>
<h2>            KB4038788 Crashes P3D Programs</h2>
                    <p>I am running Lockheed Martin P3D v2. One of the add-ons crashes every time it loads. I uninstall KB4038788 and it works fine. The problem is KB4038788 keeps mindlessly and forcibly reinstalling itself. Windows 10 is the most invasive operating system in
 Windows history. The user who paid for and owns the software is prevented from turning anything off. The updates are forcibly installed with no System Administrator permission needed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My programs worked fine before this most recent Windows update. It is not my installed programs that need to be fixed. It's the Microsoft Updates that have bugs. My question is: When are you going to either fix the bugs in this update or just eliminate it?

<p>Hi Ted,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates are important to make sure that your device is always kept up to date with the latest features and fixes. In rare cases, a specific update might temporarily cause issues with your device or programs.

            It did not help in the slightest bit, The offending update KB4038788 does not even appear in the Hide Update app. I need to delete this update forever and prevent it from ever installing itself again. I really couldn't care less about Microsoft's need
 to forcibly and without permission, install updates. Microsoft evidently thinks that we are too stupid to keep our systems running correctly. This update is crashing a program that I have a lot of money invested in and I am not about to let this situation
 go unresolved, even if takes legal litigation.

            In previous Windows versions we had a choice if we wished to install any specific updates. &nbsp;Why isnt this still available? &nbsp;Obviously MS doesnt work well with some program developers and vice versa so it appears each merrily carry on at the expense of
 users. &nbsp;In this case, the problem update and program (P3D) have been identifed fully, so why cant users turn off this update once and for all? &nbsp;Giving users work-arounds that work only temporarily is a frustrating experience that turns people off both the
 system (windows) amd program (p3d). &nbsp;Maybe time for Xplane on my mac.

            This issue has not yet been resolved. This is totally unacceptable. Microsoft MUST either resolve this issues or provide an app that allows users to block forever the security updates that act like viruses,&nbsp; taking over our expensive programs and keep
 reinstalling themselves without user permission. Despite Microsoft's propaganda touting Windows 10 as the ultimate operating system, it has actually become the most compelling reason to switch to a Mac.

    <title>Do you think micro transactions will end&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thelungz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do you think micro transactions will end&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Growing up on the original xbox and other consoles i had the pleasure of purchasing a game and getting the whole thing. Skins and weapons were gained through a good graft in the game and games were more about self satisfaction rather than having a better
 aesthetic look than your buddy!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree for dlc’s and the extra free item if you buy a premium edition of a game but when you need to pay for in game currency there really becomes a reluctance to even play that anymore. I tend to be principled in that respect and i see it as business sense
 only. Do fellow gamers feel the same? Am i wrong or shortsighted? Would love some opinionated feedback :)&nbsp;</p>

            I think the fact that game studios still use an means they are still a viable source of income for them, so despite all the apparent dislike for them, folks are still buying them, so they are not likely to go anywhere, and as a lot of games transition
 into more of a long term "service" then we are going to see more of it rather than less, which is a shame

            I doubt it, but I think we would all like to go back to a time where we paid £40-50 for a new game and you got the whole package with no further costs or in game transactions.

            Microtransactions is basically the life blood of almost all video games, it is a marketing strategy that is highly effective to continue to milk the consumer every which way. This is a double edged sword the more you think about it, developers and creators
 who continue to contribute towards the game by adding skins, maps, and items need to be compensated for their work so adding microtransactions would help to repay them in a sense. I could be wrong and the profits could be towards something completely different
 but for as long as you have the majority of consumers continuing to purchase DLC, there is no stopping it. As long as you are getting a fair deal and a worthwhile cosmetic, I am not opposed to it but if its expensive for no reason just to be recolored later
 in the future, that is unforgivable. On top of that, when Capcom released the "All content unlock" DLC that just ruins the way gamers can accomplish their goals. That is the very definition of paying to win.&nbsp;

            I think that they will not end however because of the public criticism and court cases, they will get less intrusive and less pay to win. We might see changes in games that are rated for kids and teens due to government regulation. I agree with you, I
 would love microtransactions to be gone, expansions, extra missions or maps or cosmetic packs that give you the exact item you buy (e.g Black Ops 2 Camp Packs) are the right way to make money off games. change is starting to happen tho. Belgium already banned
 loot boxes as they are gambling so under 18s games like Fifa and Overwatch actually removed them. Even tho I'm not too happy with the government regulating the gaming market, it is our only hope of defeating microtransactions

    <title>Install network printers for non domain clients - windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dale28  say:</h3>
<h2>            Install network printers for non domain clients - windows 7</h2>
                    <p>hi guys</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>need some help/pointers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we have undergone a major network upgrade in which we have lost our DC's and print server (now managed offsite, we have&nbsp;a local RODC, with no access) A print server has been provided which allows clients to connect and access various shared printers. Using
 win 7 non domain connected machines, we can browse the UNC path: 
\\server1\printername in which the user is prompted to provide their credentials. Once authenicated, printer is connected and can be used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because we are in the situation where we now have over 300 non domain connected netbooks, running windows 7 pro, we have had to write our own scripts (vbs) to connect users home drive, shared drive, set internet settings (proxy etc) and then map network
 drives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All tested was carried out on a machine that various print drivers installed (checked through print management --&gt; all drivers) the script is then run inwhich the user provides their logon account, password and so on. Drives are mapped and printer connections
 are est. When we moved the script to another machine, used the same test user and ran the script, the printers did not get mapped. We checked the the print management driver location and the printers where not listed. We have checked random machines and some
 have the drivers and others dont. Basically we dont want to manually install 10 printers for over 300 devices... Hence the reason for the logon script.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub&nbsp;that i am using is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sub sbMapPrinter(strLogonName, strPassword, strPrinterDomain, arrPrinterList, strDomainName)<br />
    'On Error Resume next<br />
    Dim i<br />
    Set objNetwork = CreateObject("WScript.Network")<br />
    WScript.Echo "Please wait...Connecting printers. Once connected you will be informed. Process can take up to 1 minute to complete. Click OK to cont."<br />

    <title>WMP12 Play to not working with multiple active network adapters - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            WMP12 Play to not working with multiple active network adapters</h2>
                    Trying to use the Play-To Feature of WMP 12, to stream content to a WDTV.<br />
<br />
I have more then one active Network-Adapter in my system, beside the normal Wireless Network Adapter, i have two virtual network adapters from an installed VMWare Player (VMWare Network Adapter VMNet1 and ...VMNet8).
<br />
IP of my computer in the normal network: 192.168.178.28, IP of WDTV: 192.168.178.38, Netmask: 255.255.255.0<br />
IP of VMNet1: 192.168.254.1<br />
<br />
When using Play-To Windows 7 communicates normal with the device, and sets up correctly the DLNA callback-urls for the event-notifications with the correct IP. Howewer when streaming starts, it communicates to the device the wrong IP adress.<br />
<br />
Please see this Network-Sniffs:<br />

<br />
Look at the bold marked part. WMP 12 is telling the WDTV the location to fetch the content from, but this is the wrong IP, it's the IP of the virtual network adapter from the VMWare Player, not the Networks Adapters IP over which the normal TCP communication
 between my computer and the DLNA-DMR goes and which would be the network both my computer and the WDTV resides. This should be the IP 192.168.178.28.<br />
<br />
If i deactivate both virtual network adapters from VMWare, 'Play-To' works fine. <br />
<br />
So this is a bug in WMP12, how can i get around it, without having to deactivate both virtual network adapters?<br />
<br />
How is the right way to file a bug report to microsoft?<br />

            <div>Hi Karthik,</div>
<div><br />
The keyboard in built into the notebook computer, a Toshiba Satellite P50t-A.
<div><br />
<div>I'm pretty sure if it's happened when I've had an external keyboard plugged in (wirelesss keyboard) and typed my password on the external keyboard. &nbsp;<br />
<div><br />
<div>Once logged in the keys map to the correct characters (the @ key gives and @ character etc....).</div>
<div><br />
<div>My guess is that some sort of keyboard related service is slow to start so key mappings are incorrect just after the PC is powered up, maybe related to the Touch Keyboard? &nbsp;Its a touch-enabled notebook.</div>

            It happens on the internal keyboard on the laptop. &nbsp; It also happens on an external keyboard. &nbsp; All drivers are up to date. &nbsp; Didn't happen for over a month but just happened again. &nbsp;I guess using an @ in a password is just to hard for Windows. &nbsp;Next time
 I change I'll use some other character. &nbsp;

            I figured out what is going on but not why. &nbsp;Sometimes when Windows 8.1 starts it thinks I want a UK keyboard layout just for the login so keys are mapped different. &nbsp; When I've logged in then the usual US keyboard layout is in place. &nbsp;On the login screen
 there's a language/keyboard selection on these occasions that allows me to select a US keyboard layout. &nbsp;Why would Windows give me a different keyboard layout just for the login screen on just the odd occasion? &nbsp;Was there a practical joker working at Microsoft
 that put this in? &nbsp;Or is it just a bug?

<h2>            How to disable a dragged window to transparent&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Recently I installed a third monitor and I was configuring it.&nbsp; All of sudden, I found that when I drag a window, it becomes so transparent that I couldn't see where it is.&nbsp; So I want to see the window with the same transparency no matter it is being moved
 or stationary, which is not much transparet.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do know that you can adjust the transparency for window that is not moving.&nbsp; I am just talking about the window being dragged.&nbsp; How do I achieve my goal? Thanks.</p>

            The behavior you describe is a feature of nVidia's driver and control programs. &nbsp;Inside your Control Panel you should have an nVidia option -- go into there to disable the transparent windows while dragging option. &nbsp;

<h2>            Win 8.1 install on 64 bit new machine via USB - need 32-bit iso</h2>
                    In the process of upgrading PC's for 64 bit support. &nbsp;I have purchased most of the components &amp; have the PC ready for it's initial loading of Win 8.1, however, there is no DVD reader presently installed. &nbsp;I want to install the OS via USB. &nbsp;All of my existing
 PC's are running on XP SP3 current with all updates &amp; patches.
<div><br />
<div>So far this is what I have accomplished:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; Installed Win 8.1 32 bit trial on a virtual machine to determine if it was as bad as the press it receives. &nbsp;Concluded it was not as bad as the press it receives &nbsp; and purchased Win 8.1 Pro 64 bit OEM for new PC build.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; After downloading and installing all the SW to prepare the USB, creating an iso image of the DVD, I started the creation process.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; I receive the message '............ unable to run bootsect ............'. &nbsp;I created a MS account during the trial of 8.1. &nbsp;When looking at my MS account, it shows I &nbsp; have no purchase history (true).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; How do I get the 32-bit. iso, so I can complete the process of loading new with the Win 8.1 operating system?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; Thank you for your cooperation.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somehow I don't understand exactly what you are trying to do...</p>
<p>You are asking about a 32 bit ISO at the same time you mention a 64 bit disk and disk image...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are not interchangeable... Did you get the bootsect error while trying to create the bootable&nbsp; 64 bit USB ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the 32 bit for the old XP machines, and the 64 bit for the newest one, or am I missing something?</p>

            Perhaps I did not makes myself clear with what I was trying to accomplish or what I was trying to find.
<div><br />
<div>I need to obtain a file from the Windows Store entitled '32-bit.iso' &nbsp;All the other stuff was there to explain why I needed it. &nbsp;The instructions on the Microsoft site indicate I should go to their store and download it. &nbsp;Specifically, they say to look
 at your purchase history and you should be able to find it. &nbsp;Well I don't have any purchase history with the Microsoft store, only an account. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>While I appreciate your help, it appears you were trying to assist me in resolving an issue which did not exist. the only question I really needed a response to was; "how do i get the '32-bit.iso' file which is the Microsoft solution to the error I received".
 &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The following provides more information which should answer your questions when you responded to my question as to why I bought a 64 bit version when the trial was on a 32 bit machine.<br />
<div><br />
<div>I have built a new 64 bit PC to replace an existing PC. &nbsp;The motherboard in this new machine is 64 bit architecture. &nbsp;It does not have a DVD reader...... At this point the build is not finished but, I am, far enough along to load the operating system.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The only working PC's I have access to are 32 bit machines. &nbsp;I downloaded and installed the software outlined in &nbsp;<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windows-8/a/install-windows-8-usb.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windows-8/a/install-windows-8-usb.htm</a>&nbsp;and
 started the creation of the bootable USB drive on a 32 bit PC. &nbsp;At the end of the of the creation process (writing to the USB device) I received the message regarding not being able to run bootsect. &nbsp;Information on the pcsupport section outlines the way to
 correct this. &nbsp;Specifically, I need to download the file with the name '32-bit.iso' from Windows Store and copy over a file. &nbsp;This is a known issue when trying to create a bootable USB disk when trying to do it with a 32 bit machine. &nbsp;That's why I need the
 file which has a name of '32-bit.iso'.</div>

            There is no file which has a name of '32-bit.iso'.
<div><br />
<div>The reference is to the bit version of the Windows 7 DVD, and what your computer is telling you is that it can't handle the data on your 64-bit Windows 7 DVD, and that you should use a 32-bit Windows DVD to complete the task.&nbsp;If you do that, you will end
 up with a 32-bit system.. </div>
<div><br />
<div>Two options.. </div>
<div><br />
<div>Option 1.. buy a DVD drive for your new computer. They are cheap enough.. </div>
<div><br />
<div>Option 2.. create the bootable USB installation media on a 64-bit computer of a family member or friend</div>

<div>Option 1... &nbsp;I have a DVD drive on order or I could have removed one from one of &nbsp;my existing PC's. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That is not what I chose to do as the URL listed below indicates what I am attempting to do &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;is doable.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Option 2.. &nbsp; That is certainly a viable alternative. &nbsp;Did not pursue that for the same reason as indicated &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;above.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Option 3.. &nbsp; Pursue the solution outline in 2009 &nbsp;posted here where it outlines how to accomplish what I &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;am attempting to do.</div>

<div><br />
<div>By the way, this reply was posted by a Microsoft support engineer and it makes reference to the file in question. &nbsp;As is frequently the case, not everyone is on the same page when asking or answering a question. &nbsp;I do believe he would have stated it could
 not be done if that was indeed the case.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am now suspecting he is telling the person to get the 32 bit version of the OS and is referring to it as '32-bit.iso) &nbsp;Again not stated as such in the response and I have no purchase history with the store any way. &nbsp;I now assume the '32-bit.iso' file
 contains the refers to the OS 32 bit version and the bootsect.exe container therein.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please understand I'm not trying to be difficult, Microsoft seems to indicate what I want to do can be accomplished. &nbsp;I want to try creating the bootable USB 64 bit OS drive with a 32 bit machine as it appears it can be done..</div>
<div><br />
<div>Other threads in <i>'WWW land' </i>seem to suggest you do not need to use the Microsoft tools to accomplish the same thing. &nbsp;While researching this issue, it was gratifying to know I was not the only one trying to accomplish the same thing. &nbsp;I just elected
 to try the Microsoft solution 1st.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If any one who has accomplished what I am trying to do, please let me know how you accomplished it.</div>
<div>I will continue to pursue a solution &amp; should I arrive at one......... I will post it here.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've never done this on a 32 bit machine, so I'm a bit in the dark...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found a link where you can download the bootsect for Win 7 32 bit, but I don't actually know if that will work... I would think so, but that's just a guess...</p>

            <p>I've read the thread a few times and I'm still unclear why you are looking for 32bit media when you are building&nbsp;a PC with a 64bit OS.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, I've reimaged many a device using&nbsp;a USB drive. So, either grab your DVD or your ISO file and head on over to a working PC.</p>
<p><br />

tool</a>). I've found the tool to be self explanatory.</li><li>Build the media</li><li>Take to your new PC and give it a test. Make certain you are either booting from removable media first or you are using the boot select menu.</li></ol>
<p>I've never run in to issues using that tool for Win8 media. But I have to say I have not built the media on an XP machine before. It's always been either Win7 or newer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I applaud your willingness to learn, but trial and error is the best tool as well as forums. Hopefully this helps and you're able to build your PC before your DVD drive arrives.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing I thought I should mention that you may or may not be aware of is the file format of the USB drive...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are planning on using a UEFI BIOS feature on your new machine, the USB requires a FAT32 format to be read by the UEFI setup...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The USB tool will create a NTFS format... this is OK for regular install, but won't work for UEFI...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've not done this, but have come across this little detail recently... just a heads up.</p>

            To Zeke009, 


Been there done that with the link you provided.  At step # 4,  I get the message about the bootsect file. Following that thread for a solution; I'm think the solution is to get the bootsect.exe off a 32 bit OS and copy it over to the flash drive.  This is the solution provided in all the threads I've seen so far. Don't know this will work for sure, I just down loaded the file from the link provided by slance 310 and will be trying it shortly.  Like you said trial and error and the forums. 



To slance310, 


Thanks for the heads up on UEFI and the link to the 32 bit version of the bootsect.exe.  I recall reading something about that while trying to resolve my 1st issue.  I will go back and read it again.  I want to understand the significance  and will try and understand it prior to proceeding. 



To all others reading this post and for what it's worth..............  I am one of those XP hold outs.  Within the last few weeks I came to the realization that Microsoft is really goin
