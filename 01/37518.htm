<h2>            How do I remove an optional driver optional update.</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed an optional driver update from Microsoft, Realtek-Network-RealtekRTL8168/8111b PC1-E-Gigabit Ethernet NIC (NDIS6.0). Having done this I now cannot access&nbsp;the internet. I have tried to restore to an earlier time, but tells me it was unsuccessful,
 what can I do?&nbsp; Any help you can give on this?</p>

Where you grab the Taskbar to move it can make a difference. Try grabbing it near the clock&nbsp;or System Tray.<br />

    <title>Attempts to get into the System Protection menu of System Properties - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertforrest1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Attempts to get into the System Protection menu of System Properties fails.</h2>
                    <p>When I go into "system properties", "system protection" to create a restore point all the options are greyed out, none of the restore points I've created are listed and the following error message is displayed:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 90px">There was an unexpected error in the property page:</p>

 menu (e.g., "Computer Name", "Hardware", etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 2nd error message seems pretty straight forward as being the ramification of the 1st error message.&nbsp; What I'm lost with is how to analyze and resolve the reason for the 1st error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had been successfully creating "restore points" ever since first installing this instance of Windows 10 (1 year+).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel that being able to create and use restore points when needed is an important function so I'd be grateful for some advice on how to fix this.</p>
<p>

            How much storage space do you have?
<br />Go to file explorer and see.
<br />
<br />For now this maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

            I haven't been able to find a good answer for this error. It is not likely a RAM or HD space issue. It is more likely a hard coded limit in a variable. Often related to path length limits of 256 char.
<br />
<br />On the off chance it is a RAM issue, have you tried restarting the computer since encountering the problem, and retrying the process.

<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your space question I have a single SSD; 99GB&nbsp; used, 155GB free, 254GB total
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried your 1st suggestion of running sfc /scannow and rebooting, but I'm still failing as initially described.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The CBS log has a high number of error messages which are all "<span>Duplicate ownership for directory",
</span>for various directories.&nbsp; It also has 4 sets of 3 failed messages which are "failed to internally open package", failed to create open package" and "failed OpenPackage".
</p>
<p>I'm concerned with trying your 2nd idea because of the "Important" message you added to the instructions for your 2nd idea:<span>;
 "</span>When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I'm concerned, my shed some light on the real issue.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>When my system installed the March 2018 cumulative update the subsequent reboot failed dropping into attempts to recover which also failed.&nbsp; After 2 failed reboots and failed recoveries&nbsp; I was able to get into the advanced options where I used a restore
 point that was created just prior to the March update.&nbsp; The restore worked, but my 2nd attempt at the March updated failed the same way.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are more than a few discussions about both the March and February cumulative updates causing people a verity of issues.&nbsp; I tried many of the suggested fixes and work-arounds each time needing to us my restore point to recover and then retry.&nbsp; On my
 last try at fixing my March update issues, my recovery point was no longer there to be used leaving me stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Acronis True Image 2018 to manage full and incremental backups.&nbsp; Before restoring my system to it's last backup, I physically disabled the network adapter on my system.&nbsp; After restoring it, I suspended Windows updates (which is how I'm running now)
 and then subsequently re-enabled my NIC in the hope that the April cumulative upgrade my offer some resolution to my update problem.</p>
<br />
<p>I'm worried that in order to have DISM run correctly, I'll need to re-enable Windows update which would lead to installing the March cumulative update which is where all this started; be it directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry for all the words, but the repeated failure of the update leading to the inability to boot up and the subsequent use of the restore point to recover seemed to lead to the reason I now can't use the "create restore point" function at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am willing to clone my HD to cover a complete system loss before trying your 2nd idea, above.&nbsp; I just wanted a chance to get your take on what I've said here in this reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!&nbsp; </p>

            Hi Robert:
<br />(the way this forum is setup, sometimes we don't see conversations with other repliers, I hadn't seen Sarah's thread with you)
<br />
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />I'm worried that in order to have DISM run correctly, I'll need to re-enable Windows update which would lead to installing the March cumulative update which is where all this started; be it directly or indirectly.
<br />&lt;/snip&gt;
<br />To the best of my knowledge, DISM does not use Windows Update. It does use images stored on the drive to recover files from  You should be able to turn off (unplug) your internet connection while running it, to prevent the update from being applied. 
<br />
<br />You can use the process in this page to delete pending updates to ensure they don't get applied until you rerun Update:

<p>
</p><p>As for not seeing Sarah's reply to me, I hope I'm not breaking any rules by repeating this, but this was Sarah's initial reply:</p>

Go to file explorer and see. <br />
<br />
For now this maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt. <br />
You can try a couple things. <br />
<br />
Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter. <br />
Restart the computer. <br />
<br />
If that doesn't work then try this, <br />
<br />
Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />
In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. <br />
Press Enter key after each command: <br />
<br />
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth <br />
<br />
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth <br />
<br />
<strong>Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.</strong>
<br />
To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter.
<br />
Restart your computer. </p>

            No, you are not breaking any rules. It is simply the way this part of the forum is setup that we have no indication when there is a side coversation going on. But we can see it by making an extra effort. We simply have no indication when to do that.

<br />Ron is correct in assuming that DISM does not require updates to be on.

<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No need to be sorry, I'm grateful for whatever time and help you can afford me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up running the scanhealth and restorehealth cmds three times.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p>The first time scanhealth said ‚ÄúThe component store is repairable.‚Äù, but the restorehealth failed:
</p>
<p>[==========================100.0%==========================] The component store is repairable.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>[===========================84.5%=================&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ]<br />
Error: 0x800f0950<br />
DISM failed. No operation was performed.‚Äù</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebooted anyway and tried opening the ‚Äúrestore point‚Äù window which failed as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second time I ran both commands.&nbsp; Scanhealth said ‚ÄúThe component store is repairable‚Äù and restorehealth was successful:</p>
<p>[==========================100.0%==========================] The component store is repairable.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>[==========================100.0%==========================] The restore operation completed successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebooted, but ‚Äúrestore point‚Äù again failed as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a third time.<span>&nbsp; </span>Scanhealth completed saying nothing is corrupted:</p>
<p>[==========================100.0%==========================] No component store corruption detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So although there were one or more things corrupted which were apparently fixed, regarding my create restore point problem, I‚Äôm back to square-1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I‚Äôm hoping that you and/or<span>&nbsp; </span>Rohn might still have a few tricks up your collective sleeves.</p>

            OK 2 choices. Links provided to either one.
<br />
<br />Option 1 - Run the repair upgrade and that will reinstall windows right over top your existing windows without wiping anything.  So less extreme but not 100% will work.

<br />Option 2 - Do a clean installation which will require you to back evrything up and reinstall your apps.  More extreme but will 99% work

    <title>Windows Update Configuration stuck on 61&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charliedan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update Configuration stuck on 61&#37;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,<br />
<br />
I've just purchased a new Windows 7 machine, and after a few days it downloaded some Windows Updates, as I've seen commonly with my old Vista machine.<br />
<br />
It installed the updates on shut down, but now on restart it has stopped at 61%. It has been stuck there for over 2 hours now. Every now and again the hard-drive does whirl into action, for ten seconds or so, but other than that nothing it happening.<br />
<br />
I'm reluctant to force a shut-down on the machine with the message "Do not turn off your computer" written across the screen - the last thing I want to do is corrupt Windows and force a reset to factory settings as I'd lose everything I'd imported from my old
 PC.<br />
<br />
Any advice is gratefully received!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Charlie</p>

<p><span>Hi Charlie,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You can try booting into Safe Mode and see if you face the same problem there.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To boot to Safe Mode you can follow the below given steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Do one of the following:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>a. If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to<span>&nbsp;
</span>try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b. If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow<span>&nbsp;

<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If you are not able to boot in Safe Mode try booting from the Windows 7 DVD and perform a Startup repair.</span></span></p>

<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Boot from the Installation DVD.</span></span></p>

            <p>Do you mean error 0x80244<strong><u>0</u></strong>19? This is normally caused (in conventional Windows installations) by not being at SP3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Verify your current service pack level...</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Hold down the Windows key (between Ctrl and Alt) and hit the Pause Break key</span>
</li><li><span>Examine what is listed in the System: section regarding your service pack level</span>
</li><li><span>Also, make a note of your processor type in the Computer: section (see later)</span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>If there is no service pack level designated, first you must download SP2 from...</span></p>

<p><span>...and then run the downloaded program to install SP2. You can ignore the text that says that it is for network installations and also ignore the text advising Windows/Microsoft Update if only updating one PC.</span></p>
<p><span>As an alternative to SP2 you could download SP1A (xpsp1a_en_x86.exe) from‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://slug.ceca.utc.edu/ftp/pub/windows/patches/winxp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">http://slug.ceca.utc.edu/ftp/pub/windows/patches/winxp/</font></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>‚Ä¶which a fellow contributor <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5a8f0406-1930-485b-a7f1-796a68549081">
<span><font color="#0000ff">Daavee</font></span></a> found.</span></span><span> It is half the size of SP2 so should be quicker. However, as you can see, it is not a Microsoft web site.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Once you have done that, or if you were already at service pack 1, 1A or 2, you can install SP3, but before you do, read this article‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950717</font></a></span></p>
<p><span>‚Ä¶and if your PC is an HP Pavilion, Presario or Media Center and has an AMD processor (see above) you need to install this patch
<b><i>before</i></b> installing SP3‚Ä¶</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?cc=uk&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;softwareitem=pv-60484-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?cc=uk&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;softwareitem=pv-60484-2</font></a></span></p>

<h2>            I dropped my computer, now it&#39;s acting weird...</h2>
                    
<p>I recently dropped my laptop (it's a Samsung, not sure what kind; it's only a year old), and the battery kind of popped out of its socket. :(<br />
<br />
Afterwards:<br />
- The Computer would start ok, until it got to the desktop<br />
-&nbsp;But then it&nbsp;would freeze at the desktop and none of the programs would work<br />
- Ctrl-alt-delete wouldn't work.&nbsp; There would be this error message if I tried it.<br />
- Safe mode worked sometimes.&nbsp; Sometimes it wouldn't, it&nbsp;would get stuck at the black screen (w/white letters) and stay there.<br />
<br />
I eventually ended up running System Recovery and that seemed to fix the problem.&nbsp; The computer was working ok for about 24 hours.&nbsp; But just now, it crashed again (for no apparent reason), and now it's back to being weird.<br />
<br />
Safe mode runs ok, but regular mode won't let me run any programs.&nbsp; It's suuuper slow.<br />
<br />
I know this is kind of vague but I'd REALLY appreciate any ideas on what the problem might be.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Grace</p>

            Umm... Contacting Samsung's technical support would probably be the best idea. It is possible that, say,&nbsp;memory modules are loose, hard drive or motherboard got damaged etc. As far as memory modules it's likely that you can remove them and insert them
 again by yourself (with AC adapter disconnectd and battery removed from your laptop). At the bottom of your laptop there should be a latch (fastened with a Philips screw). This latch hides the memory modules. Either way, the safest way would be to contact
 Samsung's technical support.

    <title>Mic works in Party Chat but not in Game Chat - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ebinhuston  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mic works in Party Chat but not in Game Chat</h2>
                    Whenever I get into a match on Rainbow Six Siege I'm unable to access game chat at all, I can't speak to them and they can't speak to me, and the mic symbols next to player names no longer appear. i've checked my headset and microphone which works on my
 computer and it registers when I am in a party, but when I switch the party to game chat or if I am already in the game chat the mic no longer works. I've gone through the processes of checking all of the settings, from volume, muting, and privacy, and my
 controller is up to date and I've updated it with my headset plugged in. My NAT type is open and I have the adequate ports, and the problem persists after hard reseting and waiting. This hasn't been an issue until a couple of weeks ago and has been persisting
 ever since.

<h2>            diagnostic policy service could not restart on local computer. access denied.</h2>
                    Have exactly same problem that kafsana had two years ago - Diagnostic policy service could not start on local computer. access denied.&nbsp;
<br />
Details:&nbsp; HP p6630f PC running Windows 7 64bit. Moved to another city; got different IP. Turned on computer and could not access internet - Diagnostic policy service not running. Typed Services.msc in Start Search box and scrolled down to Diagnostic Policy
 service. It was set to automatic but turned off.&nbsp; Tried to restart, but received Access denied. This is exactly the same problem posted by others two years ago. Did not find any answer that fixed that problem.&nbsp; Would think Microsoft would have solved problem
 by now.&nbsp; Has it been solved? If so, What is answer? If not, Why NOT?&nbsp; HOW DO YOU RESTART THE DIAGNOSTIC POLICY SERVICE WHEN ACCESS IS DENIED????<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Are you logged in administrator?</span></p>
<p><span>For the "Diagnostic Policy Service" service, the issue may occur when the account Trustedinstaller is missing the permissions for the key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DPS\Parameters.
 You may follow these steps and check if the issue persists:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press Windows + R key on the keyboard, type ‚Äúregedit‚Äù (without quotes), and then click OK.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</p>
<p>
<b><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b>In the navigation pane, locate and expand the following registry subkey:
<b><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DPS\Parameters</span></b></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click <b><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DPS\Parameters</span></b>, click
<b>Permission</b>, and then click the <b>Security</b> tab.</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Advanced</b> to open the
<b>Advanced Security Settings for &lt;Object&gt;</b> dialog box.</p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Owner</b> tab, click
<b>Edit</b>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
<b>Continue</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the new <b>Advanced Security Settings for &lt;Object&gt;</b> box, in the
<b>Change owner to</b>: field, select your <b>User </b>name, and Check the
<b>Replace owner on sub containers and objects</b>. Click OK, repeat for remaining boxes. (If your User name is not listed click
<b>the other users or groups</b> button to add your account).</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In security&nbsp;of the property dialog of the file, it shows "You must have Read permissions to view the properties of this object". When I click the "Advanced" button, it shows the same message again.</p>
<p>When I open an administer prompt window and navigate to the target folder and run "del the-just-created-file", it shows "Access is denied".</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update regarding the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be an actual permission issue or it‚Äôs because the file or folder is locked by a process. Please follow the methods given below and check if this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Try to Run a
<strong>System File Checker </strong>(SFC) scan to repair damaged System Files. Refer to the link below for more information:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Take ownership of the files by following the steps below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the folder which contains the file or folder on which you want to take ownership. Right-click on the file or folder and select Properties.</li><li>It'll open its Properties window. Now go to "Security" tab and select your username from the given list.</li><li>Click on "Advanced" button and it'll open a new window.</li><li>Click on "Change" button near "TrustedInstaller‚Äù it‚Äôll open a new dialog box. Now type your username and click on "Check Names" button. It'll automatically convert the username to correct format.</li><li>Now click on OK button.</li><li>Exit from both Ownership dialog boxes and come to the first Properties window again. Now select your username and click on "Edit" button. It'll open a new window.</li><li>Select your username again and click on "Allow" checkbox given for "Full control" option. Click on "Apply" button and then OK. It'll ask for confirmation, click on Yes button.</li></ol>
<p>Now you'll have full permission on the file or folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information was helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows in future. We will be glad to assist.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi squidow,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Did you make any software or hardware changes on your computer prior to this issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let‚Äôs try these steps and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong><span><br />
<br />
<span>You may temporarily disable all security softwares and check if the issue persists.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> <span>&nbsp;</span>After checking turn on all security softwares.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2</span></span></strong><span><br />
<br />
<span>You may boot into safemode and check if the issue reappears. Safe mode will start Windows 7 with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows
 are installed, follow the steps to boot the computer into safe mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Restart the computer</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Start tapping F8 key.</span></span></p>

    <title>Cannot boot Win 7 PC&#59; repair &#38; checking options all fail to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian macintyre  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot boot Win 7 PC&#59; repair &#38; checking options all fail to work.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Windows 7 PC (Home Premium 32-bit I think) is failing to boot.</p>
<p>It gives a message "The boot selection failed because a required device is inaccessible" and instructs that a repair is needed via the Windows (boot) disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the Win-7 disc to boot the system and then accessed several repair options (in the sequence below):
</p>
<p>1. A standard repair (from the menu that includes 'System Restore' and 'Command Prompt' failed the first time, saying RecEnv.exe could not be located.</p>
<p>2. Repeating the standard repair but selecting a different option caused the app to run a check on the system and then state a repair was scheduled when the system was rebooted.&nbsp; However, a reboot simply brought up the same error as above.</p>
<p>3. Using a Repair/Restart option offered by the Win disk app <strong>before</strong> the 5-option menu was reached rebooted the PC and gave 2 options on boot-up: (1) Launch Repair Service and (2) Start Normally;&nbsp; using option (1) took the system back to
 the boot-failure message noted at the top of this post!</p>
<p>4. Using the Command Prompt allowed the following...</p>
<p>- using 'wmic' revealed partitions of C: (HDD), D: (HDD), E: (HDD), F: (DVD) and X: (HDD).</p>
<p>- using 'DiskPart', then 'list volume' only listed C:, D:, E: and F: - the X: partition was not shown and none were listed as 'boot'
</p>
<p>- using 'chkdsk X: /f' failed with the message that the file system was NTFS and was write-protected</p>
<p>- using 'chkdsk X: /f / r / x' gave the same message (did not bypass the write protection</p>
<p>- using 'sfc /scannow' failed as it said a Windows Repair was scheduled and rerun sfc after the reboot (the repair did not happen on reboot, as noted above)</p>
<p>- switching to X: and listed the directory contents worked correctly, noting that X: was the boot area</p>
<p>- standard Windows .exe files on X: appear to run OK (e.g. RegEdit.exe)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is the chkdsk not bypassing the write-protect status and why does DiskPart not display the boot-partition?</p>
<p>More importantly, does anyone have any suggestions for what I can try next?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Brian.</p>

<p>Hi Mayra</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at the instructions via the link you kindly provided - unfortunately I could not follow them fully because I do not get the repair options it expects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I boot from the Win 7 32-bit installation DVD, and select 'Repair' (not Install) when the option arrives, I get the following displayed:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9dfc8a7e-6c56-4403-81de-a77ab49c3376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9dfc8a7e-6c56-4403-81de-a77ab49c3376" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Using 'Next' informs me this option cannot be used with the 'Operating System' selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cancelled this and eventually reached the options page with Startup Repair and Command Prompt.</p>
<p>I ran the bootrec options suggested on that other post, with the following results:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d82737f-5d30-42e3-8230-1365ec4ac21e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d82737f-5d30-42e3-8230-1365ec4ac21e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This did not look hopeful (with Zero installations!) but I exited and ran the Startup Repair option anyway.</p>
<p>It did not work, of course, returning the following message:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/70f47a65-e882-44ee-8cb3-a51435b38166" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/70f47a65-e882-44ee-8cb3-a51435b38166" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For reference, this is the DIR listing on the X: drive (which does not show up when DiskPart is used)...</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48e960b9-f8ed-44db-8207-4b9792fcfe11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48e960b9-f8ed-44db-8207-4b9792fcfe11" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, I am at a loss regarding what to do next. &nbsp;Someone has suggested buying a new HDD, installing Windows on that and using the existing drive just to retrieve the data, but that would lose all the installed programs, settings, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you any other suggestions on recovery? &nbsp;Or is it beyond repair?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks &amp; regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Brian.</p>

<p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the confirmation and link. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the steps on that link, it indicates reinstalling over the existing Windows 7 instance and then reinstalling all other software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the person who's machine is faulty does not have the discs do reinstall the other applications, as they were gifted the machine be a friend who was moving abroad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been suggested that one option is to fit a new HDD, install Windows 7 on the new hard-disk and then access the non-bootable drive as a data drive.&nbsp; Is that a workable solution and, if so, do you have a link providing guidance for this solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Brian.</p>

<h2>            Rotating &#39;Egg Timer&#39; in centre of my desktop&#33;  How do I remove it&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>How do I remove the revolving 'egg timer' from the centre of my desktop?&nbsp; It rotates continuesly!&nbsp; I'm&nbsp; using Windows Vista.&nbsp; Egg Timer appeared immediately after installing Hewlett Packard sortware for my new printer!&nbsp; I used a disc to install this.&nbsp; Is
 it worth me un-installing this software and then re-installing, in the hope the 'egg timer' will disappear?</p>

<p>Do a clean boot <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>&nbsp;and see if the egg timer is still there.&nbsp; If it is gone, follow the procedures in the article to identify the culprit and remove, delete, or uninstall
 it.&nbsp; You may need to remove it from Startup - go to <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a>&nbsp;and download Autoruns and check the Everything Tab to find the program or process identified by the clan boot and uncheck it to remove it from startup (in fact, since it occurred right after
 intalling the printer software, you can just go there before trying the clean boot and uncheck any HP-related entries and that will probably resolve the problem).&nbsp; Once done, be sure to return Vista to a normal status and then reboot.&nbsp; The problem should be
 resolved.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
