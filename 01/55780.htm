    <title>Issue with Magic Jigsaw Puzzle - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issue with Magic Jigsaw Puzzle</h2>
                    <p>Hi. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been very happy with Magic Jigsaw Puzzles - until now.&nbsp; The app was downloaded through the Microsoft Store. &nbsp; I believe the app was recently updated as the appearance is different and it does not contain all my puzzle purchases.&nbsp; These were in the
 app prior to the changes.&nbsp; I offered to send the Magic Jigsaw Puzzle folks my record of purchases. &nbsp; I was told that the record of purchases may only be used to restore puzzle packs if the "name" of the puzzle pack is included on the receipt. &nbsp;&nbsp; The name of
 the puzzle pack is not consistently found on the receipts - rather they are listed as puzzle pack 0, 1, 2, or 3. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Magic Jigsaw Puzzle folks told me that was not enough to restore my purchases. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have purchased/had 36 puzzle pack and spent about $135. Any advice? &nbsp; </p>
<p>Microsoft: are you able to generate a vendor specific list of payments as well as the "name" of the puzzle pack as opposed to the generic description of puzzle pack 0,1,2,or 3? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Needless to say - I am very disappointed.&nbsp; When I spoke with the company I asked if they could give me a credit for my expenditure and I would repurchase the puzzle packs I had. &nbsp; This way they would see that the expenditures were made.&nbsp; The company suggested
 I contact Microsoft. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this the place to vent my concern and ask for help solving my issue. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi TheJerri 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should contact Microsoft Gaming Support to get this resolved. Use below option to reach out to Microsoft Gaming Support. Here you get Live agent support not virtual agent/bot support.

<h2>            I&#39;m trying to delete a file within the C&#58;&#92;RECYCLER folder but keep getting a prompt that it is in use and cannot be deleted, but there are NO other programs or processes running.</h2>
                    SEQUENCE OF STEPS:<br />
<br />
1)&nbsp; I go to C:\RECYCLER and click on the only file in it: S-1-5-21-2741670144-2218735027-4111831206-1006<br />
<br />
2) &nbsp;I highlight that file<br />
<br />
3) &nbsp;I select "Delete" &nbsp;NOTE&gt;&gt;&gt; This worked on two other files<br />
<br />
4) &nbsp;After the delete process has been churning away for a few seconds I get the prompt that it can't be deleted because another program or process is using it and I must first close them down.<br />
<br />
5) However, NO other programs or processes are running and the Task Manager confirms that the System Idle Process is the ONLY thing running.<br />
<br />
PLEASE:&nbsp; I'm not capable of arcane solutions involving command line prompts and other DOS-like sophistication :-)<br />

<h2>            How to get into locked doors</h2>
                    
<p>I've played through a bit of the game, up to the point where I entered the bat cave and acquired the batclaw (or something like that).&nbsp; At any rate, I've passed many rooms that contain Riddler trophies which I cannot access.&nbsp; Is there eventually an upgrate
 or device I can use to enter these inaccessible rooms, or am I doing something wrong?</p>

<p>Wow, an answer by someone with "Arkham" in their name, guess you really liked this game?! &nbsp;Great to know, thought I was messing up or something. &nbsp;While I have someone's attention in this sleepy forum (chirp, chirp), I have another question. &nbsp;I'm playing
 on Normal difficulty for now but I really like the game and plan to play it again on the hardest difficulty. &nbsp;Will I have to re-collect all the items to upgrade my abilities, or do the abilities carry over onto the next game? &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<p>You'll have to start from scratch with the upgrades and gadgets. &nbsp;The biggest difference with the hardest difficulty is that there are no "animations" warning you that you're about to be hit and need to counter, you definitely have to watch the thugs' body
 language more. &nbsp;I didn't choose this gamertag, it's the one that I was given when I first signed up for xbox.com, being a big "BatFan", I felt lucky and honoured...:-)</p>

            <p>I think:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>"There is an option to break the CPU usage graph into two sections; kernel mode time and user mode time. Many device drivers, and core parts of the operating system run in kernel mode, whereas user applications run in user mode. This option can be turned
 on by choosing Show kernel times from the View menu. When this option is turned on the CPU usage graph will show a green and a red area. The red area is the amount of time spent in kernel mode, and the green area shows the amount of time spent in user mode."

<p><span>Hi Saedrb,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run the chkdsk /f /r command from Windows recovery console and check if it helps you fix the issue. This command
 will try to find and repair the files on the harddrive. Once the chkdsk completes try to boot to the desktop and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Fallout New Vegas Won&#39;t work on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My PC isn't really considered a gaming PC by todays standards. (Windows 10, Tried running the game on Compatibility Mode)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-4170 CPU @ 3.70Hz</p>
<p>RAM: 8.00 GB</p>
<p>System Type: 64-bit Operating System, x64-Based Processor</p>
<p>Video Card: NVIDIA GeForce GT 730 (based on my PC... it's up to date)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could run the game but when I start to "Load" or "Continue" it sets me into a loading screen which seems legit enough until the program crashes/stops responding. The save file was from my Windows 7 PC. I take a lot of precautionary measures that even my
 IT friends don't do (not being mean just being honest).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes I can guarantee you its not due to the save file being a windows 7 copy of the game. I tried to start a "New" game... it shows the classic intro were... then starts the loading screen then it stops responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP ME</p>
<p>If I should also inform Beth. software about this... Do tell me...</p>

            <p>I have FO3 and FO-NV which were installed on Win7 long before 'upgrading' from Win7 to Win10.</p>
<p>I am sill using the saves from Win7 as well.</p>
<p>Both FO3 and FO-NV run fine on Win10, but Bethesda game have more than their share of issues.
</p>
<p>Both have had issues with Win7 as well. FO3 in particular.</p>
<p>No point informing Bethesda. If there were something in the game that they could fix, they wouldn't.
</p>
<p>The game is too old. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Have you also run Steams '<em>Verify integrity of game cache</em>' tool ? Some games require this after upgrading</p>
<p>to Win10, and after the major Win10 updates.</p>
<p>- If you have not already. Deleting the <em>Fallout.ini</em> and <em>FalloutPrefs.ini</em>&nbsp; may help.</p>
<p>- If you are using the 4GB fix, don't.&nbsp; The game won't launch on Win10 with this .exe.</p>
<p>- I'm not using any Compatibility settings with FO-NV . FO3 does require Vista sp1 though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- This game was not as big a problem as FO3, but does have it's ups and downs.
</p>
<p>Last time I checked FO-NV it was crashing when I approached a certain dead body.
</p>
<p>Today there was&nbsp; no issue with this, but the game crashes my machine when I exit - unless I
</p>
<p>Alt-TAB out of the game and&nbsp; close it from the Taskbar.</p>

</p><p>- I don't know if my issue is due to 1607 or the recent driver update I did. If you are using the current driver</p>
<p>try an older one,&nbsp; such as&nbsp; 359.06, which would have been the driver I was using last time I checked FO-NV.</p>
<p>I rather doubt there is much, if any benefit using a driver newer than this with a 700 series card, especially</p>
<p>with the model you are using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- For the most up to date fixes for all Bethesda games the Nexus Forums would be the best option.</p>

<p>Try using the Intel HD440 Integrated graphics on your machine.</p>

<h2>            XBOX 360 Power Supply Red Light</h2>
                    
<p>Recently my XBOX 360 has been suddenly turning off while I'm playing a game and when this occurs my power supply has a red light. I've tried unplugging the power supply and leaving it for a few hours but when I start playing again it turns off within 20
 minutes. Any help is appreciated.</p>

    <title>Achievements not unlocking on Xbox PC game pass. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> avoled  say:</h3>
<h2>            Achievements not unlocking on Xbox PC game pass.</h2>
                    <p>I apologize if this has been asked before, but I can't seem to find an answer about this problem except "It's in beta" which is obvious but I want to know if any one else is experiencing this problem as well. Also if Microsoft knows about it and is working
 on a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I launched Riverbond, Metro Exodus and Wolfenstein 2 on the Xbox Beta app and they run great. However no achievements seem to be unlocking. It's not just that they don't pop up they just aren't unlocking. I've even checked on my Xbox One, The Xbox Mobile
 app and the website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, any input or information would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I haven't played the PC versions of these games, but be aware, that on PC, publishers are not required to add Achievements to the PC version to be added to Game Pass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please ask the publishers of these games (i.e. Cococucumber for Riverbond, Deep Silver for Metro Exodus and Bethesda) for Achievement support on the PC version of the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft only provides a marketplace and the means to download and install it. But the Achievement functionality is the responsibility of the game maker.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No the achievements are available because I see the progress bar for the windows versions on my profile.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is they aren't unlocking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the Xbox games for PC game pass have achievement support (I've checked)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However some of them don't, but Riverbond, Exodus and Wolfenstein 2 have dedicated achievements for their windows counterparts.</p>

<p>In this case I'm sure Xbox support isn't aware of it since it doesn't appear on the FAQ lists, and I haven't found any form of fix for this problem</p>

</p><p>My advice would be to continue to pursue for this information @xboxgamepasspc on twitter or at this

<p>
</p><p>Also post to the twitter account and Xbox Game Pass PC app under feedback (since it is on beta lol sry) they need this type of information to make game pass better for pc.&nbsp;</p>

            I have just had the same problem running Banner Saga 3. I can add that not only do achievements not unlock, but the game itself doesn't show up under "My Games" in the XBox Console Companion app - not until I launch the game from XBox.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern.</p>
<ul>
<li>Let us know whether the issue is specific to online videos or it is happening with other videos present in your system too?</li></ul>
<p>As the initial troubleshooting steps, I would suggest you to check all the available Windows Updates. Installation of recent Windows Updates should fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, then try updating the Display driver and check. Here is the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows Key + R on your desktop screen to go to run command box.</li><li>Type devmgmt.msc and hit Enter.</li><li>In Display Adapter, expand Display Adapter, right-click, and then click Update.</li></ol>
<p>Also I suggest you to follow the below article and update the driver, if still the issue persist then you can go to the manufacturers website download the sound drivers and install it and check if the issue persist.</p>

    <title>BSOD Driver verifier detected violation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julianrtaylor  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD Driver verifier detected violation</h2>
                    <p>recent problems with bsods forced reinstallation of Win10. Similar problem this morning with System Service Exception ( no specific file). Then it changed to Driver verified violation but still rebooted. Ran DISM and sfc, no errors. Checked device manager
 for errors and drivers for updates. Created restore point and opened Driver Verifier. Followed your reccomendations for use but when I restarted Windows it wouldn't open. Through Advance Options I tried to 'restore' but recent restore points didn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I restart? How can I access dump log files? Will Verifier still be 'on', if so how can I turn it off?</p>

            Hi Julian, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .       
        </p>

            Hi Julian, thanks, I got that . . .
<br />
<br />Well that mini-dump file indicates Trusteer Rapport as the causitive element in your crashes.
<br />
<br />That is a security extension on your Browser, usually used for online banking and so on!
<br />
<br />Try downloading and installing the latest version for your chosen browser to see if that resolves this for you . . .

            You need to redownload your xbox profile on the 360 Version In order to play online. If that doesnt work try to reset your xbox but only delete your accounts not the games

<h2>            Time for a new Xbox - Pre-owned or new&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So my current Xbox 360 has died (I'm not surprised, I think this is console number four) and I'm after a replacement as I'm now out of of warranty. The two options I see are either to buy a cheap Core console to stick my hard drive on or get myself a new
 250GB console.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do people think it's worth the risk/hassle saving the £100 on the pre-owned machine? My experience tells me that the old style consoles don't last. From somewhere like Game there will be a 12-month warranty, but that's going to get tired quick if I'm having
 to pop in every couple of months to get a replacement unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And does anyone know of any good deals around at the moment on 250GB consoles or bundles?</p>

<p>Get a new one, the 250 gig slim has more than £100 worth of extras that the old one doesn't have like the extra storage and the built in wireless, and HDMI. It also looks allot better. Plus you could sell your old console on Ebay to bring back some extra
 cash.</p>

<p>OP, Just to give you another side. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have two Xbox's in my house, one for the kids, one for me. &nbsp;The kids have the new one, whilst I had the Elite. My Elite started overheating all the time (only on multiplayer oddly, fine for everything else, kept as DVD player) so I asked myself the same
 question as yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, I bought a mint arcade model, and put my 120gb H/D on it. &nbsp;The machine is nearly as quiet as the kids new one, and had clearly rarely been used. &nbsp;CEX said they would give a twelve month warranty, in that, anything goes wrong in that time, they
 will repair or replace but not refund. &nbsp;I was happy enough with that, It cost me £70 and they threw in an extra controller. &nbsp;I thought that was a very good deal. &nbsp;I had other things on at that time, and my Elite went before pay day. &nbsp;I will get &nbsp;another slim,
 if or when this goes however.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst I agree with the majority view in this thread, and think you should go with a new one, I just wanted you to know you can get results going used too, if money is tight and you inspect and shop carefully.</p>

                    <p>Hi <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already read couple of other posts stating "Dell venue 8 pro not starting up" &amp; solving this issue by holding the power button couple of times.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to have a different issue here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My dell venue 8 pro wont start - no screen light, no dell logo, no charging light (orange/white).</p>
<p>If i put it to charge (using dell charger) , white charging light is on &amp; then after 5/10 mins it turns off &amp; then there is no light irrespective of how long i put it on charging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Pls advice, are there authorized dell service centers in/around delhi, India?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As there is no Screen light or Dell Logo at Boot, that would suggest a Hardware problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you contact the Dell Support in India for assistance as to where their Service Centers are located,</p>

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Can&#39;t move photos around in a folder, could in Vista</h2>
                    <p>Funny, the suggested answers were irrelevant; nothing about move 'photos'.</p>
<p>Microsoft again has not thought things through. They remain tech-, not customer-, focused.</p>
<p>People often want to re-arrange photos in a folder, to group related photos taken at various times, for example.</p>
<p>This was easy in Vista.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is impossible in 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft says this is progress.</p>
