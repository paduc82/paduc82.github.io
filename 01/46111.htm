<h2>            Bad Reputation Because of BF4 Server</h2>
                    <p>I Currently Am not able to Access any&nbsp;BF4 Servers OR Online Servers Because of MY "POOR" reputation, This is a result OF me Owning and admin'ing 3 BF4 servers, HAving to kick Players for rule breaking and Not following server guide lines, I apparently made the mistake of messages people before I kick to give them a chance to change, before kicking them and this has Given the Players who I kicked the Ability to report me for Whatever reason,&nbsp; I rarely Use foul language or Say rude comments, So I Find that fact that just because some1 reports me,&nbsp;With or without Reason my "Rep" is Hurt, Its my Job as a Admin is to make sure the server is being Kept in Order, Ive Played for 8 Years or so with this Gamer tag and never had a issue like this Until I started playing BF4 the last few Months, I would like my&nbsp;Reputation Reset, As this&nbsp;Problem is the fault of People who are angry I kicked them, and not From any wrong Doing</p>

<p>I heard they were gonna have 50% off some DLCS in a poll, but I have yet to see them. Was I just daft and missed them?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I didn't miss them, what DLCs should I or should I not be sure to get?</p>

<p>Mass Effect 2 was in the lead but no winner has been announced yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally I could recommend getting everything, as I already own it all for the 360m and PC. However I'd say that only Kasumi, Lair of the Shadowbroker and Arrival are essential.</p>

<p>I'd also download the Firepower Pack (Mattock Assault Rifle, Phalanx Heavy Pistol and Geth Plasma Shotgun) and the Aegis Pack (Incisor Sniper Rifle and the Kestrel Armor set), as the weapons you get are considerably better than what can be found in the default
 setting. The Kestrel Armor, imo, is one of the best for a Soldier class Shepard.</p>

<p>Maybe initially when you get it <b>Schuey19</b>, but after getting all the AR upgrades, it is a great weapon. That could be said though of all weapons, however for Soldier and Infiltrator classes, I'd recommend getting the Widow. Even without upgrades, still
 a powerful and accurate weapon. The choice is yours though what one you pick.</p>

<p>Assault Rifles are ideal for Short to Medium range imo that is, where Sniper Rifles are for Long Range. The Mattock AR though, imo, is like a hybrid of both, as I've been able to use it like a pseudo Sniper Rifle at times. Not as powerful as the Viper or
 Incisor SR, still a useful tool if you don't have access to a SR (Get the AR training ability from the Collector ship).</p>
<p>But for Short/Medium range, the Revenant (with upgrades) is a viable option for those who want a decent AR and don't want the Geth Pulse Rifle.</p>

<h2>            Youtube app won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t load</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, this is the fourth straight week that the youtube on xbox app will not get past the initial loading screen. It keeps trying to load and on the rare occasion it does make it past the loading screen it freaks out, switching from tab to tab without myself
 pressing any buttons. I obviously have done the following:</p>
<p>Clearing the cache, Deleting the app and re- downloading, clear the cache with the app still installed, signing out and signing back in, checking the status on Xbox.com and Youtube's console help site, and changing my gamer pic (because for some reason this
 does something to the programming of Xbox Live)... nothing works!</p>
<p>Now I was in the latest dashboard beta and this seemed to start happening when I downloaded the beta update however it is continuing to do this. Any help would be wonderful, because contrary to many I do enjoy watching Youtube on my console. Common guys
 fix your stuff!</p>

<p>The recording captures the last 30ish seconds when you press it, so it sounds like it's working right.</p>
<p>The DVR is basically always recording. If you snap the DVR app, you can do the option to start and stop up to 5 minutes.</p>
<p>The X button just quick grabs the last 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps as I see this post is from well over a month ago.</p>

<p>By default, it records that last 30 seconds when you use the Kinect ("Xbox record that") or use the X button on your controller. &nbsp; However, you can adjust how much gameplay time is captured in settings on your console.</p>

<p>The issue you are describing appears to occur when using the generic Windows 10 camera drivers or the LifeCam 5.20 and possibly newer drivers in concert with Skype for Windows 10. Whatever reset occurs does not appear to re-engage some type of advanced lighting
 property. I have noticed the issue can be resolved by downgrading to the Windows 8/10 compatible LifeCam 4.25 drivers. It appears that Microsoft no longer provides 4.x drivers from the main camera support page because in Windows 8 and above "drivers are not
 required". I still located them on their download server. This older package might online update to the newer, windows update 4.25.532.0 (2015) drivers. If it does not, I have provided them below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/3/8/F/38FEE4FA-9219-4BC8-974A-C9A2228CB205/LifeCam4.25.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LifeCam 4.25</a></p>
<p><br />
These drivers are compatible with:&nbsp;</p>
<p>HD-3000, HD-5000,&nbsp;HD-5001, HD-6000, Cinema, Studio, and Microsoft-based (not Intel) *Surface Pro Front and Rear cameras (*64-bit only).</p>

<p>
</p><p>Once installed, that should resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For other cameras:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest release of Skype for Windows desktop (8.x) supports webcam settings (8.30.0.50+). An option on a Windows 10 computer is to run that release of Skype instead of the App release.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 keeps trying to connect to an old wireless network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pmjb007  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 keeps trying to connect to an old wireless network</h2>
                    <p>Hi, i am using Windows 7 64-bit on an HP desktop in the UK. A while ago we changed broadband supplier from Sky to Virgin, and since then my desktop PC will not automatically connect to the Virgin network on restart, although I am able to manually connect
 to it. The problem seems to be that it keeps trying to connect to the old Sky network on startup, despite the fact that it is no longer there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following with no success:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- Removed the Sky entry from 'Manage Wireless Networks', but it keeps re-appearing on startup. Note that on startup it is the ONLY entry, even though i have 'Connect Automatically' checked every time i manually connect to the Virgin router;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Ran netsh wlan delete profile name = '<em>sky network name</em>' - this comes back with "Profile '<em>sky network name</em>' is not found on any interface";</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Uninstalled and re-installed the wireless adaptor drivers - again this was unsuccessful as the old entry keeps re-appearing. I am using a Realtek RTL8191SU LAN 802.11n USB 2.0 network adaptor;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even tried renaming the Sky entry in&nbsp;'Manage Wireless Networks' to the Virgin one, but it keeps changing back again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have numerous other devices in the household, including a Toshiba laptop running Windows 7, a mac book, 2 ipads, 2 iphones, an android phone, etc., none of which have any problems connecting automatically to the Virgin network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Peter</p>

<p>Maybe the underlying registry key is write-protected. Open the registry editor and navigate to&nbsp;</p>
<p>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\ CurrentVersion\NetworkList\Profiles</p>
<p>Now use the Find function to locate the name of the unwanted network. Check its security settings or delete it straight away.</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for the reply. Unfortunately, i had no luck with that. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There were several entries in the registry with the old network name. I've removed them all, so now there are none. However, on restart the pc will still not connect automatically to the network, and the old network name is still the only one listed in 'Manage
 Wireless Networks'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the registry and the changes I made have been saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

</p><p>Is it possible that SKY installed some type of program on your machine that is still launching at Startup ? That used to be a fairly common practice to setup\initialize the modem\router\connection.</p>

<p>Hi, i already tried that and it doesn't work. Yes, i can remove the Sky entry from the list and i can log in to my correct network, so that it looks like it's only that one on the list. But, when i restart the computer, the list goes back to what it was
 before, i.e. the Sky entry is the only one, and the PC does not reconnect automatically to the correct network.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of removing SKY, try just Disabling it, restart, then connect to the new one...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also look in System Configuration (msconfig)...Services...</p>
<p>Check the box to Hide All Microsoft and checkout what is left...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has to be something on your machine that insists on trying to make SKY the Default...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thought... When you connect to your new one, right click on it and see if it can be set as "Default"..</p>

                    I find two devices called "Bluetooth Peripheral Device" and a device called "Unknown Device" in my device manager, to which I can not find the proper drivers. The MS Window's hardware troubleshoot can not find the solution to this problem. Is there any

<h2>            how to change age on live accounts</h2>
                    
<p>new to Xbox360, bought Live Gold for my son for Christmas, entered his info correctly.</p>
<p>we got him Battlefied3, which from reading in here EA won't allow him to play until his account reaches 13</p>
<p>as parents we will allow him to play</p>
<p>long story short, is there a way to access his Live Gold info and change his birthdate</p>
<p>if not, if we delete his gamertag can we create a new one and use the same Live Gold code or will it be lost?</p>

<p>There is no way to change the age of an account. </p>
<p>If you just added the gold to his account then you can try calling support to see if they can cancel it and give you a code to redeem on the new account. However, with EA's age restrictions I believe you have to be 18 to play M rated games.</p>

 actually two (one with MS and one with EA), stating you would follow their terms and conditions.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Error Code 1603 When attempting to Install .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 1</h2>
                    
<p>I am running widnows xp SP3. I recieved a automatice update from MS KB2416447 = this install failed - tried again several times but the same result(failure). After searching and reading on your answers site I found avice to coreect this. The first going
 in to add &amp; remove programs and remove all versions of Net Framework - which I did. The reinstall the versions removed - which I attempted to do but got erros trying to instal Net Framework 1.1 SP 1</p>
<p>I then took the next route on this and rant the "cleanup tool" that would remove all versions of Net Framework - that ran successfuly.</p>
<p>Then back to installing Net Framwork 1.0, 1.0 sp3, 1.1, 1.1 sp1, 2.0 and then attempted 2.0 sp1 and that got the error code 1603</p>
<p>Previous to the initial problem with KB2416447 I had all versions and SP's up to and including Net Framework 3.5</p>
<p>what is the solution to this? all these klugey workarounds are just rediclous and time consuming and indicate poor planning and programming/testing</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 laptop can&#39;t connect to my Windows 10 desktop</h2>
                    &nbsp;Hi, I recently upgraded my desktop to Windows 10 Pro. Since then I cannot connect my Windows 7 Pro laptop to it. I have internet connection but I get a 'logon failure: unknown user name or bad password'. Everything was ok before with Windows 8.1. Does
 anybody have a solution?

<h2>            Edge has no Internet connection. But Chrome works fine.</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reading my&nbsp;problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got my laptop last year with Windows 10 preinstalled. For some reason, Edge doesn't have Internet connection. Every time I open it, it will say show the following:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<span style="color: rgba(31, 31, 31, 1)">Ó≠Ω</span>
</td>
<td>

Hmmm...can‚Äôt reach this page
<p style="color: rgba(31, 31, 31, 1)">
Try this</p>
<ul>
<li>
Make sure you‚Äôve got the right web address: <span>
https://www.msn.com</span></li><li>
Search for "<span>https://www.msn.com</span>" on Bing</li><li>
Refresh the page</li></ul>
<div><span>Details</span></div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>But the Internet is properly connected. Chrome works fine and so do other Apps like WhatsApp, Outlook 2016, Google Keep, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I restart my laptop, sometimes in the notification this will pop up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click it, this will pop up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click Fix now, this happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Cortana is also not working. It would ask me to sign in my Microsoft account. But every time it will say something went wrong, try again later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your time! Please help me fix this.</p>

            Hi, Jennifer! Thank you for the reply! I have followed your suggestion to repair Windows completely. But Windows still has no Internet connection.

<p>Ah! The good old infinite Page File debate. You may want to just play with the options and find what you think
</p>
<p>works best for <em>your</em> system.</p>
<p>My observations and conclusions are that while it should not be disabled, as many people
</p>
<p>( especially gamers) have been doing since they started running&nbsp; machines with 8GB or more RAM, the Page File's</p>
<p>significance to overall performance has decreased dramatically since XP and earlier days.</p>
<p>Some argue having a PF can reduce performance if you have adequate RAM, but if it does it would only be in
</p>
<p>synthetic benchmarks. It would not be noticeable in 'real world' running your programs or games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the Page File was important in the day of XP and 512MB or less RAM,&nbsp; it is not much benefit since</p>
<p>Win7 and large quantities of RAM moved in.</p>
<p>Other than Windows needing the Page File for creating memory dumps, some software still seeks the Page File and will</p>
<p>have issues if it cannot find one. And while that software may use the Page File, it will only use the amount it</p>
<p>was developed to use. No more. So there is no need for a great amount of HDD space to be allocated to the PF.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>System Managed</em> is still the recommended (industry standard ? ) setting, but I've been getting by with 2048MB</p>
<p>min and max <em>Custom</em> setting for at least five years.</p>
<p>- Having a PF on every partition/drive is not going to improve performance on a modern system, if it ever did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>.</p>

                    I have Asus smart gesture for windows 10. It is working but now if I swipe from the left edge it always opens task viewer. I'm left handed and this is annoying. How can I turn off this feature? It's not listed in the ASUS smart gesture swipe features.&nbsp;

            Hi EK.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See the suggested fixes here:
<br />https://www.****/knowledge/asus-smart...
<br />
<br />Control Panel is being deprecated so check also at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features for Steps 1 and 3.
<br />
<br />You also do not need to use the Driver Finder suggested.  Just go to the Asus Support Downloads web page for your exact model to download install the Touchpad driver.  While there check that you also have the latest chipset, BIOS, display, network, bluetooth, USB and all other drivers, compared to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />If these don't help go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            OK, I was not aware of this.  I'll summarize the steps for you:
<br />
<br />1) Check if a newer version of Smart Gesture is available for your model Asus on their official Support Downloads web page.  Download it either way as you may need to reinstall it. 
<br />
<br />2) Check for Asus Smart Gesture in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Asus Smart Gesture &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Reset or Repair.  If that isn't present then open the App and follow the illustration below to Reset to Defaults.
<br />
<br />3)  It may also still be located in the Control Panel by typing Control in Start Search, open Control Panel, Choose by Icons, Asus Smart Gesture, open and Set all to Defaults as shown in illustration below.
<br />
<br />4) If all the above fails uninstall Asus Smart Gesture in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features, restart PC, then reinstall the latest version from Asus website.  You may need to contact Asus to see if this is a known issue and find out how to get any patches or newer versions.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/28f5e610-420c-4a1a-b903-896e1074e40d?upload=true" />
