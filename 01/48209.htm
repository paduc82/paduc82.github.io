<h2>            My Windows 10 updates have been downloading for over 24 hours &#40;&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp; My Windows 10 updates have been downloading for over 24 hours (?).&nbsp; There are&nbsp;eight updates downloading.&nbsp;This is an abnormally, long amount of&nbsp;time for updates to download.&nbsp; Although its been over 24 hours, the updates are only at 54%.&nbsp; I've tried rebooting
 my computer,&nbsp;and restarting the updates, but no difference.&nbsp; Past updates do not usually take this long.&nbsp; Usually within a few minutes, the updates are finished.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is something wrong -why are the updates taking so long?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to speed up the processing of these updates? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, several times, when I tried contacting the help desk to establish a chat connection, an error popped up each time, "error, please try later".&nbsp; (?).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was nothing else downloading while the Windows Updates were downloading.&nbsp; Normally our Windows updates download fairly quickly....</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems our internet connection was possibly the culprit...</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, all updates are finally downloaded, and 'all' seems OK now. </p>

<h2>            Skype UWP, video quality gone horrible since last updates.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhere between&nbsp;fall creators update and Skype 12.9.604.0 update video quality went to bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier no problem with 720p or 1080p resolution, now just&nbsp;something like 640*360&nbsp;resolution at best case. Odd part is that if other party is on web.skype.com service, my laptop sends video at HD resolution, but&nbsp;I receive only sub-SD resolution. With both
 parties using UWP app, crappy video on both sides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Used laptop is Thinkpad T470s i5 7th and Intel HD620, drivers are&nbsp;up to date.&nbsp;Tested this issue on two separate networks, that both worked earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what is causing this? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h3> moneyhurricane1  say:</h3>
<h2>            ESENT Errors and Games Writing&#47;Using my HDD instead of my RAM</h2>
                    <p>Continuing the slew of PC problems I've been having since the beginning of August (look at my profile and you'll see, ugh...) , a new one has popped up. All my games that are resource heavy are using tons of my hard drive instead of my RAM, which is causing
 significant slow downs and constant freezes. I have no idea why they're not using the adequate amount of RAM that they need. Event Viewer shows several ESENT errors the last time this happened, but this isn't always the case. It's super annoying and I've just
 about had it with this laptop. Every. Single. Week. It worked fine for months and now everything is going wrong. Please help.</p>
<p><br />
Edit: After further investigation it seems that this is random. Sometimes it happens, sometimes it does not. Note that when Task Manager shows 100% disk usage, there is nothing on the list that's using that much of my disk. Looking increasingly likely that
 is a hardware issue. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Specs:</p>
<p>CPU: Intel Core i7-7500U @ 2.70Ghz</p>
<p>RAM: 16 GB</p>
<p>HDD: 1 TB</p>

<p>Hi MoneyHurricane1,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A lot of factors could cause this performance issue on your computer. Based on the details—knowing that you've already performed a full system scan to no avail and just a few weeks ago—I suggest that you still run an online virus scan. Search for free rootkit
 type cleaners or check on other forum sites for suggested programs. Make sure to read and search about the recommended software before you download it.<br />
<br />
Your issue could be due to a malware doing a crypto currency mining in the background. Some malwares are able to detect if you've launched the Task Manager, it stops its processes to avoid detection when you try to review software and apps running in the background.<br />
<br />
Noting the ESENT error codes you're getting, this could be a case of a root kit infection. This version of malware hijacks the operating system. Anything that could cause detection is filtered out before it is given to the OS.<br />
<br />
If you end up still getting other ESENT error codes (note that it would depend on the number code) to get rid of all the ESENT errors you're getting in Event Viewer, I recommend that you perform an in-place upgrade of Windows 10:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-perform-an-in-place-upgrade-with-windows-10/7f0b236e-3c6c-4913-9691-c4baa2a6190a">How to perform an In-place Upgrade with Windows 10
 Step-by-Step Guide</a></p>
<p><br />
If the above method didn't resolve the issue with your current user profile, then you'd need to create a new user account.<br />
<br />
Post back for the update so I'd know if you still need my assistance.<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />

<p>Hi. Thank you for you reply. I ran both Malwarebytes Anti-Rootkit and Kaspersky TDSS killer, neither of which found any rootkits. Also, I did a Windows reinstall like 2 weeks ago under direction from a Microsoft agent for another problem I was having. My
 system has been running smoothly for the past 2 days since I posted this, but it tends to crop up for a day, disappear, then happen again. Not sure why, but it's concerning.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Also ran GMER to triple check and it scanned but then closed randomly without letting me save so that means we're all good I guess? On the rootkit side of things anyway.</p>

            Thanks for the update, MoneyHurricane1.<br />
<br />
If you're referring to the performance issue you keep on experiencing even after completing all the methods suggested, which includes reinstalling Windows. Then maybe it's time to check for a possible hardware limitation.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've checked on your profile, and it seems that a lot of MVPs had already suggested the needed methods and troubleshooting to isolate the cause of the issue.<br />
<br />
What I can suggest is, get an SSD.<br />
<br />
Most Hard disk drives—if not all—are slow. HDDs used in laptops are even slower since they are designed to be energy-efficient, not fast. Swapping your HDD for an SSD will give the system a massive speed boost, or better yet, add an SSD to your rig, it will
 make the difference. If you have only hard disk installed in your laptop, then I am sure it is the reason behind the slow performance of your computer. I too had the same issue on my laptop. Like what other users suggest, it's possible that the laptop is only
 slow because the HDD can not keep up with the speed of your processor and the visual aspects of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
The Core i7 line of laptops doesn’t always mean performance, again, it means low power consumption. Pick quad core models labeled with HQ letters like i7-7700HQ, instead of the dual core Ultra low voltage labeled with the letter U, like i7-7500U.<br />
<br />
By the way, another factor could also be due to CPU temperature. Your CPU could be lacking cooling. Many CPU automatically throttle back when the internal CPU temperature is getting too high. Make sure to check the ventilators, heat sink, and dusk filters.<br />
<br />
I hope this somehow helped you with your concern.<br />
<br />
All the best!<br />

</p><p>When you reinstalled windows was it a clean install or a repair install, in other words did you wipe the hard drive and clean install.</p>

<p>Hi. Thank you for your help. However, what I find suspicious is that these problems started happening at the start of August. Before August 6, 2018, I got a problem like once a month and then it resolved itself&nbsp; without requiring any outside assistance.
 However, since the aforementioned date, I've been having critical problems at least once every 2 weeks. I'm a bit paranoid about rootkit activity because as as soon as I open Task Manager, the CPU/HDD usage drops. Also, whenever I try to run GMER it scans
 and then closes itself automatically, without letting me save a finished log. Has me a bit concerned. Any help in that respect?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi neilpzz, thanks for replying. I opened that up and it said that I was up to date. Ran a check just in case and it came up with two uninstalled updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Definition Update for Windows Defender Antivirus - KB2267602 (Definition 1.275.727.0)</p>
<p>2018-08 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1803 for x64-based Systems (KB4346783)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I install these?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the Windows reinstall reinstalled windows but kept all my files. I did it after a Microsoft Technician told me to do a system restore for another problem I was having, which caused my PC to not even get past the boot screen and immediately BSODing.</p>

<p>Yes certainly install what ever update is waiting to install. The reason I asked is because I had seen some systems where an update tries to install and then fails, loops and tries again. So slowing the system. After the updates have finished check the update
 history to be sure it installed correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although carrying out a repair install is the easiest method it won't necessarily get rid of problems. The best thing to do as the last resort is to clean install, wiping all the data from the hard drive and starting again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thought would be to scan with Malwarebytes free, just to be sure.</p>

<p>I have a payed antivirus, Kaspersky Internet Security. None of the scans (and there's a lot of them, including a rootkit scan), have found any issues.</p>
<p>

<p>If you have Kaspersky installed then it doesn't make sense that you have a Defender definition update. Defender should be disabled if Kaspersky is installed correctly.</p>
<p>Check to see if Defender thinks Kaspersky is handling your antivirus by opening Windows Defender Security Center and selecting Virus &amp; threat protection. Does it show Kaspersky is installed as an antivirus provider.</p>
<p>It doesn't hurt to have a Malwarebytes scan as it can sometimes find things others miss.</p>

            Yes, it does. But I turned on occasional scanning from Windows Defender just in case.

 for some reason did not create a restore point.&nbsp; Tried everything suggested on this site with no luck.&nbsp; Now down to trying to reinstall Win10 from ISO disk.&nbsp; It wants a KEY which I don't have.</p>
<p>HELP</p>

            <p>Your post was quite helpful. The black screen issue is happening with a desktop, not a laptop, and following the Method 3, I was able to create a test user and verify that the issue is user specific. The test user does not have a black screen desktop. Now,
 is there any way to solve the issue for the main user?</p>

            I had a black screen with just a cursor, could not clock in. One phone call, fixed in seconds....I was told to hold down on/off switch for about 40 seconds, until everything was off, leaving just a black screen as it was now&nbsp;off. Then start up again. Hey
 presto, all back to normal. Just had to turn on WiFi If still not sure, ring-------------0800 323-4060. It worked for me.

<h2>            Clickfree HD535 Will not work at all</h2>
                    My gf was previously using this on her macbook pro but long story short a program she was running off of it crashed and now it seems that it has become corrupt or something. It will not allow the disk utility on her mac to repair it and it won't allow
 my laptop (Toshiba L505 running Windows 7 64-bit) to format the disk. it constantly gives the error, (Unable to format...) not a windows 7 issue but it seems the manufacturer is so confident in the product that there is no troubleshooting on how to fix this
 when one cannot explore the disk because it wont format in the first place.

<p>
</p><p>The issue has been traced as a miscommunication with Office 365 system leading the cancellation of the subscription.&nbsp;Users do not need to worry as they should be able to reactivate the minutes from Office so long as the Office 365 subscription is active

<h2>            Windows 10 Boot loop&#33;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a TOSHIBA P70 B11P running WIN10 Home..I am getting a boot loop that leaves me on the TOSHIBA logo screen and doesn't go further.</p>
<p>I have tried SFC/SCANNOW (no errors)</p>
<p>Tried Automatic repair and nothing</p>
<p>
</p><p>does anyone know if this is just a simple fix or a re-install? If I hold power button down and restart a couple of times it boots??
</p>
<p>I don't really want to have to re-install Windows for this if possible?</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards </p>

 the only browser that works.&nbsp;Google chrome gets the error DNS_probe_finished_NXDOMAIN. That is the only thing and steam gets error -105, but all the other apps cannot connect to the internet. FYI, I'm using Ethernet.</p>

What operating system did you upgrade FROM?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Anything other than Windows 7 would require you to install any/all applications such as Microsoft Office, Mozilla Firefox, etc.; which you would do using your installation media and product key for the product(s) you need.

<h2>            Forza Horizon 3 Profile Deleted After Restarting Game</h2>
                    <p>I was playing FH3 when i realised that the cars in my garages where missing their icons. All that came up was the name of the car and the specifications. I thought this was a bug, so i restarted the game. When it opened back up, it asked to sync my data - from my device or from the cloud. The device had newer saves, and the cloud had older saves. So i loaded the game from my device. When the sync had finished, the game started to show the opening scenes. I have spend over 3 weeks getting to where i am and will be quite sad if i have permanently lost all of my data! Is there anyway that i can get my data back?&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>P.S - I am playing on PC and i just changed my gamerpic on the xbox beta app. Has it got anything to do with this?</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks if you can help</p>

<h2>            BSOD and the only file that appears is ntkrnlpa.exe when playing Metal Gear Rising</h2>
                    So this is a bit tricky to explain mainly because i've downloaded Bluescreenview and the only file that appears is ntkrnlpa.exe, and it only happens when i'm playing Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, which is a processor intensive game, i thought it was because
 it was overheating and/or dying but i downloaded Core Temp to monitor if my fan was working and the max temp that it reached is 65 degrees celsius so i can't find the problem there, it happens randomly, one time i might play for 2 hours withouth a BSOD and
 the next 5 minutes, I also tried reinstalling it but nothing happened, i only overclock my Gpu, my cpu is a fairly old 1.8 ghz dual core but it can still run any game pretty well, i also tried the veryfier.exe option wich led to my computer crashing on startup
 so i had to disable it using safe mode, and what made it crash was deamon tools, is my processor failing or is windows giving up and i need to reinstall it?<br />

<h2>            How to remove the password from the lock screen on Win 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I am 10 minute AFK, my PC goes to the lock screen - yes, it's useful and there is nice slideshow :) But the problem is every time i unlock, it requires the password. I'm sure there is a way to remove it, but HOW? I've tried everything and still can't
 find a solution. </p>
<p>There is also a problem with interface, for ex. in Windows Store or after the Lock Screen, when i must type in my password. I just don't see a field to type the text in, or even don't see anything. And i must first move or click the mouse interface to appear.
 However, it's not the main problem..</p>

<h2>            How to delete a locked user profile that doesn&#39;t show up under &#34;User Profiles&#34;</h2>
                    I just bought this computer used, and though I was able to set myself as administrator, the previous profile still has control over a lot of areas of my Windows 7 system. When I try to click on "my documents" it says it is listed under c:Users/chaz (not
 me) and "access is denied." How do I get rid of this guy? There are lots of files on my computer I am not allowed access to. There are others ostensibly listed under my profile that still have his account on them as well.

<p><span>Hi Jerry Foglas – Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community.<br />
<br />
I suggest you restart your PC, and after BIOS hold down <strong>F8</strong><br />
and once you enter Windows® Boot Menu select <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>.<br />
Once the welcome screen appears see if you can find the default built-in Windows®<br />
administrator account. If available click it and log-in (<strong>note:</strong> the password can be blank).<br />
<br />
Once logged-in into Windows®, press <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fpublic.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pdZ81R5jlg40svpjCSdGkUO3FEWUM9tGLLT_Dr2vxk9t6Jo-wvVt3RO8A4q_mOVxMP7_7MF7MbCRGAvPP4cj0aQ%2fwinkey.png" /><strong>+ R</strong> and type<em>“control userpasswords2”</em><br />
and press <strong>Enter</strong> or click <strong>OK</strong>. <br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fpublic.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pqNH2ku1nUnOoE3Vclgh4RYSw-Xhk1KVToowiRpghRWZEX74ORe_MZ_oRvYIWO4jW5EoeUWhziCQA0CiLp4307A%2fuacshield7.jpg" /><strong>&nbsp;Security note:</strong> If UAC is enabled, then you’ll get a UAC prompt on screen. Please
 specify <br />
credentials or permission to pass the UAC elevation. <br />
<br />
Now see if that account is available in the list, if it is, delete it or do what you<br />
want to do with it. <span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
I hope you find this information useful. If you need any further assistance,<br />

<p>Thank you for your help. Unfortunately, it had devastating results. I can no longer log in. Administrator is the only log-in option, and since I had never set a password before, there is no password for me to use (previously, the computer just started up
 without a log-in). I opened it in safe mode to try to set up an administrator password, but this password is only good to continue logging me in to safe mode. What should I do now? I don't even want any user accounts at all.</p>

<p>It is useless. Windows 10 photo app isn't working properly. In windows 7, my Canon worked properly. After installing the Windows 10, it doesn't recognise the camera. When opening the photo app as per advice above, it popped up and disappeared for no reason.</p>
<p>Anyway, I found one useful in another solution, it is in:</p>
<p>http://www.quantumbooks.com/technology/software/how-to-import-photos-from-your-camera-in-windows-10/</p>
<p>The solution is in the window explorer.</p>

            I have a Canon 50D which I use at work. &nbsp;It automatically downloads with Windows7 Pro immediately when connected to the computer asking me which program I want to download the photos with. &nbsp; I have spent four hours already trying to figure out how to get
 Windows 10 to work the same way. &nbsp;I have purchased Photoshop, looked for firmware updates from Canon(none needed for 10 supposedly) and tried calling Microsoft but hung up when I was told I was going to be charged 499 US Dollars for the one time help. &nbsp; Can
 someone please help. &nbsp;There is nothing wrong with the camera other than its 5+ years old and my Asus laptop is brand new. &nbsp; Thought this program was supposed to make things easier....

            <p>I was holding onto some hope that Windows 10 was going to leave the Windows bad reputation behind them, and some people seem to be loving Windows 10.</p>
<p>I've had a whole host of issues that I would have thought that would be easy for Microsoft to resolve.</p>
<p>Months after my original post on this issue, it still has not been resolved.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One power brick light shuts off when plugged into console</h2>
                    <p>I was playing my Xbox when it randomly shut off and wouldn't come back on. I unplugged everything to do a power reset. When I plug in the power brick by itself, the light is orange. But when I plug it into the back of the console the light shuts off. Has the brick failed or is this it's way of telling me the console has failed?</p>

            Hi PrinceDaniel07
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem. 
<br />
<br />If you are uploading Memory.dmp also, please upload it separately as the size of memory dump is very large.
<br />
<br />If you don't get minidump files in above folder, you will need to enable minidump generation. If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi Daniel, BSOD's are generally caused by a corrupt or incompatible device driver, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            OK apparently I didn't actually share the files hopefully this link will work:<br />
This should be the events around the time of the last blue screen:<br />
https://1drv.ms/f/s!AkqzxN2Wy5DbixvaRPWY7rUe9Hq9<br />
And these were just the system logs was asked for earlier:<br />

<br />
<br />
I downloaded FullEventLogView but I don't see how it's different than the event viewer.

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let’s try these steps &amp; let us know.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may check in device manager if the wireless controller is listed there.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Connect the external wireless controller to the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. To open device manager, type devmgmt.msc in start search box and hit Enter.<br />
c. Check if the external wireless controller is listed.<br />
d. In device manager, expand the wireless controller listed in the device list.<br />
e. If the hard drive is listed, right click on it &gt;click Properties.<br />
f. In General, under device status check for the message. Post back if there is any error message.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Additionally, you may also connect the wireless dongle to some other USB port and check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Regards<br />
