    <title>Dynamic disk &#34;Healthy &#40;At Risk&#41;&#34; after failed shrink - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> george-x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dynamic disk &#34;Healthy &#40;At Risk&#41;&#34; after failed shrink &#43; add mirror operation</h2>
                    Have a 1TB disk drive where I install program files. The disk has only 50GB used. It is configured as GPT and dynamic.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I wanted to transfer its contents to a 500GB disk and transfer the 1TB to an external box. I tried to to do something I have done before, that is shrink the single, simple volume on the disk to something less than 500GB, add the 500GB disk as a mirror,
 and when the mirror syncs, break it and keep the 500GB disk.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The shrink failed (although I did not ask for the maximum shrink size available), and this had the following result: The volume size in disk management looked as it did not change, it had its previous size, which was the whole disk. In Windows explorer,
 the volume was appearing with the reduced (shrinked) size. Used + free space on the drive equaled the shrinked size.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried a few things to correct this, like trying to shrink more, trying to extend the volume again, but all these operations failed to complete by disk management, which did not complete the requested tasks and produced an error. (I thought that by doing
 a successfull shrink or extend operation, disk management would update the incorrect information on the disk with the correct one, or something like that).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I then used EaseUS Partition Tool the convert the disk from basic to dynamic. I had used this operation before with no problem. After the conversion, the problem was solved, and disk management displayed the corrrect size, agreeing with windows explorer.
 So the volume appeared shrinked, and the rest of the disk as free space.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I then wanted to proceed with the plan of mirroring the disk. Using disk management I changed the disk back to dynamic. The disk changed, but its status changed to "Healthy (At Risk)". On the left column in disk management it shows "Dynamic" and below
 the disk number, "Error".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The disk works correctly and I can access all files on the disk. There is no smart status indicating any problem with the disk.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can not bring the disk out of this state. I tried "Reactivate Disk", but it does nothing. When I try "Add Mirror", I get a message "The disk is not healthy", and the operation does not complete. The mirror partition is created on the 500GB disk, as a
 simple volume.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I use diskpart, and on the volume list I can see a new volume on the 500GB disk, which looks like it is the remain of a failed create mirror operation. It has the same size as the shrink volume I am trying to mirror, but is a separate volume (different
 number). I deleted the "ghost" volume. Doing a "detail volume" on the problematic volume, does not show a broken raid configuration.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions? There is no physical problem with the disk I'm trying to mirror, its just looks like some information on it is wrong and appears as "Healthy (At Risk)".&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have repeatedly converted the disk back to basic and back to dynamic again. When the disk is converted to basic, I can then shrink or extend the volume with success. But when I try again to convert it back to dynamic, I get the same status after the
 conversion: "Healthy (At Risk)".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Finally, I know I can use a partition/volume cloning utility to copy the volume to the other disk. I will do that if there is no solution to the above problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>

<p>I bought a bluetooth device, connected it, and now wish to use it as a microphone but not speakers. How can I do this? I thought I knew but clearly not. I went to the Sounds folder in the Control Panel. I clicked on the Recording tab. It shows the devices

<p>
</p><p>As Im Listing these it just hit me that these problems started occurring immediately after I got my laptop back from the HP repair shop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running a hp notebook on windows 10.</p>
<p>The pc was generating new accounts constantly and apparently elevating these accounts above the one and only user(and admin) account on this pc. I've been getting denied access to more and more things.When I seen that bonjour was running an app on my windows
 pc it threw up a red flag and the app it was running was a DNSresponder. However the issues have only gotten more bizarre. MY net kept kicking me off so I logged onto my mothers asus laptop(win8) to see if the problem persisted on hers. it did.</p>
<p>After a quick check to see which wifi network i was on it was giving me my wifi address+2. Something was forcing my moms laptop to connect to the internet via my computer even tho all options for sharing my net connection were turned off. In Network and
 sharing center it shows this pc being connected to a private network yet all other signs were indicating I had somehow became part of a workplace network. When I open event viewer theres a custom log named "Server". So after a little digging using cmd (and
 later powershell) it turns out yes I am indeed acting as a server or something and there is a partition on my HDD that is hidden.</p>
<p>Also this two pcs are the only devices on this network that arent running IOS and the only two that were infected.</p>
<p>Then I found a .txt file inside a hidden folder titled "REGFLUSH": rthat contained the following:</p>
<p>RegFlush&gt; Starting...</p>
<p>RegFlush&gt; attempting to flush -&gt;HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</p>
<p>RegFlush&gt; Successfully flushed</p>
<p>RegFlush&gt; attempting to flush -&gt;HKEY_CURRENT_USER</p>
<p>RegFlush&gt; Successfully flushed</p>
<p>RegFlush&gt; attempting to flush -&gt;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</p>
<p>RegFlush&gt; Successfully flushed</p>
<p>RegFlush&gt; attempting to flush -&gt;HKEY_USERS</p>
<p>RegFlush&gt; Successfully flushed</p>
<p>RegFlush&gt; Done...</p>
<p>After digging around theres lots of weird stuff in these multiple hidden files. one txt list my OS as windows_NT, My Platform as mobile, my ram as 8gb(its only 4)and my I have zero windows credentials. then I found the policy definition scripts...&nbsp; C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions
 is a folder full of .adml files that force different policies. one in particular was a script that was forcing me onto a domain which in turn forced me into a workplace. Then the script told itself to connect to all other devices within the workplace(naturally)
 in turn infecting every other device that seemingly isnt Mac.Heres the script for that:</p>

            One more thing. Ive tried to edit the scripts in powershell but I do not have the permissions. I'm wondering now though that maybe if I can change them in the right order I might be able to get my system back?

            Unfortunately the best bet is to clean install Windows, if at the moment that is not an option &amp; you have access to the internet so you can hopefully download these:
<br />Try running these programs:
<br />MBAM free: <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br />Eset online scanner:  <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/</a>
<br />Adwcleaner:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/</a>
<br />
<br />If these do not fully remove the virus/malware then it will be wise to register with a malware removal site to receive dedicated malware removal instructions, an expert will remain with you throughout the process until confirmation that your PC is 100% clean.

<p>Thank u I suppose thats what im going to have to do. I've since used powershell to trace the malware to its root services and the ports that its using but this malware is very sophisticated by my standards. it is booting itself in front of my OS(im not an
 it tech this is just what ive gathered) and basically created its on directory of system files that the OS looks to. Ive gone into regedit and started removing the countless files that have global priviledges. i was able to track the remote service to an ip
 address and gathered everything about the remote client.&nbsp; I even managed to use RM to bring up the credentials screen to logon to the server but the user/pass is not default. I will post all of this here maybe someone&nbsp; can do something with the info.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; You must enclose the filter in quotation marks, as shown in the example.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This command gets association instances that are related to the specified instance (winrm). Because the&nbsp;</p>

            If you have another device you could first try one of the Malware removal sites to see what they say &amp; hopefully help you remove the infection without needing a clean install.
<br />If they do &amp; you get the ‘all clear’ I’d then recommend using Macrium Reflect to image your PC to an external drive, if this happens again you can then restore one of the images quickly to recover from the infection.

<p>Hello thank u for your input I performed a clean install and thought the problem was solved at first until i started looking/deleting existing malware scripts on my pc. I've never seen a malware(I actually think its spyware it isnt really attacking my system
 so much as monitoring it) anything like this. the more I dig the more scripts i find. One script in particular completely ignores all exploit/defender settings. Im currently on another pc atm the infected one is running but I dont have it connected to internet.
 as soon as i did earlier today alarms started going off. each time I would link a process to an ip address and block it all it did was change ips. i currently have ip range .192....255 blocked.</p>
<p>even after a clean install the first file I found was a script that ran a command to extract itself from the oldOS and embed in the newOS. However it was trying to pull itself from windows.old but there was nothing there since i Kept no files yet somehow
 it managed to root itself. my admin permissions keep dwindling awayand svchost.exe just keeps multiplying. I'm aware that svchost is used to host many different applications however the amount of them running is beyond normality.</p>
<p>I currently have anything to do with remote access disabled as well as every port either blocked or monitoried. I ran a threat scan with malwarebytes to no avail. It's currently running a full system scan. I've done just about everything i can without going
 online but i have yet to even update windows since the reinstall or install many of my drivers.</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do in terms of attacking the system thats attacking mine being that I have all the info for it? At one point i used remote manager to access the client system(my pc is listed as a server in workplace) and got to the login screen but
 I couldnt nail the password. It has to be some sort of default because all the system/user names are except for one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also I'm almost positive this spyware was put on my system by HP themselves. '</p>
<p>I sent my laptop to HP to be repaired and it was there from about 12-1-18 until 12-14-18. and the easiest way I've found to identify malicious files is if they were created/modified&nbsp; on 12-12-18. that would mean it was in the custody of HP when this was
 loaded onto my pc.</p>
<p>I feel like they should take 100% liability for any of my personal info that has been stolen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            It does appear the malware is embedded in a file which is being restored somehow.
<br />A clean install doesn’t create a windows.old folder, also with a clean install you can delete all existing partitions &amp; allow the tool to create everything new.
<br />If you can show HP that the problem was caused while in their care then you’d need to contact them &amp; inform support of that, however this might be difficult to prove to them.
<br />What HP software is installed?
<br />Are you using HP’s own recovery disks (which will have all their bloatware included) or the Media Creation Tool?
<br />You should try one of the malware removal sites to see what they recommend.

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The WEP key (wired equivalent privacy) can be found in the router’s page. To know the WEP key you need to log into your router. Follow the steps mentioned
 below.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Find the Router’s IP address.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open
 Internet Explorer and in the address bar type in the IP (Internet Protocol) address of your router.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>To
 find the IP address of the router follow the steps mentioned below.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 on start, then run and type in command, press ok.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>ii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>When
 the command prompt comes up, type ipconfig and presses enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>iii.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>In
 the information presented to you the default gateway is the IP address of your router.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>iv.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Just
 type in exit and press enter to exit the command prompt.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>In
 the router page the WEP key is mostly stored under security link, but the link may vary in your router page.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can check the WEP key in that page and set the key there.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h2>            Compressing files and folders to save disk space</h2>
                    Hey guys!&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Just a quick question for you all.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I upgraded to W8 a short while ago and have just noticed that in folder options &gt; advanced, there is a "compress folder to save disk space" option present.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have used this in the past and in most cases it has been quite efficient. Although, that was back in XP days and now I'm wondering if it is still a relevant feature. Does it do a good job or is the feature now defunct?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance!</div>

            <u><font color="#0066cc">Can I run 32-bit programs on a 64-bit computer?</font></u><span>
<div>
<p>Most programs designed for a computer running a 32-bit version of
<span>Windows</span> will work on a computer running 64-bit versions of
<span>Windows</span>. Notable exceptions are many antivirus programs, and some hardware
drivers. </p>
<p>Drivers designed for 32-bit versions of <span>
Windows</span> do not work on computers running a 64-bit version of <span>
Windows</span>. If you're trying to install a printer or other device that only has 32-bit drivers available, it won't work correctly on a 64-bit version of
<span>Windows</span>. For information about updating drivers and troubleshooting issues with device drivers for 64-bit versions of
<span>Windows</span>, contact the manufacturer of the device or program.</p>
</span>
<div><span>
 Would I benefit
 from using a 64-bit computer?
</span><span>
<div>
<p>The benefits are most apparent when you have a large amount of 
random access memory (RAM) installed on your computer, typically 4 GB of RAM or more. In such cases, because a 64-bit operating system can handle large amounts of memory more efficiently than a 32-bit operating system can, a 64-bit system can be more responsive
 when running several programs at the same time and switching between them frequently.</p>
</span></div>
<div><span>
 If I'm running
 a 64-bit version of Windows, do I need 64-bit drivers for my devices?
</span><span>
<div>
<p>Yes. All hardware devices need 64-bit drivers to work on a 64-bit version of
<span>Windows</span>. Drivers designed for 32-bit versions of
<span>Windows</span> don't work on computers running 64-bit versions of
<span>Windows</span>.</p>
<p>To learn how to check for drivers, see 
Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly or go to the device manufacturer's website. You can also get information about drivers by going to the

<h2>            How to re-activate a healthy partition lost by windows 7 beta</h2>
                    I installed Win 7 Beta&nbsp;on a 104GB&nbsp;partition of a 500GB drive.<br />
<br />
I erased it and reinstalled Win XP on the same partition. Since then, the remaining "Healthy (Primary Partition)" as shown by both Win XP &amp; Win &amp; are inaccessable.
<br />
<br />
I have tried everything and every forum I know of. <br />
<br />
All my tax records are on this - I need the info. <br />
<br />
Any Ideas?????????????????

<div>Hi <strong>Wtdel,</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
A) Do you get any errror message in disk management?</div>
<div><br />
To get into disk managment follow the steps given below:<br />
<br />
<div>1.Open Computer Management by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Security, clicking Administrative Tools, and then double-clicking Computer Management.‌&nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation,
 type the password or provide confirmation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2.In the left pane, under Storage, click Disk Management.</div>
<div><br />
B) What is the size of partition for windows XP and Windows 7?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I would suggest you to boot to winre(windows recovery environment) from windows 7 DVD.<br />
1. Select the operating system.<br />
2. From system recovery options click command prompt.</div>
<div>3. In command prompt type notepad.<br />
4. In notepad click file and click save. On the left pane click computer and check whether you are able to access hard disk or not.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For reference<br />

<p>Put these files in the Download folder in Windows 10 or just use the USB.&nbsp; Use these files to reinstall your downloaded programs rather than wandering all over the Internet.</p>

<p>However there is a driver for the same series of OKI Printers including the C3200 &amp; C3200n.</p>
<p>I have checked with Oki, Microsoft and Driver Detective who all say there is no available driver, Oki suggestyed I use the 64bit Vista version???</p>
<p>I have downloaded the 3200/3500 series drivers from OKI and unzipped the file but cannot find any info on how to install it.</p>
<p>Any ideas or advice on this would be greatly appreciated&nbsp; </p>

            There are installation instructions on the OKI support download page.&nbsp; You will need the 64-bit driver if you have 64-bit Windows 7.&nbsp; Following is a link to the download for the C3200n which has the installation instructions (which are probably similar
 to what you need even if that isn't the exact driver you found):&nbsp; <a href="http://my.okidata.com/PP-C3200n.nsf?opendatabase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://my.okidata.com/PP-C3200n.nsf?opendatabase</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; After going to that link, click on "Windows 7 (x64)" in the "Find a Driver" section then click on "English C3200n GDI Driver for Windows" and the install instructions are on the left under "Description."<br />

    <title>Wireless card installation fails despite using WHQL drivers. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> plaml  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless card installation fails despite using WHQL drivers.</h2>
                    I bought an Edimax WiFi card (EW-7728IN) which supports Win 7 to replace an earlier WiFi card unsupported by Win 7. In the initial installation I left Windows to find the necessary driver, which it did and reported a successful installation. However, no
 wireless signals were picked up and when I went into the Network Centre and looked at the adapters, the card was recognised but reported as Disabled. I enabled it and Win 7 went through Enabling to Enabled but the icon for the adapter continued to show Disabled
 and no wireless signal was detected. Looking in Device Manager showed the WiFi card was detected with no exclamation mark next to it and it was reported to be working normally. Win 7 wireless diagnostic procedure suggested there may be a driver problem but
 gave no solution. <br />
<br />
I uninstalled the inbuilt MS driver and then went to install the Windows 7 driver provided by Edimax and written by Ralink. Essentially the same thing happened and installation was reported as successful but despite Device Manager reporting the card to be working
 normally it was shown to be Disabled in the Network and Sharing centre. To give as much information as possible, the following data summarises the situation:
<br />
<br />
I have used the Windows 7 driver (20091028) provided on Edimax website. <br />
<br />
Under Device Manager it reports that the card is given as working normally and the driver is given as Edimax 802.11n PCI card and the driver given as provided by Ralink Technology, Corp., driver version 3.0.3.0 dated 4/8/2009.
<br />
The Win 7 diagnostics from within Device Manager gives the following information: Network adapter Wireless Network Connection driver information:<br />

Running the Edimax utility Diagnostic test shows all the stages give a Pass until 08:58:52:806 Profile verification gives 0 Profiles Warn and 08:58:52:821 gives 0 Diagnostic Capable - Warn.
<br />
The Network diagnosis gives CCX Diagnostic test failed!!!<br />
<br />
Is this likely to be a driver problem or are there some arcane settings within Win 7 that is preventing what is seen as a successful installation to be effective.
<br />
<br />
I would be grateful for any help you can give me.

<p>AHA!</p>
<p>Ok so extrapolating from answers I saw in this and other forums etc...</p>
<p>1. I downloaded the driver (comes down as utility package zip from edimax uk site) and completely uninstalled previous driver/utility</p>
<p>2. Unzipped to a folder called utility (surprise) then properties of setup.exe inside... Compatibility tab and change to windows xp (sp3) compatibility mode and check 'open as administrator' (i suspect it has less to do with admin rights and more to do with
 compatibility)</p>
<p>3. During install it will ask if you want utility and driver or driver only, I chose driver only</p>
<p>4. After install complete I ran network diagnostics on the wireless connection and bingo it detects my wireless networks</p>
<p>Am at this moment connected using the edimax.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

<h2>            win tonic and driver tonic</h2>
                    From what I could learn win and driver tonic were not something I want on my hard drive but when I try to uninstall them I either get a red window telling me that the administrator won"t allow me to run them or if I go through the control panel I am asked
 if I want to allow the apps to change my computer. I chose no which then does not uninstall them.They are irritating for sure and seem to be a virus or something. Is that right and if so how do I get rid of them

            Hey Wade.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Good on you for recognizing PUP's which we need to watch out for like hawks any time we're installing freeware because the vendors feel like they are justified adding them in (even in the license agreement!) for giving us something free.  
<br />
<br />
<br />Run a full scan with the most powerful on-demand free scanner Malwarebytes: 
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>. 
<br />
<br />In the Scan Settings first set it to include scanning for Rootkits.  
<br />
<br />If necessary run it in Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode accessed by one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Clean up anything found, restart PC and then run again until it comes up clean.
<br />
<br />Check for any remainders in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features, and also in each of your browser's Extensions, Home Page settings, Search service or Add-On's as shown here:  <a href="https://community.box.com/t5/How-to-Guides-for-Account/How-To-Disable-Plugins-Add-Ons-Extensions-In-Multiple-Browsers/ta-p/19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://community.box.com/t5/How-to-Guides-for-...</a>
<br />
<br />Then check for damaged System Files:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />If it cannot repair them see Step 10 here to continue:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />If you want to keep Malwarebytes as an on-demand scanner then you can turn off its Real Time trial version in it's Settings &gt; Account Details tab.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Reset Library in Windows Media Center on Vista Ultimate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pghilino  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reset Library in Windows Media Center on Vista Ultimate</h2>
                    
<p>Is there anyway to reset Media Center so it rebuilds the picture, video, and audio library?&nbsp; I need to start all over again since it will not let me control my own destiny.</p>
<p>Media Center has found all kinds of stuff on my drives that I don't want showing up in it's&nbsp;menus.&nbsp; No, it is not ____, but I see how that could be a real problem.&nbsp; It is finding all kinds of misc photos that I don't want shown.&nbsp; I should not have to rearrange
 my hard drive in the attempt to hide stuff from Media Center.&nbsp; This is just plain crazy!&nbsp; Media Player 11 is much better behaved.</p>
<p>Once Media Center finds something it will not let go of it!&nbsp; At least it seems that way to me.</p>
<p>It would be a great improvement if Media Center just showed you a list of folders that it finds and then gives you the option to delete or add to that list.&nbsp; MS apparently&nbsp;dumbed it down so much you&nbsp;can't do that.&nbsp; Then after that is should rescan and update
 everything.&nbsp; Media Center development team please talk to the Media Player 11 development team and see how they are doing it.</p>
<p>Apparently it can't detect that I have moved my Public folder to another drive.&nbsp; It is still searching for C:/Users/Public&nbsp;and will not give up looking for it there.&nbsp; I have empied out all My Music, Video, Pictures, Etc under my user so it will not find
 anything next time around.&nbsp; Now I just need to find a way to reset the library from scratch.&nbsp; That would be a nice option to have under Task!</p>
<p>Another option would be to flag a folder for Media Player/Media Center inclusion with a on/off toggle set with a&nbsp;right click on the folder.&nbsp; Carbonite does this for it's online back ups and it&nbsp;couldn't be more simple!</p>
<p>This really makes a great product just about useless for me.</p>

Have you attempted to manually delete the media player database? </p>
<p>Click <b>Start -&gt;</b><span> click<b> All Programs -&gt;
</b>click<b> Accessories -&gt; </b>click <b>Run</b>, type the following in the Open filed:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\ Medial Player</b></p>
<p>Click <b>OK.</b> Select and delete the files in this folder. Open Windows Media Player to initiate a rescan of your library. Follow the previously outlined steps to further customize your library.</p>
<p>If this step is still not satisfactory, then as of now, the only way to completely restore Windows Media Center is through a clean reinstallation of Vista. Please see
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/e77344fa-e978-464c-953e-eba44f0522671033.mspx#section_3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>BajaPaul,</p>
<p>Windows Media Center pulls some of your Library information from Windows Media Player. We will need to edit your library from there.</p>
<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Add or remove monitored folders from your library:</p>
<p>Open <b>Windows Media Player,&nbsp;</b>press the <b>Library</b> tab and choose the type of media (<b>Music, Pictures, Video, Recorded TV</b>), then&nbsp;press
<b>F3</b> on your keyboard to open the <b>Add To Library</b> window, press <b>Advanced Options</b>, make your folder selections for your library (by selecting
<b>Add, Remove Ignore or Enable</b>), click <b>OK. </b></p>
<p>Now we will Remove unwanted&nbsp;existing content from your Library:</p>
<p>Press the <b>Library</b> tab, choose the type of media (<b>Music, Pictures, Video, Recorded TV</b>). Now select
<b>Library </b>from the left side panel, from the <b>Additional Views</b>, select
<b>Folder. </b>You can now right-click the desired folder and select <b>Delete</b>, at the notification box choose
<b>Delete from library only</b>, press <strong>OK. </strong>Alternatively you can right-click any media file and follow the above steps to delete.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>The Pictures and Video Libraries in <strong>
Windows Media Center</strong>&nbsp;automatically monitor your <strong>Current</strong>&nbsp;<strong>User's Pictures</strong> and
<strong>Video </strong>folders. Any media content added to these folders will be automatically scanned into your Media Center, this&nbsp;includs the
<b>Public</b> folder under <strong>C:/Users</strong>, place only the content you wish to add in them.</p>
<p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            windows installer error</h2>
                    <p>Soon after starting up my computer, windows installer tries to install a program called "TrayApp". An error message comes up saying:</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>TrayApp</strong> is a software developed for <strong>HP</strong> devices. There's a chance that the error message that pop-ups at boot up might be due to a corrupted installation. That being said, please refer to

<h2>            New Skype Meeting icon was there and gone</h2>
                    
<p>I am using Skype for Business 2015. I can sign in directly with Skype for Business (Lync). When I first signed in earlier today I saw the New Skype Meeting icon in Outlook 2013. I used it to schedule a meeting and successfuly held the Skype for Business
 meeting. Also was able to use Skype for Business online app.</p>
<p>Now the icon is gone. I went to COM add-ins and enabled the Skype Meeting add-in but every time I did that it disabled itself. So I navigated to C:\program filesx86\microsoft office 15\root\office15\ucaddin.dl and added it and now the add-in is listed as
 Lync Meeting Scheduling Outlook Add-in. (no corresponding add-in in c:\program files\microsoft office etc.</p>
<p>Tried closing &amp; opening Outlook &amp; Skype for Business; tried rebooting. Checked my startups in msconfig.</p>
<p>But the Skype or Lync add-ins do not stay enabled. I check them, say OK, then go back in and they are disabled.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 stopcode 101 and 124 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> earthdragon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 stopcode 101 and 124</h2>
                    <p>I'm having ongoing&nbsp;occurances&nbsp;of stopcodes 101 and 124. This&nbsp;is a computer that was newly-built during the summer and it has had ongoing stopcodes since it was new (i7 6700, MSI&nbsp;MB, MSI Nvidia Geforce 950, 250GB SSD, 16GB ram).&nbsp;It was relatively expensive
 for my budget. I bought it to process HD video but so far, I haven't even been able to get to surf the web without the bluescreen. At one point, the system builder replaced the&nbsp;MSI motherboard (but not the CPU), the MSI graphics card, and the ram and reinstalled
 the Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp;No improvement. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is the link to the last four minidumps from yesterday and today. There are&nbsp;dozens more. Also, I noticed that the only time the minidumps are recorded are when the computer makes it through restart. There are also dozens of&nbsp;occurances where it hangs
 in the "info gathering" process and there is no minidump. These are shown as event ID as 1005 and just says "unable to produce a minidump file".</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://1drv.ms/f/s!Aqoz1C5eQXCWiVsgtv52fTjF8adZ</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really hoping that someone may know of a solution to this problem. I have searched and read many posts but have not found a solution that I could effect. It appears each case is unique and that the minidumps will be helpful. If this information is insufficient,
 let me know and I will attempt to correct it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance and any info is appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You demand that I jump through all those hoops and gather all that information apparently for no good reason then respond that the stop codes are "hardware related" so read this wiki and figure it out yourself?</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Volkan,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It seems that something went wrong while you were making changes with the windows shortcut. I would suggest you
 to perform a system restore to resolve the issue. Restore the computer to a date before you had the issue.</span></span></p>
