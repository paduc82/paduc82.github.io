<p>Hi,</p>
<p>More general methods, try starting with a Clean Boot to see if that eliminates the issue.<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER<br />
had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause<br />
strange issues).<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>Do these :</strong><br />
<br />
Start - type this in Search Box -&gt;&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; -&nbsp; RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Enter this at the prompt - sfc /scannow<br />

Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

Refer to these threads for many more excellent tips however be sure to check your antivirus<br />
programs, update major drivers and BIOS, and also troubleshoot with the cleanboot method<br />
first.<br />

<h2>            Update from Windows 10 build 1511 to 1709</h2>
                    <p>Ive never been able to get off of build 1511 of windows 10. Every time my mahcine restart to update it feeezes at some point during the install. The breathe ring does not go round and is stuck. The only way to get out of this is to restart and then the machine
 does back to the previous version then this happens again after it downloads and apples</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently it keeps getting stuck at 54% with version 1709, but the has also happened with other versions at different points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ive tried everything. Uninstalling avast anti virus, running checkdsk, running windows update troubleshooter, deleting the old download files, starting in clean mode but all the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be a log somewhere that shows what stage it is at before hanging, i get no error messages when restarting, only the generic ‘we were unable to apply updates message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my model is a samsung series 7 laptop, it cam with wondows 8, but i upgraded to 10 through the upgrade program.</p>

<p>Hi Graham,</p>

<h2>            Windows Easy File transfer hangs with just one minute left</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, i've read through the forum posts and cannot find an error similar to mine.</p>
<p>I'm using WET to back up a Windows XP SP2 computer onto an external hard drive so i can update my computer to Windows 7.&nbsp; After some initial hiccups i was able to get the program to run.&nbsp; It began to back up all 3 user profiles.&nbsp; I am now stuck with "1 minute
 remaining" and a screen showing all 3 profile names in the 'saving' status.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only app running is WET.&nbsp; I thought if i closed some extra processes that might help unblock WET but i don't know which ones to close (or on the other hand, which ones i need to keep running so WET will finish the last bit of backup).</p>
<p>Has anyone seen this error before and can you help me get through it?</p>

<p><span>Hi valerieo,</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you receive any error message?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you have any security software installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In many cases security software would interrupt the file transfer process between the computer to external hard drive.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you temporary disable the security software installed on the computer and check if the file transfer continues.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span>Antivirus software
 can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If
 you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>If the file transfer does not proceed after disabling the security software then you will need to cancel the file transfer process. Disable all
 the third party program installed on the computer to check if any of them are conflicting with file transfer and later perform file transfer again.</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers
 and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the below link to know more about clean boot procedure.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state</span></strong></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Reset the computer to start as usual</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></p>
<p><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or
 click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h2>            Touchpad isn&#39;t working with Windows 10 1903</h2>
                    I did a clean install of Windows 10 1903 and now the touchpad on my Laptop no longer works. It used to work great with 1809 and before. I've installed all the latest drivers for my Laptop, I've installed all the Windows Updates, Graphic Drivers, Sound
 Drivers etc. and the touchpad isn't working, it doesn't even move the cursor. I've had to go out and buy a mouse.

<p>Hi Danielle Magbanua,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your concerns, yes, there is, but not all users can have Admin control,
<strong>only accounts with appropriate Admin Permissions</strong> can access Admin interface to manage the related settings, if you purchased Office 365 for Business subscription which include Skype for Business online subscription, it looks like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9180fc64-5bc3-4f6f-8d52-d1cafc167ef7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9180fc64-5bc3-4f6f-8d52-d1cafc167ef7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, it is also suggested to use Teams as the primary chats, calls, and meetings tool to get different experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>hello i don't know if this is the right place to post this but last week i tried signing in and i get a message saying " Your xbox live membership information isn't valid. please use a profile that contains a valid membership or recover your profile from
 xbox live." i go sign in to xbox.com and when i signed in, it had a different gamertag. i called the support line and they couldn't help me cause my originial gamertag isn't associated with the email i provided them with even though i always had my gamertag
 associated it with. i even get emails from the xbox rewards with my original gamertag. i never changed any information for my original gamertag. also the weird thing is that i can connect offline but when i try going online, i get the error message. i tried
 recovering but it gave me a different gamertag. can anyone help me. i already called the support line twice and they haven't done anything. thank you</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>It is a strange problem you have, like you said you hadnt changed any details relating to your gamertag or windows live ID?</p>
<p>Is ZeroGiraffe4828 your original gamerrtag? As it shows in the profile box of this forum.</p>
<p>Also when you log in to xbox.com with your windows live ID does it show the correct gamertag?</p>
<p>Have you tried clearing your systems cache</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</a></p>
<p>Also you say you tried to recover your gamertag, did you delete the profile from your xbox first then recover it?</p>
<p>Just a few things to try but if you have no joy then xbox support should help you but if youve contacted them twice and they havnt you may have to lose the gamertag forever or pay some points to get it back! I know thats not ideal but it may be a solution
 if the above fails.</p>

<p>Hello, you are receiving this message because you are using a different e-mail to login to your XBOX Live account. This gamertag "ZeroGiraffe4828" is an automatically generated XBOX Live Gamertag. This appears when you login to XBOX.com for the first time
 using an e-mail address that has never accessed XBOX.com before. Please note that even though you get e-mails that still go there from the original gamertag that does not necessarily mean that the e-mail could not have been changed by you. It's possible to
 have 2 different e-mails on an XBOX Live account, one which would be the Windows Live ID and one that can be changed at any time by going to the contact preferences on XBOX.com.<br />
<br />
So there are a couple of possibilities that could have occurred here:<br />
<br />
a.) You have changed your e-mail address and cannot remember the e-mail, it's possible that you signed up with a .ca, .uk e-mail and are trying to login with a .com<br />
b.) Your account was accessed in an unauthorized way, and you would need to contact phone support in order to resolve that.<br />
<br />
If you call phone support and tell them that you can't seem to remember your Windows Live ID associated with the account they will be able to go through some very specific questions with you that only the account holder would know. You will need to answer them
 for them to be able to help you get the correct Windows Live ID for your account. If you cannot answer their questions then they cannot give you the e-mail associated with your account.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We realize the inconvenience you have experienced. Let us know few things to analyze the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Are you referring Mozilla Firefox?</li><li>Are you trying to close single tab or entire Firefox window?</li><li>Is that Mozilla Firefox up to date?</li><li>How about working with other browsers? Like Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge?</li></ol>
<p>See, when you try to close a single tab, it will automatically close it without asking you for a choice. However, when you try to close entire Firefox window with multiple tabs, then it will ask you for a choice of closing a current tab or entire window.
 By this you can make a choice of closing a window or a tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give us these details to assist you better.</p>

    <title>Black Screen Upon Startup After Windows 10 April Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Black Screen Upon Startup After Windows 10 April Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I updated my Windows 10 to April update through Update&amp;Security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon startup, the login to windows takes longer time then, the&nbsp;screen goes black and I can see only moving cursor. I need to press Ctrl+Alt+Del to call task manager and restart or shut down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, restart fixes the issue. Sometimes doesn't. Very hard to predict.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, shutting down and start again fixes the issue and sometimes doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very confusing and frustrating. Can anyone provide some solution? Thanks</p>
<p>My device is,</p>

            Hi Chan.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to try to fix the problems, but at any time you can roll back Version 1803 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems .   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I have a similar problem except I cannot see anything on the screen except the cursor. I can't even get into task manager. I have done a clean reinstall but the same problem is still there. Is it possible to get a version prior to the one with the problem?
 I have been stuck without a computer for 2 days and as a small business it is causing immense problems &amp; stress.</p>
<p>

<p>CTRL + SHIFT + ESC will get you Task Manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your problem is not the same as mine I don't think. But with the recent black screen with recycle bin issue, I had to return to a previous version of windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried running the command that was supposed to take me to the advanced start up settings. I may work for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Task Manager go to File&gt;Run New Task</p>
<p>Open: cmd&nbsp; &nbsp;- make sure to check box "Create this task with admin privileges"</p>
<p>
</p><p>At command prompt type:</p>
<p>bcdedit /set {globalsettings} advancedoptions true&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is supposed to turn on advanced start up options at boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To turn it off, run command:</p>
<p>bcdedit /set {globalsettings} advancedoptions false</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this works for you. You're supposed to be able to go to advanced options with F11 at startup but that didn't work for me. Once in start up settings, you can find advanced options that will "go to previous version". (It took some digging and I didn't
 write it down). Then once that is done and the PC boots, I was able to function once again with Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!!</p>

                    While in File Explorer (or Windows Explorer), is there a setting or even a registry hack to default the item that shows up in the preview pane to show the entire page? By default, it fills the width of the screen and you have to click a button at the bottom
 to show the entire page.

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have any Office application installed on the system?<br />
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When do you get this error message?</div>
<div>&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you trying to install any application?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It might be that the office application is not installed properly on the system that is the reason you encounter this error ‘Setup cannot find download ‘1706 and windows installer is trying to install the program on the system, that is the reason you see
 the pop up on the system. This error is a Windows installer error.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong>&nbsp; Run the troubleshooter and then follow the steps from link and check the results.
<br />

&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong>&nbsp; I would suggest you to unregister and re-register Windows installer and check if it helps:<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the "Start" menu, Type Run in the search bar and hit enter.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the "Open" box, type "msiexec /unreg", and then press ENTER.<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the "Start" menu, Type” Run” in the search bar and hit enter.<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the "Open" box, type "msiexec /regserver", and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 3: </strong>You may download the latest version from the below link:<br />

<h2>            Driver power state fiailure when using USB 3g modem</h2>
                    Hello<br />
<br />
I bought a new laptop this week, preinstalled with windows 8. Everything worked fine in the city, as both at work and at home I always have easily available wifi. However I went down to the country side yesterday where I use a USB connected 3g modem, and I
 keep getting "DRIVER POWER STATE FAILURE" crashes every few minutes. Here are my dump files https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1415366/Minidump.zip<br />
<br />
My computer model is asus A55k

<div><span>How To Find Drivers:</span><br />
<span>- search Google for the name of the driver</span><br />
<span>- compare the Google results with what's installed on your system to figure out which device/program it belongs to</span><br />
<span>- visit the web site of the manufacturer of the hardware/program to get the latest drivers (DON'T use Windows Update or the Update driver function of Device Manager).</span><br />
<span>- if there are difficulties in locating them, post back with questions and someone will try and help you locate the appropriate program</span><br />
<br />

            <p>Hello Renoc,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You do realize that removing Windows 8 from your new system will void the manufacturer's warranty, right?</p>
<p>and that you may find that installing Windows 7 may not succeed on this hardware configuration?&nbsp; (hardware driver issue come to mind).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You do not have to use the apps on the Start screen. You can go right to the desktop by pressing Windows-key+D</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a starter list for keyboard shortcuts within Windows 8 &amp; Windows RT.<br />
Obviously for systems with a keyboard.</p>

<p><br />
Handy shortcuts for <u>switching between WIN8 Start screen and Desktop</u>:<br />
Press Windows-key on keyboard:&nbsp; If you press once {and repeat as needed}, it will toggle (switch) between the Start screen &amp; Desktop, and vice-versa.<br />
A repeat press of the Windows-key will toggle it back.</p>
<p>While in Desktop mode, press &amp; hold ALT-key + press Tab key { and repeat press of TAB-key} will toggle thru a viewable list of open windows.<br />
To switch to the program that is desired, when it is "encased by rectangle" let go of the ALT key.</p>
<p>While in Desktop mode, pressing Windows-key + R starts the RUN dialog.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you really truly cannot do without the old-windows start menu, you can give a try &amp; get Classic shell&nbsp; from&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Something that might make your life a lot easier without purchasing Win 7 or whatever, would be to try a program by StarDock called Start 8.</p>
<p>It will restore the Start button and some other features you are familiar with in Win XP, Vista, 7 etc..</p>
<p>It will also boot directly to the Desktop, if you wish.</p>
<p>It's only $5 and has a 30 day free trial.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><br />
Ignore the squares,&nbsp; remove them if you like or change them to things that you would find useful.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing that is really different is that when Windows first starts up, in W7 terms it is as if the Start Menu was opened automatically and spread all
 over the Desktop.&nbsp;&nbsp; To dismiss that you would press Win- or Ctrl-Esc, or just ignore it and open the Run... dialog (e.g. press Win-R).&nbsp;&nbsp; But in W7 you would also probably often not see what you wanted to use immediately and then have to open the Start Menu
 and start typing.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, in W8 with the Start Screen already opened you can start typing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just imagine that you have an invisible input box to type your first letter in--which is true--as soon as you start typing you will see its Search bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another difference
 would be that in W7 you would be able to see your Taskbar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That shows up as soon as you dismiss the Start Screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, as a reminder you could leave the Desktop tile in position one and then "launch" the Taskbar that way simply by pressing Enter (since
 the first tile on the Start Screen has keyboard focus when Windows starts up--but, again, you may find that you have a more useful default than that for that feature.&nbsp;&nbsp; ;&nbsp; )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything else, e.g. on the Taskbar is essentially the same, so I don't understand your comment about minimizing programs?&nbsp;&nbsp; "How to open new apps"&nbsp; may need some customizing of the Start Menu or the Search, depending on how the "new apps" were installed.</p>

            <p>I suggest you get away from the Windows backup program and get yourself a good commercial backup program. This forum is frought with problem reports for the Windows one. I know I was very unimpressed when I tried it. Two I'm familiar with and like are Norton
 Ghost (which I've been using for 7 years without the 1st problem), and Memeo which has a 30 day free trial and you can buy it for $29.99 - you can download it from http://memeo.com . You can get Ghost for next to nothing (like I did) if you watch the sales.
</p>
<p>CNET has a lot of backup program reviews at </p>

<h2>            No video on skype 8.14.0.10 on linux 16.04</h2>
                    <p>hi</p>
<p>I'm using ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Skype 8.14.0.10, a Logitech C920 webcam, and I'm unable to use video. Other applications seem to work fine with the web cam (e.g. Cheese). It previously used to work on an older version. Has any one solved this issue ?</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/0b22902a-94d4-4b98-8ac2-c07eb0ab06e7" title="Michael-McNulty">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this up to Microsoft Community. For any Surface book devices, we cannot just replaced the keyboard alone, In warranty or Out of warranty replacement for any Surface book devices, what we replaced is the entire device, not just the
 keyboard alone or the Clipboard/tablet. I suggest you to please contact support for any replacement options on your Surface Book. Before we proceed further in getting your Surface book be replaced, have you tried troubleshooting it?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two possible reasons for your Surface Book USB ports concern; software-related or hardware-related. Let's troubleshoot on the software side. Let's go ahead and try these solution steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Perform the&nbsp;two-button shutdown.</span><br />
<br />
</strong><em>Note: Please make sure your Surface device is completely turned off before proceeding to Step 1.<br />
<br />
</em><strong>Step 1:</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.<br />
</span><strong>Step 2:</strong> &nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both. The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the
 buttons down for at least 15 seconds.<br />
</span><strong>Step 3:</strong>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.<br />
</span><strong>Step 4:</strong> &nbsp;<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.</span></li></ul>

<h2>            I cannot login to my Microsoft account or create a new account on my computer</h2>
                    <p>On Windows 10, I've attempted to connect my Microsoft account to my computer for the first time. An account called "admin" was already on there with no Microsoft account attached. However when I went into "manage your accounts"&gt;Your email and accounts and
 clicked on "sign in with a Microsoft account instead," nothing happened. Or, more specifically, the window popped up for a millisecond and then closed once more without a single error message or anything. Once I tap on the button, the mouse becomes a spinning
 wheel until you move it.</p>
<p>So I scrolled down the page and selected "Add an account," however it did the exact same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would very much appreciate some guidance on this issue. Thanks!</p>

            Hi Emma.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It sounds like you have an older version.  What I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Once you get it upgraded try again to add your MS Account in the latest version's Account settings under the new name "Family and Other Users" 
<br /> 
<br /> But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            What happens if you do the following:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Click Add
<br />
<br />Enter a user name
<br />Password, confirm it, create a hint
<br />Click Next
<br />Click Finish
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Sign into the new account.
<br />
<br />You can also try adding an account through the command line:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD, right click CMD then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />To view a list of user accounts on the system, type net user then hit Enter.
<br />
<br />Here is how you can create a user account with a specific privilege:
<br />
<br />Type the following then press Enter:
<br />
<br />net user Username Password /add
<br />
<br />For example: net user Emma mypassword123 /add
<br />
<br />You should see the following message: “The command completed successfully.”  You should now be able to click Start &gt; username to switch to your new account.
<br />
<br />If you want to add the user to a particular group such as Administrator, Power User or Limited User, use this command:
<br />
<br />net localgroup GroupPrivilege UserName /add
<br />
<br />Example: net localgroup administrators Emma /add
<br />
<br />You can also use the command line to enable the built-in Administrator account, which you can use to manage all the resources of your computer.
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Disabling it is just as easy, type:
<br />
<br />net user administrator /active:no
<br />
<br />If none of these work, its best you reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br /> Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<p>Hello, Greg!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response, I really appreciate the fast reply. Unfortunately, after I followed your instructions to update Windows, it got corrupted and I had to seek assistance to reinstall Windows 10. I suspect it had something to do with my unstable
 internet. Whilst doing this, I had the option to recover what little files I had, however I ultimately decided it wasn't worth it and restarted it completely. I was able to connect my Microsoft account upon boot up and everything is running smoothly!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, thank you for your response!</p>

<h2>            Hissing noise from right speaker on Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>I have had my Surface Pro 3 for a few days, and I have even taken it back to the store for an exchange. &nbsp;When using the Surface, all of a sudden, I'll hear a low hissing noise (white noise) coming from the right speaker. &nbsp;I turn off the speaker, and it still
 continues. &nbsp;I've even done a refresh of the unit, and it does the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas of what it may be?</p>

    <title>atikmdag.sys Causes Blue Screen on Windows Startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frozenbean  say:</h3>
<h2>            atikmdag.sys Causes Blue Screen on Windows Startup</h2>
                    
<p>Every time I boot up my computer with Windows 7, I get a blue screen caused by atikmdag.sys. The blue screen appears for two seconds, then causes the computer to restart. The problem disappears when I uninstall the driver, or when I boot into safe mode,
 but those options are not long term solutions as they significantly reduce the performance of my card.</p>
<p>I've tried installing different versions of drivers (down to 9.1), but none have worked so far. I also tried uninstalling Windows 7 (64 bit)&nbsp;and switching over to Windows XP (64 bit), but once again, but the same problem occurs. None of my parts are overclocked
 as of now.</p>
<p>Any help on this would be appreciated. I've spent a lot of time on this and really want to see this work. Here are my system specifications, if this helps:</p>
<p>Graphics Card: ATI 4870x2, Power Supply: Corsair 650W (others have gotten it to work with 600W power supplies), CPU: Intel i7 875k (not yet overclocked), Motherboard: Gigabyte P55-USB3, Hard Drive: Intel 80GB SSD</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s uninstall the ATI graphics card driver software completely from device manager and reinstall it back then check.</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;Type devmgmt.msc, press Ok.</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;In device manager, expand graphics card driver &gt; right click on it&gt; click Uninstall [Put a check in delete all driver files].</span></p>
<p><span>c. Reboot the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>d. The Windows generic driver will get installed automatically.</span></p>
<p><span>Since you are facing this issue in Windows XP as well as in Windows 7 it might be possible that the graphics card has gone bad.</span></p>
