<h2>            New update&#58; contacts lost and calling credit lost</h2>
                    <p>My computer automatically updated to the new Skype and now my account no longer shows my contacts or my calling credit. I have tried all the recommended ways of fixing this problem and they do not work. How can I speak to someone at Skype about fixing this?</p>

<p>That is complete rubbish. I have only ever had one account, but I lost all contacts and the new skype-downloaded even though I said "no". I can't do anything with it, and the help button brings up only a pile of things for skype phone, which I do not want
 or ever use. Microsoft has forgotten why skype was developed: so people can video chat live. If we wanted Instagram or snapchat or any of the other things out there, we'd use those. Quit messing with skype! All your answers are useless too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I did, and it was the ONLY thing I could do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same thing happened to a lot of people, and the new version is garbage; it's microsoft trying to compete with all the other stuff out there such as snapchat, instagram, twitter, etc. They have forgotten that Skype's
 purpose is for people to be able to videochat. Also, a lot of people got updated to this version -including me- even though they refused it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After lots of googling and going around in circles with trying to contact skype support that I believe doesn't actually exist-because all roads lead back to the same community support page- I found a solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ignore the app on your device -just unpin it or whatever, and google "skype for web", where you can log in and you will find all your contacts. You'll have to bookmark it and have your browser save the pasword if you don't wish to keep having to
 log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, do as I did and if you use Chrome, click on the three dots in the top right corner of the screen on your Chrome browser, click on "more tools" and then "add to desktop" which will give you a shortcut on your screen. You can then pin this shortcut
 (right-click) to your start menu and/or task bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next time I get a new computer, I'm going to choose a Linux operating system (Mint looks good) because Microsoft has forgotten that we need things that actually work, and for the purpose for which they were meant.&nbsp; Good
 luck!</p>

<p>&nbsp;Seriously? I was already logged in and have only ONE account -as I already said. Your comment is total nonsense. I used the web version because it was the only one that worked...with the SAME skype name and password. DUH!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, I achieved the miracle of getting thtough to a live chat tech who looked at my computer and ascertained that in fact, the wonderful (meant sarcastically) last update had actually deleted skype off my computer -the icons were gone from the start
 menu itself and the task bar -and what was left in the start listings and what I'd opened, was some other "thing" that did diddly squat. How the heck was I supposed to know that? Some update! So I had to download it again, and the tech had no answers whatsoever
 as to how this happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I know what happened: MS keeps fiddling with things and cannot leave well enough alone, and the problem with that is much of the time the techs have no idea how to resolve anything, plus many of us don't want things messed with. We don't want to have
 to sign in with smart phones, use Skype for anything other than video chats -for what it was developed- and we don't want to have yet another social media platform when Skype was never meant to be used for that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, I don't want some sort of platform that looks like it was meant for a smart phone -I don't have one. I want to chat with my elderly mother on a full-size screen and in comfort. Not everything has to be tied to a smart phone. I don't have one,
 and I'm not ever going to have one because I have no use for one. Why the heck would I want to quint at a tiny screen when I can work comfortably at a full-sized screen? I don't need to be "connected" 24/7 either: I have a life. You know, a real one!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And PLEASE stop replying to queries if you don't have a sensible, practical answer that actually works, and then only after actually reading and understanding the question or problem.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 backup error 80070005</h2>
                    
<p><strong>New Win7 Pro build. &nbsp;I have the OS on an SSD and a 2nd 500GB drive set up as drive D. &nbsp;I was able to do a backup of the OS disk (C:, SSD) to drive D without errors. &nbsp;Then I messed it up.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I was "fixing" ownership and permissions on drive D to resolve access issues to media I had copied onto drive D. &nbsp;Ownership is set to myself (user) and permissions are set to full access by administrator and myself. &nbsp;This was&nbsp;propagated&nbsp;from D: root
 through the whole drive. &nbsp;At this point, I noticed backups were broke. &nbsp;I've tried a few permissions and ownership settings on D, and deleted the two WindowsBackup and WindowsImageBackup folder on D:\.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Create a system image / Where do you want to save the backup? screen says Local Disk (D:) - This drive is not a valid backup location. &nbsp;If I were to select an external USB drive, its happy, but that's not what I want to do.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I wish to clear out the prior backup settings and start fresh with backups going to D:. &nbsp;How to begin anew? &nbsp;What are the proper ownership and permissions on a target drive for Windows Backup?</span></strong></p>

<p><span>Hi cjninaz,</span></p>
<p><span>What is the complete error message?</span></p>
<p><span>The error message 80070005 is related to improper permission set for the drive. I would suggest you to follow the steps as below to take ownership
 of the Local Disk D: on you computer.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>3.</span></strong><span> Click on<span>Security<strong>
</strong>tab<strong>.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>4.</span></strong><span> Click on<strong>‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù.</strong></span></p>

<p>Okay, here's the story...</p>
<p>When I reset the permissions for D:, I referenced a bogus Administrator name: &nbsp;machName\Administrator, rather than the valid Administrators group (with the 's' on the end). &nbsp;I reset and waterfalled the permissions and all is now well.</p>

    <title>Why can&#39;t I access my own folder 1under windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I access my own folder 1under windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to update my game: Elder Scrolls Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the troubleshooting options is to delete the "ProgramData" folder and then repair/update the game from the launcher/interface/client(??).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, ProgramData is undeletable due to the fact that the subfolder:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Host.6357113bc720a83cfde75951160e66ac0596bb97</p>
<p>
</p><p>is locked/I-don't-have-permission-to-open-it-let-alone-make-any-changes-to-it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is: Why?!! My follow up question is: How on Earth do I give myself permission when I get these responses:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/45d88949-1815-43eb-9878-265c9566ee73" /></p>
<p>1.) There is no "Open as Administrator" option that has been mentioned 2.) I'm assuming those shields mean something..??</p>

</p><p>Hi, Frederik.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the above commands, tailoring them to my own locked folder, with no success.</p>

<p>Lachie here (original poster)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if anyone's interested, I was able to delete the goddam folder accidentally with IOBit unlocker. Which doesn't answer my question. But anyway, it was gone, I started the update via ESO desktop launcher, lo and behold it started repairing and now I have
 a new "host.whatever" folder that now I have access to. So, yeah.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the hell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway. Thanks to all who read this and would have helped/those who helped others in the past!</p>
<p>
</p><p>God bless,</p>

<h2>            Problema com o FIFA 14.</h2>
                    
<p>E ae amigos, tranquilos? Ent√£o, n√£o sei o que t√° acontecendo, mas tipo, quando ponho o cd do fifa 14 pra rodar no xbox ele n√£o abre, fica na tela preta e n√£o carrega nem nada, e o cd √© novo. O que ser√° que pode t√° acontecendo? Eu deixei ele desligado a tarde
 toda, pra s√≥ mexer nele de noite pra ver se era bug ou algo do tipo, mas nada, continua na mesma. O que pode ser? O que posso fazer quanto a isso?</p>
<p>Valeu, e grato pela ajuda.</p>

<h2>            MSVCR110 install on Windows 10 -</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to install AutoCAD LT 2016 onto a PC which has recently been upgraded to Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>AutoCAD LT&nbsp;can't install as the MSVCR11.dll file is missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following the advice of MS support&nbsp;I have downloaded the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 Update 4, but when I try and run this I get an alert to tell me it can't install on this PC - there are no error codes but I think the problem is that
 the MSVCR isn't supported by Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone advise on a way to progress, or do I have to reinstall Windows 8.1?</p>

Hi Library Mouse, <br />
<br />
What I would recommend you do is to run <b>System Restore</b> and restore Windows to a date when you know the PC was working properly.
<br />
<br />
Here's how. <br />
<br />
Go to Start | Programs | Accessories | System Tools | System Restore<br />
<br />
Click: <b>Restore my computer to an earlier time</b> and click <b>Next</b>. <br />
<br />
From the calendar which appears, choose a date when you know the PC was working properly and then click
<b>Next</b>. <br />
<br />
System Restore takes a few mins to run during which the PC will reboot. If the restoration was successful, you'll see a message to that effect.
<br />
<br />
Test to see whether copy/paste works properly again. <br />
<br />
"agrsmdel.exe" appears to belong to a company called Agere Systems. The same company makes a
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?cc=uk&amp;lc=en&amp;softwareitem=pv-43225-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
software modem for HP</a>, so one would assume it to be genuine. <br />
<br />
TeraCopy v2.27 appears to be genuine as well and is available at FileHippo which is a bona fide download site:
<a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_teracopy/tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/download_teracopy/tech/</a><br />
<br />
The important thing however is to compare file sizes since malware can masquerade as genuine software in order to disguise itself. To compare both, right click the file and go to Properties. Click the Version tab next and then compare file sizes.
<br />
<br />
Having too many security programs running on a machine isn't good either. So decide whether you want to keep Malwarebytes, or SuperAntiSpyware.
<br />
<br />
If you want to install AVAST, you'll need to uninstall MSE beforehand which also requires a reboot.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>

<span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since when are you facing this issue?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you install any software or update recently?</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>------------------</p>
<p>There was an option to use a /S to specify where to copy the boot files to. &nbsp;However, I wanted them to be copied to the system partition which doesn't have a drive letter. &nbsp;So, I used DISKPART to assign the letter Z to volume:<br />
<br />
<br />
Then I could use BCDBoot to run this:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>-------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I assign a letter to the volume ?</p>
<p>How do I display volumes in diskpart?</p>
<p>What is my C:&nbsp; volume name?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to ruin my primary boot volume C:</p>

    <title>Problem za granicƒÖ - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem za granicƒÖ</h2>
                    
<p>Witam.</p>
<p>nie wiem czy taki temat by≈Ç poruszany - z g√≥ry przepraszam jak co≈õ. Mam problem przebywajƒÖc na terenie Niemiec. Jestem Polakiem, mieszkam w niemczech ale chcƒô mieƒá xbox live po polsku. Z polskimi grami, ofertami itd. Dlaczego? Poniewa≈º mimo ≈ºe tutaj mieszkam
 to m√≥j jƒôzyk nie jest wystarczajƒÖcy do przyjemnego grania i korzystania z us≈Çug konsoli - a po to przecie≈º ona w≈Ça≈õciwie jest, prawda? Wielokrotnie kontaktowa≈Çem siƒô ju≈º z pomocƒÖ technicznƒÖ kt√≥ra jest niekompetentna do udzielania pomocy wciskajƒÖc mi kit jaki
 nie ma prawa bytu nie rozwiƒÖzujƒÖc mojego problemu. Rozumiem r√≥wnie≈º ≈ºe m√≥j adres IP mo≈ºe siƒô nie zgadzaƒá z ustawieniami regionalnymi konsoli/konta MS ale nie spos√≥b by by≈Ço inaczej skoro polak mieszka poza granicami swojego pa≈Ñstwa. To samo tyczy siƒô konta
 PayPal i p≈Çatno≈õciami z nim zwiƒÖzanymi poniewa≈º gryzie siƒô niemcy=&gt;polska.</p>

<p>Moja sytuacja uniemo≈ºliwia mi w zwiƒÖzku z tym pobieranie wiƒôkszo≈õci gier z akcji games with gold, zakup promocyjnych gier czy nawet zakup jakiejkolwiek gry pomimo ≈ºe moje polskie konto MS r√≥wnie≈º posiada odpowiednie ≈õrodki. 60‚Ç¨ posz≈Ço siƒô bujaƒá na darmo,
 zaczynam ≈ºa≈Çowaƒá ze w og√≥le kupi≈Çem konsole i zastanawiam siƒô nad kompletnym pozbycie siƒô jej z domu bo robi siƒô ca≈Çkiem zbƒôdna.</p>

<p>Rozumiem prawa autorskie, ograniczenia regionalne i wymagania wobec graczy ze powinni trzymaƒá siƒô swojego regionu. Niestety w niekt√≥rych przypadkach jest to wrƒôcz niemo≈ºliwe a konsument zaczyna ubiegaƒá siƒô o swoje prawa do przynale≈ºno≈õci narodowych nawet
 za granicami swojego pa≈Ñstwa! Opracujcie jaki≈õ system pomocy osobom w moim przypadku, zr√≥bcie jaki≈õ wywiad albo skontaktujcie siƒô osobi≈õcie ze mnƒÖ by m√≥c potwierdziƒá faktyczny stan rzeczy i odblokowaƒá mi konsole i te chore zabezpieczenia!</p>

<p>W jaki spos√≥b w≈Ça≈õciwie chcesz, ≈ºeby tƒô sprawƒô rozwiƒÖzaƒá? ≈ªeby≈õ m√≥g≈Ç pobieraƒá gry z polskiego rynku bƒôdƒÖc w Niemczech? Je≈õli tak, to w ≈ºaden dozwolony spos√≥b tego nie rozwiƒÖ≈ºesz, bo sam zaakceptowa≈Çe≈õ te restrykcje w regulaminie podczas zak≈Çadania konta.
 Gdyby≈õ go wcze≈õniej przeczyta≈Ç, oszczƒôdzi≈Çby≈õ sobie teraz nerw√≥w i walki z wiatrakami.</p>
<p>Jedynym sposobem na rozwiƒÖzanie problem√≥w z blokadƒÖ regionalnƒÖ jest zmiana regionu twojego konta na Niemcy. Gry bƒôdƒÖ oczywi≈õcie po niemiecku (z nielicznymi wyjƒÖtkami, kiedy region na konsoli bƒôdzie ustawiony na Polskƒô, konta na Niemcy, a gra, kt√≥rƒÖ akurat
 uruchomisz, bƒôdzie obs≈Çugiwa≈Ça oba jƒôzyki). Inaczej tego nie rozwiƒÖ≈ºesz i ≈ºaden pracownik po stronie Microsoftu nie jest w stanie ci pom√≥c. Ca≈Çy regulamin musieliby zmieniƒá. Oni te≈º muszƒÖ siƒô go trzymaƒá i nie majƒÖ na niego wp≈Çywu.</p>

<p>Czasem regulamin r√≥wnie≈º wymaga zmian. Tak samo jak tyczy siƒô to konstytucji, regulamin√≥w np aplikacji na tel itd. Wszystko z czasem zmienia sw√≥j regulamin w miarƒô potrzeb i trzeba go ponownie potwierdziƒá. Mo≈ºe w tym przypadku r√≥wnie≈º nale≈ºa≈Çoby co≈õ z tym

<p>Akurat tego nie przeskoczysz ≈ºadnymi petycjami ani skargami. Po pierwsze, liczƒÖ siƒô pieniƒÖdze, a ceny na gry sƒÖ r√≥≈ºne zale≈ºnie od regionu. Po drugie, podatki od sprzeda≈ºy, jakie p≈Çaci Microsoft te≈º sƒÖ r√≥≈ºne zale≈ºnie od regionu, w kt√≥rym sprzedajƒÖ. Po trzecie,
 pa≈Ñstwa majƒÖ swoje regulacje prawne i np. Niemcy sƒÖ bardzo restrykcyjne odno≈õnie przemocy w grach, do tego stopnia, ≈ºe gry brutalne albo wcale nie sƒÖ tam dostƒôpne, albo zostajƒÖ drastycznie okrojone. Je≈õli Microsoft chce sprzedawaƒá na terenie Niemiec, to te≈º
 musi siƒô dostosowaƒá i nie wydawaƒá gier, kt√≥rych tam nie chcƒÖ, lub dbaƒá o to, ≈ºeby by≈Çy w takiej postaci, jak oni chcƒÖ. Do tego te≈º s≈Çu≈ºy blokada regionalna i bƒôdzie zawsze. Jeste≈õ w Niemczech, podlegasz ich prawu.</p>
<p>O ile konstytucja to czƒô≈õƒá prawa i ma s≈Çu≈ºyƒá obywatelom, o tyle regulaminy firm majƒÖ s≈Çu≈ºyƒá tylko ich interesom, a nie klientom. Kapitalizm. Zawsze tak by≈Ço i bƒôdzie.</p>

<p>Sorry wszystko jestem w stanie zrozumieƒá ale po ostatnich newsach tym bardziej ≈ºa≈Çujƒô zakupu konsoli. Dowiedzia≈Çem siƒô ≈ºe najnowsze PlayStation nie ma ogranicze≈Ñ regionalnych i nie sprawia u≈ºytkownikom tego typu problem√≥w... mo≈ºna? Mo≈ºna! Dlatego tym bardziej

<p>O jakich prawach i przywilejach m√≥wisz i gdzie sƒÖ one zapisane?</p>
<p>Klient wyra≈ºa swojƒÖ wolƒô portfelem. Je≈õli nie jeste≈õ zadowolony z konsoli, sprzedaj jƒÖ i kup konsolƒô konkurencji, wiƒôcej nic nie zrobisz. Jedynie w ten spos√≥b mo≈ºesz wyraziƒá sw√≥j protest. Jak ludzie przestanƒÖ kupowaƒá Xboxy, wtedy dopiero Microsoft zastanowi
 siƒô nad zmianƒÖ regulacji.</p>
<p>Je≈õli chodzi o blokadƒô regionalnƒÖ Playstation, to nie ma jej tylko na papierze. W specyfikacji jest zapis, ≈ºe Sony nie wprowadza blokady regionalnej na gry, ale producent gry mo≈ºe wprowadziƒá blokadƒô regionalnƒÖ i Sony bƒôdzie jƒÖ respektowaƒá (na PS3 sƒÖ to pojedyncze
 tytu≈Çy, nigdy nie interesowa≈Çem siƒô, czy ju≈º co≈õ blokujƒÖ na PS4). Podejrzewam, ≈ºe gry sprzeczne z prawem np. w Niemczech, gdzie cenzura na brutalno≈õƒá w grach obowiƒÖzuje, albo w og√≥le nie sƒÖ dostƒôpne, albo majƒÖ okrojone wersje z blokadƒÖ na wszystkie inne. Ponadto,
 o ile z za≈Ço≈ºenia nie blokujƒÖ regionalnie gier, to wszystkie DLC sƒÖ u nich blokowane regionalnie. DLC musi byƒá z tego samego regionu co gra, kt√≥rƒÖ masz, inaczej nie bƒôdzie dzia≈Çaƒá. Je≈õli chodzi o Niemcy, to tam Sony nawet blokuje regionalnie us≈Çugƒô Share Play,
 kt√≥ra umo≈ºliwia dzielenie siƒô bibliotekƒÖ gier z innymi i granie razem. Na pewno jakie≈õ gry majƒÖ zablokowane regionalnie ze wzglƒôdu na cenzurƒô, inaczej Share Play nie by≈Çoby u nich problemem.</p>
<p>Co najciekawsze, na forach Microsoftu ludzie piszƒÖ, ≈ºe konsola i polityka tej firmy jest do niczego i przechodzƒÖ do konkurencji. Na forach Sony sytuacja jest identyczna. W takim razie kto ma racjƒô? :) W obu obozach sƒÖ spore niedogodno≈õci, ale nie zauwa≈ºysz
 ich, dop√≥ki nie dotknƒÖ ciebie osobi≈õcie.</p>

<p>Co do DLC to nie mam pojƒôcia skƒÖd to wiesz, bo u mnie nie by≈Ço z nimi ≈ºadnych problem√≥w. Niezale≈ºnie czy do gry z Polski czy z Niemiec. Je≈õli chodzi z kolei o okrojone wydania gier w Niemczech to tez pic na wodƒô. W sklepach sƒÖ dostƒôpne dwa r√≥≈ºne wydania
 pude≈Çkowe - okrojona np z krwi i w normalnej wersji, troszkƒô dro≈ºsza od 18 roku ≈ºycia. Nie widzƒô problemu w takim razie by konsola zarejestrowana na pe≈Çnoletniego u≈ºytkownika mia≈Ça mo≈ºliwo≈õƒá w Niemczech pobierania pe≈Çnych tytu≈Ç√≥w.</p>
<p>Skoro tego typu sytuacje majƒÖ miejsce to wolƒô by Microsoft zni√≥s≈Ç ograniczenia regionalne, a w razie ogranicze≈Ñ ze strony producenta bƒÖd≈∫ innych czynnik√≥w zastaƒá komunikat o problemie w pobieraniu. Bo to jest istna paranoja by produkcje takie jak Tomb Raider
 by≈Çy zablokowane w Niemczech tylko ze wzglƒôdu na r√≥≈ºnice regionalne... gdzie tam krew i przemoc?

<p>Te≈º bym wola≈Ç, ≈ºeby nie by≈Ço ogranicze≈Ñ regionalnych, jak chyba ka≈ºdy, bo to le≈ºy w interesie graczy, ale te≈º nie zale≈ºy to od u≈ºytkownik√≥w. W kapitalizmie korporacje robiƒÖ co mogƒÖ dla maksymalizacji zysku. W Sony rzekomy brak blokady regionalnej te≈º jest
 chwytem marketingowym, majƒÖcym przyciƒÖgnƒÖƒá klientelƒô. Restrykcje regionalne sƒÖ poukrywane. A kto wiƒôcej na tym zyskuje - Microsoft na blokadach, czy Sony na kuszƒÖcej polityce? Pewnie obu siƒô to op≈Çaca. Co do DLC, wiem to z autopsji. Do jakiej gry na Playstation
 jedno DLC dzia≈Ça≈Ço ci w obu wersjach gier?</p>

<p>Sorry ale Microsoft w europie bardzo traci. O miliony wiƒôcej sprzedanych konsol z PlayStation ni≈º Xbox a to ze wzglƒôdu na politykƒô Microsoftu. A to ze gry sƒÖ nie ciekawe a to te ograniczenia itd. Microsoft dobrze siƒô czuje jedynie w USA gdzie zaledwie paroma
 tysiƒÖcami sprzedanych konsol g√≥ruje nad Sony. Xbox traci rynek europejski i to jest w≈Ça≈õnie moment na reakcjƒô i zmianƒô przepis√≥w i regulamin√≥w. Nie sƒÖdzƒô by ograniczenia na PlayStation by≈Çy a≈º tak mƒôczƒÖce zw≈Çaszcza ze nie ka≈ºdy producent gier ma widzimisiƒô

                    <div>I&nbsp; cannot create a usb recovery drive in Win 10.&nbsp; I have built a new machine with a clean install of Win10 Home.&nbsp; Every usb drive I have tried (all 8 gb or larger, mostly 16's) is immediately recognized by win10,
 appears in the File Explorer, appears in Disc Management as healthy, can be read and written to, etc.&nbsp; HOWEVER if I try to create a recovery drive none of them are recognized, the "next" box remains grayed out and I have to just cancel.&nbsp; I have even reformatted
 one of them as FAT32 (which it had been anyway).&nbsp; It made no difference.&nbsp; It will not recognize any drive in any usb port on my system for this one purpose, but sees them all just fine in every other application.&nbsp; I have rebooted more than once.&nbsp; I am up to
 date according to Windows update and have experienced no USB related problems on my system so far except this one anomaly.&nbsp; From reading forums I know I am not alone on this.&nbsp; What good is this feature if it does not work?&nbsp; MS, GET IT FIXED!!!</div>

            Can you please tell me more information about how it is not working?  Do you get an error?
<br />Did you reboot after changing the registry and creating the scheduled task? Have you tried installing something that would make a change to the registry to see if creates the backup?

                    <p>Hello dear xbox and Microsoft and the Xbox live policy enforcement team I‚Äôm speaking on behalf of my brother that got all his accounts and consoles and ip addresses banned for life until the year 9999 he‚Äôs very angry and stressed about this because of your company doing this to him and causing him to have pains in his body because of loads of people reporting him and he‚Äôs also gotten the police involved as well and now he can‚Äôt sell his banned consoles to any game shop so I think it should be banned to ban consoles in my opinion thank you Xbox have a good wonderful day&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Mail and Calendar App crashing when accessing settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bellad 10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail and Calendar App crashing when accessing settings</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp; Just wondering if anyone has this problem and a solution.&nbsp; Since about November, after an update to the Mail and Calendar App, I cannot access some of the settings options; specifically the signature option, quick actions and notifications.&nbsp; When I
 click on those the app hangs for about 2 seconds and then crashes.&nbsp; I could access personalization and reading options.&nbsp; There was another update today, and it's gotten worse.&nbsp; Focused inbox now has its own options.&nbsp; That also cannot be accessed without the
 app crashing. A pity 'cos I hate the Focused inbox and I now cannot access the setting to remove it.&nbsp; I have uninstalled and reinstalled, done a reset of my PC, reset the app - multiple times. Very weird as the app works fine on my old surface pro 3 and was
 working fine until November.&nbsp; I'm running a Surface Pro New and everything else is fantastic.&nbsp; Except for this app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help would be very much appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Andre</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked.&nbsp; I signed in using the Administrator and no problems with Mail and Calendar App at all.&nbsp; To answer your other questions the Surface I use was bought installed with version 1607 - I think.&nbsp; It was purchased in about July 2017. The version currently
 installed is 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My next question now is do I have to use the Administrator account permanently?&nbsp; How do I fix the problem on my normal user account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for coming back to me so quickly.&nbsp; Further help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Andre not sure why you can't see my response. Short answer is using the admin account worked. No problems with the app. My current build is 1709. The version installed on purchase was 1607. Thank you for responding. Any ideas what i can do to fix the
 problem for my normal user account?</p>

            Use the following script to remove the Mail app under your account:
<br />

<br />
<br />Next, download the Mail app again from the Store:
<br />
<br />Get Mail and Calendar - Microsoft Store

<br />
<br />If that does not work, I recommend you backup and create a new user account:

<p>Hi Andre</p>
<p>
</p><p>A quick update.&nbsp; I have set up a new user profile as you suggested. Bad news.&nbsp; After initially working as intended the Mail and Calendar app shows the same behaviour as on my original profile; that is, I can't access certain settings and when I do the app
 hangs and then crashes after about 5 seconds.&nbsp; Cannot work it out as the app works fine on another older Surface that I own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe unfixable but any other ideas you have would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

<p>Wow and ok Andre.&nbsp; I will give this a go but quick question. If I downgrade then won't Windows keep trying to update me to the latest version anyway meaning I have the same problems again? Also, does this mean I will be going back to the version of Windows
 prior to the Fall Creators Update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player 12 Library not rebuilding</h2>
                    <p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold">Windows Media Player 12 Library Issues</span><br />
<br />
The library settings for WMP on my Win7 x86 Ult PC appear to have become corrupted after I hit a BSOD just as I saved a new network folder to the Music library settings. It was fine until then, but after rebooting, going to Organize&gt;Manage Libraries&gt;Music does
 not return a screen. Other libraries, such as Picture will open a screen and can be maintained, but it appears that media in these folders will not actually populate the view.</p>
<p>A System Restore to a point prior to the BSOD did not fix the issue.</p>
<p>Running MS FixIt for Windows Media Player did not fix the issue.</p>
<p>Running sfc /scannow did not detect any problems.</p>
<p>Removing the library and settings by deleting the AppData/Microsoft/Media Player folder did not help.</p>
<p>The only possible solution that I am aware of that I havent tried is uninstalling/reinstalling WMP via Add/Remove features - this I am _extremely_ reluctant to do for the simple reason that this step also appears to uninstall Windows Media Center, which
 I have lavished countless hours on over the last four years getting setup to my preferences - and there are also OEM modifications (its an older Sony VAIO) such as Disc Changer support and background art that I would struggle to restore.</p>
<p>Having to reinstall Media Center from scratch would be an even bigger disaster than losing the Music Library, which is a pretty big disaster already.</p>
<p>Does anyone know any way to fix this issue _without_ losing all my Media Center settings?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PROBLEM RESOLVED</p>
<p>I noticed another possible solution in another thread and it worked - in explorer delete the music&nbsp; folder from the "Libraries" section, right-click the "Libraries" section header and select "Restore default libraries" from the menu.</p>
<p>I was then able to open WMP and add my network folder via the Organize feature successfully .</p>

<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of your phone?
<br />Which version of Android is installed?
<br />
<br />Are you actually referring to 'screenshots' or pictures saved from within Skype to your phone?
<br />

    <title>Can Win10 be installed in a different PC than the one the HDD will be - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> magnettherobot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can Win10 be installed in a different PC than the one the HDD will be used in&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Sorry if the question sounds a bit confusing. My brother just recently upgraded from win7 to win10 and would like a clean install because, amongst other reasons, his keyboard and mouse wont work!</p>
<p>Obviously, without any usable input to reinstall win10 even throigh bios, i thoight i could do the clean install for him.</p>
<p>My question is; can i put his HDD in my pc (in series with my win7 HDD) and do the clean install on his HDD, and will it work when its put back in his pc? Or does it have to somehow be done inside his rig so the hardware is consistent for the install?</p>
<p>Any assistance appreciated, please let me know if you need more info!</p>

            <p>That is not what was asked. He is saying that he cannot install windows in computer A. And is it possible to install windows in computer B and move hard drive from computer B to computer A.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect that might not work, however I am also interested in this question. And I would be happy if someone would confirm if that can be done or not. I am also having problems with installation and maybe that could be an opption.</p>

            <p>Had the same issue with myself and my husband's game: we both have the same version of Asphalt 8 playing on windows10 laptops.
<br />
<strong>Solved it</strong> by setting up a <strong>private </strong>network with a
<strong>homegroup </strong>(a windows feature - which in itself caused a bit of trouble - many windows services needed to be auto-enabled and other network settings checked- however, how to create and join a windows homegroup is well described elsewhere and
 not necessarily difficult!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once both computers where joined to the homegroup, we were able to create and join our own local wi-fi races in Asphalt 8.
