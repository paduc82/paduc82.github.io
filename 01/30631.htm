    <title>Files become locked after being moved. Please help&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Files become locked after being moved. Please help&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I am running XP Home SP3. i recently had to repair my OS from my computer's OSDisk, because of an OS crash. Almost everything works fine now, except whenever i move any sort of file or folder (regardless of the means of moving it [Copying, Cutting, or Dragging]
 ). After I move the file or folder, whenever I try to access it, it tells me that access is denied, and I cannot delete the items without the use of outside programs like FileAssassin.</p>
<p>Although I realize that there are plenty of people that will say "Go into safe mode and give yourself permissions..." That may allow me to delete THESE files, but it will not solve the problem, and allow me to move files from here on out.</p>
<p>Any Help would be Greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I would have to question how the files were placed back on the disk after recovering from the OS Crash.&nbsp; It is possible that these files are still attached to the owner on the previous system.&nbsp; Even though your user name might be the same on the new system,
 the owner as determined by Windows is based on the SecureID (SID) on the file, which will be different on the two systems.&nbsp; My first step would be to go to the top directory of these restored files and take ownership of them to make sure that your new user
 ID owns them:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Java itself will not do harm to your computer, but you need to make sure to keep it up-to-date.</p>
<p>Java, Adobe software (Flash, Reader), and Windows tend to be targeted as the primary&nbsp;gateway

    <title>Viva Pinata Trouble in Paradise hard crashing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deadpooldixon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Viva Pinata Trouble in Paradise hard crashing</h2>
                    
<p>Every time I try to play Viva Pinata Trouble in Paradise, either via Rare Replay or the regular backwards compatible version, the game loads up, gets to the press start screen only to immediately crash when I press start. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling
 it, clearing my local 360 save cache, everything that Xbox Twitter Support said to try all to no avail. It's really aggravating me because I only have 5 achievements left in the game and would like to get them but am unable to because the game always wants
 to crash. Does anybody know of any way to fix this issue?</p>

            <p>Hey, DeadpoolDixon! Sorry to see troubleshooting didn't help you out. It sounds like your save might be corrupted. I checked with Twitter to see what all you've tried, and I see that it works for you when you are not signed in. Based on all the other troubleshooting you've done, it's likely the save isn't able to be loaded.</p>
<p>Have you tried to delete your save, go offline (disconnect from the internet), and then launch up the game while signed in to your profile there? (Note: Your save will still be on the cloud, but you have to go offline to make sure your Xbox One doesn't automatically sync when you launch the game.) If that works, then the save is no good and you'll have to start another one. If it still crashes, then it's something else. Let us know if that works for you!</p>

<p>Literally none of those topics cover what I'm dealing with. The game simply crashes whenever I press Start while I'm signed in, online or offline. I also have no saved data for it outside of the reserved space. Lastly, it works when I'm not signed in but
 that defeats the purpose of trying to play it since I can't get the last 5 achievements I need in it because I'm not able to be signed in. I got it both digitally and in Rare Replay, both versions do the exact same thing.</p>

<h2>            Forwarding an email takes too long time to open the page in window live mail</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am using window live mail as an email client on my desktop and configured my pop account into it. In the starting everything was going fine. But from last two weeks I am facing an issue, when I am trying to forward an email using window live mail
 from send items or inbox, the forwarding page is taking too long time to open i.e. nearly 20 to 25 seconds or more. It seems that there might be some issues of viruses or something is blocking it from opening.&nbsp;This is quite awkward.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have tried my best doing repairing of wlm and uninstalling and installing it again, scanned with malwarebytes and other software too, but nothing works. I have also searched for help online, tried but same nothing works.
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Overall request someone to please help me out of this situation. I would be kind thankful to his/her kind attention to my query.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Syed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a <strong>pop account</strong> provided by my company of its own domain name. I am using this from last 4 months and it was working fine . But from few days before I am facing this kind of issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to send same email to many people, so once I send an email I just forward to the rest from the sent items. On forwarding it from sent items, the forwarding page takes too long time to open i.e. about 15-20 seconds.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Therefore request you once again to guide me through the useful steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Is my rundll32.exe Corrupted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> severus46  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is my rundll32.exe Corrupted</h2>
                    I believe my Windows XP Media Center Edition is suffering from a corruption/virus it looks like rundll32.exe is at fault because on boot-up the machine sometimes starts but very slowly and occasionally disrupts Norton Internet Security stopping antivirus
 and firewall. &nbsp;I have a similar XP machine and have copied the setup RUNDLL32.EX_ to "Windows32" then renamed the suspect file and before I can replace with the suspect file with new a new copy of the old rundll32.exe is automatically restored.
<div><br />

<div>My original ADVENT OEM setup disc cannot be found so how can I check then correct the problem.</div>

            Although you very well may have a malware problem, it's not all that likely that rundll32.exe is corrupted.&nbsp; As you have seen, Windows automatically replaces rundll32.exe automatically with a good copy anytime something attempts to delete or change that
 file.<br />
<br />
What service pack is installed? Right click My Computer and select Properties for information.<br />
<br />
How long have you had NIS, and have you kept it up to date automatically?<br />
<br />
If you see any error message, please provided the complete text, without paraphrasing.<br />
<br />
Even though you have NIS (which may itself be a part of your problems), please do the following:<br />
<br />
Download, install, update, and run scans with each of the following free programs (do not install the free trial of the "Pro" versions and be careful to UNcheck any option during the installation to install anything like the Ask Toolbar or similar add-on software).&nbsp;
 Don't run the scans simultaneously.&nbsp; Each scan will take quite some time, so start one up and go do a non-computer chore for a while.<br />
<br />
When a scan completes, permit the program to delete any malware that it finds. <br />
<br />
You may uninstall either or both of the scanners when complete.&nbsp; If you choose to keep SUPERAntiSpyware, I suggest that you change its configuration so that it doesn't start every time you start Windows.<br />

            That's right...<br />
<br />
Windows File Protection looks after 3498 XP files (yes - there is a list on <a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
my SkyDrive</a>)<br />
<br />
If you rename or delete one of those protected files, WFP will want to replace it with the backup copy that it keeps in the DLLCACHE folder (that is what that folder is for).&nbsp; That is why you can't simply delete it and replace it - you don't have time.&nbsp; WFP
 will replace it for you since that is what WFP does.<br />
<br />
WFP will quickly and silently replace the file and put a message like this in the Event Viewer System log:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64002<br />
Description:<br />
File replacement was attempted on the protected system file c:\windows\system32\<b>rundll32.exe</b>. This file was restored to the original version to maintain system stability. The file version of the system file is 5.1.2600.5512.<br />
<br />
To see for yourself, rename the rundll32.exe file to something like rundll32.xxx and almost before you can blink, it will be silently replaced with the backup copy in the DLLCACHE folder.&nbsp; That is WFP in action.&nbsp; I just did it and you can see above the Event
 Viewer message from my system.<br />
<br />
So it sounds like that part is working okay and that is a good thing...&nbsp; but if you are seeing some kind of rundll32 error, you need to tell us more about your system and exactly what the message says (like LemP suggests).<br />

            Your error report from NIS seems quite common.&nbsp; I haven't really looked at many of the posts, but I've seen suggestions to
<a href="https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/v80281719_EndUserProfile_en_us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
uninstall NIS and then run Norton's Power Eraser</a> and I've also seen a suggestion to uninstall NIS 2013 and go back to NIS 2012.<br />
<br />
Frankly, if I were you, I'd uninstall NIS using the Norton Removal Tool and then install some other amtivirus product, especially if your NIS subscription is anywhere close to the end.&nbsp; You can get any number of opinions on what a/v to use, but my suggestions
 are <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Security Essentials</a> (free) or <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/home/products/antivirus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Hello,<br />
<br />
Sorry for the trouble. I am Vineeth and I am from the Norton Support team.<br />
<br />
Do you still receive the error 8506,421 even after uninstalling and reinstalling the Norton product?<br />
<br />
Can you please run a scan using the free Norton Power Eraser tool and see if it reports any threats: http://www.Norton.com/npe?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

I am happy that Norton performs as I expect and although I have had to reinstall at least three times (which is time consuming) the cause is almost certainly in the boot process. &nbsp;One of your colleagues stepped me through the first reinstall and advised that
 the slow boot process meant that Norton performs a check for virus updates and because the IP address was not allocated in time there was no internet connection and the process timed out. (thats how I understood it).
<div>I have now set the IP address "as Fixed" rather than dynamic to try to get round that eventuality and will use Norton Power Eraser and report the findings soon.</div>

That sounds plausible<br />
<br />
<blockquote>I have now set the IP address "as Fixed" rather than dynamic to try to get round that eventuality&nbsp;</blockquote>
That's unlikely to help.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
There are a number of network activities that take place when your computer is booted up.&nbsp; If your network adapter is configured with the Windows default to have its IP address allocated automatically, one of the activities is a short series of messages between
 your computer and a DHCP server (generally in your home router).&nbsp; Unless your computer has been turned off for more than a day or so, the "lease" of the computer's IP address will probably have not expired, and the computer will request that the DHCP server
 "reallocate" the same address.&nbsp; This is a shorter process than the IP address "allocation" process that happens when a computer is first connected to a network (or is connected after having been powered off for a time long enough for its lease to have expired).<br />
<br />
However, whether your computer is asking to have an IP address allocated for the first time, asking to have a previously-allocated IP address reallocated, or using a manually-configured (static) IP address, one of the final steps taken before "getting down
 to business" is checking to see if there is another computer on the network that is using the same IP address.&nbsp; It does this by broadcasting a message to ALL of the devices on the network using a technology called ARP (address resolution protocol).<br />
<br />
The check for potential duplicate IP address goes something like this:<br />
<ol>
<li>When ready to check (e.g., after being tentatively allocated an IP address by a DHCP server or sooner if all of the parameters normally supplied by the DHCP server have been manually configured), the system waits for up to 1 second before making its broadcast.</li><li>The system then sends 3 "probe" packets, evenly spaced 1 to 2 seconds apart.&nbsp;
<br />
</li><li>If no other device on the network responds by 2 seconds after the last probe request is sent, the system assumes that the IP address that it wants to use is OK.</li></ol>
<p>There thus can be a delay of up to 7 seconds before the system decides that its IP address -- even a manually-assigned static IP address -- is safe to use.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If NIS attempts to use the Internet during that period and gets "confused" resulting in a longer than normal boot up period, that's a failure on the part of the Norton design team and yet another reason to get rid of that product.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'd be interested to learn if configuring a static IP address does in fact speed things up for you.<br />
</p>
<br />
<blockquote>will use Norton Power Eraser and report the findings soon.
</blockquote>
<br />
That's <b>probably</b> a good idea in any case.&nbsp; As I understand it, Norton Power Eraser will check for rootkits and other deeply-hidden malware not easily detected by "normal" antivirus programs.&nbsp; Be aware, however, that
<a href="https://security.symantec.com/nbrt/npe.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Norton advises</a>:&nbsp; "Because Norton Power Eraser uses aggressive methods to detect threats,
<strong><em>there is a risk that it can select some legitimate programs for removal. If you accidently remove a legitimate program, you can run Norton Power Eraser to review past repair sessions and undo them.</em></strong>"<br />

            Hi BARRAQUILLO,<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> I would recommend you to update the Display Adapter drivers first.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a>
<br />
<br />
<strong>2. </strong>Instead of checking the usb hub for power management tab check for Mouse and Keyboard power management tab.<br />
You may also check under Network adapter and Display adapter for Power management tab.<br />
<br />
Follow the steps below: (Check for Display adapter, Network adapter, mouse and keyboard)<br />
Check if allow this device to wake the computer is checked in Device Manager.<br />
1. Click Start, type Device manager in the Start search box and hit Enter.<br />
2. Select keyboard, it will display your keyboard, right click and select ‘Properties’. (<strong>Do not go to USB hub</strong> )<br />
3. Select the ‘Power management’ tab.<br />
4. Check the “Allow this device to wake the computer” check box.<br />
5. Repeat these steps for Mouse and Network adapters as well.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Follow the link for HP support:<br />

<h2>            Hidden network problems</h2>

<p>
</p><p>I recently got myself windows 10 on my laptop and is having a lot of issues with it . The biggest one is my wifi connection</p>
<p>we have 4 different routers in our base camp &nbsp;that are set up as hidden networks . Why do i have to enter the ssid code and password every time i restart my pc . Is there a way so it can connect automatically without having to retype everything . Note i
 did click the connect automatic box </p>

            <p><span>Hi Henil,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From your issue description I understand that, you are unable to install MAAX Payne 3, receiving error: isdone.dll extraction failed. I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. Don’t worry; we will certainly help you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let’s follow these methods and check if it fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Perform clean boot and try to install the game.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Clean boot will help us identify if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>To do this, follow steps from this link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: </span></strong><span>After checking the functionality in clean boot, c<span>onfigure Windows to use Normal startup. Refer step 3 from the above link for details.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: If you have installed any non Microsoft antivirus application, disable it.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Follow the steps to disable security software:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Search for the security software installed in your computer in the Windows 8 search option.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on <strong>Settings</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Uncheck the option to <strong>
turn on security</strong> software.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on <strong>Save changes</strong> button.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>After disabling security software, check if you are able to install the game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Do not worry even if you disable third party antivirus, windows Defender will still be running in the computer, so your computer is safe.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>Hope this will be helpful. If you still have further queries, please reply us and we will be happy to help you.

 to use the dial pad on an automated support call and the dial pad is totally useless thus I can no longer take advantage of Skype support as the call hangs up as I cannot use the dial pad numbers to make my option selections. Previously this functionality
 was perfect and now it is far from that. Please fix or tell me how to get around this.</span>

</p><p>Makes no sense why these two different versions (Skype for Desktop and Windows 10 app) are different, even on a Microsoft OS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway.&nbsp; I didn't want to use the app, but guess i will so I can have the dialpad feature.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you are trying to print in Edge Browser use CTRL + P or click the little 3 dots in<br />
the top right corner (under the "X" then - Print.<br />
<br />
As OEM Canon is responsible for the proper operation of the printer and their<br />
supplied drivers. Check with Canon Support, their on-line documentation, and <br />
drivers.<br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />

<p>desculpa se a resposta parecer estranha, copiei de outro post com problema parecido.</p>
<p>Olá,</p>
<p>Infelizmente você não vai receber nenhuma resposta oficial aqui, por que só existem moderadores no fórum americano.</p>
<p>Mas o seu caso não é o primeiro nem o último, e acho que posso dar uma luz sobre o que aconteceu. Algum bug atacou o banco de dados da microsoft e deixou vários usuários com dupla regionalidade, o sistema deles faz uma varredura de todos os usuários de tempos
 em tempos, quando encontra essa dupla regionalidade acaba por cancelar a assinatura gold automaticamente.</p>
<p>Você deve entrar em contato com o suporte, pode usar o link ao final do post, e comunicar o que aconteceu, se puder em minha conta-&gt; transações ou então conferir no email a confirmação da compra da assinatura ajuda. Eles vão pedir algum tempo para analisar
 o seu caso, mas depois ele vão regularizar sua situação, houve caso até em que o usuário desistiu do serviço e teve a compra estornada do cartão.</p>

    <title>System_Service_Error dxgmms2.sys BSOD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abeltensor  say:</h3>
<h2>            System_Service_Error dxgmms2.sys BSOD</h2>
                    <p>So I use my computer a lot for gaming and 3d cad work. &nbsp;I've been getting these random BSODs since i started using windows 10 (never had a single one on windows 7 or 8/8.1). &nbsp; Recently the System_service_errors had no file associated with them so I went
 and reinstalled all my chipset drivers and GPU drivers and checked my ram and hard-drive integrity. &nbsp; The one before this most recent one happened as i was installing the new Nvidia drivers from their site (I always run a clean install with new drivers), and
 I got stuck in a BSOD loop, the computer would try to install the drivers and then crash in the middle. &nbsp;I was finally able to fix this problem by forcing the computer into safe mode and aborting the driver installation, manually removing the GPU driver and
 then installing it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A week later or so I encounter this BSOD with the dxgmms2.sys file as a specified problem while playing SC2:LoTV. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the DMP files, if anyone knows what i can do to fix this specific problem i would appreciate it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>

            <p>If Microsoft wants people to use Windows 10, they need to stop causing problems like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This also happened to me. Windows decided it was going to change the video driver even though I installed the most recent one from Nvidia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So unless Microsoft is going to QA every software update, they need to stop "updating" these drivers.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 - Parental Controls - why they are worse than before - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgelashkhi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Parental Controls - why they are worse than before</h2>
                    <p>Disclaimer: What follows relates to comparison between Windows 7 and 10 parental controls (or family management, as it is called in the latter), I never used 8.1 parental controls.<br />
<br />
Gist of the message: parental controls on Windows 10 are change for the worse<br />
<br />
For the two main reasons:<br />
<br />
1. You can't change them locally - internet access is required. Now, imagine situation of traveling with the kid on the back seat dying of boredom and asking to be given a laptop. It's outside the scope of their screen-time, but you can't change it on the road,
 unless you find a spot to connect to internet first.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
2. Screen time can be set only as a whole bulk - so, "On time", "Off time", "Overall usage time" in between the first two. Now, in Windows 7 I used to handpick hours kid could have used laptop in - the point being, I don't only want to be able to limit the&nbsp;<strong>overall
</strong>screen-time, but also span down <strong>sessions.</strong> The way it has been handled in&nbsp;Windows 10, and knowing my kid (9 years old gaming addict :( ), he will use all his hours up in one go - damaging his sight in the process, I fear.<br />
<br />
Or else, I will have to keep going to the control page every day, every odd hour, tweaking it all the time so he wouldn't be spending more than an hour at the laptop at a time. Thank you very much, Microsoft, I could not have dreamed of anything better to do
 with&nbsp;<em>my </em>time then doing the drill from now on daily.<br />
<br />
Now, apply the need to my point one - lack of net access. What if I'm in a meeting? What if my phone battery dies? What if I'm in a place with bad coverage? What if I fail to connect to the net, fail to tweak the time? What is I simply forget, one day? The
 kid is left without an hour of gaming they expected to have in their usual time (drill applied in Windows 7 was - 1 hour in the morning, 1 hour after school, 1 hour before bedtime), that hour they believe to be rightfully/habitually theirs?<br />
<br />
We have hurt feelings and quarreling. Thank you very much Microsoft, once again...<br />
<br />
Solution:<br />
<br />
<strong>1. We need an option to be able to tweak parental controls locally, on the machine itself, not in the cloud only</strong><br />
<strong>2. We need an option to be able to pick out "allowed hours", not only "As early as" till "No later than" with "limit per day" in between.
</strong><br />
<br />
Come on! Even android apps can do that, I have one on the kid's phone, blocking everything but calling and messaging according to a schedule. Having seen Windows type of parental controls, I very much doubt I'll be switching to Windows phone for the kid any
 time soon.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It is nice to have an ability to change settings for all windows devices in one go, I admit. &nbsp;And time limits with enough flexibility to let kids themselves choose when to use said limits up&nbsp;might be a great option for older kids/teenagers, but for 9 year olds
 and younger, who can't yet control themselves, who get carried away and can't keep track of time while gaming, it's not the best of solutions, believe me.&nbsp;<br />

            And it's not even working properly, keeps messing up limited and allowed hours<br />
<br />
With the message "come back on such and such time tomorrow", while I clearly have the time set as allowed&nbsp;<br />
<br />
More than unhappy, more than useless, do something about it, please<br />

<p>Not only that, but for Microsoft to state that a child is safer with their own email, their own account, etc, is absolutely crazy. Then to activate the poorly designed features, they expect the parents to enter a credit or debit card to make that happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
What a complete and utter rip off. I will be spending the extra money on buying my son a Mac Book and eliminating all Windows devices at this point. Leave it to Microsoft to take something that was operational and make it useless.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Throttle problem with Flight Simulator X</h2>
                    When I start a free flight everything seems to be fine but then the plane will throttle up on its own, then when I put it back to normal the same happens again,. I have tried with and without my joystick but I still get the same problem and I have tried
 many different aircraft but still get the same problem, I am using a windows 7 pakard bell pc with 6gb ram and 1tb hard drive
