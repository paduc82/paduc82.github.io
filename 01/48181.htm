Let me know if it doesn't and I'll look for something else. In fact, let me know if it does so that others will know this works if they have the same problem.<br />

Best of luck

<h2>            Xbox 360 S or Skyrim disc issue&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I recently got a new 250GB Xbox 360 (I think thats the S?) after my previous Xbox 360 died due to disc reader failure. Its worked great on all the games I've tried playing on it, until I tried to play Skyrim. It will read the disc and immediately go to a
 black screen. One time it asked to update for skyrim, then it disconnected from xbox live and booted me to the dashboard. Now all it does is go to a black screen and often times becomes unresponsive. Any ideas what the problem is? Skyrim worked best on the
 old xbox before it got too bad to play games.</p>

<p>I've got 1000 of 1000 GS and 100% completion on Skyrim, all played on a XBOX 250Gb S model. I logged over 70 hours with zero lockups or glitches of any kind, So, I don' think it's your console's version. Try clearing your cache and downloading that failed
 update over again. Hope that helps.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Surface video has no sound</h2>
                    I have a Microsoft Surface and I wanted to record videos but when I have they do not have any sound.&nbsp; I have looked at the settings and the internet for an answer but cannot see how I can record sound with a video.&nbsp; There is a volume setting on the playback
 but even turned up fully there is no sound.&nbsp; Can anyone help me to record a video with sound.&nbsp; All the forums seem to be saying go to settings and then set up the microphone but it does appear to be working as the green bars move when I speak to test it.&nbsp;
 I am going to get rid of it and buy something else that does record videos with sound if someone can suggest a better computer please.

<p>I'm not sure who you are but a big thank you&nbsp;for responding&nbsp;so quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;have tried all the suggested 'fixes' except 'reset'.&nbsp;&nbsp;The trouble-shooter's&nbsp;listed and download reported back&nbsp;everything is working properly?&nbsp; and forced start did not cure the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read about 'reset' and it seems to me, with my limited skills, I would best not attempt this.&nbsp;&nbsp;I might do something irreversible, but also lose some programmes I have installed and I don't know how to re-install them.&nbsp; Its an age thing so I am going to
 PC World tomorrow to see if they have a tablet made by someone else that records sound when taking a video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Surface never did record the sound with video, the speakers always worked as did the headphones with the media player, but I have never been able to get it to record sound with video.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems strange to me&nbsp;that buying a Microsoft computer because it should work with Microsoft software, but doesn't, means trying all these solutions - this was the main reason for purchasing the surface,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not technically proficient so just wanted something to 'use out of the box' so to speak.&nbsp; I'm really fed up with Microsoft as I think this is a real let down on their part - it's like buying a car only to find the headlights don't work, but if you re-build
 the engine - they might....thank you again for your help.</p>

<h2>            Cannot remove Windows 10 Insider program&#47;builds</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I want to unenroll from the Windows Insider program as I'm getting a number of issues with Office applications which are now actually stopping me from being able to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've followed the recommended process - Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Advanced &gt; Stop Insider Builds .... but whenever I select this it does nothing. The main setting panel with have the 'processing' spinning circle, but then my credentials just re-appear
 there again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also selected the 'Need to stop getting builds permanently?' option but this just instructs the same process to remove a device and when I follow through via the links provided the same thing happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas or suggestions are highly appreciated!</p>

            <p>I have had nothing but issues with the Insider builds since agreeing to participate in the program, to the point to where even undertaking the simplest operation takes 3 times longer. Programs previously installed under Windows 10 no longer operate. If I
 open a window, I have to close/minimize every other open window before I can reach it. The notifications tab in the lower right corner is totally useless as the tab window closes as soon as I move my mouse off of the button. Edge is terrible but now my IE11
 is beginning to freeze up. While the above instructions look simple, the reality is that you cannot opt out of the program. I have tried several times to opt out without success. It turns into a circular argument and the only actions taken by MS actually cause
 more problems, and you still have the flaky Insider build you don't want. They even deleted my System Restore points, ensuring that I can't return to my original Windows 10 OS. The only alternative Microsoft offers is to format your drive and completely reinstall
 everything. Thank you Microsoft for completely screwing up, what was a perfectly good installed operating system, forcing me to spend the next several days formatting and reinstalling my original Windows 10 OS and all of my other software.</p>

<p>AMEN BROTHER ED&nbsp;- Pardon me but&nbsp;I'll even one-up ya' a bit here if&nbsp;I may. I&nbsp;went so far as to buy&nbsp;a new lumia phone&nbsp;just over a year ago, thinking it would be&nbsp;the perfect&nbsp;match - Well as sure&nbsp;as if they came from the same orphanage, I swear I adopted my
 PC's runt twin brother and they both seem to have inherited that&nbsp;same&nbsp;bad gene. You know -&nbsp;The one&nbsp;there ain't no cure for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now without taking any swipes at&nbsp;our tireless expert hero's here in the&nbsp;forums &amp; not to sound to cynical, I'm not so certain that our insider membership isn't tied&nbsp;the Microsoft accounts we were more or less forced to establish if we intended to get any
 value out of the windows platforms the world seems to run on these days. I am truly hoping that this dosen't become an iron clad&nbsp;shackle with a 20 lb. ball at the end of a chain, cause' if it is,&nbsp;I'm 20 yrs.&nbsp;to old to pick it up and run very far&nbsp;with it &amp;
 I don't much relish drag'n it around for the few good years I've&nbsp;got left neither. I suppose&nbsp;time will tell &amp; it won't take long, but if I start to feel the constant hot breath of&nbsp;a stalker&nbsp;I can't shake&nbsp;on my shoulder, I'll pull stakes and move in a Minnesota
 " Heart-Bleed ", if you know what I mean. I refuse to be water-boarded into submission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway Ed ( That's my brothers &amp; my Fathers name also&nbsp;) I wish you well. There just&nbsp;has to be a way for all of us in the same predicament here, to gain&nbsp;a little distance from Microsoft without having to suffer the ordeal of an acrimonious divorce that would
 benefit nobody. Just that - Absolutely&nbsp;No-one likes to be bullied...no-one!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if any of you tech wizards out there have any reasonably workable solutions or&nbsp;ideas to share with the masses,&nbsp;as to how one could in an effective manner, thoroughly, completely &amp; permanently sever themselves from the insiders as well as the developers
 communities, you would find there are many of us out here&nbsp;who would be extremely&nbsp;grateful to find a fresh start available&nbsp;&amp; you in turn will know you have " Done The Right Thing " to keep the family&nbsp; happy and whole - Thank You &amp; we shall all look forward
 to a positive response! - paintbrush -</p>

                    <p>Dear Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>in my <span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">Win 7</span>, I'm trying to permanently add a program to the

<p>
</p><p>The program is the HTML WYSIWYG editor <a href="http://bluegriffon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="BlueGriffon">
<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">BlueGriffon</span></a>, and the executable is <span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">

 bluegriffon.exe was recognised as BlueGriffon. I have tried to replace <em><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">"bluegriffon.exe"</span></em> with
<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><em>"BlueGriffon"</em></span>, as a String Value in the Registry, but still it doesn't work out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe <em><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">bluegriffon.exe</span></em> isn't indexed properly by Windows, or something similar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your attention and patience.</p>

</p><p>That suggests a misspelling somewhere.&nbsp; What happens if you try using "Open with &gt; Choose default program..." and look in the "Other programs" section (click the down-pointing chevron)?&nbsp; Or if you can't find it there, click the "Browse" button and navigate

    <title>Samsung R580 Laptop upgrade to Win 8.1 Wifi issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john_799  say:</h3>
<h2>            Samsung R580 Laptop upgrade to Win 8.1 Wifi issue</h2>
                    <p>I have a Samsung R580 laptop that was purchased with Windows 7 installed. Windows 7 failed to load recently and the only way forward was to install a new operating system. I chose Windows 8.1 because I have it on my Desktop machine and it has worked very
 well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After&nbsp;completing the installation I found that I couldn't activate the software because of a lack of internet access. Investigation and trouble shooting led me to the wireless network adaptor, a Qualcom Atheros AR9285. The trouble shooter asked me to enable
 the adaptor by pressing a button on the front or side of the machine or pressing the appropriate function key. This machine doesn't have to buttons but the appropriate keys are present. However pressing them gives no result. I have tried a couple of driver
 update facilities and all suggest that the installed driver (from the Win 8.1 installation)&nbsp;for the wireless adaptor&nbsp;(v.3.0.1.155) is up to date. I have also noticed that a couple of the other function buttons don't seem to work. All of the normal keys I have
 tried work correctly.&nbsp;Is it possible that the wrong keyboard has been selected during installation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Access to the internet works fine through a wired connection to the router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>ZigZag,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for you advice but I think I found the problem. The drivers were OK but I couldn't get the adaptor to switch on from the keyboard. I was also having trouble getting into BIOS to check the start up settings. Eventually found a way in and discovered
 that the BIOS was instructing that the wireless adaptor be switched off? No idea how this came to be, but considering the difficulty I had when Win 7 crashed it must have been turned off. Now it is turned on and this communication is travelling through the
 ether from computer to router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All's well in windows land - for the time being.</p>

    <title>Problem joining a homegroup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wallace99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem joining a homegroup</h2>
                    <p>Following a problem with my windows 7&nbsp;desktop which involved re-installing Windows, everything is now working fine apart from the Homegroup link to my wireless windows 8.1 laptop, which had been fine before.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that both computers want to be the one creating the Homegroup. None of them seems to offer an option to join an existing homegroup</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any suggestions on how to get around this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p>Just after posting the above I tried, without any hope of success,&nbsp;printing from the laptop and, for some reason, this worked and it printed out on the&nbsp;printer attached to the desktop. Does this mean that the printing is not using the Homegroup facility
 as there is definitely no common homegroup. It must be using some other communication method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing I should have mentioned is that the Windows 7 desktop only seems to be looking out for other Windows 7 computers, according to what it says on the screen. I can't remember whether it said this previously but it definitely&nbsp;used to be&nbsp;in the
 same homegroup as the 8.1 laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still interested in the problem in case I might want to share other types of data in the future but, for the moment , I am OK because all I wanted was to be able to print from the laptop and that does not seem to be a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I need to share any&nbsp;other
 data I&nbsp;do this&nbsp;via OneDrive&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I understand that you are unable to join homegroup on one of the computers. I will certainly help you with the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try and share data among the two computers and check if it works. Since printing works, there is a possibility that you are already connected to the homegroup or the printer
 is working as a network printer. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>To fix issues with HomeGroup:</span></strong></p>

            <p>Sahil, thanks for the reply but I have had no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed the the homegroup parameters to include all types of date but got the same results:</p>
<p>I&nbsp;can create a Homegroup on the Windows 7 desktop but the windows 8.1 laptop (from which I had removed previous homegroup)&nbsp;does not offer me the option to&nbsp;join the desktop group. It will only let me create a new group.</p>
<p>Similarly, I can remove the desktop from its Homegroup, set up a new group on the laptop but the windows7 desktop does not offer me the option to join the laptop group, only to create a new group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The previous printing was definitely not done via&nbsp;a homegroup as the desktop did not belong to a homegroup at the time of printing.&nbsp;This could be checked on Control Panel/Homegroup&nbsp;&nbsp;I assume there must be a straightforward wireless connection between the
 laptop and the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know why Windows 7 talks about connecting to other windows 7 computers.&nbsp;I definitely used to have a homegroup linking the laptop to the desktop</p>

            <p>I am using a Toshiba Qosmio laptop that was shipped with a 64 bit version of Windows 8. All worked fine through the 8.1 update and the original Windows 10 version. The problem started when the newest build of 10 was installed. I checked for video driver
 updates for the on-board Nvidia card in the Qosmio and updates for the Intel video driver.</p>
<p>I questioned why I needed both the Nividia and the Intel video drivers but accepted the fact that they were automatically installed. After downloading and install both of the latest updates the problem still persists. I then removed both devices and drivers
 from the device manager and installed the newest drivers. Still no solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was unable to finish Novembers card challenge due to this problem but it's only a game and the solution to the problem is more important. I finally found a temporary fix by restoring
 an earlier build of Windows 10. So I'm pretty sure it's not me. I have noticed a small number of glitches using the newest build of Windows 10 on my desktop computer at work. The only similarity between the two computers seems to be the Nvidia video card and
 driver. So far.</p>

            I am running a Lenovo Y50 Touch laptop with Windows 10, 4th gen core I7 with Intel and Nvidia Geforce display drivers.&nbsp; I have the same problem as everybody else with the display driver freezing in Pyramid Solitaire Daily Challenge&nbsp; and even had Geek Squad
 try to resolve the problem.&nbsp; Since only one or two solitaire games are affected I'm sure that Microsoft doesn't consider this a big deal.&nbsp; However, it is a big deal when that game is part of a series and you can't complete it because of that problem.&nbsp; I agree
 that Microsoft should send a patch for that glitch, since it seems to be their fault.<br />

            Same for me exactly! Surface Pro 3, Windows 10 Pro and a paid for version (before they woke up and made it free again) of their Solitaire Collection. &nbsp;It
<em><strong>ONLY </strong></em>happens while playing the Pyramid component of the Daily Challenge and it is not random at all. &nbsp;It is therefore a coding problem with the Daily Challenge and not, as it appears to most people, with the patch in Windows 10. &nbsp;Certainly,
 that patch has exacerbated the problem by causing it to happen, much like chewing gum can pull out a filling, showing you that you have decay that needs attention<strong>. &nbsp;Wake up Microsoft!
</strong>&nbsp;The people suffering this &nbsp;problem are your true and loyal devotees, and we deserve a solution to your dodgy coding in quick time. &nbsp;Surely it can't be that hard to solve the issue and resolve it with a patch, if that is even necessary at all? The
 code is on your server and is downloaded vie the challenge when we sign in. Too easy for the propeller-heads I would have thought!

            My wife found a work-around for this problem.&nbsp; If you go to MSN Games you can play the Solitaire Collection from that site.&nbsp; Haven't tried downloading it to my computer yet but at least I can play it without crashing.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10...a step back</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 10 on a Dell Venue 8 Pro that I have had for about a year.&nbsp; I find Windows 10 to be seriously flawed in many ways.&nbsp; There are several things that sure seem to be superior in Windows 8.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.)&nbsp; The new Cortana search.&nbsp; When I compare the search function between these two OSs Windows 8 beats 10 hands down.&nbsp; Windows 10 search cannot even find installed programs on my device.&nbsp; It appears to only search for "apps" and some files.&nbsp;The search results
 in Windows 8 were&nbsp; more robust and useful.&nbsp; I am quickly finding the new search to be useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.)&nbsp; Windows 10 will&nbsp; not recognize installed programs on another drive. I have a small C drive and a larger SD card in this device.&nbsp; I have several programs installed to the SD card for space reasons.&nbsp; After the upgrade, Windows 10 no longer recognizes
 several of these including google earth and CCleaner. Windows 8 did not have this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.) Onedrive.&nbsp; Oh, where to begin?&nbsp; I will keep it short and sweet.&nbsp; Smart files are gone, you have to keep all files you want to use on a device stored locally, and you cannot move them to an SD card for storage reasons.&nbsp; Un...freakin...believable.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall, Windows 10 feels like a step backwards and seems like a less thought out OS.&nbsp; The switch to Windows 8 was refreshing and new.&nbsp; Windows 10 seems old and clunky.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 7 Help and Support Pane suddenly stopped working, says not available on this version &#40;has been fine since new 1 year ago&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>Sometime in August (24th for me), one of the Windows Updates, or one of the HP Updates, caused a problem regarding my "Help and Support" function. When I click on Start, then help and support, the help pane opens but says "Topic not found" next to a blank
 info icon, and "The topic you are looking for is not available in this version of Windows".&nbsp; "For additional assistance, see More support options". The links within the help pane are all non-functioning.&nbsp; My version is Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit, on an
 HP Desktop. I would appreciate hearing from anyone else who may have encountered this, or knows how to fix the link to their Help and Support functions. Thanks ahead of time for your time and assistance.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Robert,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My permissions are ok. The article you referenced seems to be directed at Vista users. The old help files are not compatible with Windows 7, this is what the download fixes. However, since my computer is new, Windows 7, 64 bit, shipped with new type of Help,
 I feel this tech article does not really apply to my problem. As I stated before, everthing was fine until the HP Support Assistant Update I downloaded August 24, 2011. This was just after my 1 year warranty expired. The Windows Help &amp; Support link was disconnected
 in favor of the HP. When I try to restore old Help, It is skipped because "It can not be restored to original location". My registry has 290 invalid items, all broken or empty help library, etc. Also, as I stated before, I have found a workaround and will
 just stick with that rather than mess up my computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you anyway !!! I appreciate all the responses and ideas. You guys are great!!!!!!</p>

<p>I have a problem, fixing my DVD with some important files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a DVD with some important files, and when I put it in my DVD drive, after a while I get a message: "Drag files to this folder to add them to the disc".<br />

After running cmd, check disk, and chk dsk e: /f, I get message : "an unspecified error occurred 75646663686b2e63 307"</p>
<p>Sometimes, it says to me that chk dsk e: /f succeeded and write how many space those files take on DVD, and how many space do I have left.</p>
<p>But after that, when I go to My computer and to DVD drive, it is the same.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Matija,<br />
<br />
<br />
The unspecified error you've received is really strange and is might be due to a variety of reasons.<br />
<br />
That being said, have you tried checking the DVD on a different Windows 10 PC and is getting the same error?<br />
<br />
In the meantime, let's run the <strong>Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter </strong>
to find and repair problems with your devices and hardware:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the <strong>Start</strong> icon, then select <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Choose the<strong> Large icons</strong> option from the<strong> View by</strong> drop down list found on the upper-right part of the Control Panel window.<br />
</li><li>Locate then select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>View all</strong> from the left pane.<br />
</li><li>Locate and click <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong> to run the troubleshooter then follow the next steps.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

<br />
Based on the information you've provided, you were able to try the same DVD on a different computer and the same error appears. To further isolate your concern, we'd like to know if you were getting the same error code on both computers when you try to access
 files from a different DVD. <br />
<br />
We look forward to your response.

<h2>            Windows 7 boot disk made from ISO, won&#39;t boot</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I have downloaded the ISO for 64bit WIndows 7 home premium, have used windows tool for creating a bootable disk for this, and have currently had no luck...<br />
<br />
I have set the DVD drive to boot first, and it displays "booting from cd/dvd drive" for a while, the&nbsp;dvd drive makes a few noises, and after 20 seconds, it loads windows xp (the current OS on my machine).<br />
<br />
I have checked that the drive isn't faulty, by booting from my windows xp disk, which works just fine. And the boot disk utility provided by windows gives no errors. I have tried burning a new copy, but again, the same problems.<br />
<br />
Any insight would be most helpful, thanks.

    <title>Search old messages feature no longer works when in call - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshua qin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Search old messages feature no longer works when in call</h2>
                    I've already noticed that when in a call, you can only look at either your contacts sidebar or your chat, not both at the same time, and you can no longer resize your side panes. Recently, I found that, inexplicably, Ctrl-F for searching old messages also
 doesn't work anymore when in a call. I rely on this feature very much, and it seems absurd that this very basic feature was removed. Am I doing something wrong? Is there any way to get the search functionality working again in calls?

    <title>Dead Space 3 achievements not unlocking despite saying unlocked - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Dead Space 3 achievements not unlocking despite saying unlocked ingame.</h2>
                    <p>As it says in the title;&nbsp;I had a problem involving my Dead Space 3 achievements not unlocking while playing the 360 emulator. That issue is now sorted and I'm getting achievements again and they're counting throughout, however the 7 achievements I unlocked during the issue I was having are still saying locked across everything, the XBox 360 and One. However in game it's saying these achievements have been unlocked so there is no way I am able to get them again to make them count. I've tried everything I&nbsp;can think of and have spoken to people on the live chat twice now. Any advice would be great.</p>

 <p>You can't get the achievements again from xbox 360 bc games if you unlocked them for xbox 360 before. </p> 
 </blockquote> <p>I haven't though that's the thing. I unlocked them the other day while using the emulator for the first time, however the issue I&nbsp;was having was it was only registering in-game, and not on the XBox One or anything like that. That issue has been fixed but the achievements I&nbsp;earned are still only registering in-game and nowhere else.</p>

            I doubt that the status of the integrated adapter on you mobo is affecting things, but sure, go ahead and disable it in the BIOS.<br />
<br />
Similarly, I doubt that installing the beta driver would help, but you can install it and if it doesn't work out use the "<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/283657?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">driver rollback</a>" feature.<br />
<br />
I do think, however, that your ISP is correct: tuning the TCP/IP stack is necessary to get maximum speed.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If the utility provided by your ISP doesn't help and if the information at DSLReports doesn't help (look at all 3 items in the dropdown list: Tweaktester, Receive window, and more info), then keep after your ISP tech support until you either get something nearer
 to the speed you're paying for or you decide to stop paying for it.<br />
<br />
The problem is that without a second computer connected to your router, you can't tell whether you have a problem in your own equipment (modem/router, cables, Ethernet interface, motherboard, Windows XP) or if there is a problem between you and the ISP's server.&nbsp;
 This is a significant problem and if I were you, I'd make an effort to borrow another computer (that has a gigabit Ethernet adapter) and test your LAN.&nbsp; Otherwise, it's all too easy for the ISP to say, "Our equipment and connection is working just fine; your
 lack of speed is your fault."<br />

            The fact that your Ethernet adapter is theoretically capable of 1000 Mbps doesn't mean that everything else in the path between your computer and the fiber cable (which is what your ISP is basing its "speed" spec on) is similarly capable.<br />
<br />
For example:&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>what sort of cable are you using between the computer and the modem/router ... and how long is it?&nbsp; Did you make the cable yourself or did you purchase it with the connectors already attached?&nbsp; You need at least Cat 5e cables, and attaching the connectors
 yourself is not recommended unless you have a fair amount of experience doing so.<br />
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>what is the make/model/version of your modem/router?&nbsp; Does it have the latest firmware installed?</li></ul>
<br />
Do you have a second computer that also has a gigabit network adapter?&nbsp; If so, check the transfer speed from computer A through the router to computer B (i.e., what is the transfer speed of your LAN, completely apart from the transfer speed between you and
 your ISP).&nbsp; Either use a stopwatch and a large file or use a utility such as <a href="http://www.totusoft.com/compareLST.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
LAN Speed Test</a>.<br />
<br />
What version TG-3269 do you have?&nbsp; The current one is V3.<br />
<br />
Assuming that you have v.3, you don't appear to have the latest driver (although I doubt that is the problem).&nbsp; The package labeled
<span>TG-3269_XP_beta</span> has version 5.719.0325.2009 of the XP driver.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.tp-link.com/en/support/download/?model=TG-3269&amp;version=V3#tbl_a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.tp-link.com/en/support/download/?model=TG-3269&amp;version=V3#tbl_a<br />
</a><br />
Finally, you may want to think about tuning your connection, which is more important for XP than for later versions of Windows:

    <title>Minecraft Leaderboards Reset&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Minecraft Leaderboards Reset&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>This is discouraging and should be adressed as soon as possible. What else is there to look forward to if you and a buddy are having a competition and then you get reset all of a sudden? Now i'm back at square one after spending all that time Farming and
 Fighting Monsters on Normal and Hard. I was ranked within the top 500 on Hard and climbing everyday and now it's all gone. Fix&nbsp;the leaderboards before you release a game or don't have&nbsp;one at all.</p>

<p>Well, the reason they have to do a Leaderboard reset is because of all the people cheating and glitching their way to the top. MANY people on Minecraft had purely unattainable scores for farming etc &nbsp;within a week of launch, and it is only right this is
 addressed so that the people who are getting their scores through genuine means are not &nbsp;getting screwed (for lack of a better word) over by all the cheaters.</p>

<p>great point, me and my buddy have been staying up countless hours makeing a giant pit for no reason for a race to see who can max first. a good idea would be to make a style of prestige type thing where you once you max on everything you can have the option
 to reset and for extra incentive make a few achevements or some kind of counter to tell how many times you have maxed then make a new leader bored just for that. so people dont clog up the leader boards. I get why they want a reset but there are so many other
 alternitives</p>
