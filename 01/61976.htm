<h2>            laptop occasionally thinks its not plugged in</h2>
                    Sometimes when I'm using my laptop while its plugged in, it thinks it's not plugged in. For example, when I'm in the middle of playing Counter Strike 😎 the brightness goes up and down by itself because sometimes it thinks it's not plugged in. What's the
 fix for this?

            Hello fat, my name is Irisdiel and I am an independent advisor.
<br />I suggest you follow the instructions down below.
<br />
<br />
<br />Open the Device Manager by searching for it or right-clicking the Start button and selecting Device Manager.
<br />Click Batteries on the list to expand it and you should see two items: Microsoft AC Adapter and Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery.
<br />Right-click on each item and choose Uninstall device. Yes, you are uninstalling your laptop's battery drivers, but don't worry because they will automatically be reinstalled when you restart your laptop.
<br />Shut down your laptop.
<br />Unplug the power cable from your laptop.
<br />If your laptop has a removable battery, remove it. If your laptop doesn't have a removable battery, remove the bottom panel of my laptop and then remove the battery by disconnecting it from the motherboard.
<br />Put the battery back in if you removed it.
<br />Plug in your laptop.
<br />Power on your laptop.
<br />Click the battery icon in the system tray and you should see that your laptop is plugged in and charging.
<br />
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!
<br />Thank you and good luck,
<br />Regards- Irisdiel H.

            Sorry but it didn't work. My laptop still does this. Maybe I didn't explain the problem clearly. So when I'm in the middle of doing something while my laptop is plugged in, at random moments for around 30 seconds, my laptop says its running of battery,
 and after that approximately 30 seconds, it goes back to saying its charging. This happens every time my laptop is charging and I don't know how to fix this.

<p>Hello Scotman,</p>
<p>How did you try to uninstall and reinstall Windows Media Player 12?<br />
</p>
<p><strong><span>Uninstalling and Reinstalling the Windows Media Player:</span></strong><span>
<br />
<strong><span>Step 1.</span></strong><span><br />
<strong><span>Uninstalling the Windows Media Player:</span></strong><br />
</span>1. Go to Start and in the search type "Turn Windows features On or Off".<br />
2. Click on "Turn Windows features On or Off".<br />
3. Browse to the Media Features and uncheck the mark in front of Windows Media Player.<br />
4. Restart the computer<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>Step 2.</span></strong>
<br />
<strong><span>Reinstalling the Windows Media Player:</span></strong><span><br />
</span>1. Go to Start and in the search type "Turn Windows features On or Off".<br />
2. Click on "Turn Windows features On or Off".<br />
3. Browse to the Media Features and place a check mark in front of Windows Media Player.<br />
4. Restart the Computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are having trouble using Windows Media Player, try using the troubleshooter to see if that fixes</span></p>
<p><span>the</span><span> problem.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Open the Windows Media Player Settings troubleshooter by clicking the
<span>Start</span> button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type
<span>troubleshooter</span>, and then click <span>Troubleshooting</span>. Click
<span>View all</span>, and then click <span>Windows Media Player Settings</span>.
</span></p>
<p><span>If the size of the .wmv files are too large, it may cause Windows Media Player to stop working.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>I would try and remove the videos from the Windows Media Player library and test to see if the size of the files could be causing a problem.
</span></p>
<p>Please reply back and let us know if this helps.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h2>            USB 2.0 HD UVC Webcam not working Windows 10</h2>
                    I have an Asus Q550LF and when i first got it the webcam (USB 2.0 HD UVC WebCam) worked fine. I upgraded to windows 8.1 and it stopped working. I have since upgraded to windows 10 (64 bit) and I got it to work by uninstalling the device through the device
 manager and reinstalling. Then windows 10 updated itself and now it doesn't work again. I tried the same solution but that didn't work. I also tried running the troubleshooter and updating the driver that still didn't fix it. Is anybody else experiencing this
 and can someone please help?

<h2>            Windows desktop client not displaying all messages</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use skype on both Windows 10 desktop (v12.1803.279.0) and Android. In group chats (haven't noticed in individual chats) I can see large parts of conversations are missing on the desktop client but visible in the android client. Is this a known issue? Any
 idea on how to troubleshoot / fix? When @ work I'm mostly using the desktop client but keep having to bring&nbsp; up chats on my phone to catch up on messages that've been missed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

</span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should be able to restore with

<p>You said you tried the built-iin Administrator Account - did you mean the account referred to in this procedure:
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67567-administrator-account.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67567-administrator-account.html</a>.&nbsp; If not, try using this procdure to create a new administrator account and see if that works (or use it to change
 your current administrator accounts to standard accounts and then change them back to administrator accounts.</p>
<p>I haven't heard about this problem before and if an update was causing it, others here would be posting similar problems and I've seen no such posts. It might still be caused by an update, but there's no telling which update caused it it you can't help us
 by remembering when the problem started and telling us what updates were installed around that time by KB number.&nbsp; If you honestly think this is a Windows Update problem, then you should repost your question in the Windows Update Forum at:
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistawu/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistawu/threads</a>&nbsp;where experts in updates wll be more than happy to assist you - but since you don't know when the problem started
 or what update or updates might be the cause it will be very difficult for them to provide any recommendations (as it is for us here).</p>
<p>Hare you done nothing recently that required administrative rights so we can determiine when the accounts stopped having administrator rights? Did you do any program installatons?&nbsp; Did you make any changes in the Control Panel?&nbsp; Did you install any new harware
 or device drivers?&nbsp; ANYTHING?&nbsp; You may not have to go back as far as you think to get to a restore point that might very well fix the problem if you can remember&nbsp;when you did something only an administrator can do.&nbsp; System restore doesn't affect your data
 at all.&nbsp; You just need to re-install anything you installed including updates between now and the restore poiint.&nbsp; If it'snly a week or two or even three ago, that probably isn't that much to do - you don't install that many new programs that often do you
 &nbsp;(and Windows Update will autormatically re-install the deleted updates so that's no effort on your part).</p>
<p>Here's an article on changing Account user types (but you will need to login as the built-in Administrator for this to work since it can only be done by an Administrator) and try the second and more advanced option and see if that works any better than the
 normal method: <a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/122023-user-account-type.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/122023-user-account-type.html</a>.&nbsp; While you're logged into the built-in Administrator account, try doing some other functions that require Administrator rights to see if it actually has Administrator rights itself as it should.&nbsp;
 If you can't do any administrative tasks even with this account, then the problem is bigger than it seems and we'll have to refocuse on problems of system file or hard disk corruption and we may need to do a repair/ugrade re-installation of Vista to fix the
 problem.&nbsp; That may still be the case if you are unable to create admninstraror accounts or change standard accounts to administrator accounts even using the built-in Administrator account</p>
<p>Let's try testing your system files and hard drive for corrupton (and these procedures can sometimes fix that corruption but not always):</p>
<p><span><span>Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator. If you can't do this, boot to the Installation
 Disk and select recovery and continue until you come to a screen of options including Command Prompt).&nbsp;
<span>
To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and
 exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>If
 you don't have&nbsp;a disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span><span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
</span></span><br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt in the same directory, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors
 on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps (and I'm sorry if my first suggestion upset you so much - it is the most logical solution to this type of &nbsp;problem and works in many if not most cases -
 I wasn't aware of the circumstances you revealed in your reply when I suggested it but I think it still might be a viable option if we can somehow pin down a reasonably recent timeframe). If not, please post back the results of what you did and the results
 of the scans you ran and we can move on from there.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Good luck!</span></span></p>

            <p>I was trying "Method 2" out, tried to stop everything. It should be noted that trying to stop appidsvc gave the "error" of "The Application Identity service is not started. More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 3521." Considering that it said it was
 stopped already, I proceeded, assuming that while the command hadn't done it's job, it didn't need to; it's job was already done. Everything else worked correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first renaming process went without error (or confirmation, it just went to the next line), but when I tried to rename the second thing, it simply stated "Access is denied." Tried again, "Access is denied." Like Damien, I also tried installing the Windows
 10 update multiple times, both times installation went fine till the very end, at which point it reverted, giving me the same error he got. Is it possible that this file is the source of my problems? If so, what should I do to resolve it?</p>

            So we know Method&nbsp; 2 does not work.&nbsp; I've tried using Windows update to manually install the driver, this does not work.&nbsp; I tried using the Hide Update facility in windows update to stop the troublesome AMD Graphics Adapter WDDM 1.2 AMD Radeon HD7520G
 driver from showing up and this does not work. When it finished this time it said "AMD Graphics Adapter WDDM 1.2 AMD Radeon HD7520G optional failed".&nbsp; So there appears to be no way around this blockage.&nbsp; Has anyone asked AMD about this?<br />

<h2>            Will my Steam games be compatible with Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I have quite a few Steam games that I like playing, some of them a little old. Since all my currently owned Steam games were released without Windows 10 in mind, would they still be playable and compatible on Windows 10? One of my main concerns is Skyrim
 since that's my most played game. I also have games like Fallout 3 which were released in 2008 that I still love to play.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>to update your privacy settings you can go to <a href="http://account.xbox.com/settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://account.xbox.com/settings</a></p>
<p>and verify if all settings allow multiplayer and related, like the option that will allow you to see content created by other users.</p>
<p>If your account is controller by a parental account, that parental account needs to be signed in to check the settings via that link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that after the settings have changed, it might require you to sign out of your profile and sign back in again before the changes become active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a console also be sure to do a power cycle</p>
<p>try the manual power cycle steps like mentioned on the following link, be sure to wait at least 60 seconds before powering on again:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p><span>Hi Wanda,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>With the issue description, I understand that there is no sound on your Windows 8 tablet. I will certainly help you in getting this fixed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur because of incompatible drivers or incorrect hardware settings.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try the below mentioned steps and check if that helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1</span>:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Hardware and devices troubleshooter</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The built-in hardware and devices troubleshooter can automatically detect and fix most of the incorrect settings and errors that could cause issues with hardware. I would suggest you to run
 this troubleshooter to check if there is any issue with the display adapter. Refer top these steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a) Press “<strong>Windows key + X</strong>” Open “<strong>Control Panel</strong>”</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>b) Click on “<strong>Troubleshooting”</strong> and select the “<strong>view all”</strong> option on the left pane.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>c) Click on “<strong>Hardware and devices”</strong> troubleshooter and follow the prompts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Try method 2, if the issue persist</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 2</span></span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">:

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a) Press “<strong>Windows Logo</strong>” + “<strong>R</strong>” keys on the keyboard, type “<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong>”
 in Run box.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b) “<strong>Device</strong>
<strong>Manager</strong>” will open up, on the top click on “<strong>Scan for hardware changes</strong>”</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c) Search for the Sound adapter/drivers from the device list, right click on it and then select “<strong>Uninstall</strong>”.
 On the un-installation window, if you have an option: “<strong>Delete the driver software for this device</strong>” you may select that and then remove the corrupted drivers from the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d) Follow the on-screen instructions to complete it and the restart the computer if prompted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After the restart, you may again open the
<strong>Device Manager</strong> and then click on the “<strong>Scan for hardware</strong>
<strong>changes</strong>” button at the top of the Device Manager window and check if Windows 8 detects the sound devices and installs an appropriate driver for it automatically. If that happens, then check if it resolves the issue.

<h2>            Forza motorsport 7 halts a few minutes after introduction</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I just purchased for my PC the game. It installed etc. When I load it, the introduction runs fine. A few minutes later, I think by the end of the introduction, game halts. I suspect something is not compliant on my HW. Processor is ok (i7 5500, 2.4 GHz, RAM 16 GB, Dedicated Video board 2 GB, AMD Radeon R7 M260). I suspect on the video properties... maybe a tweak? Thanks!</p>

I tried using a password reset disk but when I try to change my password. Windows say that there was an error changing this user's password. Something like that. No error codes.

    <title>Texture Pop in and untextured games. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Texture Pop in and untextured games.</h2>
                    So as of lately, I've been getting a lot of errors in GTA: San Andreas. Things are untextured and texture pop in happens frequently. Not only that but if I go too far away, it says "loading" and stays like that for 3 minutes. In GTA IV, things stay untextured
 until I get very close. And in borderlands 2, things stay untextured. Help please?

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>In regards to San Andreas, Xbox Originals run emulation software to function on the 360 and that emulation can be buggy.&nbsp; For example, Halo 2 suffered a ghosting effect and Fable could confuse the texture for your clothing with the ground.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've not played GTA IV or Borderlands 2 so I cannot speak about specifics for those games.&nbsp; I&nbsp;do believe&nbsp;that Borderlands 2 runs on the Unreal Engine which is prone to texture issues.&nbsp; Technically speaking, texture pop-in is generally a result of insufficient&nbsp;video
 RAM&nbsp;to handle everything on the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might try clearing your system caches and seeing if that helps.&nbsp; Also, if these are digital copies you could attempt to re-download them, sometimes files get messed up during download.</p>

<p>I've tried clearing the cache and it didn't help. And as for the Download, I thought about uninstalling ane reinstalling but the disc is too scratched up so it's unreadable. But that wouldn't explain why the problem started just now. Before I never had this
 problem.</p>

            <p>Hey there&nbsp;bak2dakitchen88,<br /><br />It doesn't sound like your console is experiencing any symptoms of the red light issue. If you are only experiencing this with one game then it is likely the disc. I totally understand not wanting to replace it, I am pretty excited about GTAV too :)&nbsp;<br /><br />Cheers! Let us know if you need anything else! &nbsp;</p>

<p>It probably is just the disc. Because when I loaded just cause 2, a very graphically intense game, everything rendered just fine</p>

<p>Hi there&nbsp;bak2dakitchen88,<br />

<h2>            My Dell Studio running Windows Vista won&#39;t start up and won&#39;t enter safe mode.  I eventually get the blue screen after it runs startup repair.</h2>
                    The Blue screen tells me&nbsp;this:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A problem has been detcted and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.
<br />
<br />
A process or thread crucial to system operation has unexpedtedly exited or been terminated.<br />

Check to make sure any new hardware or software is properly installed.&nbsp; If this is a new installation , ask your hardware or software manufacturer for any windows updates you might need. (I didn't install any hardware or software)<br />
<br />
If problems continue, disable or remove any newly installed hardware or software.&nbsp; Disable BIOS memory oftions such as caching or shadowing.&nbsp; If you need to use Safe Mode to remove or disable components, restart your computer, press F8 to select Advanced Startup
 Options, and then select safe mode. (how can I do that if I can't get into my computer)<br />

<h2>            Sobre o final do GTA V</h2>
                    
<p>Primeiramente, o que eu vou escrever contem spoiler do jogo, então se você não quiser saber, não leia!</p>

<p>Eu terminei o jogo faz um tempinho e agora eu fui voltar pra fazer umas conquistas e eu vi que tem uma conquista em especial que precisa gastar 200 milhões com os três personagens. No final do meu jogo, eu matei o Trevor e agora só tem o Michael e o Franklin
 disponíveis pra jogar. Vou ter que criar um novo save e dessa vez não matar ninguém ou tem outro jeito de fazer o Trevor voltar?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Como a descrição da conquista diz, esse 200 milhões não são ''com'' os três personagens, e sim ''entre'' os 3 personagens, e.g. gastando 200 milhões só com o Michael ainda te dá a conquista. Tenho 99% de certeza que o final que você escolheu não afeta isso.</p>

                    I got the notice about upgrading to the next version of Skype, and I did. However, there are now 2 Skype launchers on my task bar. Why? I have never ever downloaded and installed an application that retained the one that it was supposed to be upgrading.
