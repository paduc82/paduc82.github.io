    <title>Start menu unavailable after install of Windows 10 Home, version 1511, - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Start menu unavailable after install of Windows 10 Home, version 1511, 10586</h2>
                    <p>About a week ago my computer automatically installed the&nbsp;Windows 10 Home, version 1511, 10586 update.</p>
<p>The immediate result was that the Action Center and the Start menu became unavailable to me. I was able to open some of the functions of the Start menu by way of right-clicking the Start button, but it was VERY frustrating and quite disasterous as to working
 on the computer in any normal manner.</p>
<p>My solution, for the time being, has been to move the system back to the restore point that was set up at the time of the update. Everything is working fine now, but I don't know what I am missing as a result of not installing the update.</p>
<p>I checked out the community questions and answers and discovered that I am not alone with these (and apparently other) problems, but all of the solutions suggested involve playing around with the system in ways that I would rather not get into (not to mention
 the time involved in doing it all).</p>
<p>Why isn't Microsoft putting out a corrected update that will not cause these problems?</p>
<p>The "solution" of telling me how to undo the problem caused by the author of the operating system is like telling someone that just got his car tuned up by the manufacturer to take apart the motor to repair damages done during the tuning!</p>
<p>NOT ACCEPTABLE.</p>
<p>I would appreciate an answer from some Microsoft executive that is willing to accept the responsibility of cleaning up his company's mess.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

    <title>Chkdsk read error &#47; unspecified error occurred - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Chkdsk read error &#47; unspecified error occurred</h2>
                    <p>I have an old hard drive (1TB) that was taken out from my laptop and currently been used as a external drive. However it seems reaching the end of its life.</p>
<p>HDTune showing a bad sector at around 2961 MB-3076MB location, so I used chkdsk (command prompt, &gt; chkdsk F: /f /r /x) and fixed it. Then I formatted the hard drive using the normal formatting and test using HD tune shows all green. But after a while the
 HDTune shows the bad sector came back. (no new sectors popping up)</p>
<p>So I repeated those steps at least 2 times, but the&nbsp; bad sector came back yet again at time of writing.</p>
<p>Further more, sometimes chkdsk will fail to finish at very end (see attached picture), returning

<p>Some times chkdsk will ran normally but other times it returns error just like the one above, and the same bad sector seems always there. So maybe it is time for me to say bye bye to this hard drive? Or is there a way to salvage that hard drive like repartitioning
 to skip the bad sectors?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may have occurred due to corrupted components and bad sectors are also caused by software issues, it‚Äôs possible for a repeated bad sector to develop and corrupt some of your data.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We highly suggest that you back up your files before performing any repartitioning. We also suggest that you reach out to your manufacturer if your hard drive is still under warrantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>I think it might be hardware problem. It is a 4+ year old Seagate laptop drive and since repeated Chkdsk check and reformatting didn't have any beneficial effect on the hard drive.</p>
<p>But seems other sectors where fine, that is why I am considering salvage the remaining sectors by put the bad sectors into a hidden partition using the tool came with windows.&nbsp; That way Explorer won't get stuck trying to read whatever data was near the bad
 sectors.</p>
<p>Unless there are reasons I shouldn't do that or you have better suggestion.</p>

            Your monitor (actually every monitor) will not be recognized correctly until you have the correct drivers for your graphics card, so first thing to do is get them from the manufacturers website and install them.<br />
<br />
Then set the resolution to the correct value and you should get your popups under control. The '1' it is referring to is the button marked 1 on the monitor's front, usually to the left of the 'on' switch.

    <title>Latest Windows 7 update breaks sysem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pgcjr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Latest Windows 7 update breaks sysem</h2>
                    <p>About 2 weeks ago, I got a notice that there was a new update for Win 7 (64 bit). &nbsp;I delayed installing it on my Lenovo W520 until this weekend.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When it rebooted, I got an error message saying some required resource was missing.. &nbsp;I tried using Startup Repair from my installation disk. It found problems, apparently repaired them. But on reboot, after the Win "Starting Windows" screen, the screen
 went black (the cursor is visible and movable).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the Startup Repair again, but now it finds no problems to repair, so I have quit that approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried starting in Safe mode, but after the list of modules being loaded scrolls past (the last to appear is CLASSPNP.SYS), the system goes black, except for the cursor. &nbsp;There's an occasional disk light flicker, but no other sign of life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other symptom, just noticed. I pulled the drive and attached it via USB to another Thinkpad. The system notes that it is present, but when I try to look at the files on it, &nbsp;I get error "D:\ is not accessible. &nbsp;Access denied"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else can be done? For example, is it possible to revert to the original Win 7 version on the installation disk (for example, using the disk's upgrade function) without destroying the application I have installed and the other personal data? If so, I
 could then re-install the various fixes, taking a snapshot after each installation that could be used to roll back the next installation if it is the one that breaks the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Phil</p>

            <p>Sadly, the Windows Update doesn't automatically create restore points when upgrading, so I don't have any restore images to work with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only hopes for a clean correction of the problem are:</p>
<p>a. Microsoft knows about it and issues a corrective program. It would have to be downloaded, onto bootable removable media, elsewhere and then moved to this PC, since there's no way I can find to do a download on the comatose machine. OR</p>
<p>b. The Installation CD's Upgrade function will upgrade from Win7 to Win 7, so I can save all my applications and data while restoring Windows.. &nbsp;Does anyone know if this can be done?</p>
<p>

            <p>To your question b.&nbsp; YES. Use your install disk and take the Upgrade option.&nbsp; It will restore Win7 from scratch.&nbsp; That also means you will have a lot of updates to do.</p>

            <p>I found out that, unfortunately, the upgrade process requires a running Windows on the system. &nbsp;It has to be started from inside Windows, not from the installation CD. &nbsp;Since my Windows dies after the splash screen (even in safe mode), I still have no process
 that will let me restore my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, Linux, unlike Windows, can read the disk&nbsp;so I was able to copy all my data files. &nbsp;At the moment my only path seems to be to reinstall Win 7 from scratch which will cause the loss of all the applications I have installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have the knowledge to isolate which operational files can be safely restored after the reinstall from scratch and which file have been changed in the way that causes the current problem, so I will have to reinstall my applications after reinstalling
 Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I tried to upgrade to Win 10 a while back. Win 10 didn't work properly on my hardware so I reverted back to Win 7. Possibly that Win 10 uninstall process failed in such a way that it left my Win 7 installation vulnerable to this problem.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be so encouraged if anyone has a less drastic&nbsp;(less drastic than a complete reinstall) solution that would let me keep the installed applications.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Problem with Windows 10 Upgrade 1511&#59; 10586</h2>
                    My tablet automatically tried to install the 1511 Windows 10 upgrade 10586 but got stuck at 40% for several hours. I then restarted the machine which proceeded to re-install my previous version of Windows&nbsp;10. This reinstallation was successful. However,
 the tablet will no longer show the Upgrade 1511 as an available update when I check for updates, telling me that my system is up to date. I am now stuck with my original version of Windows 10. My suspicion is that the tablet thinks that my reinstallation is,
 in fact, a new installation and won't offer the newer version 1511 until 31 days have passed. Does anyone know how I can force my tablet to 'see' the new upgrade 1511 and install it?

            Did you go through the same steps for the L655?
<br />
<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy

thank you very much for the help, but is there any possibility that this issue can be fixed in the future update? if so i'll just wait for it so that i will not downgrade to the older build. but if this cannot be solved in future updates then i don't have any
 other choice but to downgrade. but anyway, it's been a great help...thank you very much again....

<h2>            Windows 10 installation issue in samsung laptop model rv 509</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to upgrade from win 7 pro to windows 10 using upgrade option, but i am always getting stuck at blue windows logo after re start . Even i tried fresh installtion, but same thing happens. Some windows 7 forums has posts saying that its an inherent
 problem with broadcom wifi card installed in samsung laptops and have advised to remove wifi card for installing. I dont want to remove wifi card. I need to know whether Microsoft has any workaround or solved this issue in latest build of windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Samsung website has not updated anything regarding this issue. &nbsp;So please guide me on this issue as want to install windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance. &nbsp;</p>

            Samsung is the best source to contact about compatibility. The Wi-Fi card remains an issue with the RV models. Removing it has turned out to be an invasive work around that has worked so far.

            <p>Could you describe for us the steps you tried?</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>My recommendation would be to install the updates in batches, such 5 at a time, exclude hardware/driver updates. Avoid installing a combination of Microsoft Windows and Office updates at the same time. Also, try installing the small updates first. Avoid
 installing things like .NET Framework and SQL Express Updates.</p>
<p>Restart each time you install the updates (its a chore, but it guarantees a more reliable experience). Try starting out with Microsoft Office Updates for programs such as (Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint).</p>
<p>Another thing, try downloading the updates then install them. When prompted to restart, disconnect from the Internet and restart your computer.</p>
<p>Proceed with installing the additional updates.</p>
<p>If the computer continues to become non-responsive, try the following:</p>
<p>„ÄÄ</p>
<p>You can reset Windows Update components by running the Fixit on this page. But, if there's malware present, it will continue to reset the connection to the update servers:</p>
<p>How do I reset Windows Update components</p>

<span>
<p>Suggest you download and save the Fixit. Then configure the system to Clean boot prior to running it:</p>
<p>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista/Windows 7</p>
</span>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<span>
<p>Once the Fixit has been downloaded and the system booted to the Clean state, check to see that the native Windows firewall is now On if a 3rd party firewall was being used previously. Now run the Fixit and choose the Default mode. Restart once it's done
 and see if the system can connect to the update servers. If it can not, then run the Fixit again and choose the Aggressive mode. Restart when it's finished running and check for updates.</p>
<p>I suggest before shutting down and installing any updates, disconnect from the Internet first.</p>

</p><p>No, DX12 is only available on Win10, and only the latest model graphics cards will be able to</p>
<p>use in game DX12 effects.</p>
<p>DX12 is supposed to have other benefits though. The main one being that it uses the cpu more efficiently when</p>
<p>rendering graphics than previous versions of DirectX.</p>
<p>-DX12 is still in it's infancy though. There are no fully released DX12 games yet.
</p>
<p>I reckon it will be a couple of&nbsp; years before DX12 truly becomes an important factor in games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- MS is far to focused on getting people to abandon Win7/8/8.1 to ever make DX12 available on those OS's.</p>
<p>Getting as many people as possible onto Win10 would be the primary reason for making it 'free' for Win7/8/8.1
</p>
<p>users within the first year of it's release.</p>
<p>- There are hardware limitations with Win10 (as there was with previous Windows versions), but many people</p>
<p>are being seduced, by the 'free' offer into trying Win10 on machines, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
laptops in particular,&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>that are not truly optimal for Win10.&nbsp; Especially in regard to the graphics hardware.

<p>Ok, so... following the Windows Vista&nbsp;kb2388210 update, which was installed automatically as my PC shutdown 2 days ago. I switch it on the next morning, and I find that it cannot connect to the internet, and instead reads, "Unidentified Network" in the Network
 and Sharing Center.</p>
<p>I try every possible fix and solution windows provides to help with the problem, and absolutely none of them work... I then, on my laptop (the one I am using to post this) check out this problem on Google, and find that it is a well known issue. I try literally
 every solution and find that none of them work.</p>
<p>I am now beginning to think that, the update might have done damage to my registry, or drivers, or something like that... I even reinstalled my network adapter drivers and updated my netgear router.</p>
<p>Still no luck.</p>
<p>Is anyone else experiencing issues after the update, and if so, have you been able to sort them out and how?</p>
<p>Also... I have uninstalled the update and the problem still persists.</p>
<p>I really need help, as that PC was the main workhorse I had... :(</p>

<p>Hi jmcorp,</p>
<p>Here are additional things you may want to try:</p>

 the services list, search for&nbsp; <strong>Bonjour DNS Responder Service</strong> or the<strong>Id_String2.6844F930_1628_4223_B5CC_5BB94B87 9762</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-Click
 it on it, select&nbsp; <strong>Properties</strong>, select <strong>Disabled</strong> from the startup type .</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>STOP</strong>

<h2>            iPhone suddenly not syncing photos with PC</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In mid-March, and not tied to anything that I can tell, my photos from my iPhone stopped syncing automatically with Microsoft Photos. When the phone is plugged in and unlocked, I manually open Microsoft Photos, and click Import, the message reads: "We can't
 find photos or videos on your device. Add some and try again." I get this message even though I have taken lots of pics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot find the solution to this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>
