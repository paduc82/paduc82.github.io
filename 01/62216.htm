    <title>Direct hosting of SMB over TCP&#47;IP Specifically in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Direct hosting of SMB over TCP&#47;IP Specifically in Windows 7 Pro&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A year or so ago I had one Windows 7 Professional computer on a NAT LAN with two Windows XP Professional computers, all on the same workgroup.&nbsp; I was somehow able to turn off NetBIOS over TCP/IP on the Windows 7 machine (currently verified through ipconfig/all),
 and I followed the instructions at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/204279/en-us to implement Direct hosting of SMB over TCP/IP on the Windows XP machines.&nbsp; This enabled me to access shares on any machine from any other through password-protected sharing in
 relative safety by using the corresponding IP address (not a problem as my router is set up with IP reservations for all machines; I don't share any printers).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All was well until I upgraded the XP machines to Windows 7 Professional and tried to implement Direct hosting of SMB over TCP/IP on them.&nbsp; Unfortunately the instructions in the cited link apply literally only to Windows XP.&nbsp; I cannot figure out how to implement
 them on the new Windows 7 machines.&nbsp; I can't even reconstruct how I turned off NetBIOS over TCP/IP on the original Windows 7 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my questions are (assuming that I don't want to use NetBIOS to implement file sharing):</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Is there an instruction anywhere that explains how to do this specifically in Windows 7 Pro?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) If not, can anyone translate the following Windows XP instructions from the cited link into Windows 7 steps?</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, point to <strong>Settings</strong>, and then click
<strong>Network and Dial-up Connection</strong>. </li><li>Right-click <strong>Local Area Connection</strong>, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.
</li><li>Click <strong>Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)</strong>, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.
</li><li>Click <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>WINS</strong> tab, and then click <strong>Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>3) I would also want a viable Window 7 test of this setup as shown at the bottom of the cited link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help with this will be greatly appreciated! -- JCW2</p>

            <p>OK, I stumbled on a translation of the above steps, cued in by the (erroneous) Microsoft instruction at https://support.microsoft.com/kb/313314?ppud=4&amp;wa=wsignin1.0:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Control Panel/Network and Sharing Center</p>
<p>Double-click on each connection that needs to be modified (e.g., LAN and wireless) individually and click Properties</p>
<p>Double-click on the Internet Protocol Version 4 entry</p>
<p>Click the Advanced button</p>
<p>Select the WINS tab and click the last button, "Disable NetBios over TCP/IP"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The results may be verified at the Command Prompt by entering "ipconfig/all" and examining the "NetBIOS over Tcpip" entry under each relevant adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps out somebody else... -- JCW2</p>

    <title>PC turns back on within a minute of hibernating. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            PC turns back on within a minute of hibernating.</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I have been trying to solve this problem for months and I haven't found a working solution for it so I just started turning
 my PC off normally. But hibernation is a really useful feature and I think I've tried almost everything to fix it.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">What happens is that every time I put my PC to hibernate, it saves all the memory and stuff and turns off like it should. Then
 usually less than a minute later, all the LEDs go back on and the PC just boots up like normal. I usually just hold the power button for a few seconds to properly turn it off for the second time.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Here's what I did so far:</span><br />
<ul>
<li>Disabled the "allow this device to wake the computer" option for all my peripherals</li><li>Disabled the option that allows tasks to wake the computer</li><li>Disabled all scheduled tasks that are scheduled for the night</li><li>Set Windows updates to notify only, rather than automatic</li><li>Disabled any waking options in my USB Wi-Fi adapter (I don't use Ethernet yet)</li><li>Changed settings in the power plan to disable anything that can wake the PC</li><li>Disabled hybrid sleep in the power plan</li><li>Disabled my keyboard and mouse waking in the BIOS</li><li>Tried "powercfg -devicequery wake_armed" in the cmd which returned "NONE"</li><li>Last time this happened, I did "powercfg lastwake" but it did not list any devices</li></ul>
<li>
</li><li>
</li><li>
</li><li>
</li><li>
</li><li>
</li><li>
</li><li>
</li><li>
</li><li>
<br />
<br />
And this problem still happens. Is there anything else that I can do or check?<br />
Also, is it possible to force the PC to shut down after it saves the memory to the HDD during hibernation? After I hold the power button, the PC does not go back on again so it is obviously not turning off fully during the hibernation process.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused, I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for mentioning the steps you have tried to resolve the issue, we appreciate your effort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This could be due to corrupted drivers or a hardware device triggering the system to wake, or changes in power settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, try the steps below to identify what exactly is causing the system to boot up:</p>
<p>1. Type CMD in the search bar.</p>
<p>2. Right click command prompt and select "run as administrator".</p>
<p>3. Type the following command and press enter.</p>
<p>powercfg -lastwake</p>
<p>4. Check if it shows any events.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I would suggest you to try the methods below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Power troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p><span>The Power troubleshooter checks things like your computer's timeout settings, which determine how long the computer waits before turning off the monitor display or entering sleep mode. Adjusting
 these settings can help you conserve power and extend your computer's battery life.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Type <strong>
<span>troubleshooting </span></strong>in the search bar and open it.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click on "<strong><span>view all</span></strong>" on the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Run the "<strong><span>power</span></strong>" troubleshooter and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2: Change Power Plan</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Try changing the power plan and check again. R</span><span>efer to the steps given in the link below to change your power plan
 and check if it helps</span><span> </span></p>

            <p>I hibernated my computer and waited for it to wake up. Sure enough, it woke up within about 30 seconds.</p>
<p>As soon as that happened, I used the command in command prompt and this was the result:</p>
<p>
C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;powercfg -lastwake<br />
Wake History Count - 1<br />
Wake History [0]<br />
&nbsp; Wake Source Count - 0
</p><p>
</p><p>Power troubleshooter only suggested changing the power plan to save battery but I'm using a computer so that would not help. I did reset the settings in the high performance power plan and I only changed these: Require a password on wakeup to no, Sleep after
 never, enable wake timers to disable, and turn off display after never.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, the problem still persists and nothing helped.</p>

<h3> zachfuj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Unmountable Boot Volume Error</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo G50-45. About six weeks ago I installed Windows 10 after months of ignoring the notification informing me I should update. Yesterday my computer installed an update to 10. Later, after the updates were complete and I had been using my computer
 for a few hours, it started functioning very slowly which lead me to restart the computer from the Windows menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer was having trouble restarting so after about 30 minutes of inactivity I opted to hard reset it with the power button. Upon turning it on I was shown the UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME error screen. I have perused your already given answers for a way
 to fix this issue but the same response has been given to all of them which requires the windows 10 installation DVD and the Windows Media Creation Tool. Because I downloaded the Windows 10 operating system I do not have the installation disk and thus need
 an alterior method for fixing my now useless 10 month old laptop with hundreds of pages of writing on it.</p>

<h2>            If someone knows my product ID, can he hack my pc somehow&#63; whether it be someone who works for Microsoft&#63;</h2>
                    If someone knows my product id, can he hack my pc somehow? I'm from India and recently when I called the Microsoft customer support representative on the toll free number (1800111100) for a doubt regarding my system, the person on the phone asked for my
 product id and product key saying it was for validation purposes.&nbsp; I told him my product ID but did not tell him the product key. He then told me to open SLUI and SLUI 4 to see my product key which now I learned are not the space to see the product key. When
 I opened SLUI or SLUI 4, the screen went to selecting country option and after selecting, it went to a screen saying 'call and provide your installation ID' and the customer care support person said that's not it and asked me to close it which I did. He then
 asked me to open cmd and type something to see the product key which I don't remember what was anyhow I closed that in the midway too because I thought doing it was unnecessary. Now I learned that Microsoft customer support

            Hi its, SLUI 4 is a command to activate Windows 10 by phone - that person you were dealing with on the phone, obviously did not know their commands. So knowing that, I would not be too worried . . .
<br />
<br />I Honestly think he was trying to deactivate your Windows and then he was going to ask you for money to re-activate Windows, thankfully, you stopped him before he could do that . . .

<h2>            How to restore the system&#47;boot drive letter in Windows 7</h2>
                    I found the Windows XP registry repair instructions if the boot drive letter changes:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/223188/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/223188/en-us</a>
<div>But what if it is Windows 7? &nbsp;It says the instructions are only good for Windows XP so I am hesitant to make these changes on my Win 7 PC, but the problem is definitely that my Windows 7 boot drive has changed drive letters. &nbsp;How can I do it? &nbsp;I have tried
 system repair several times already and system restore. &nbsp;Both restore points failed.</div>

            It could be a couple of things. &nbsp;My RAID 5 is degraded, and has been that way for awhile. &nbsp;But it has been managing to get through reboots for quite a long time with no problems. &nbsp;The most recent thing was the most recent Microsoft updates. &nbsp;When it came
 back from that reboot, it wouldn't come up. &nbsp;I tried the Windows XP registry fix for the heck of it, but the registry doesn't hold onto the change, it keeps reverting back to D:

            Sorry, I don't know much about RAID arrays and I avoid them when I can because of the complexity of fixing them when things go wrong. You could, of course, boot the machine into Repair Mode and play with the drive letters in this location: HKLM\SYSTEM\MountedDevices
 in the System hive. Whether this will fix the problem I do not know.

            Hi CT
<br />
<br />1.
<br />The first thing to do is change your Video card device driver, because that controls the sleep function in Windows . . .
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running
<br />
<br />2
<br />Click your Start Button, then just type Power Options
<br />
<br />On the left, click 'Choose what the power buttons do' 
<br />
<br />At the top right, click 'Change settings that are currently unavailable'
<br />
<br />Under 'Shutdown settings' disable 'Turn on fast startup'
<br />
<br />Save that and close Control Panel
<br />
<br />
<br />3
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Run these troubleshooters
<br />
<br />Hardware and devices
<br />
<br />Power

<p>I checked the link that you posted in your reply. Regarding opening the previous folders at startup, I have enabled the setting 'Restore previous folder windows at log-on' and as for other programs, I want to say that, the programs that automatically save
 their data like a web browser can save and restore their data [as I have experienced till now], but
 the article the link of which you provided, I think that there is no way to restore the programs with all their data, on restart, without the help of a third party software</span>.</p>

<p>I am already running an old version of the driver because I have seen that the problem occurred even in the versions that I installed before this one.<br />

<p>When I ran the troubleshooter 'Hardware and devices' it ran for quite a while and then it displayed 'An error occurred while troubleshooting: An unexpected error has occurred. The troubleshooting wizard can't continue'. And when I clicked 'view error details'
 then some of the details were: 'Error code: 0x8000FFFF', 'Source: Page load', 'Context: Elevated'.</p>

<p>Time before hard disk goes to sleep is too long</p>
<p>Why I want this:</p>
<p>I don't want the hard disk going to sleep so I had written 'never' in the box, because a person in the windows chat option told me much time ago to do it if I didn't wanted the hard disk to go to sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue 2 (shown as fixed):</p>
<p>Time before computer goes to sleep is too long</p>
<p>Why I want this:</p>
<p>I don't want the computer to go to sleep, until I click on the sleep button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue 3 (shown as fixed):</p>
<p>USB selective suspend is disabled</p>
<p>Why I want this:</p>
<p>As because I download large files, and if I will enable this, it will cause the internet connection to be dropped [as I use a data card device

<h2>            error 0x80071AC3 message copying to SanDisk microcard</h2>
                    I bought a SanDisk SDSDQU-064G-U46A Ultra 64GB Class 10 microSDXC Card including the microSDXC to SD Adapter. However, when I put it in my computer to copy files to it so I can use it with my Samsung 2 Tab, I get the 0x80071AC3 error message.
<div>Some forums are saying to format it once it is in the Tab, others are saying format it from my computer, and others are saying don't format it at all because it will halve the capacity of the card from a 64GB to a 32GB.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Help? I'm not very techie-minded so please feel free to explain how I can fix this the same way you would to a small child :)</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Vista is very stable however it and XP, as well as all other OS's, can be negatively affected by<br />
outside influences.<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER
<br />
had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause
<br />
strange issues).<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>Do these :</strong><br />
<br />
Start - type this in Search Box -&gt;&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; -&nbsp; RUN AS ADMIN<br />

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.
<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,
<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate
<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -
<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after
<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually
<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers
<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as
<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check <br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be
<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then
<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<h2>            Bought computer with pirated windows 7 premium want to downgrade to genuine windows 7 home premium.</h2>
                    So I bought a computer from a fly by night store that sells used computers and come to find out from a friend that they sell computers with pirated windows. I bought a genuine windows 7 home premium as soon as I found out and would like to downgrade immediately.
 How do I go about getting this pirated garbage off my computer and get my real windows on? I am so frusterated that someone would actually sell something that is PIRATED and call themselves a good company. They are no longer in the little strip mall that I
 bought if from so I have no way of getting my money back. So it comes down to getting my computer to be genuine. Please help me! I tried doing it myself but I have no clue cause inserting the disc into the drive doesnt work. I would like to completely wipe
 my hard drive and install my genuine windows.

<span>Every computer is different, when you first turn on the computer it should tell you what button to push to enter the BIOS. It's usually one of the following and you must push
 it within the first 5 seconds: </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>F1 &nbsp;F2 &nbsp;F10 &nbsp;F12 ESC &nbsp;DEL
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Once in the BIOS you have to find the menu with the boot order and change it so it boots from the CD/DVD drive first. Every computer is a little different for this process
 as well so I can't give exact directions. <br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If your BIOS settings are correct and if you have a DVD drive, when the computer restarts if there is a message to "press any key to boot from disk" you must press a key on
 the keyboard to boot from the DVD. </span></p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 apps that won&#39;t open - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 apps that won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p><span>Hey there,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that this is a known issue with Windows 8.1 but after having trawled through many websites offering potential solutions (many of which
 I have tried to the best of my ability), I am still suffering with it. When I attempt to open several of the apps included with Windows 8.1 - Weather, Mail, Store etc - the apps appears to open normally by spinning round and expanding to fill the screen...but
 I am then returned straight back to the Start screen. The app remains in the left swipe-in bar, but whenever I try to select it, it does the same thing again- displays the opening image for a couple of seconds and then returns to the Start screen.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Obviously this is a pretty major flaw in using Windows 8.1 and one that I am far from alone in experiencing it seems.&nbsp;Despite the numerous suggested
 remedies online, I am still none the wiser as to what is causing this or how to resolve it. While I’m not sure that I will be able to find any alternative suggestions for things I can do by posing this question, I wanted to give it a try as I struggle to believe
 such a fundamental issue, experienced by so many users, does not have a reliable remedy. So can anyone advise me as to what can be done to solve this situation?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file "wer.dll" means "Windows Error Reporting". If this cannot run, you can probably fix it by doing the following.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click the Start button and go to "Command Prompt (Admin)".</li><li>Type (or copy/paste) <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and hit Enter.</li></ol>
<p>System File Checker will check Windows system files for corruption and attempt to repair any found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it can't, you'll see a message that says, "<em>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files, but was unable to fix some of them</em>".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that event, use the same command prompt to run the following command which I suggest you copy/paste:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>DISM.exe/Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>If neither of these fixes the problem, open another Command Prompt (Admin) and run the following command to check your hard drive for errors.
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>CHKDSK /f </strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>If you have a standard rotary hard drive, run this command instead:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>CHKDSK /f /r</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>You'll get a message that the tool cannot be run because the disk can't be locked and whether you want to schedule a diags check on the next reboot. Click "Yes" and then either reboot immediately, or finish what you're doing and then restart.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If CHKDSK finds bad sectors, it will mark them as such so that they can't be used. But if the tool appears to hang for more than a few of hours at a certain percentage, then that may possibly indicate that your hard drive is defective and will need to be
 replaced. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You might wish to print these instructions.</p>
<p />

<p>If you actually did a "fresh install of Windows" (rather than a "reboot" as you wrote in the body of your post), you need to install ALL of the drivers associated with your hardware or Windows will attempt to use generic drivers for the devices that it is
 able to recognize.&nbsp; Typically, you would install drivers for your motherboard (chipset), video adapter, audio adapter, network adapter, and perhaps others.</p>
<p>If you did not receive a CD with a set of drivers when you obtained your computer (and your clean reinstall of Windows XP was from a CD rather than from a hidden partition on the hard drive), you have two choices.</p>
<p>Preferably, obtain the drivers from your computer manufacturer.&nbsp; In your case, start here:<a href="http://www.equuscs.com/productdrivers?dc=NB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.equuscs.com/productdrivers?dc=NB</a></p>
<p>If you are unable to obtain drivers that way, you will have to identify the exact make and model of the various hardware components in your computer and get the driver(s) from the manufacturer of each of those components.&nbsp; You can start identifying drivers
 by using built-in Windows tools.&nbsp; Both Device Manager (Start &gt; Run &gt; devmgmt.msc &gt; OK) and System Information (Start &gt; Run &gt; msinfo32 &gt; OK) should give you most of the information you need.&nbsp; If not, you can use a third-party system information tool, such as
 SIW from <a href="http://www.gtopala.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gtopala.com/</a> or open the box and look.</p>

<p>What do you mean? Is your computer not listed at the site I provided?&nbsp; What is the specific model of your computer?</p>

<p>the model of my pc was not listed but using Start&gt; Run&gt; Dxdiag it said the model of my pc was Nobilis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;not to make you mad but i dont know where to find this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;is this found on the back?</p>
<p>I was just informed buy a label on the pc that it was upgraded from windows 2000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;does this have anything to do with the hardware issues when i rebooted it with the windows xp cd?</p>
<p>&nbsp;i have a cd the has the windows xp pro sp2 installation cd that installs xp pro on any harddrive as long as i have a valid liscence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;i dont have a clue where the model number is.</p>
<p>i would realy appreciate it if you help me on this part.</p>

<p>I'm not mad at all.&nbsp; "Nobilis" is a brand name for a line of "custom-built" computers.&nbsp; As near as I can tell, computers with the Nobilis name are sold by several different "system builder" companies, but they all seem to lead back to Equus Computer Systems,
 which is the web site I originally gave you.</p>
<p>It seems to me that you have two options:</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; Call Equus at <strong>800-576-7929 </strong>and ask (1) how to identify which model of Nobilis computer you have and (2) where you can download the drivers for it.</p>
<p>B.&nbsp; Try to figure out the answer to these questions on your own. If you're going to take option A, you don't need to read any further.</p>
<p>It is, of course, possible that you can get the information from the company who sold you the computer.&nbsp; Or you may have documentation and/or one or more CD/DVDs that came with the computer.&nbsp; So ...</p>
<ul>
<li>Where did you buy your computer?&nbsp; </li><li>Is the company still in business? </li><li>Did you receive any documentation and/or CD/DVDs with it?&nbsp; </li><li>On the DxDiag page that you ran, if the "System Model" is shown as "Nobilis", what is shown for "System Manufacturer"?</li></ul>
<p>In addition to answering the above, please do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start Notepad (Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Notepad) </li><li>Click Start &gt; Run &gt; msinfo32 &gt; OK </li><li>The System Information window should open with the top line in the left pane (System Summary) selected.&nbsp; Click Edit &gt; Select All, then click Edit &gt; Copy, then in the open Notepad window, click Edit &gt; Paste</li><li>Go back to the System Information window and click on the + next to "Components" then click on "Sound Device." Click Edit &gt; Select All, then click Edit &gt; Copy, then go back to the Notepad window.&nbsp; The cursor should be at the bottom.&nbsp; Press Enter to get
 a blank line and then click Edit &gt; Paste </li><li>Go back to the System Information window and click "Display." Click Edit &gt; Select All, then click Edit &gt; Copy, then go back to the Notepad window.&nbsp; The cursor should be at the bottom.&nbsp; Press Enter to get a blank line and then click Edit &gt; Paste
</li><li>Go back to the System Information window and click on the + next to "Network."&nbsp; Click on "Adapter." Click Edit &gt; Select All, then click Edit &gt; Copy, then go back to the Notepad window.&nbsp; The cursor should be at the bottom.&nbsp; Press Enter to get a blank line
 and then click Edit &gt; Paste </li><li>Go back to the System Information window and click on "Problem Devices".&nbsp; Click Edit &gt; Select All, then click Edit &gt; Copy, then go back to the Notepad window.&nbsp; The cursor should be at the bottom.&nbsp; Press Enter to get a blank line and then click Edit &gt; Paste
</li><li>Save the Notepad job as a txt file somewhere that you'll remember. </li><li>In your response here, copy and paste the contents of the Notepad file you created.</li></ol>

<p>1.&nbsp; I think you would be best served by calling Equus, because the information that is shown by System Information is too generic -- it reveals that your computer is made by Equus and is a "Nobilis" model, but Equus makes many different models -- as shown
 here: <a href="http://www.equuscs.com/productdrivers?dc=NB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.equuscs.com/productdrivers?dc=NB</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; If you have substituted hardware parts, there's now way anyone can tell from the information you provided what your other hardware is.&nbsp; For example, the video card shown in the System Information report you provided is an nVidia Vanta/Vanta LT card.&nbsp;
 This is a legacy (i.e., somewhat obsolete) economy video card, but nVidia still makes drivers for it:<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/winxp_2k_71.89.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/object/winxp_2k_71.89.html</a> &nbsp; Of course, it won't do you any good to download
 and install that driver if you're going to remove that video card and put something else back in the computer.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; You appear to have a Belkin USB wifi adapter and an HP Ethernet adapter, both of which seem to be working OK.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I apologize -- I forgot that all of the information that System Information provides does not include the make and model of the motherboard.&nbsp; To find that out, you need something else, such as<a href="http://www.gtopala.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SIW from gtopala.com</a>
 Or, because I'm pretty sure you have an Intel motherboard, go to</p>
<p><a href="http://www.intel.com/support/detect.htm?iid=dc_iduu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/support/detect.htm?iid=dc_iduu</a></p>
<p>and run the driver update tool.&nbsp; Click OK when it says that the publisher can't be verified.</p>
<p>Install the chipset drivers (at least).</p>

            I had the same trouble after re-installing Windows XP.&nbsp; When you bought the computer, the purchase would have included an additional CD for installing devices. If you don't have it, you'll have to call the computer manufacturer, and provide them with your
 computer's serial and model numbers.

<h2>            Searching conversation in skype &#40;July 2018&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I use skype regularly and generally it is very useful. The latest version update (July 2018) has taken away the menus which were across the top of the GUI. How do I search a conversation as the Ctrl F suggested on websites when in the conversation does not
 work. Any suggestions.</p>
<p>Thanks<br />
David</p>

            Hi koende,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />As Release preview ring is on build 17763, you cannot switch yet to release preview. A build for release preview is expected this month, so when that releases you can switch. Slow ring builds would stop releasing when Release preview builds releases.

</p><p>But when I choose the add option, Facebook is not one of the options:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If I choose the apps I've already set up option, Facebook is also not listed. I've been able to connect to other accounts, such as Twitter. But I'm not finding any solutions to this facebook option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to connect via the People app on the Surface RT, it says I cannot connect to facebook due to not allowing certain permissions, but it also says I can fix that once I've connected to facebook and to click try again to reattempt to connect. This does
 not work.</p>

<div>Facebook changed their API so Facebook Connect no longer works. Microsoft is</div>
<div>having a hard time updating apps to reflect the current "no longer supported"</div>
<div>status. You should stop trying to connect the People App as it won't work. </div>

<p>Hi, I am actually new at Xbox live. Have had my xbox360 for years now but never got interested in using internet to play online. I recently got interested in purchasing a new Xbox360 slim version with Kinect. Unfortunately I bought the 4Gb version and have
 very limited space for downloading so I decided to purchase the 250gb hard dive. I am just waiting for it to arrive via USPS and my international shipper will deliver in 3 to 5 business days and once it does I will most definitely try online gaming. The next
 problem is that I never quite tested my internet connection to see if online gaming would work with my current provider. I do consider it is very fast since I am able to stream live TV. The only game with coop online multiplayer that I have is Tom Clancy’s
 Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter™ 2 . Oh, I forgot to mention I am from Nicaragua, a country in central America. Most of my friends here have PS3. They all warned me not to buy the XBOX again because for online gaming you have to pay gold membership. I just
 would like to try to see if online gaming would work using this game, if it does, then I would buy the one year membership and more games that have this feature. I just hope that in a few days, you have the chance to play with me and consider me as a friend.
 Believe me, if love Call of duty, Gears of War, Halo and Mass effect franchise. My profile is dafg79.</p>

<p>I am still waiting for my sister , that lives in the US to provide me with a code to redeem my gold membership. Hope we can play some time soon. I think I will be ready by september. I will most definitely let you know.</p>

<p>You have probably already played it now however if you haven't then I am interested. I am buying it again tomorrow but I have a question, &nbsp;even though I originally had the Legacy Edition will I need a Legacy disc or can I still play with the DLC on a normal

<p>Hi, I'd be keen to play some multiplayer or co-op with reasonable folks. I played GR2 on my original xbox years ago, but I've only recently got round to buying GRAW2. I'm in Australia, so if anyone in a similar timezone fancies a game, please feel free to
 invite me. </p>

<p>Did you get a list of updates when you ran the .exe file from the link, and was the onenote security update on it?&nbsp; If so the only other thing I did to get mine to work for me was reset windows update.&nbsp; The onenote update on my computer was hung at 32%,
 every time I ran update it would automatically go to onenote security update and show 32% and stop.&nbsp; I found a link from another thread regarding windows 10 update problems and there was a batch file that another win10 user used to reset update.&nbsp; I did that
 first and it reset update completely, then I was able to use the "hide update program".
</p>
<p>Here's where I found that solution: Copy it and paste it to your browser and it'll take you to the thread showing you how to reset windows update.</p>

            <p>An external hd would be considered "plug &amp; play",no drivers are needed...</p>
<p>However,simply plug and play it,would be determined if youre pc&nbsp;hardware</p>
<p>is up to date.The pc controllers &amp; USB controllers need software/drivers to</p>
<p>operate properly,the "chipset installation utility" would be the 1st,then the IDE</p>
<p>or SATA/RAID software,some pcs also require a seperate chipset installation.</p>
<p>Get all the updated downloads from the MB mfg web site (intel,amd,etc).You</p>
<p>can get the MB specific hardware part/number from device mgr,copy down,then</p>
<p>head to its mfg web...&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            In addition to the above answer, what makes you think you need the driver? <br />
<br />
Your post is vague at best. Give us some details about what is going on with the external. Any error messages? If so, what are they EXACTLY?
<br />
<br />
Have you tried the external on a different computer assuming that is an option? <br />
