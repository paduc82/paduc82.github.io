<h2>            Xbox One Wired Mic not working</h2>
                    
<p>It worked fine for about two days, and now my wired mic seems to mot be able to talk or listen to anyone. The weird thing is though, it still&nbsp;lights up when you press the mute button, and makes the sound if you keep turning the sound up, just nothing through
 chat.</p>

<p>I've tried both replacing batteries and plugging in controller and nothing seems to work. The Mic was working fine until I tried to restart console to get party chat working which it froze restarting so I hard reset it and now Mic isn't working but lights
 up makes sound but nothing else.</p>

<p>The issue came back.. but I went to the guide and selected my profile and voice chat worked once again. Tested 2 this times already, powered off then powered back on, mic chat stopped working again but then I selected choose profile without using kinect
 and that fixed the issue. This seems to be happening when I use the kinect to sign in, and usually when my room is dark and my laptop is covering my face. This is clearly a bug, please MS notify this to other people. Thanks</p>

<p>I get the same issue when I started/joined a party through the Kinect... BUT would work if you used the controller. Then it just would not work at all last night. look the "high quality headset" off and threw this garbage on the floor. It smashed into dozens
 of pieces..."High quality"...OK</p>
<p>Suggest you guys set up a party through the 360 and keep moving the stick even few minutes to stop the controller from powering down. that's what we have been reduced to after spending $700+ of this useless xbox.

                    It is eating up my CPU time and RAM memory and also placing an "update" icon in my toolbar.&nbsp; I believe this is a virus, although the web states that at one point it was a Microsoft Automatic Updater that can sometimes disguises itself as a virus.&nbsp; It is
 wreaking havoc and every time I try to stop its process on my Task Manager, it quickly (seconds) restarts.&nbsp; Please help!<br />

            I don't understand your answer. Under 'File' there is Export... but no options are available beyond naming and locating the file you export. Could you add more detail please? Thanks for your time on this because this is really screwing up my machine, too.

<h2>            Can someone explain Lag Compensation to me. </h2>
                    
<p>So I havent heard this term untill I jumped on the forum today and see several posts about "lag comp broke my game", so on and so forth.&nbsp; Did some searching online and found some information but it looks like people seem to be in two camps.&nbsp; People who sound
 network savy stating "its a ping issue deal with it" and people with game experiance stating "lag comp sucks".&nbsp;&nbsp; Only been on MW3 multiplayer for about a week (due to internet/account issues) and so far things to be pretty constant every now and then I have
 a terrible match but I usually chalk that up to me playing for way to long and needing to take a break.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So at this point here im trying to get a valid explination for what lag compensation is if anyone can assist with that it would be much appriceated.</p>

<p>The simplest way to put it......... &nbsp;If you have a super good connection speed the game creates artificial lag to "even the playing field"... &nbsp; So if you have really good internet you get punished so that people with crap internet can excel..</p>

<p>It's a method of balancing the online experience out for everyone, since Host advantage is an extreme factor in online play. They slow down players with good connections, though I don't know what they do to help slower players, if anything.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The result would ideally be that no-one is advantaged, except that they *might* have overdone it a bit. Only IW would be able to tell you whether they have or not, and people may be exaggerating its effect as well.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>They're looking at changing it in some way in one of the future updates.</p>

<p>Repost of what I've already posted.</p>
<p>I'm going to jump in here with connection speed having something to do with lag compensation or lag in general. Connection speed doesn't matter unless we are talking dialup or hosting. When playing MW3 you are using ~50 to 75Kbs...that's Kilobits...not bytes
 per second. Hosting I've seen it run from 300Kbs to 750Kbs. Even the most basic broadband connections can handle this from the client side.</p>
<p>Lag compensation works on latency. You know, that milisecond number you get when you ping Google or run a trace route to them. Lag compensation takes those number from the users that are connecting to the host, attempts to 'normalize' them by delaying information
 to users with low latency. That way the guy from New York connecting to a host in Nebraska with a 250ms ping has a chance with the guy in Iowa with a 50ms ping.</p>
<p>The problem is something appears to be dreadfully wrong with the lag comp in MW3 and earlier in BLOPS. This results in hugely one sided game play where your entire team is simply unable to kill the other team consistently. We have all been in those 7500-2500
 games where your fighting with the aim assist to keep on where "you" see the target but not where the "host' sees the target. The game itself is determining the winner by compensating you out of the competition.</p>

<p>Man, why bother having a freaking format button when it doesn't do a damn thing...</p>
<p>Anyway, to put it in easier terms using the example above. Since our fictional NY user has a 250ms ping to the host that basically means that his information takes approximately 1/4 of a second to get to the host. Mr. Iowa on the other hand (50ms) means
 his information makes it to the host significantly faster. So what happens when these guys meet. Well, in a no compensation world Mr Iowa is going to win almost every time. In a 1/4 of a second Mr Iowa is already shooting before Mr NY even realizes he has
 rounded the corner. Mr NY is lagging behind Mr Iowa due to his location.</p>
<p>So lag comp tries to normalize this. It looks at all the connections, finds a average it thinks will normalize the game (say 150ms in this case) and delays Mr Iowa information by that amount. That way Mr Iowa (now at 200ms delay) and Mr NY (at 250ms) are
 much closer to the same timing. They see each other at approximately the same time and at approximately at the right place.</p>
<p>What appears to be happening in MW3 is that the averaging function appears to be killing people with low pings (Mr Iowa in this case). Instead of adding a 150ms delay (using this example) it's adding something much worse. Say 250 or 300 ms...to Mr Iowa.
 As a result Mr Iowa, who got into the great 50 ms server....is seeing everything as if he was connected at 350 ms...and gets connsistently owned by Mr NY which connected with a crappy ping.</p>

<p>[/quote]That is actually a pretty good possibility.&nbsp; I have a very average connection (probably in the middle 50% area) and I haven't noticed a change at all.&nbsp; When I'm host I don't feel disadvantaged, and I never feel advantaged based on connection either.&nbsp;
 My performance says the same thing--I'm consistent with previous games.&nbsp; Lag compensation probably isn't affecting me much because of this; those who have high-end connections might be used to having the connection advantage and just haven't gotten used to
 an even playing field, so they are doing more poorly and assume lag compensation is actually giving them a disadvantage.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I'm not saying this is for sure of course, but it sounds reasonable to me.</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>Part of this is almost certainly what it is. I personally am just going to deal with it and play the game, but I'm quite familiar with how easy it is to kill people when you're on Host/very good connection outside of MW3.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>While I think it's a perfectly possible that they have overdone it or something else, I think it's much more likely that people are upset that they aren't slaughtering effortlessly, which many people do and used to.</p>

    <title>Unable to use Bluetooth Dongle with Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ponuryciastkarz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to use Bluetooth Dongle with Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>hello,</p>
<p>I recently purchased a USB Bluetooth Dongle ( &nbsp;Esperanza BLUETOOTH v2.1. EA101 ) (not a best buy but defiantly a cheep one).</p>
<p>While i can confirm that it is 100 % functional and working. As i tested it on the other PC with Windows 7(x64) and my Linux device.</p>
<p>I can not set it up to work with me home PC. <br />
I goggled a lot . Found that my &nbsp;Bluetooth Support Service was stooped and i manually started it and set to start automatically restarted computer and plugged device. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Plug and Play installed CSR Bluetooth Chip driver . ( same one can be downloaded from manufacture website).</p>
<p>I'm still unable to use the device. When i enter the Bluetooth settings if i make any changes it says that my device is unplugged.</p>
<p>While on the other PC i tried it the plug and play also installed/set up following things which were not installed on my Home PC :</p>
<p>Bluetooth Device (RFCOMM Protocol TDI)</p>
<p>Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator</p>
<p>Bluetooth Device ( Personal Area Network)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any tips am I missing smth?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can provide any other necessary details upon request&nbsp;</p>

<p>Non of the above Method helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying them i managed to solve the problem in more invasive way.</p>
<p>Solution that worked :</p>
<p>I re installed my Windows, updated it with all Windows Updates + installed the newest drivers.</p>
<p>(My previous instance of Windows 7 was up to date with both Updates and Drivers)<br />
After that I started&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Bluetooth Support Service and set it to Automatic.&nbsp;</span>Restart PC, plug device and ALL the drivers installed automatically ( including&nbsp;</p>

 platform issues. &nbsp;In case that is not your platform, please let me know, so that I may try elsewhere, because it seems like the answers for your platform are not really forthcoming...

<p>I am a different user, and I am having the same issue. &nbsp;There seems to be no way to send a voice message. &nbsp;Below is a screenshot for my situation, but I don't understand how that will help you help me, since my issue is that I don't know where to look for
 the option to send a voice message, and wherever I have looked (which seems to be everywhere), there seems to be no vestige of a voice recorder icon or anything remotely like it. &nbsp;To fully document my search for it with screenshots would, I think, be a visual
 overload, as well as a waste of everyone's time...</p>

<h2>            Minecraft Nether Problem</h2>
                    
<p>My friends and I are making multiple nether portals to connect our houses but 3 of our overworld portals make us spawn in 1 nether portal. So we have 2 portals in the nether and 4 in the overworked. How do we spawn more in the Nether?</p>

<p>Short answer: &nbsp;You need to build matched pairs of portals. &nbsp;Destroy the auto-created ones, and build your own where the coordinates come close to matching. &nbsp;X and Z coordinates in the overworld are 3 times the size of nether coordinates. &nbsp;The Y coordinate
 is the same in both the overworld and the nether.</p>

<p>I too just hit this last night. &nbsp;My first portal is near 0,0,0 (close to the original spawn point).</p>
<p>My second portal is presumably far enough away, it is near the western edge of the map, mostly due west, slightly northwest.</p>
<p>as the wiki shows, the actual coordinates and math would help.</p>
<p>In my eye, it was far enough away. &nbsp;However, this statement points out:</p>
<p><em>Likelihood of 2 overworld portals linking to the same Nether portal - Normal World portals that are within 1024 distance of each other on both X and Z axis are almost always going to link to the same Nether realm portal on initial construction because
 1024 translates to a distance of 128 in the Nether Realm, and the game checks for existing Portals within 128 "radius" around the destination (the 257x257x128 box).</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the map itself is slightly smaller than 1024x1024, we may not be able to get farth enough away in practical terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can perform the overland distance calculation by getting the coords for both overland portals,&nbsp;&nbsp; take the absolute values of x=abs(x1-x2) and y=abs(y1-y2).&nbsp; they do pythagoras's theorem on it d =&nbsp; sqrt(&nbsp;x^2&nbsp;+ y^2)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your best bet is to do portals that are on opposite corners of the mat, to get a distance larger than 1024 in the overland map.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's too bad.&nbsp; As I had built Cheyenne Mountain and the Star Gate Command with Gate Room for the second gate. Kind of useless now, though it does&nbsp;reflect having 2 active star gates on the same planet.</p>

<p>That's too complex for most people. &nbsp;All you have to do is build your own matched portals
<i>in both worlds</i>. &nbsp;Destroy the portals the game generates itself, because they're usually far away from where they should be for proper matched pairs of portals. &nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Let's say you build a portal in the overworld at -300, 52, 127. &nbsp;The corresponding coordinates in the nether would be -300/3, 52, 127/3, which rounded out to integers equals -100, 52, 42. &nbsp;You want to build your matched portal in the nether as close to those
 coordinates as you can. &nbsp;And if the game generated a portal somewhere else in the nether, go destroy it, so the game's logic doesn't get confused later, when you build other portals.</p>

<p>I should add that I have 5 matched pairs of portals in my gargamel world right now, with a railway system going between them in the nether. &nbsp;Some of these portals are fairly close to others, and still they work perfectly. &nbsp;As long as the game finds a closely
 matching portal in the other world, it will always go there. &nbsp;It will never get confused and send you to the wrong portal.</p>

<p>Hypnotic is correct but the Y coordinate doesn't matter. It'll still link the 2 portals no matter where the 2 portals are made.</p>

<p>My understanding is that Y matters if X and Z are very close. &nbsp;But you're right, Y can generally be ignored. &nbsp;It would be an interesting experiment to see if you can build portal pairs at the same X, Z, but at different elevations, and see if the game can
 still match them up. &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>The difference in the Y should always act as if you didn't link a portal along the X,Y coordinates, to the best of my knowledge. If someone were to make numerous portals in the overworld, on the Y axis then you'd probably have to sync up the portals on the
 Y axis in the Nether also.</p>

            Alright a few other things you may try. 
<br />
<br />go into a command prompt as admin (type cmd into search, right click it and select run as admin) type sfc /scannow (this will take a while)
<br />
<br />If it finds nothing then try putting in these commands:
<br />
<br />          Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />           Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

<p>A little background might help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you run a program, it's very important to be sure that the program is actually what it&nbsp;claims to be. For example: Just because a file
<em>calls itself</em> Winword.exe, how do you know it&nbsp;<em>really is</em>&nbsp;Microsoft Word?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Software developers vouch for their identity by obtaining a&nbsp;<em>digital certificate</em>, which is a proof of identity not unlike a passport or a driver's license. Digital certificates are issued by trustworthy organizations called&nbsp;<em>certificate authorities.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most people wouldn't begin to know (and why should they) how to check whether a program they want to run has a valid digital certificate, so the operating system does that for you by consulting the list of known and accepted certificate authorities included
 in the operating system.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's what happened: Windows won't open your program because the certificate authority (the 'publisher') is not, or is no longer, on the list of known and accepted certificate authorities. The publisher might have been known and accepted in an earlier
 list of certificate authorities, but the lists are updated frequently. The April 2018 update, or another update, revised the list of known publishers, and the publisher for your program ain't no longer on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of this was invented by Microsoft, who is simply complying with internationally accepted standards for safe computing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're seeing the message because Windows can no longer guarantee that the program is safe to use.</p>

<p>
</p><p>thank you for the explanation. However the thing is I am not seeing a message that the program is from an unknown publisher. I believe that is the problem I am facing.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Saving a GIF from email...</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to save a GIF from my email. I use AOL mail. It will not save as a GIF only as a Bitmap. Is there a default I can change? I spent an hour with HP support. What I was told was to save in Paint then change the file type. This is a pain. Is there
 any other way. I am trying to save these to a folder on my flash. I am using Vista Home Premium Sevice Pack 1 64 bit.&nbsp;

            I just tested this on my computer.&nbsp; I did a search for "animated gif" in Internet Explorer 7.&nbsp; Loaded a page that had one, right clicked and chose "save as".&nbsp; I had the choice to save as a .gif or .bmp.&nbsp; Try that and see what results you get.<br />
<br />
If the file you are right clicking isn't a .gif, Internet Explorer will not convert it to one.&nbsp; You will need to load the image into a program like paint and save it as another file type.<br />

<p>Si amigos, lo que me temia sucedió, resulta que hace como 15 dias compré el dvd original de gears 3 y hoy de un momento a otro cuando estaba jugando, se bloqueo el juego y no funcionó mas, abri la bandeja y saque el dvd, y le encontré un rayón totalmente
 circular en el borde externo del dvd, lo probe en otras 4 consolas originales que tengo y nada no funciona, por favor cual será el procedimiento para que microsoft me de un reemplazo? ¿ y cuanto me valdría? GraciasLa garantia de la consola vence en diciembre
 del 2.012 Nuevamwente gracias</p>

<p>Por favor, si va a ser una critica, que esta sea constructiva y con conocimiento de causa, no hay que hacer presunciones ignorantes, la consola esta asegurada con un soporte metálico el cual evita que tan siquiera vibre, además de que la consola se congeló
 de un momento a &nbsp;otro de3spues de 2 horas de estar jugando, además hay que tener un poquito de conocimientos tecnicos y de sentido común, el rayon que tiene es perfectamente circular, lo cual indica que no fue un rayon brusco por movimiento dee la consola,
 asi que por favor calladitos mas bien, sino se sabe del tema Gracias</p>

<p>Los rayones con forma circular y uniforme son precisamente los ocasionados por el movimiento de la consola. La garantía de la consola no cubre el rayon de un disco y ningún almacen le responde por un disco en esas condiciones a menos este sea destapado dentro
 del almacén en el momento de la compra y se encuentre la raya.</p>

<p>compañero, me paso lo mismo con gears 1, eso es por mover la consola cuando esta leyendo el disco, te rcomiendo q consigas un local donde pulen los dvd o dvd de juegos, estas personas pulen estos dvd y quedan como nuevos, claro q mi gears no se salvo del
 todo, solo se puede jugar campaña, pero bueno se salvo algo de nada, pues mis rayones eran muy profundos y ademas esta vencido en la mitad, esa pulida cuesta entre 1.000 y 2.000 pesitos y depronto tengas buena fortuna Y la consola lo lea en su totalidad,.
 tambien recomiendo a todos q no guarden sus videos juegos en sus cajas, porq el seguro q trae la caja el de la mitad, ayuda a romper o quebrar en la mitad al dvd con el tiempo, por quitar y poner cada rato o simplemente por los cambios de temperatura q sufre
 el juego en el estuche se &nbsp;dilata y se contrae y esto causa el rompimiento del dvd solo, asi lo tengas lejos del sol o del frio. asi me ocurrio con modern warfare, se quebro solito, lo guarde bueno y lo fui a sacar y vaya sorpresa. es mejor q lo coloquen en
 una chuspita de cd y lo coloquen en su estuche pero ojo sin asegurarlo. espero te ayude esto.</p>

<p>Please, please, please will someone help me. I'm using a Toshiba laptop which I bought about 10 days ago pre-loaded with windows 8.1
</p>
<p>Nearly every time I move the mouse to the right (<strong>not to the edge</strong>) the charms bar appears on the right side &amp; a digital clock to the bottom left. I can't find any way of stopping (except for clicking on the screen) sometimes it brings up
 the start page (shrug &amp; puff) this &amp; it's becoming more &amp; more irritating<strong> :(</strong>

<p>Any advice? </p>

            <p>Hi Basith, </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply I did make a change following someone's suggestion on here by clicking the mouse settings &amp; disabled the side screen but when I shut down &amp; restarted I couldn't get onto the internet through our wireless broad. So I went back to the
 mouse settings &amp;&nbsp;returned them to the enable the side bar &amp; voila up &amp; running but had to put up with this side bar on the right &amp; the clock bottom left.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't see the need to use the snipping tool as the side bar is the same as if you go the top/bottom right.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue that you are facing is not exactly an issue, this is by design. When you move the cursor towards&nbsp;top/bottom right corner it will shows the charms bar and the charms bar covers the Digital clock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I can't imagine how on earth the mouse touchpad gesture swipe (which is controlled by whatever company built your touchpad -- Microsoft doesn't build those), would affect your internet ability. &nbsp;I would honestly try it again. &nbsp;And if it really does damage

            <p>Hi&nbsp;Shawn, </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Me neither, I'm just using sleep mode right now rather than shut down. My laptop is a Toshiba and everything else seems ok. Other than the fact I can't seem to burn a video that I took on my camera onto a disc :(
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I will try another day but I'm on chemo right now &amp; don't&nbsp;have an awful lot of energy. Thanks for your reply.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Movie Maker Audio File cuts off at end. </h2>
                    Movie Maker Audio File cuts off at end. When I play the MP3 audio file alone, the full song plays. But in Movie Maker, the last 3-5 seconds is missing when I play from project from start to finish. However, when I start viewing from the last part of the
 slide show movie that&nbsp; am creating, I do hear the end of the audio. Please advise<br />

<h2>            Cannot login to Windows 10 - RPC Server unavailable</h2>
                    Whenever I try to log into Windows 10 it asks me for my password but when I key this in, it simply states The RPC server is unavailable. I cannot do anything else, there is no start tile and neither can I get to task manager or anything like that. It has
 effectively locked me out. Thanks for any help in advance.

            I am using a personal computer. I have not done anything to the laptop prior to this happening. I am not sure what troubleshooting steps to use. I have tried a few that i have googled but they do not result in anything.

            I think the problem is that you don't always update your windows 10 in time. Must always update your windows when you receive a message about updating. so that the server is good as new.&nbsp;

<p>What is this nonsense?&nbsp; You didn't update Windows in time so it did this? Completely wrong and false information.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Deleting sub folders on Windows 10</h2>
                    I'm organizing pictures into folders and now I've found that I no longer need some subfolders that I've created. &nbsp;Ugh... I CANNOT figure out for the life of me, how to delete them. &nbsp;Ideally, without deleting the contents inside. &nbsp;The contents belong in
 the main folder. &nbsp;I just need to do away with the sub folder. &nbsp;Please help......

<p>If it's come from a French website the game will mainly be in French. Although most game come with multiple language choices. So in theory you can play the French game in English or an English game in French. But this is only if the option is available.</p>

                    <p>Hello again</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to buy Windows 10 from Microsoft, but it's the first time I am installing it and I need some help from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. After I purchase it how will I receive it and what does it look like? Is it a link? Where is it I receive it?</p>
<p>2. How do i transfer it on a USB drive? Just '' send to''&nbsp; to the USB Drive?</p>
<p>3. How many GB should the usb drive have? Is 4 GB enough?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; What is a bootable Windows 10 usb flash drive and why do i need to create one? Does not sending windows on the usb enough and then install it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please tell me what are the steps from buying to installing Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never done this and I am at loss to know how to install windows from scratch.
</p>
<p>Thank you again!</p>

            Hi Andraperianu
<br />
<br />Go to the Microsoft Store to purchase Windows 10, you can choose to have a Bootable USB flash drive sent to you or create your own. The Windows 10 Product Key will be Emailed to you and automatically linked to your Microsoft Account
<br />
<br />If you choose to create your own:
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS so the bootable USB is top of the boot order list) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Step 1: Make bootable install media:
<br />
<br />What you should do, is first download the ISO file using Media Creation Tool, then use another tool such as Rufus to make a bootable copy. Here is how you do that:
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Create installation media for another PC if you want to download a ISO image or create a bootable DVD or USB thumb drive,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />If you want to download a particular edition or both architectures, uncheck the Use the recommended option for this PC. 
<br />Image
<br />
<br />Click in the Edition list box, choose your edition then click Next.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - contains Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro.
<br />Windows 10 Home Single Language - only select this edition if you are running Windows 10 Single Language, Windows 8 Single Language or Windows 8.1 with Bing.
<br />Windows 10 N - only select this edition if you reside in Europe, it does not contain Windows Media Player. It contains Windows 10 Home N, Windows 10 Pro N.
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Exception: you can double click the ISO (or right click it, choose Open with &gt; Fiel Explorer), mount it and start the upgrade in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />MAKING A BOOTABLE COPY USING RUFUS:
<br />
<br />You can download Rufus, for free.
<br /><a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://rufus.akeo.ie/</a>
<br />
<br />After downloading Rufus, connect your thumb drive, launch Rufus application, click in the Device list box then choose your thumb drive.
<br />
<br />Click in the list box then choose your partition scheme. If you select the ISO, Rufus will automatically select the appropriate options for you. Next, click in the File system list box, then choose FAT32. If your thumb drive is larger than 32 GBs, choose exFAT.
<br />
<br />Leave the default Cluster size then enter a label for your thumb drive.
<br />
<br />Click the choose disk image icon, browse to where the ISO file is located, select it then click Open.
<br />
<br />Click Start to copy the files to the thumb drive.
<br />
<br />If you have any files on the thumb drive, they will be deleted.
<br />
<br />Wait while the files are copied to your thumb drive.
<br />
<br />Close when complete
<br />
<br />Step 2: Perform a clean install
<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.
<br />a
<br />BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

                    <p>Before the Windows 10 upgrades, I was running a virtual machine, Virtual PC2007, running under windows 7. &nbsp;Have a licence of Windows XP, that I was running in the VM. &nbsp;All was fine and great. &nbsp;Then Windows 10 was upgraded into my machine, now I'm getting
 an error message "Virtual PC 2007 SP1 doesn't work on this version of Windows. &nbsp;Learn more." &nbsp;Is there a version of Virtual Machine that I can run Windows XP under Windows 10?</p>

            <p>Client Hyper-V doesn't seem to be part of Windows 10 Home edition. &nbsp;I had Windows 7 Home, and was able to use the Microsoft's VM. &nbsp;Is there an alternative option?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Remote Desktop Connection in windows Vista &#40;Home Premium&#41; does not work properly</h2>
                    I have installed and re-installed my Vista (Home premium) 2 times already because of Remote Desktop connection.&nbsp; I have a problem connecting from another laptop running windows 7 to connect to my desktop running Vista.&nbsp; The remote operation works the other
 way around meaning from desktop running vista the laptop running windows 7 professional.<br />
Looking at the Vista under \System\Remote setting\Remote Tab that the remote assistance box is showing but the Remote Desktop box where you can choose which type connection can be made is missing.<br />
<br />
I have gone though all the forum answers but nothing help.&nbsp; Even in a command prompt running "sfc scannow" did not help.&nbsp; It says that it found corrupted files but it cannot fix all the corrupted files.&nbsp; That is why I reinstalled windows in hope of fixing this
 issue but NO SUCCESS.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help?&nbsp; I have attached the screen shot of what I see in vista.<br />
<br />

            You can connect FROM a home version of Windows to another computer, but you can't connect TO a home version of Windows.<br />

It's not an "idea", it's cold hard <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Remote-Desktop-Connection-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
