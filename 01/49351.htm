<h2>            Too many Win 10 problems&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have ran all the troubleshoots.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled Win 10 and everything else for that matter.</p>
<p>I have ran the stupid <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> multiple and multiple times.
</p>
<p>I have&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">reset the&nbsp;Windows Update Components.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have factory reset multiple times</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have even had a customer service person remotely uninstall and reinstall, stop and start, and repair.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I can tell you that I have performed most every thing that has been suggested and have performed them multiple times.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Still nothing has ever worked!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have an Acer Aspire R7- 371T, it is only a year old.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Operating system is Microsoft Windows 10 Home 64 - bit</span></p>
<p>I never have any updates, troubleshooting always says service registration are&nbsp;missing or corrupt, the scan has never showed any errors, default windows update data locations have changes, windows update components must be repaired, security settings are
 missing or have been changed, check missing or corrupt files, Microsoft account required (I do have one), user account control has been disabled,&nbsp; windows update configured to never install drivers, hardware changes might not have been detected.
</p>
<p>Also I need to point out that&nbsp;windows update service is always stopping, bits is always stopped along with the installer and background and cryptographic. When ever by chance an update appears it Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB2267602 (Definition
 1.223.2791.0). It is never installed and just keeps trying with out success. I have ran the script reset for windows update.
</p>
<p>As I&nbsp;said I follow the instructions and suggestions. </p>
<p>Nothing works! If&nbsp;it does fix an issue it will never last and within the day the problems return.
</p>
<p>So is there anyone at&nbsp;here that can fix Windows 10?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>Was Windows 10 pre installed? What version is it 10240 or 10586?&nbsp;<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Acer Aspire R7- 371T has a lot of drivers for Windows 10. It is supported for Windows 10 by
 Acer. It is&nbsp;probably&nbsp;v10240. What is the BIOS version?</span></span></span></p>
<p>I take it from your post, Updating is the issue that caused you to re-install,&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">factory
 reset,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">reset the&nbsp;Windows Update Components so many times.</span></p>
<p>Answer these question and may be some one here can tell you how to install Windows 10 properly.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for response. Windows 10 was not pre installed. I purchased it with windows 8.1 pre installed.&nbsp;How do I find the version? I maybe misunderstanding your question. You say Acer Aspire R7 - 371T has a lot of drivers for win10? When I check for updates
 I get nothing. I think you are asking BIOS version, and it says V1.12. </p>
<p>It really gets to be a&nbsp;pain in the butt having to reinstall then reinstall the&nbsp;apps or downloads.&nbsp;I have&nbsp;reinstalled win10 a few times as well as customer service remotely doing it. It would just be really nice to get an update and when you get&nbsp;an update
 not to have it cause multiple problems. </p>
<p>I am a fulltime student&nbsp;so I use my laptop constantly and do my best to take care of it.&nbsp;It is discouraging to have paid so much money&nbsp;just to keep having issues. Just one update with no side affects &nbsp;would be nice.
</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>This is the acer website for the US</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/drivers</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me drivers are not coming over Windows Update any more. They can be updated threw device manager with auto search and being online. You Bios is the latest version according to the Acer website. I like to use the manufacture drivers from the Acer
 webiste.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 version can be checked in "system information". It is in the start menu, all apps, in the Windows Administrative tool folder. If you have v10586 then the build can be seen in settings &gt; system &gt; about. The current is 10586.420.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You thread/question is to many problems with Windows 10. But then you go on about the efforts to solve the problems. Leaving the community to guess the problem is trying to update with Windows update. In your first post you state "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I
 never have any updates". This last post you state "</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Just one update with no side affects &nbsp;would be nice.".</span></p>
<p>So I have to ask what is the issue you need help fixing. You are an Insider so what version and build of W10, do you have installed?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>I am sorry if there was any confusion with my post. I checked the version and it is the current version. Thank you for the directions to check.</p>
<p>My problem with Windows 10 is that if you reset the update service, bit service, installer, etc., you may get updates. Unfortunately, sometimes that is not the problem and so when using troubleshoot, there are other issues needing fixed.&nbsp;When the customer
 service person remotely&nbsp;reinstalling Windows 10, everything was perfect for a while.
</p>
<p>Microsoft Edge freezes, apps wont open, Onedrive is not syncing. </p>
<p>I read the other posts on here and other people, not just myself, seem to have the same issues. I am sorry for my unorganized post and ability to clearly express my concerns. I am not at all an&nbsp;expert in this department, nor am I very good at explaining
 it seems. </p>
<p>When I am able to get an update is what I should have said. I would like to get the update issue fixed and not have to reset services all the time. I would like to fix the missing or corrupt service registration, to repair windows update components, for
 &nbsp;windows update configured to&nbsp;install drivers. </p>
<p>I appreciate your time and hope I better expressed myself. </p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>If you are at 10586.420 then Windows update is working. The freezing and not syncing is something else. MS-Edge is a work in progress. It is tied to Cortana &amp; search. Which can be change is the MS-Edge settings. I do not use MS-Edge that much do to its erratic
 behavior. Shutting off Cortana may help a bit. OneDrive sync would have to be troubleshot. I have not see drivers come threw Windows update in a while. Device Manager (right click start and select Device Manger) has updated some drivers on request, but if
 up to date no drivers will be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest to pick one issue you would like to solve and post a question in the closes category (Windows 10) and then topic (Network &amp; Internet) &nbsp;you can find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update: Security updates and commutative updates only come once a month. If you have an issue with an update then that update will need to be addressed. The last commutative update was KB3163018 for June. Make a question in that forum and someone
 will be able to address the issue.</p>

            <p>Ok, the only reason Windows 10&nbsp;was up to date, at the time of the prior post, was&nbsp;because I went to Microsoft support and the person remotely reinstalled windows 10 for me. However, after that the windows update service, installer, and bit service have continuously
 stopped. I would like to know how to solve that problem, please.&nbsp;If those are not&nbsp;reset then&nbsp;I do not get updates from Microsoft store, windows, or Acer.</p>
<p>I hope that I have formed a better question for you. </p>

    <title>Random disconnects from xbox live - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shadowshukaku  say:</h3>
<h2>            Random disconnects from xbox live</h2>
                    
<p>Second post as the first one deleted itself.</p>
<p>My Xbox is disconnecting from Xbox Live randomly and reconnecting within seconds.
</p>
<p>It shows everyone disconnecting from the party and rejoining, whereas in fact I am the one who is disconnecting, because of this problem, and I return at the bottom of the party list.</p>
<p>It also happens during games, for example in Call of Duty Black Ops it says network disconnected; on other games such as Halo Reach it shows me the starting game screen and then reconnects me after a few seconds. During the whole of this time I am the only
 one seeing the screen, others in the party can continue playing.</p>
<p>I am using Halo Reach XBox Slim. THe first few months there were no problems, now this happens continually.</p>
<p>I have had earlier models of the XBox - 60gb and Elite - without these problems. The network into the house is the same.
</p>
<p>I am using Devolo, to allow the in-house power lines to carry the network in place of ethernet or wireless. This is effective with other devices and is also the way I connected previous XBoxes - and was used successfully with this XBox until the current
 issue started..</p>

<p>Hey mate, just to be sure, have you tried power-cycling (fancy term for unplugging and then plugging back in) your router and modem? Also, could you please run a connection speed test from your PC, and then post the upload, download, and ping here?</p>

<p>That could be... I'm also concerned about your upload speed. Generally speaking, I recommend an upload of around 1 MB for gaming on LIVE. You may want to call your ISP to discuss a better speed for online gaming.

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Mail and Calendar apps doesn't have .exe file. They’re .appx files. However, .appx files are essentially executable programs, so they have a lot in common with .exe files. However, .appx is an entirely new application platform for Windows.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You can refer to the following Microsoft article and check if it helps.</span></span></p>

            <p>I know there is a thread on uservoice to have multiple home xbox's on one LAN but maybe a family subscription would be a good idea, so individual family members could log on to any xbox away from home. You could try creating the idea on uservoice, I am sure you'd get plenty of votes.</p>

 help me? I'm running on windows 10 and using an ASUS laptop, I know how to add Microsoft products but mine isn't one. For this reason I have no idea on how I re-add my device. If someone can help it'd be highly appreciated!

<p>2. When I try the Surface option it wants my country/region and serial number. When I put both in it says it's incorrect, is this option only for surface or is my serial number wrong?</p>

            <p>As far as I can tell, from my own PCs/Laptops and Microsoft Account:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Only Microsoft Devices can be added to the account; and</p>
<p>b) non-Microsoft Devices would seem to be automatically added&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">only</span>&nbsp;when a version of Windows 10 is activated</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> &nbsp;My Account shows a PC running Windows 10, plus an activated copy of Windows 10 Insider Preview in a Virtual Machine as two separate Devices, but a second PC running Windows 10, plus Windows 7 in a Virtual Machine only appears as
 single Device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For non-Microsoft Devices, it appears that it is the combination of an Activated Windows 10 License + the Device Identity that's recorded rather than the Device itself. &nbsp;Which also implies that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- if your Device isn't running an activated version of Windows 10, then it can't/won't appear in the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- if your Device is running Windows 10 but doesn't appear, that Windows 10 may not be Activated.</p>

 MS), stating that my device is NOT CONFIRMED on my MS ACCOUNT.&nbsp; I go through the MS process, send a code to my email, input the code, but the LAPTOP IS NOT BEING ADDED, NOR APPROVED on my MS Account.&nbsp;&nbsp; With this error, I am not able to update Windows 8.0 completely,
 which worries me, since MS needs to push the Windows 10 update to my Laptop.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Game disappeared from Account</h2>
                    <p>I have owned 2k17 as a digital download for months and was playing it last night. Went to bed and woke up this morning and tried to start it and it gave me the error that said insert the disk or buy it from the store. I thought it was weird so I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it said that I could play it for now or buy a copy but still let me install it. I installed it again and when it said it was ready to play I tried to load it and it gave me the same error. I tried uninstalling again and it now doesn't even give me the option to install it and basically says I have to buy it. I have tried resetting the console through the settings but that did not fix the problem. Can anyone help?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            HP DVD RW AD-7701H is not working, gives error code 39</h2>
                    I was in the last step of downloading Norton 360 5.0 (via CD) onto my HP Pavilion dv6 3030TX when the the process&nbsp;suddenly stopped. I try to restart the download but the DVD/RW would not read the CD. I&nbsp;took out the &nbsp;CD and rebooted my computer but it still
 would not read this or any other disc. I found an 'error 39' message in the Device Manager stating the driver in corrupted or missing. What do I do?

            <p>Same issue here, the pop-up menu doesn't work. &nbsp;I can't even play my music, open up photos due to this OpenWith [Pick an app] menu not showing. The file type( .mp3, .m4a, .jpg etc) also has a default program set but for some stupid reason, it still behaves
 like the file type have no program to open file with. Only way I can open the file types are opening the program and dragging the file type to the program to open. I've restarted, sfc /scannow, check for virus and, reset to Microsoft defaults in Default Apps
 (which worked for some) &nbsp;and none work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Ok, I went to Safe Mode and fixed it and reseting to Microsoft defaults in Default Apps. Hmm, didn't work when I clicked it twice in regular mode for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT #2: Yea, this needs to be patched, I have flv videos that won't open even after thinking I fixed the issue, I can't change the program to open with flv. The flv file type opens with my Torch browser instead of my VLC. Oh geez.</p>

            <p>I had success via the safe mode method, resetting and then re applying my choices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest though this whole file association thing is just a pain in the backside. &nbsp;It's just clunky and tedious and windows 10 effectively will not let you escape from the 'metro apps' like mail and well....calendar, it can't even find it's own app for
 that when I go to reset the defaults. &nbsp;It's all just pretty sketchy to be honest but it is still early days. &nbsp;It's so irritating that it will get fixed eventually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also to note I just got stuck in a lovely (and slightly nerve wracking safe mode boot cycle of lameness. &nbsp;If I were not an experienced PC user then it would have been game over and back to the shop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed GUI on boot via msconfig for a faster boot. &nbsp;Then when entering safe mode for the above reason I chose I think option 3, the diagnostic one as it sounded ok (I didnt need network/internet) it turns out it's for troubleshooting hardware issues blah
 blah. &nbsp;But that's beside the point. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I restart into 'safe mode' all seems normal, static (no gui) blue win logo appears, then up pops my password page (forgot it's actual name). &nbsp;Network is crossed out so I know it's in safe mode but ermmmm where is my login prompt...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I wait.........and wait........nothing!! &nbsp;No prompt for PIN (which I had setup for standard boot) nor any prompt for password. &nbsp;Infact there was just nothing bar the ease of access stuff and power off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the method of holding down left shift while selecting to restart to take me to the recovery menu (a slight sigh of relief as my .iso copy of W10 is still on my HDD!) Tried startup repair....didn't like it. &nbsp;No joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok.....so boot with command prompt. &nbsp;Reset login (to remove 'safe mode') with command bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy standard</p>
<p>
</p><p>It liked it....command exit. &nbsp;Continue to windows......presumed at this stage I was done......oh wait NO.....It didn't actually do what it said it did...er sh**</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway if this happens to anyone else out there method to resolve it was to left shift + restart then select troubleshooting, advanced, configure startup options (or something along those lines) you are then presented with 9 or 10 options. &nbsp;I chose basic
 safe mode (option 3).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked....thank god. &nbsp;Have stuff I need to prepare for meeting at 9am!!</p>

            <p>This is a followup to the issue. My issue 'kinda' went away by upgrading to an Insider preview. I say 'kinda' because you have to use the menu option twice to make it to appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This solution is not for everyone but it's an option to consider.</p>

            Should have waited to try both your solution guys. I made a new user account that day and somehow I was locked out after using the password I set for it (tried 100 times still locked out, changed caps lock everything, restarted, seems Windows intentionally
 locked me out). So I did a clean install, came back and the password worked. Very effing furious. Upgrading to Insider Preview came in mind but I didn't think that would help much and was hesitant. Anyway thanks, bookmarking this post in case it happens again.

<p>I've tried all of these, to no avail...</p>
<p>I have been trying to fix this for several weeks now, but this is the closest I have gotten to even finding someone with the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've disabled any non-Microsoft context menus, tried using another user account, tried resetting to default apps, tried resetting to default apps in safe mode, and a number of other things. &nbsp;None have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best I have been able to do is, if I go to safe mode, the OpenWith dialog will show up for me, but as soon as I reboot it stops working again.</p>
<p>Any ideas on further steps I can try?</p>

            <p>My problem seems to be related. If I try to open an http link, e.g. in an email, I get the popup menu and it works if I choose Edge or Firefox, but not if I choose Chrome. If I choose Chrome I get this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a3dbb2c-3f83-4c5a-a20d-6d6b2e7b4dc9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a3dbb2c-3f83-4c5a-a20d-6d6b2e7b4dc9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I set Edge or Firefox as my default browser, there's no problem; the link opens the browser immediately. But if I set Chrome as my default browser, I get the popup menu, choose Chrome and get the above message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this began only yesterday after I uninstalled a Firetrust product called 'Hideaway'. I assume Hideaway stuffed the registry somehow. I've restored windows to a restore point I set before uninstalling Hideaway, but that doesn't fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b7d5d75-8b92-4a51-a81a-93da0b4c809a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b7d5d75-8b92-4a51-a81a-93da0b4c809a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, the 'OpenWith' popup doesn't allow me to choose other programs on my PC, only apps in the Windows Store. This is a new development. It's been mentioned above also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later: Reinstalling Chrome has fixed this problem and I've managed to reinstall Hideaway, which is also working.</p>

<h2>            Downloading content from Xbox market place</h2>
                    
<p>hello,</p>
<p>I understand that if the physical location and account location are different&nbsp;I would not be able to complete the online transaction for purchase; is this true.</p>
<p>Secondly, I want to know if&nbsp;I can download games from the marketplace if I arrange for the payment to my gamertag through somebody else in the account region.</p>
<p>Thanks and regards,</p>

<p>You may not have a problem with all content not downloading, but you will have region errors if your account and location do not match.</p>

<p>if it is region locked content like blackops or halo games</p>
<p>then regardless if you have someone use your account</p>
<p>you are still outside the region and still cannot download region locked content</p>
<p>they tend to fail at 99% when the content checks your region</p>
<p>&nbsp;if you mean i can get my friend to enter billing info for subscriptions and ms points sure if you trust them that much</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but if you are trying to work around the region lock content</p>
<p>&nbsp;no that won't work</p>
<p>&nbsp;however most DLC is not region locked its depends which game you are trying to download</p>

<p>try purchasing it the dlc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(if you get the not available in your region then&nbsp; its region locked)</p>
<p>typically non violent games don't have an issue that raises CONTENT issues like nazi symbols and torture and extreme violence</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so i doubt it region locked</p>

<p>&nbsp;you could always call ubisoft</p>

<p>I'm far from certain that TechNet would provide any better assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen many, many reports of "Problem signature ... APPCRASH ... Exception Code:<span>
</span>c0000005" with various different programs.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there doesn't appear to be a definitive solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps Nuance will offer some help, but they're more likely to say, "Lotsa luck.&nbsp; It's a Windows problem."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you downloaded the installer rather than getting it from a CD or DVD, I'd re-download it after temporarily disabling your antivirus program.&nbsp; Save the downloaded file on your Desktop rather than elsewhere.&nbsp; Keep the a/v disabled while you install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before running the installer again, clean out all of your TEMP folders.&nbsp; Disk Cleanup usually misses some, so either use
<a href="https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">CCleaner</a> (I suggest that you NOT use the Registry Cleaner feature) or do it manually.&nbsp; On my Windows 7, I have at least the following locations that ought to be cleaned out:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Temp</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Windows\Temp</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Temp&nbsp; [Note that AppData is hidden, but if you type that whole path name into the Search box and press Enter, the Temp folder will open]</p>
<p>
</p><p>To run the installer, right-click on it and select "Run as administrator" and respond as needed to any UAC prompt.&nbsp; The reason for this is that the c0000005 exception code is an access violation, so perhaps running it with elevated permissions will help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry that I don't have any more constructive suggestions for you.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your very useful response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been in touch with the Nuance people who have been very helpful so far. I have sent them loads of information and they have sent downloads for me to install. I have uninstalled and reinstalled dragon using their programs many, many times. I think
 I'm now getting to the point of having a go at installing it again but before I do that I want to try to make sure that my system is fully clean of it &nbsp;because that might be the problem - what do I know?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am no expert on registry matters but the uninstallers they sent me are supposed to clean out all instances. I did a search on the word "dragon" and still found lots of instances of a previous dragon installation I did - which never worked by the way. Now
 whether these entries are relevant or not I don't know. The uninstaller didn't delete them so maybe they're not relevant?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reported this back to them and they say I need a registry cleaner, reinstall windows - no thanks, or set up as a new user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really like to make sure that my computer is free from whatever dragon doesn't like before I install/uninstall it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help please?</p>

                    <p>Hi, so we all know that on the xbox one controller it turns off after 15 minutes of inactivity, this is a problem if using a wheel on forza 7 and controller for party chat as it will go off and plugging in a plug and play lead can be not only a pain but it can have a buzz noise for other party members. Now on the xbox you can change game record time change party volumes an all that so here is my idea, put a setting in the xbox so you can set inactivity times for your controller, turn off after 15 minutes, 30 minutes,1 hour, 2hours, never.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Just an idea from someone who encounters this problem on a daily basis.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused. I will assist you with this.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Yes, this limit occurs when you try to add them by selecting them, Windows Media Player will only recognize 50 Albums and not more. But when you try to add them folder by folder by opening them in Windows Media Player, it will add normally and the
 limitation is gone.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
I would suggest you to open <strong>Windows Media Player </strong>then Click on <strong>
'Organize'</strong>, click on <strong>'Manage Libraries' </strong>and choose <strong>
'Music' </strong>and add the folders. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above information helps.</p>

    <title>Parental Controls allows Microsoft.com sites - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larocque  say:</h3>
<h2>            Parental Controls allows Microsoft.com sites</h2>
                    Why does Parental Controls allow microsoft.com sites such as downloadable templates, and even worse the Windows 8 store? When I set my allowed list of sites, that all I expect my kids to get to. Does Parental Controls apply only to http traffic or something?
 What are the real limits to how it works? For now, I have to either add a block on my router, or set the Windows policy to disable the store, but both of these are a pain because they affect all users on the computer, not just the kids' account.<br />
<br />
This behaviour is the same in both Windows 7 and 8<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the link which says about Allow or block specific websites. You have to move the slider to Allow list only under turn on web filtering.</p>
<p><br />
Once you move the slider up then you can select the websites that can be allow to the child user to access the sites rest all the sites will be blocked.</p>
<p>In windows store you allow or block specific games and can also set other apps restrictions.</p>
<p>Check out the link:<br />

            "When I set my allowed list of sites" means I already am building a specific list of allowable locations. *.Microsoft.com isn't among them, and yet it still works. And, yes, I'm in the "allow list" only mode in the slider selector.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting your query. I understand that you are having issues with the allowed sites in your Family Safety and we will try to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to ask where are you trying to access the Windows store in Windows 7 and in Windows 8. In case you are accessing the store in Windows 8 through the Store app, I apologize but we can only include in the allow lists urls that is being accessed
 by a browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll wait for your response.</p>
<p><br />
Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>*.Microsoft.com is <strong>not</strong> in the allowed list, yet is accessible. That's not what I expect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try it! Setup an account that can get only to one site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, you'll find that Windows still allows access to the store (Windows 8) and to such items as "Get more themes online" in the Personalization window. Why? Aren't they supposed to be blocked because they're not on the allowed list?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's what I've found on the 3 computers and 2 Parent Controls profiles I've tried this on. It could be I'm missing something, but the system effectively blocks everything else, just not these particular Microsoft sites, which is why it leads me to think
 that there are exceptions to the filter.</p>

                    Hello. I have always used Leelawadee. font.&nbsp;I&nbsp;had to install it as a supplementary font (Thai) to be able to keep the integrity of all my old documents (so layout etc didn't change). I did this and all my Word docs worked fine. However this morning I woke
 up and the Thai supplementary fonts seem to have been uninstalled. I followed the same process to reinstall the Thai supplementary fonts (which are again listed as option features, and it doesn't seem to be working. I am&nbsp;using a metered internet&nbsp;connection.
 I have deadlines etc and I need&nbsp;Leelawadee font to&nbsp;work.&nbsp;My&nbsp;question is (1) why can't I reinstall it, and (2) why was it suddenly uninstalled? Thanks, Chris &nbsp;

            <p>Ok so I tried your suggestions. &nbsp;I first tried the troubleshooter. &nbsp;It found three problems:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;All settings sync incomplete (it couldn't fix this)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Can't connect to the sync service (it detected this)</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Rootcauses found and created logs (it detected this)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried logging out and logging back in to the Microsoft account and will see if the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Edit*</p>
<p>Sorry, but the problem persists. &nbsp;I didn't have this problem before I used a Microsoft account to log in.</p>

            <p>That was one of the first things I tried. &nbsp; It said it found and fixed several problems, but the Generic Roaming Error persisted. &nbsp;I tried running it again and it still said it found and fixed several problems, but again the error didn't go away. &nbsp;I even
 tried running it several times in a row, and each time it said it found and fixed several problems, but the error didn't stop popping up.</p>

<p>First, try restarting your graphics driver:</p>
<p>Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B</p>
<p>If that does not work...</p>
<p>Press Windows key + X </p>
<p>Click Device Manager </p>
<p>Expand Display adapters </p>
<p>Right click the current display adapter </p>
<p>Click Properties</p>
<p>Click Driver tab</p>
<p>Click Rollback driver if the option is available </p>
<p>
</p><p>If not</p>
<p>Right click the current display adapter </p>
<p>Click Uninstall </p>
<p>Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” </p>
<p>Exit Device Manager </p>
<p>Restart </p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.</p>
<p>You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.</p>
<p>If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. </p>
<p>Press Windows key + X </p>
<p>Click Device Manager </p>
<p>Expand Display adapters </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:</p>

</p>
<p>Some of these sites offer autodetect options. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore or brightness functions missing.
 Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There might be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1809, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates.
</p>
<p>Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>Press Control + Alt + Delete</p>
<p>Click Sign out</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen</p>
<p>Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart</p>
<p>
</p><p>Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears</p>
<p>Click Troubleshoot</p>
<p>Click Advanced options</p>
<p>
