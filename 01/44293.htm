<h2>            Can&#39;t switch languages on onscreen keyboard</h2>
                    <p>I have installed the Hebrew language pack, but ever since the latest Windows 10 update, I can't switch from English Canada to Hebrew or even to English US for the online keyboard. How can I retrieve this ability, please?</p>

<p>Hi Maxine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When you've mentioned online keyboard, did you mean the On-Screen Keyboard? Just to be sure that you have the correct instructions,
<span>to switch the input language you're using in Windows 10, select the language abbreviation at the far right of your taskbar and then select the language or input method you want to use. You can also press and hold the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Windows
 logo key</strong><span>and then repeatedly press the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Spacebar</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>to cycle through all your languages.</span></p>

As a mentioned, it keeps reverting to English Canada. And yes, I did mean on-screen keyboard. Thanks

    <title>Checking actual Internet speed on your Windows 10 laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Checking actual Internet speed on your Windows 10 laptop</h2>
                    In Windows 7 I discovered that I could hit ctrl-alt-del and in Task Manager, pull up Performance Monitor.&nbsp; There was a very useful tool that showed my Internet connections (I use multiple ones) and what speed exactly they are connected at.&nbsp; I was surprised
 to find out that the LAN card and antennas installed in my laptop were not giving me very good speed, but the external USB card which I installed and use simultaneously, was giving me much better speed.&nbsp; So in Windows 10, how can I find my true connection
 speed?&nbsp; I have not found it yet after searching.&nbsp; The little bar graph is not good enough.

            Well do keep in mind that this is your link-speed to your access point.&nbsp; Which will usually be hugely faster than your actual internet connection past that point.&nbsp; But, there is a Network Speed Test inside the app store (I think it's published from Microsoft),
 how about that?

            Nope, the feature that I mentioned in Windows 7 is much better.&nbsp; The apps all look pretty stupid, in my opinion.&nbsp; Doesn't it remind you too much of toys or games?<br />

            That depends what you get in the store.&nbsp; You can get toys or games at Walmart, or you can get adult products.&nbsp; There's tons of professional and really great software in the store.&nbsp; And just because it's in the store doesn't mean it was even built with
 mobile frameworks -- now the app store has tons of decades-old software that you were using in Windows 7 (or before), plus the full Office suite (not the tablet app version of Office), full iTunes is coming shortly. I use PowerBI extensively, plus all the
 software for analytics and net suites. The benefit and difference is really just multitudes better - it's why Linux and Mac have had stores (Linux uses the term "repositories" or "repos") for many many years. It's better than having every program handle it's
 own updating by cramming your startup or task scheduler full of update checkers and managers, the package manager handles it. And no more files getting scattered through your OS and registry: all packages from the store are ent

                    When I turned off my laptop (Dell inspiron 1525 running Windows Vista 32-bit), and unplugged the reciever for my arc mouse the mouse no longer operates when I plug in and turn the computer on again.&nbsp; In the control panel, it says the mouse is working properly,
 but the pointer doesn't move.&nbsp; I have fresh batteries as well.

            Thanks for the reply, Ajay.&nbsp; I tried to uninstall and it didn't work.&nbsp; It reinstalled just fine, but the mouse isn't working.&nbsp; This is really frustrating as it happened before with my old mouse and I thought it was broken--installed this new one and it
 worked fine until now.

<p>Tried everything mentioned here as well...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>took the batteries out to change them, when i put new ones in the mouse refuses to respond to anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried removing the drivers, reinstalling them... removing the entire Intellipoint software package, reinstalling it... tried the dongle in all 12 different USB ports on my desktop... got absolutely no response from the mouse whatsoever...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only had the mouse literally less than a fortnight now, and upuntil now it performed adequately... but to break down for no apparent reason, and if you do a basic google search you will find there are hundreds of people out there with this mouse who are
 having exactly the same problem...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as i'm concerned Microsoft has just sold a useless paperweight here...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mouse is currently on my desk as a useless decoration while i use my keyboard to browse to see if anyone has actually come up with a problem yet... this is the 9th website i've checked for an answer, and absolutely no luck anywhere... every thread from
 Microsoft websites says the same thing "check the drivers, reinstall the software, check different usb ports..." and then a slew of answers saying "Sorry, didn't work..." and then absolutely nothing else from anyone working on this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm giving it 15 more minutes searching for an answer before the mouse goes in the bin, then i head over to the online store i bought it from and leave a review warning everyone else to stay away from this ripoff piece of hardware.</p>

</p><p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><div>I understand you are receiving this error 0x80070002. Since you have already tried the troubleshooter and windows store reset. Please try the steps below and see if it helps:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 1:&nbsp;I would suggest you try Clean Boot and see if it helps:</div>
<div>
<p>Click on the link below and refer the KB article to perform a clean boot: (Steps given for Windows&nbsp;8.1 are applicable for windows 10 as well, please follow them)<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a><br />
Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting".</p>
<p>
</p><div>Method 2:</div>
<div><br />
If you have any security software installed on your computer I would suggest you to disable security software and perform a clean boot and check if it helps.</div>
<div>Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as
 soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 3:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to refer to the articles mentioned below and check if it helps.
<div>What to do if you have problems with an app</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 4:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disable proxy connection</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you use any proxy connection, then follow the steps to disable proxy:</div>
<div>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Gearbox at the top right corner in Internet Explorer.</div>
<div>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Tools button, and then click Internet Options.</div>
<div>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Connections tab, and then click LAN settings.</div>
<div>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncheck the Use a proxy server for your LAN box.</div>
<div>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Ok.</div>

            I was having this same problem and was going to switch to a local account, but I noticed when I went to accounts, Your Account that there was a message that said that this user needed to be verified on my machine.&nbsp; I went through the process of getting
 the verification e-mail and entering the code that was sent to me and now apps are installing from the store fine.

            <p>Non of these solutions have really helped for me, and as no one else has replied saying they've managed to fix this issue I guess it's still an ongoing issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been a month now and I basically can't use the store at all, there's literally no point having it because i can't download anything with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not happy at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other solutions that might fix it? I was hoping that within this month there might have been an update to the store or something that might have fixed the issue but so far no luck.</p>

<div><span>I've already tried to do some of the actions mentioned in a similar topic before but it still doesn't work...windows detectes it and say something like "driver has to be installed again" &nbsp;but even doing so nothing happens...moreover
 I don't know why I can't run Mr fix, it just says "Error"&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Please be kind enough to tell me step by step how can I work it out.</span></div>

<p>A couple of things....&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toshiba machines have a problem with some software that needs uninstalled...</p>
<p>Toshiba Disc Creator and\or Toshiba Recovery Media Creator.</p>
<p>There is a problem with one of the features in iTunes that causes the same problem...</p>
<p>the solution is to install the newest "GEAR" drivers... <a href="http://www.gearsoftware.com/support/drivers.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There can be other issues in the registry for the drive... Some programs add something to the "Filters" that can sometimes cause a problem.... Take a look at this link for more details...</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 disk partitioning - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cdave3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 disk partitioning</h2>
                    This weekend I upgraded my two PCs from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1. Both upgrades seemed to complete successfully, but I became concerned when the backup of my C: drive seemed much smaller than it should have been (the program performs a complete backup
 on Sundays). When I looked at the partitions on my hard drive, it seems the upgrade on one of the computers created partitions that weren't there before. The second computer seems to look just like it did before the upgrade. I'm tempted to delete some of the
 partitions on the first computer, but wanted to first ask if I could cause problems in doing so.<br />
<br />
Computer #1 is a generic PC purchased at a local computer outlet. It has three partitions: 100 MB (system reserved), the C: partition for the O/S and programs, and a third partition for data.<br />
<br />
Computer #2 is a brand-name PC that came with a restore partition I never deleted. Otherwise, I thought I had partitioned it the same as the first machine. This drive, however, now has eight partitions. MiniTool Partition Wizard gives the following info for
 each:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;1 - WINRE_DRV - NTFS, type GPT Recovery Partition, Status = None<br />
&nbsp;2 - System_DRV - FAT32, type GPT (EFI System Partition) - Status = Active and Boot<br />
&nbsp;3 - LRS_ESP - FAT32, Type GPT, Status = None<br />
&nbsp;4 - *: - Other, Type GPT (Reserved Partition), Status = None<br />
&nbsp;5 - C:Windows9_OS - NTFS, Type GPT(Data Partition), Status = System<br />
&nbsp;6 - *: - NTFS, Type GPT(Recovery Partition), Status = None<br />
&nbsp;7 - F:Data - NTFS, Type GPT(Data Partition), Status = None<br />
&nbsp;8 - *:PBR_DRV - NTFS, Type GPT(Recovery Partition), Status = None<br />
<br />
My question: which, if any, of these partitions can I safely delete? My C: drive has shrunk to 80 GB; it used to be larger than that.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>What was your C:/ drive's storage after this happened? Also ESP is a boot partition/drive and is normally 300 MB in size which means your boot partition may be bigger than mine. Also you may have a lot of drivers on your machine and it may go to 350+ MB.
 Windows 8.1 may have extended your boot partition if you did upgrade via Windows Store. If so, delete Windows.old if there is a folder there. This is your Windows 8.0 files from when you upgraded. This is maybe the cause. Also do this quick back-up:</p>
<p>First, open File Explorer by <em>[Win] + [E]. </em></p>
<p>Go to your C:/ drive.</p>
<p>If you have a external drive, backup there. If not, <em>don't delete Windows.old! This is a crucial file! You may need this to recover from a BSoD or a virus!</em></p>
<p>Now delete Windows.old on your hard disk and keep the external drive handy.</p>

<h2>            Restoring archived emails from Live Mail</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I was using Live Mail on a Windows 7 computer to receive emails and then archiving them within Live Mail. I have just got a new computer running Windows * and Mail. How can I restore the emails I had archived on my old computer. I was doing general back
 ups of files but when I restored my files onto my computer I couldn't find any archived emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks</p>

            Hi&nbsp;Gordon,
<div><br />
<div>I understand that you want to export your emails on your new computer. I will be glad to help you out.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If your emails are still stored in the web version of your account, you can just configure your account to Windows Live Mail and it will automatically download all the emails that is in your account. If not, then you can just export your email and import
 it to your new machine, for more information on how to do so please go to the article that I have given below:</div>

            Hi Sergs
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for responding. Unfortunately my situation is a bit more complicated. The motherboard on my old computer died, which is why I had to get a new computer. I took out the hard disk from the old computer and am getting a connector to add it to my new
 computer as extra storage. I also have an external hard drive that I backed up my files onto, but I cannot find any email documents on it. This is probably because I did not have the chance to export my old emails before my old computer died.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Would you know where these emails might be stored on the old hard disk or my back up external drive, or are they unrecoverable without exporting them first?</div>
<div><br />
<div>cheers</div>
<div><br />

            Hi&nbsp;Gordon,<br />
<br />
We're sorry for what happened. Let me see what I can do to help you.<br />
<br />
As previously stated, if your e-mails are still stored in the web version of your account, you can just set-up the account to Windows Live Mail on your new computer and it will download all the messages in there. Refer to the previous post for the steps.<br />
<br />
With regard to your question, if your hard disk or the external drive is not corrupted, then you should be able to see the back up files.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have further questions.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            Hi Julius
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your reply. Unfortunately my emails are no longer available on the web version of the account. Unlike web-based emails like Gmail, my particular email server, Netspeed, does not seem to keep web versions of my emails but they are deleted after
 they are downloaded. I looked at that site and I could only find some recent emails in the trash, so I presume they are regularly purged. I think I will move to another email provider but in the meantime there are still some old emails that I downloaded that
 I want to recover.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can you tell where I might find the emails on my old hard disk?</div>
<div><br />

<p><br />
Messages are kept in the store folder. The default location is <br />
<strong>\Users\{user}\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail</strong></p>
<p>so unless you consciously moved the store folder, that's where you'll find it.<br />
<br />
To retrieve messages from this location on your old disk, it may be best to copy the folder(s) you're interested in to the new C: drive. Windows Live Mail is a bit temperamental about using files on 'foreign' disks. If you archived your messages under Storage
 folders, copy the <em>Storage folders</em> folder from the old drive to the new one (e.g. to the desktop) and then point&nbsp;Windows Live Mail's&nbsp;<em>Import messages
</em>wizard at that folder.<br />

It may be hidden, but it should be there. It won't be on your C: drive, but on the old one, whatever drive letter you've given to it.<br />

<br />
<br />
That means nothing to me, so&nbsp;it must be a W8 phenomenon. Windows Live Mail messages have names like 00D13E83-000025DF with the extension .eml. Is that what you found?<br />
<br />
I don't think you can import messages into Mail on W8. You would have to install a program like Windows Live Mail to be able to read your old messages in the program.

            Hi Noel
<div><br />
<div>I think I was mistaken about that folder. On closer inspection they seem to be local copies of Gmail emails that have appeared in Mail on my new computer from the web.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have yet to connect up my old drive so will see if I can find the old emails in the folder you mentioned. I have already downloaded Live Mail onto my new computer and tried importing emails from my folder mentioned above into Live Mail and it worked.</div>

<h2>            HP Stream Notebook 11 with Windows 10 Home.</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I originally bought this laptop. But I'm really disappointed that a message keeps coming up asking me to do a large update. No. I can't. You want to know why? Because this laptop was bought for the purposes of studying at university. It has a limit of 28.2GB.
 The update is too large. Why sell&nbsp;laptops to people and then everyday force the same message onto the screen, with no choice to reject this update permanently or offer one that does not take up any more space.</p>

            <p>The way to reduce the file size of a video is via video conversion and choosing:</p>
<p>1) Lower quality / bitrate</p>
<p>2) Lower resolution (e.g. smaller size)</p>
<p>3) Higher compression codecs</p>
<p>Movie Maker generates a .wmv file which is designed to retain as much of the original quality as possible, so it may not be the best tool for compressing your video.&nbsp; However, you can explore the options when you save your movie.&nbsp; Rather than picking from
 the default choices, scroll down to the bottom of the list of output options and choose 'Custom'.&nbsp; There you can pick various settings and it will give you an estimate of how many MBs will be needed for each second of video.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can just go for a video conversion application like Freemake Video Converter or others you might find.&nbsp; You add your video, choose the output settings and click 'Convert'.</p>
<p>Oh, and another way to reduce size is to actually remove unwanted video.&nbsp; So if there are parts you don't like, make a split before and after and delete that portion.</p>

<h2>            how to remove a hidden network from my wi-fi that connects automatically</h2>
                    <p>For my wi-fi, on my Windows 10 computer, it shows a "Hidden Network: that automatically connects to my network. I have unclicked the "automatically connect" a hundred times and it keeps going back to automatically connecting. What is this? To expand, I have
 minimal download and uploads to my network, yet my provider records huge amounts of use??&nbsp; Can someone enlighten me of how to correct this without getting viruses or mis-use?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            Hello #LisaQ&amp;
<br />Try this way 
<br />Click the Network icon on the lower right corner of your screen.
<br />Click Network settings.
<br />Click Manage Wi-Fi settings.
<br />Under Manage known networks, click the network you want to delete.
<br />Click Forget. The wireless network profile is deleted.
<br />
<br />Note: You can also type netsh wlan show profiles in the Command Prompt to manage and delete wireless network profiles.
<br />
<br />I hope it helps

            Hi #LisaQ&amp;
<br />
<br />Can you please provide a screenshot of where you are seeing this 'Hidden Network'
<br />
<br />With regards to data usage:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Windows Update
<br />
<br />Click Advanced Options - Delivery Optimization - Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Pull the bottom two sliders down to the minimum
<br />
<br />That should stop a lot of the huge data usage . . .

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I never accessed "Hidden Network". Hughesnet technician cam eby and upgraded the modem, and he gave me the wi-fi password to use. I have tried everything to delete this hidden network and it does not delete and connects automatically. Does this mean someone
 has use of my wi-fi network?</p>
<p>I can not find where to change my wi-fi network password either?</p>

            Will that limit me using data or downloading things? I dont stream videos or other and my internet speed is so slow although supposed to be 5G now. I can barely open a simple you tube video so I am worried if I slow down the data usage will that affect
 any of this? Appreciate your help

            Hi #LisaQ&amp;
<br />
<br />That will not limit your Internet in any way at all, in fact it will make your connection faster . . .
<br />
<br />Windows Update works as  file sharing, you download the updates, they install. Then hundreds of other PC's are downloading the updates from your PC - that is where the data is being used. The setting I advised you to adjust will seriously limit that file sharing on Windows Updates only . . .
<br />
<br />This will in fact make your Internet connection better and uploading and downloading faster for you . . .

<h2>            Problem with SUBST drives, on admin-priv-required COPY operation.</h2>
                    On Windows 7 I have a SUBST drive T: that is actually "C:\TXS".&nbsp; If I select a file in that directory and use the context menu to "Copy to folder", this usually works fine.&nbsp; However, if the destination folder is such that Admin privilege is needed to do
 the copy, then once I agree to the "Need admin priv" dialog, the copy fails with a message beginning "T: refers to a location that is unavailable".<br />
<br />
How can I do this operation with SUBST-ed drives?

<h2>            Can anyone advise on the legitimacy of cdkeys.com&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>As the subject suggests really... I keep seeing good deals coming up on sites like postabargain and HotUKDeals and a lot seem really good... Almost too good. As the old saying goes, sometime's it's just too good to be true. I've heard from a friend that
 they're not the best site and I can't seem to find any good source to suggest they're truly reliable - all the posts I see seem to be from users with one post and that one and only post is praising this site as the best around which is obviously suspect.</p>

<p>Noticed a good deal I'm tempted by here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cdkeys.com/xbox-live/games/mortal-kombat-x-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.cdkeys.com/xbox-live/games/mortal-kombat-x-xbox-one</a></p>

<p>I don't want to get it to find that it has the potential to get me banned from Live or face some sort of repercussion from buying through them. Anyone got any input?</p>

<p>Based in Dubai, with business "offices" in California and around the globe, &nbsp;yeah, I am sure they are a trustworthy lot... &nbsp;One of their Australian reselling sites had the worst reviews I have ever read, with countless customers complaining about money being
 taken and no goods received, with no email response after weeks of waiting... &nbsp; Wish I could find the link, but it has conveniently disappeared now that Google allows companies to remove bad reviews from their search engine results...</p>
<p>Simplycdkeys. however, are a UK based company (a subsidiary of Simplygames), and have been online since I've been online (which is well over 15 years). &nbsp;They might be a little more expensive but I have never heard of anyone getting banned after buying through
 them, which I have with cdkeys.com...</p>
<p>Just some food for thought.</p>

            Esse é um erro de região, isto é, esse código de gold é de uma região diferente da região da sua conta. Permitiu inserir o código porque a consola estava na mesma região do código que inseriu, mas se a sua conta for de outra região dá esse erro.<br />
Para poder usufruir da subscrição terá de migrar a sua conta para a região do código. Depois de migrar a conta, não poderá alterar novamente durante 3 meses.

                    Every time my pc installs updates, I lose my desktop picture and windows says the activation period has finished and is needs to be activated. When I activate it is always successful, I must have activated at least 20 times so far. How can I stop this
 from happening.

<h2>            Windows 10 mail client showing wrong email heading for email content</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 10 mail client to download web based emails to my home PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that some emails, not all, have the incorrect heading for the email content. This means that in order to see the email I have to go online and log in via my web browser. Once online all the emails are displaying the correct heading for the
 appropriate email content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea why this is happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Automatically activated after installing Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kollawut  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatically activated after installing Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I bought a laptop that comes with Windows 8.1 Home pre-installed. However, I also have a Windows 8.1 Pro license given by my school. I took the hard drive that came with my laptop out, and then formatted it so that I can use as my storage drive.
</p>
<p>Then, I installed a SSD as my primary drive and installed Windows 8.1 Pro from the disk I got from my school. However, after the widows was installed and I have not yet keyed in the activation code, it shows that the windows is already activated and does
 not show me that it is the Pro version on the control panel's System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is whether the windows is automatically activated with the OEM license coming with my laptop or the license that comes with the disk?</p>
<p>(But still...I have not typed in any activation code for either OEM and Pro??)</p>
<p>If it is OEM, how can I upgrade to the Pro version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Its possibly grabbing the existing key from the BIOS for the original license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use this method to upgrade it to your schools Windows 8.1 Pro:</p>
<p>

<p>Click System</p>
<p>Under Windows Edition, click the link:</p>
<strong>
<p>Get more features with a new edition of Windows</p>
</strong>
<p>Click the 'I already have a product key link'</p>
<p>Enter your product key and you will be upgraded to Pro.</p>
