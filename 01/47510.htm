<p>I missed that game and would enjoy a futuristic Battlefield, but that's pretty much what Section 8 Prejudice is. High tech futuristic weapons, large maps, conquest-esque gametypes, teamwork, vehicles. Its 15 bucks and well worth evey penny.</p>

<p>Section &nbsp;8 is nothing in comparison though.(Although it is good) 2142 is old, the servers are dying &nbsp;and will probably drop even further when BF3 releases. But Section 8 will never or (any other game in fact) have that same kind of feeling when you pod onto
 an enemy titan, blowing up terminals, destroying the reactor core and running for your life to parachute off the titan before being blown up with it.

<p>Never played it, but from what i've seen of the gameplay, a remake with the FB2.0 would be an absolute blast. they redid Nam for BFBC2, someone tweet Demize99 and plant the idea for BF3.</p>

<p>Ah, the old 'friends place'. That's not enough time to grasp the game. And if you judged every game off of a demo, you would have a lot less games. Demos don't really even give you any grasp of the game.</p>

<p>It would be nice if they did a remake of every game in the Battlefield series for the PC, it should be exactly like the PC version and also focus on multiplayer because imo Battlefield doesn't need a single player</p>

    <title>Xbox one disconnecting from wifi every 1-5minutes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mastoklok  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one disconnecting from wifi every 1-5minutes</h2>
                    
<p>My Xbox one is having some serious issues.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It drops my wifi connection every 1-5minutes and then reconnects and then drops. I have had this issue for about a week now. And on top of it all? it's only my Xbox One having issues.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have done everything that is recommended to fix the issue such as: resetting/powercycling gateway, powercycling xbox one, clearing cache and deleting MAC address, called my ISP(Comcast), opened the recommended ports.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Nothing has worked.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And it seems I'm not the only one with this issue. A lot of people are suffering from this and nothing is being said other than "have you hard reset?"&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I think the issue is the most recent system update being as all these problems have popped up immediately after the update.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thought I was the only one with this issue, and xbox suppor keep taking me threw the same troubleshooting steps after I tell them I already tried everything.. I can't even enjoy my system because it just randomly disconnects from Xbox Live. It's not my network
 cause nobody else's Xbox does it... I don't have the $400 on my card for them to hold and I really don't want them take a month or so to send me console back from repair. I'm also worried that they will send my console back without repairing it because it's
 not nothing you will.notice right awa. It's random and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it won't do it all for a day. The only way to use my console without problems is to have it connected by ethernet cable from my xbox to my laptop (modem is in another
 room) and I don't like having to leave my laptop on just to play my Xbox One</p>

<p>I have the same problem, whenever I am using an online connection for a game, my wireless connections just randomly drops, could be as quick as 1 minute or as long as 45 minutes. Also my controller disconnects along with my wireless connection.</p>

<h2>            What do the handles, threads and processes mean or function they are performing&#63;</h2>
                    My son ask me a question and I couldn't answer it (that may be a good thing because I'm thinking he will try to go in and change something he doesn't know about) So the more I thought that I felt I'd better try to find out. He and I are wanting to know
<u>what the handles, threads, and processes mean or &nbsp;functions they do</u>. <b>These are located in the Performance tab under the Windows Task Manager.&nbsp;</b>

<div><b>Thank you</b></div>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A process handle is an integer value that identifies a process to Windows. The Win32 API calls them a HANDLE.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you start a program, that program runs as a 'process'. This is something that runs in its own protected area, with its own memory. Other processes can't touch that memory.<br />
<br />
Some times the program needs to do several things at once in a multitasking way, similar to the way the processes multitask. For example, a spreadsheet might recalculate cells as you are entering data. It *could* start another process, but they can't (easily)
 share memory, which it would need to if recalculating cells! <br />
<br />
So we need another sort of process that isn't quite so separated. This is a 'thread'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Processes means the number of applications that run at a particular instant in computer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. </p>

<h2>            I get the error, &#34;the computer restarted unexpectedly or encountered an unexpected error. windows installation cannot proceed&#34; while getting the computer back to factory settings.</h2>
                    I tried restoring my acer aspire 5734z to factory settings. when it rebooted and the "setup is starting services" appeared and then my laptop died. when I tried to restart my computer with the charger on it a message appeared on that same spot "the computer
 restarted unexpectedly or encountered an unexpected error. windows installation cannot proceed. to install windows, click "ok" to restart the computer, and then restart the installation." pops up. so I restarted and it happened again. so during a boot up I
 pressed f8 to go to advanced boot up settings. and tried every single option. and it just will not get passed that same spot. Help please. I was trying to restore this laptop to sell it. please help.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reinstall&nbsp;Windows back to Factory Settings&nbsp;on an Acer it is Left Alt + F10 Keys at Boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://acer.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://acer.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/2631</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the following steps to start the system recovery:</p>
<ol>
<li>Restart the computer. </li><li>When the Acer logo appears on the screen, press the left <span style="font-weight: bold">
Alt</span>, and the <span style="font-weight: bold">F10</span> keys. </li><li>If you are prompted with a Microsoft Windows boot screen, press the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Enter</span> key. </li><li>After the Acer eRecovery Management application has loaded, select your restore type.
</li><li>Read the notice, and then click <span style="font-weight: bold">Next</span> when you are ready.
</li><li>Click <span style="font-weight: bold">Next</span> to begin the restore process. The restore can take anywhere from 10 minutes up to an hour.
</li><li>Once the restore is complete your computer will load Windows and start installing your drivers and software. Your computer may reboot several times during this process. After everything is complete your computer will be like it was when you first purchased
 it.</li></ol>
<p>If the steps above do not work, you will need to use recovery media to restore your system. If you do not have a set of Acer Recovery Media, you may
<a href="https://store.acer.com/store?Action=DisplayDataValidationServicePage&amp;Env=BASE&amp;Locale=en_US&amp;SiteID=acerna" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
purchase a set online</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

            I'm dropping off since my specialty is Photos but I'll note that I can't get pictures bigger than this on my 1080x1920 display.&nbsp; So the question may be why the Large Icon setting makes pictures this big on your machine.

            If you want larger thumbnails, why not use Photos?&nbsp; Its tiled view of folders might be perfect for you.

    <title>screen size in microsoft edge - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david tebbs  say:</h3>
<h2>            screen size in microsoft edge</h2>
                    When I open Edge up the resolution is wrong, I have to bump up the zoom to 150% to make it fill the window (this wasn't the case until today). Once I put it up to 150% it looks fine (looks 100%) but it seems wrong? any ideas?

<p>The reason why it display like that is because it is by tile display default. For example, if I search for a website and images on Microsoft Edge using 100% zoom-in it will display like this</p>

<p>Image 1.2</p>
<p>
</p><p>On image 1.1 you will notice that the right hand part of the page is not populated because the information&nbsp; provided doesn't take that much space compare to image 1.2 that is also on 100% zoom.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e99546dd-ba05-4b72-add9-d9c2d09ca1a4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e99546dd-ba05-4b72-add9-d9c2d09ca1a4" /></a></p>
<p>Image 2.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when you zoom it into 150%, the search for the website looks like normal fitting on the web page compare to searching for images that will take a lot of space and the horizontal scroll bar will be available because it doesn't fit on the page.</p>

<h2>            Kiosk Mode on Surface Pro 6</h2>
                    <p>Did they remove kiosk mode (assigned access) for the surface pro 6? I'm trying to follow the few outdated (by a year or more at least) guides that I was able to find, but they all refer to boxes of dialogue that don't seem to exist anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Cursor zips across screen</h2>
                    Hi, hope you can help.&nbsp; I have Windows Vista Home Premium in an HP C700 Notebook PC with Intel Pentium Dual CPU T2310. I'll be typing away on a document or an email and the cursor suddenly zips up the screen or down to another section. Sometimes it will
 highlight a paragraph, and because I'm typing away, it will delete it.&nbsp; In a document, I can Undo. In a long, complicated email, I cannot.&nbsp; Sometimes I'll just be sitting there with my fingers hovering above the keyboard thinking what to type and it will zip
 across. Drives me batty and causes a lot of extra work.&nbsp; Any idea what could cause this?

            A couple of things can cause this:<br />
<br />
1. Update to the latest drivers for your touchpad. You will only get them from HP's support site for your specific model laptop.<br />
<br />
2. Decrease the mouse sensitivity in the Control Panel mouse/touchpad applet.<br />
<br />
3. Sometimes this is caused by inadvertently hitting the touchpad with the heel of your hand while typing. Many laptops have the ability to disable the touchpad while you are tying (or if you're using a regular mouse).<br />
<br />
I would try #1 and #2 first.

    <title>Unable to delete or add any file&#47;folder to USB stick - windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to delete or add any file&#47;folder to USB stick - windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Just a couple of days back windows 10 somehow changed the access of the files/folders in my USB sticks to read only and though I could access them partially I can neither add data nor can I delete any file in them. Attempting to do so it firsts asks "<em>You'll
 need to provide administrator permission to delete this fil</em><em>e</em>" on hitting continue (I'm logged in as the Admin) it comes up with " F<em>ile Access denied. &nbsp; You need permission to delete this file. &nbsp; &nbsp;You need permission for Everyone to make changes
 to this file</em>." I've tried everything to solve this including taking ownership in several different ways without success. Also if I go to the '<strong>Properties</strong>' option on the USB Stick folder I find that there is
<strong>NO Security Tab!</strong> I'm at my wits end - can somebody help? Had 3 chat sessions with MS help - gave them remote access 3 times - those guys worked about an hour each but to no avail. Windows 10 seems to have a lot of problems - Think I was better
 off with the 7.....</p>

            <p>Hello Suresh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see you telling that there is no <strong>Security </strong>tab available under drive properties. If that is the case, then you can only fix this issue by formatting the drive completely. But ensure to take back of all files from the drive, before you initiate
 drive format. Formatting a drive will wipe out all files from the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, if you want to delete a particular folder, then you can follow below steps to take ownership of the folder for removing it from the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Right-clicking
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">on the folder which you want to delete&nbsp;and select
<strong>Properties </strong>from context menu.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>Security tab</strong> and click <strong>Advanced</strong>. </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>Ok</strong>. </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>Add</strong>, then click <strong>Select a principal </strong>under Permission Entry for folder. This will brings up
<strong>Select User or Group</strong> window.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>Enter the object name to select</strong>, for which you require permission. Next click
<strong>Check Names</strong>. Once name appears in the field, click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>Basic permission</strong>:, also select the check box <strong>Only apply these permissions to objects and/or containers within this container</strong>, then click
<strong>OK</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>Apply </strong>&amp;<strong>OK </strong>&amp; <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Let us know how it went.</p>

            <p>Tried formatting the drive - the quick format option does not work and the normal format option goes almost through the entire process and just short of completion it comes up with "Windows was unable to complete the format." Needless to say there are no
 changes in the drive.</p>
<p>This problem so far appears to only with the USB Drives. The second step you have suggested is of no use because the is
<strong>NO Security TAB </strong>in this particular drive. As for taking ownership I've tried that in various ways including cmd prompt but hasn't worked.</p>

            <p>Hello Suresh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description, I thought that the <strong>Security </strong>tab is missing only from drive properties. Hence I suggested you to check with the folder properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate if you could check the drive by connecting it to different computer. Once you connect the drive to different computer, try to format the drive to see if it goes correctly.</p>

</p><p>Once you format the drive, try to connect it to Windows 10 PC to see if it works correctly. But ensure to take backup of all files from the drive, before you initiate drive format. Formatting a drive will wipe out all files from the drive. Hope this should

<h2>            Windows Movie Maker</h2>
                    I purchased the Movie maker recently. I created a sample movie with few slides and it ran well. But when I created a movie containing photos and videos running to 12 GB in size, it does not run. What could be the reason for this?&nbsp;

<p>Dear Jsssss</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the feedback. The message I got is that Movie maker I had earlier was 2012 version and I had to purchase the 2016 version. So I made the purchase. I was advised to install the SW from the link http://www.windows-movie-.
</p>
<p>(hxxp://www[dot]windows[hyphen]movie-maker[dot]org/full/win-movie-maker-full-20160927153.exe)
</p>
<p>I installed the SW and tried the SW with movie lengths of 2 GB and it is working fine. Even with the larger file running up to 10 GB it runs from Movie maker project. But when I convert it to Movie it does not run. Any suggestions? Do I need to unistall
 the SW and install a new one from the link suggested?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<p>12 gigabytes would require a program that supports Blu-ray Discs and the correct hardware. The physical limits of the storage capacity of CD-R is 800 MEGAbytes with capable recordable media and for DVD it is around 4.7 GB. Only Blu-Ray Discs or hard drives
 can store this size of a program.</p>

</p><p>Now, it's quite possible that you have exceeded the capability of your computer to handle this file as well. Just the pre-buffering needed to play it would take a considerable time. Maybe you have chosen a format that is not compressed and if that were done
 it might solve your problem. If you simply cannot assemble the&nbsp;movie file correctly you might want to read the instructions again for clarity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But from the URL that you originally gave I would suspect you were taken. No official Microsoft site uses
<strong>.org&nbsp;</strong>nor is the word MICROSOFT found anywhere but after the @ as in @microsoft.com and if you find a site that uses Microsoft in any other way you can be sure it's NOT a legitimate site to get genuine software from the actual Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall the software and run malware/virus scanning as well, as this 'phishing' can very well be malicious in intent, to install&nbsp;malware or programs that control your computer, read your data and steal it to use against you.</p>

    <title>Update failing to install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markhazeldine  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update failing to install</h2>
                    <p>Just logging my similar experiences as others here on my Dell XPS 9550 with m.2 SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was having problems with a several update packages and after a system restore, I managed to get one or two to successfully install, but I'm now left with this one which goes through the whole update process to 100%, then fails and unwinds itself again,
 taking about an hour or more to do this entire cycle. Every time I wake up on the morning, it shows the login screen, and I log in and go to Windows Update and it shows the same file pending and asks me to restart or wait for the active hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look in Event Viewer i find this:</p>
<p>Installation Failure: Windows failed to install the following update with error 0x800F0922: Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB3213986).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: Doing a bit of reading around it seems like my issue is likely to be that my System Reserved Partition (called EFI System Partition on SSDs apparently) is too small. Mine is set to 500MB which people say should be plenty, but I guess Windows is getting
 more and more bloated over time. I now need to go and spend money to install a 3rd party partition manager piece of software to extend it because Window's Disk Management utility doesn't allow it. Thanks Microsoft! Brilliant design there!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Anniversary Update Bootloop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamablama  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Update Bootloop</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo T430 that I updated to the new anniversary update. After a few restarts, it got stuck on the black boot screen with the moving white circles in a ring and nothing else. I manually restarted it and the same thing happened. I manually restarted
 again and went into BIOS and looked for a way to boot into recovery mode or safe mode or something like that. Unfortunately, there was none to be found. I exited without saving changes. The boot screen with the white dots moving in the ring showed again, but
 this time with words saying "Restoring your previous version of Windows..." After a few minutes of that, it booted up to the previous version with no issues. I am afraid to update now, and would like to know when a fix will be made available. I contacted a
 Microsoft customer support assistant, who was very helpful. I don't think I'm the only one who has had this concern based on what she told me. Let me know if any of you guys comes up with a permanent fix or when you guys hear about a new update to the update
 being released. Thanks. </p>
<p>
</p><p>TLDR: Got new update to Windows 10. Got stuck in bootloop. Got lucky and Windows restarted back in old version. Hoping there is a fix soon.

            I had the same experience installing the Anniversary update as coildspring51 did; installed great on one computer and failed on the other, getting stuck with the blank page with circle of spinning white dots.&nbsp; I tried both method 1 and method 2 described
 by Akheel Ahmed and neither worked.&nbsp; Even when installing with the USB key created by the Media Creation Tool I had the same problem.&nbsp; I think the problem on my Acer was an error with one or more USB devices I had plugged into it during the upgrade.&nbsp; After
 leaving the computer running for another several hours with the circle of spinning white dots and no movement whatsoever, I removed 3 different USB dongles which were used for wireless keyboards and mice and then did a hard shut down.&nbsp; When the computer restarted,
 it detected the hard shutdown and went to "attempting to recover installation" and this time it picked up at 75% and resumed all the way through completion.&nbsp; I hope this helps some of you who are having

I too am looking for that answer.&nbsp; I plan on bringing my laptop to the store and make them do it.&nbsp; I'm a very unpleasant person when I feel I've been lied to or taken advantage of.

Event 11714: The older version of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client cannot be removed.</p>

On the internet I found related topics with the solution to use the Microsoft fix tool. This tool isn't available for Windows 10.</p>

Is there a new fix tool for this or is there an instruction to manual remove all old files and registry settings?</p>

            <p>
In search for the solution for my problem I tried to install the client from the command prompt with elevated rights from c:\temp where I located the .msi installation file:</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
msiexec /fv anyconnect-win-4.1.04011-pre-deploy-k9.msi /lvx "c:\Temp\ac-Uninstall.log.txt”</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Again the installations failed. This time with te message: The file "ManifestTool.exe" is not marked for installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Only option I had was to click on "Ok".</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This time the log "c:\Temp\ac-Uninstall.log.txt” was created. In this log I found this line:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
MSI (s) (E8:40) [07:42:34:275]: Product: Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client -- Error 2753. The File 'ManifestTool.exe' is not marked for installation.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I searched on the internet for "error 2753" AND "is not marked for installation". I found this site that directed me to the solution:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<a href="https://helpdesk.illinoisstate.edu/kb/1962/Error_Error_2753_The_File_is_not_marked_for_installation_when_installing_Cisco_Jabber/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://helpdesk.illinoisstate.edu/kb/1962/Error_Error_2753_The_File_is_not_marked_for_installation_when_installing_Cisco_Jabber/</a></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
In the registry I found the key that was causing the installation failure. I deleted the key in the following steps and after that I succesfully installed the new client.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
To edit the registry, do the following:</p>
<p>
1.Click Start and type regedit in the box.</p>
<p>
2.A dialogue box will pop up with the following text: Do you want to allow the following program to make changes to this computer? Click Yes.</p>
<p>
3.Browse to the following location: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Installer\Products\</p>
<p>
4.Within the Products folder, locate and delete the registry key which contains product information for Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
◦Each registry key within Products is an alphanumeric string. Select the first key and look on the right side for ProductName REG_SZ Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client. Go through each key in the Products folder until you find the one for Cisco AnyConnect
 Secure Mobility Client.</p>
<p>
◦In my (this) case: [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Installer\Products\E8CB28D0EF413434EBCBFF65361793A3]</p>
<p>
◦Your version of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client might have a different name for this registry key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
◦I recommend making a backup of this registry key before deleting it.</p>
<p>
5.Close the registry editor.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
After this start the installation of the new Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Change Netflix Sign-in account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Change Netflix Sign-in account&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just downloaded the Netflix app and trying to sign in to my account. &nbsp;The problem is that the email I used for Netflix is different than the one in my Xbox profile.</p>
<p>But it's forcing me to sign-in to Xbox Live in order to use Netflix, and then it uses the email from my profile and I can't seem to change the email being used.</p>
<p>Can someone tell me how to fix this please?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I've never heard of this issue before, so let me just make sure I understand correctly:</p>
<p>- Upon opening Netflix, you choose "Sign in"</p>
<p>- Instead of allowing you to type in your own email address, it is automatically filling in the email address field with the email address associated with you Xbox Live account without allowing you to change it</p>
<p>If this is the case, you can try quitting and reopening Netflix, deleting the Saved Data for Netflix, or uninstalling and reinstalling the Netflix app. To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<p>Quit Netflix</p>
<p>- Navigate to the Netflix tile either from the Home screen or My Games and Apps</p>
<p>- Press the Menu (or Start) button on your controller</p>
<p>- Choose Quit</p>
<p>Delete Saved Data for Netflix:</p>
<p>- Navigate to the Netflix tile</p>
<p>- Press the Menu button</p>
<p>- Choose "Manage app"</p>
<p>- Navigate to your Saved Data for Netflix. It will be the tile with your gamerpic or avatar</p>
<p>- Press the Menu button again</p>
<p>- Choose Delete Saved Data</p>
<p>Uninstall Netflix</p>
<p>- Navigate to Netflix tile</p>
<p>- Press Menu button</p>
<p>- Choose Manage app</p>
<p>- Choose the "Internal" drop down menu right above the big tile for Netflix</p>
<p>- Choose Uninstall all</p>
<p>If none of the above works, try to restart your console. This is certainly odd behavior for the app.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can go to Netflix.com and update your e-mail address to match your Xbox profile. I signed out of my Netflix account on my Xbox One to see how or if I could choose to enter a different e-mail address and, like you, I only saw my Microsoft
 Account e-mail (which, I use for Netflix anyways). I'm not sure why it does this.</p>

<p>Hey there Jill thanks for keeping in touch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Short answer is, the console and the Kinect need to be connected to the web in order to update. The console software might be out of date so we suggest connecting it (for a brief moment) to update everything and give it a shot after. Give it a shot and let
 us know how it goes!</p>
