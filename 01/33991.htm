    <title>update storage spaces from windows 8.1 to windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            update storage spaces from windows 8.1 to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Ok so I have set up a storage space on my windows 8.1 system and I know it lacked the optimize feature in the storage spaces.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I recently updated my windows 8.1 to windows 10 and was wanting to make sure my Storage space is updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is why I ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a system that I use at home that I started out with windows 10 and I noticed I have the option to optimize. However in this system that I updated I do not have that option.</p>

<p>However. on this system that I updated TO windows 10 I do not have that option.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6e615970-9a7d-454b-b091-96d257573223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6e615970-9a7d-454b-b091-96d257573223" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess my question is How do I&nbsp; update this Storage space to the newer storage space?</p>

            <p>another thought..</p>
<p>
</p><p>in the process I noticed that in the windows 10 Storage space is a Prepare to remove if you are wanting to remove a HD.
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>in the old windows 8 that I have upgraded to 10, its Storages space only has a REMOVE.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I know there is a way of updating this storage space to the newer storage space but I can not for the life of me find it.</p>

<h2>            Upload a digital voice recording to my desktop computer</h2>
                    I am trying to upload (transfer) a digital voice recording that's on an OLYMPUS DS-30, Digital Voice Recorder, to my desktop computer. Why won't it open up to show the files. Do I need certain software? I really need this done, because my Mom's voice is
 on it. She passed away and I'm making a DVD of her, so I would appreciate any help. Please help me, I need for it to be done by EASTER Sunday.

<p>This is a fairly old recorder and it was intended to be used with Windows XP and Vista.&nbsp; The recorder itself probably will still work with Windows 7, at least for what you want to do,&nbsp; but the software supplied with the recorder may be more of a problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The User Guide for your Olympus DS-30 is here:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/cpg_support_manuals.asp?id=1276" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/cpg_support_manuals.asp?id=1276</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As described at page 105, the method for connecting the DS-30 to your computer is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Turn the recorder on</li><li>Connect the USB cable to the computer</li><li>"Confirm the recorder has stopped" and then connect the USB cable to the recorder</li></ol>
<p>At this point, the recorder's display screen should show "Remote (storage)" -- did you recorder display this message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you hear the "USB connect" sound effect?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do see the correct message on the recorder, press the "Windows Logo" key and the E key simultaneously&nbsp; (or click Start and then click "Computer").&nbsp; You should see the recorder on the screen.&nbsp; Do you see the recorder or a "removable disk drive"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't see the recorder as a removable disk drive, open "Devices and Printers" from your computer's Start Menu.&nbsp; Is there an icon for the recorder there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see the recorder as a disk drive, double-click to open and start exploring for the sound files.&nbsp; The User Guide only discusses how to access these files using the Olympus software, but you should be able to do so directly from Windows Explorer (the
 file manager, which you had opened using WinLogo+E).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you run into problems, please describe at what point you were unable to follow the steps above.&nbsp; It will be very helpful if you provide a screenshot of what your computer is displaying at the point where you run into difficulty.&nbsp; See the directions here:&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">

<h2>            Don&#39;t know the Administrator password for donated computers.</h2>
                    I operate a community basic computer class and we received 20 computers that were donated from different sites.&nbsp; The problem with these computers is that we are unable to do some of the basic functions like, change the time and date and then some of the
 other features, like updates to Java, without the Admin account password.&nbsp; Is there any way we can reset these computers to reconfigure the admin account so we can make our own password?&nbsp; We need to still have an admin account as well as a student account,
 because the computers are used with young adults and if they were to have the admin password they would make unwanted changes... I have been searching this question and all I find are some vague, crazy and/or impossible ways, can someone please email me a
 simple way to do this for a basic computer teacher that does not know how to "crack codes", I would really appreciate it, thanks for your time.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I <span style="font-weight: bold">
acquired</span> a used computer, no matter who previously owned it, the first thing I would do with it would be to reinstall the operating system cleanly. You have no idea how the computer has been maintained, what has been installed incorrectly, what is missing,
 what viruses and spyware there may be, etc. I wouldn't want to live with somebody else's mistakes and problems, possibility of kiddy p0rn, etc., and I wouldn't recommend that anyone else do so either.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your choice of course, but in my view, you're playing with fire if you don't reinstall Windows cleanly on all of these.</p>

<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may run the fix-it from the following link and check.<br />

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><b><span><br />
</span></b><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span><br />
I would suggest you to temporarily disable antivirus software installed on your computer.<br />
</span><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most
 cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled,
 your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span><br />
After disabling antivirus software, I would suggest you to perform clean boot and then try to install the windows updates.</span></p>

<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</span></a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state</span></b></p>
<p><span>After you used the clean boot to resolve your problem, you can follow these steps to configure Windows XP to start normally.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click
<b>Start</b>, and then click<b>Run</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type
<b>msconfig</b>, and then click<b>OK</b>.<br />
The <b>System Configuration Utility</b> dialog box is displayed.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click the
<b>General</b> tab, click<b>Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services</b>, and then click
<b>OK</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. When you are prompted, click<b>Restart</b> to restart the computer.</span></p>

<p>Some compatibility problems can be solved by using an older operating system inside a Virtual Machine run on Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Virtual PC<br />
Download Windows XP Mode<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows XP Mode (Windows 7 only, but not any of the Home versions)&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are not eligible to download Windows XP Mode. You must have Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate to run Windows XP Mode".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have an old XP CD (or other older Windows
 CD)&nbsp; available you can just download the Virtual Machine and skip the XP Mode download.</p>
<p>This covers the whole gambit of virtual machines in "Home" versions if you want to have a look at it.&nbsp; Of course you will need a licensed copy of XP to install and&nbsp; run in any of them (except XP Mode).</p>
<p>VirtualBox is an impressive VM contender<br />

    <title>Temporarily disable tablet touchscreen when power button is pressed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Temporarily disable tablet touchscreen when power button is pressed</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am using an ASUS T300 Chi windows tablet running windows 10.</p>
<p>As this is a highly portable device, i often want to carry it around without shutting down or hibernating the OS (so that music keeps playing and so on).</p>
<p>I configured the power button to turn off the screen, which works perfectly. But when i touch the screen to carry the tablet around, it turns on again and i accitendtly perform unwanted touch input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to temporarily disable the touchscreen, when the screen has been turned off via the power button?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behavior is well known from android-tablets or iPads or any smartphone, where a touch on the screen does not turn the screen on.<br />
</p>
<p>Manually this can be done by opening the device manager, disabling the HID-device of the touchscreen, turning off the screen via the powerbutton. Turning back on in reversed order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unusual that the touchscreen still works even after pressing the power button. However, for instructions on how to disable the touchscreen while in tablet mode, I would suggest you to post your query in
<strong><a href="http://www.asus.com/us/support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Asus Support
</a></strong>&nbsp;for assistance, they will be better suited to guide you with this as this is a product related issue.</p>

<h3> gavinhornak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Looking to alternatives to graphics card drivers</h2>
                    Hi there. I was recently having a lot of problems with my computer, the Explorer.exe would crash after any extended period of the computer being idle.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After a lot of struggling and uninstalling then reinstalling programs, I finally found the program in the nvidia drivers for my evga gtx590.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I run 3 monitors on my computer, and it is essential to my work that I have all three monitors up and running, with the features of my graphics card&nbsp;implemented.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was wondering, given that windows will not display (yet it&nbsp;recognizes) my other two monitors, what alternatives I have to the nvidia drivers.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Or maybe there is a way to get their given drivers to work? Is there a way I can install an older version?</div>
                </div>

            How would I do that though? When I start my computer the nvidia driver runs automatically. Its open by the time I log in and go&nbsp;straight&nbsp;to the task manager.
<div><br />
<div>So say I kill the driver - how do I go about finding the program files to run it in compatibility mode :/</div>

<ul>
<li>35 GBytes is chicken feed, considering that the average external USB disk has a capacity of 500 GBytes.</li><li>Lots of people think that only losers back up their data regularly. Real people do not need to bother about such things. They prefer to wait until disaster strikes.</li><li>You can back up anything by booting the machine with a Ubuntu boot CD. It takes a bit of an effort to make one but it is preferable to losing the lot.<br />

<span>Hi kahrytan,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Have you tried the below mentioned steps to remove the certificates?</span></p>
<p>
<span>If not, then I would suggest you to follow the steps provided below.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>First, determine whether the computer is joined to a domain. If the computer is joined to a domain, determine whether the group policy is causing this error. To do this, temporarily remove
 the computer from the domain, restart the computer, and then try to add the Xbox 360 console as an Extender again. If the Group Policy settings are causing the connection issues, complete method 2.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>Remove the Media Center Extender certificate. To remove the certificate, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click, type mmc in the Start Search box,
 and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click the File menu, and then click Add/Remove
 Snap-in.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click Certificates, and then click Add.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select Computer account, and then click
 Next.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select Local computer, and then click
 Finish.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click OK.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In the Navigation Pane, under Console
 Root, expand Certificates, expand Personal, and then click Certificates.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click Microsoft Windows Media Center
 Extender Host, and then click Delete.</span></p>
<p>
<span>After you remove the certificate, uninstall the Extender, and then reinstall the Extender. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Start Windows Media Center.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click Tasks, and then click Settings.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click Extender, and then select the Xbox
 360 console.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click Uninstall.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>After the uninstall process is complete,
 click Extender again, and then click Configure.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>When you're prompted for the setup key,
 follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On the Xbox 360 Media Remote, press the
 Y button.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Press the Windows Media Center Start
 button.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Note the eight-digit setup key.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>j.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Return to the computer, and then enter
 the setup key.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>k.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Complete the Extender setup.</span></p>

<h2>            font size have become small</h2>
                    
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><strong>I have acer aspire 5745g pre-installed windows premiem 7</strong></p>
<p><strong>What Happened</strong></p>
<p>I had install a demo version of eKundali 2009. After seeing the software, i deleted the software. While deleting the software, unintaller of the software asked me to deleted certain fonts. I choose not to delete but some error happened and so, i re-installed
 the software and then uninstalled it. Second time it didn't ask me any option and it got deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Now Problem</strong>, i am facing is, in internet explorer, any web site you open everthing is fine. But where you get option to type or to search or where you have icon like submitt, cancal etc.. the fonts have become small. Some of the software
 which might be using the same fonts have become small. Like in tally, the fonts have chaged and it has become small. It looks to me like times (fonts).</p>
<p><strong>What I did?</strong></p>
<p>In windows 7 we have an option restorre default fonts, even in&nbsp;IE8. i tried that but didn't work.</p>
<p>I hope i very clear this time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>

<p>The standard settings are 100% (default) 125%, and 150%. You can increase the&nbsp;size by clicking&nbsp;the box before&nbsp;a higher setting and clicking on Apply. You will get a prompt to log off which you should accept. When you log back on you will see whether the
 new size suits.</p>
<p>If you want a larger setting than 150% click on Set custom text size. The box defaults to 200%. If you want 175% or any other setting you can type over 200% and then click on Apply. The process is then as for changing a standard setting.</p>

            I tried all the solution given by you. But it didn't work. I could not find "teh fonts". Is it possible that while unintalling the software some of the fonts may have deleted. which are common.

<p>Why do you need a particular font?&nbsp; You said that the size of the font was too small!</p>
<p>What is the name of that font?</p>
<p>Type "Change windows color and metrics" without quotes&nbsp;in the Search box above the Start button. That gives more options to customise fonts and font sizes.</p>

<p>
</p><p>After seeing the progress bar running, and installing updates, then at the end, the screen display "There was a problem installing updates", so i clicked "Get more info" and displayed to see "Get help with error 80070005".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP TO GUIDE ME OR ADVISE ME HOW TO FIX THIS!!!</p>
<p>THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</p>

<h2>            Copying files to my external drive, files totally different sizes, WHY</h2>
                    <p>I have to send my nearly new hp all in one computer in for repairs so I am copying all of my personal files to my Seagate external hard drive.&nbsp; I am using Windows 10 with all latest updates.&nbsp; I am using File Explorer copy/paste function and it takes a couple
 hours to complete.&nbsp; After it completes and I use properties to look at the size and number of files and folders, they are totally different.&nbsp; Yet when I go through each folder I can't find anything different, nothing seems to be missing.</p>
<p>The D: drive shows a size 29.9 GB, 9,243 Files and 1,308 Folders</p>
<p>Seagate copy shows a size 13.5 GB, 5,220 Files and 428 Folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas why the difference?&nbsp; Am I at risk of losing my data if I erase the D: drive?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, you are. The copy process you used probably failed to copy hidden folders. A much safer option would consist of using the free version of Macrium Reflect to create an image of your drive D: on your external disk. Later on you can restore any files or
 folders, even the ones you might have forgotten.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best to perform a sample recovery before erasing the partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What about drive C:?</p>
