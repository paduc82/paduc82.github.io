<h2>            Looking for Players who actually want to play through the game&#33;</h2>
                    I am at 16 skill level now. I started the game about 4 times from scratch, with new players each of the times, but it seems they dont want to play the game through. It seems they quit durng the more intense parts of missions. So I assume everyone who is
 starting a NEW game from scratch is having the same problems, finding new players to stick wiht the game. I like to find some players that are willing to hash it out all the way through and level up at same time! I would start all over again to give it another
 try at it! Of course i know about some of the cheats mods and i dont like that that takes all the fun out of EARNING you what your acquire. Play fair people! thats what makes it fun! So anyone want to rock?!?! Like I say iam a 16 skill level now and about
 to face SLEDGE.. and i would like to even find people with same skill level to carry off from there with me. as i completed alot of missions aready (more then once) and would really hate to start again!! So if you are around that

<p>Hi, i &nbsp;got your request! &nbsp;:O) &nbsp; i should say that i have weird hours.. &nbsp;i know alot of people, &nbsp; most anyways play late at night. I tried .a few times to do that, but. i cant do it cause i get tired and then my gameing slows down. which means i need to get
 sleep. &nbsp; &nbsp;I get tired early &nbsp;so i crash around 8pm.. and then i wake up like about 4am! &nbsp; &nbsp;I usually throw in a quick game of Blackops in the morning to wake up.. heheh &nbsp;then i &nbsp;getingo the rpg games like Borderland &nbsp;during the after noon</p>
<p>I know it is hard to find a player to play all the way through as i mentioined in my email toyou!. &nbsp;What i like to do is play through game AGAIN,, but &nbsp;starting over.. but with someone with &nbsp;SAME SKILL level and build &nbsp;the levels &nbsp; up at the same time. But
 then what makes it &nbsp;harder is that the other players will decide to build up thier levele &nbsp;on tghier own.. and when they the next time they join you they are like &nbsp;alreay passed. your level .
</p>
<p>so thats what &nbsp;i was saying is that i like to play through the game all the way through working together &nbsp;at the same time and at the same levels. &nbsp; But i know it isnt that easy to find people to do that . Thats whahy they should save that character JUST
 &nbsp;for that partciualr game so that &nbsp;they &nbsp;dont get ahead of &nbsp;you &nbsp; and vice versa!</p>
<p>I know the game gets harder and harder and i had some players show me the way around which i &nbsp;found was a GREAT HELP! &nbsp;and i built up a high level. &nbsp;So i am saving that High level character for that particular game with those same players. it seems only
 fairf. &nbsp;.. but I will start a new player to start a new game! and build up together.</p>

<p>hey i am able to reply here.. &nbsp;there is a reply box for me!!. killlller.. i wasnt able to reply before!</p>
<p>LEGEND.. your probly way higher then a level 12 now!.. by now... &nbsp; plus my high level character is also a siren &nbsp;so it wouldnt be any good BOTH as sirens!</p>
<p>Thats &nbsp;why i want to start from scratch &nbsp;and play a private game &nbsp;from LEVEL one and &nbsp;LEVEL UP together.. &nbsp; everytime i start one wiht someone &nbsp;for the past month or so.. it seems &nbsp;they only play for a little bit then they &nbsp;dont continue with it! &nbsp;it is
 like WHY bother starting &nbsp;a game if you dont want to continue with it?! </p>
<p>I will make another attempt on asking &nbsp;to see if anyone that wants to play from scratch... so If there is any SERIOUS DEDICATED players that &nbsp; want to join a new private game &nbsp;to play.. hit me me up! &nbsp;</p>
<p>i HAVE NO broken missions on my list, but it wouldnt matter anyways if we start from scratch &nbsp; :O)</p>

                    <p>My 1704 keyboard is trashed (not beer proof :(). I found a 1705 used keyboard (has the GPU in it).&nbsp; Will it work with my 1704 display seamlessly and will&nbsp; the display make use of the GPU automatically ?&nbsp; Will I need updated firmware to support it ? I am
 hoping Microsoft can answer this with certainty as they designed it.</p>

                    <p>I have a Dell Latitude D520 Laptop running Windows 7 (and with 200% satisfactory performance) with a Built-In Dial-Up Modem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Successfully Been able to setup a Dial-Up connection to my Windows XP Laptop (incoming connections) peice of cake easy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would Like to take my Windows 7 and Modem further by accepting/answering incoming calls.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not concerned on specific calls (voice vs fax vs data), I just want Windows 7 to pickup when the line rings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an Auto-Answer setting in windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Is there any Windows 7 software out there that utilize dialup-modems?</p>

<p>It's been a very long time since I worked with dial-up modems, but you should be able to configure most modems to auto-answer by providing the appropriate initialization string.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a fax modem, Windows Fax and Scan can set the auto-answer (for faxes) using the GUI in Windows Fax and Scan:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26260177-9c96-4e44-ba95-eebf9543c765?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26260177-9c96-4e44-ba95-eebf9543c765?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, you can configure an initialization string in the "Advanced" settings of the modem's "Properties" accessed via Device Manager (you can also get this via Control Panel &gt; Phone and Modem &gt; Modems tab &gt; Advanced):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a5dd4623-013c-4cda-af82-356e257b6f0f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a5dd4623-013c-4cda-af82-356e257b6f0f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll want to set the S0 register to a non-zero value.&nbsp; See, for example:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.modemsite.com/56k/autoanswer.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.modemsite.com/56k/autoanswer.asp</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have HyperTerminal on my Windows 7 system, copied from an XP system.&nbsp; See the Help Desk Geek article below.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The commercial version of HyperTerminal (HyperTerminal PE) is fairly expensive, but there a free 30-day trial.</p>

    <title>Mouse driver installs every time computer boots up. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doomster  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse driver installs every time computer boots up.</h2>
                    I've had&nbsp;Windows 7 for eight months&nbsp;and have just run into a problem for the last two days with my mouse. It started with a notice that the USB port didnt recognize hardware and my mouse wouldnt work. I bought a new mouse and it installed correctly but
 every time the computer starts up it wont work until &nbsp;I&nbsp;unplug the mouse&nbsp; to&nbsp;the USB&nbsp;port&nbsp; and it installs a driver for it. I've also had to shut down the computer and unplug it a couple of times before the mouse gets drivers automatically installed.&nbsp;The mouse
 then works fine for any length of time untill it's shut down and started again. I've checked all the USB ports and all eight have the same result with mouse only. Any port will work fine with all the other devices hooked to them so I dont think it's a USB
 port problem. The mouse works fine with another computer I have so I dont think it's bad.The device manager says it's working fine and has the correct driver. There are no errors reporte

<div>Hi Doomster,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Do you remember making any recent changes to your computer between the timings when things were working fine and now?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong> Try booting into Safe Mode and check if the computer boots without any issue and test the mouse too.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><span>Safe mode starts</span><span><span>Windows</span></span><span>
 with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start</span><span><span>Windows</span></span><span>
 are installed.</span></p>
<div><span>Refer this link to boot into Safe Mode:<br />
<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></a></span></span></div>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> If the mouse works fine and you can access the computer with ease, it could be inferred that the issue could be caused by some third party application.</span></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Put your computer in Clean boot state to identify the same.</p>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you
 may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or
 in Windows 7:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, make
 sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in </span><strong><span>Step 7</span></strong><span>
 in the above KB article.</span></p>

<h2>            Weird Wavy Disc Pattern&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone!<br /><br />for a while, ever since I got my console in the first place, when i try to install a game using a disc i bought, it creates a weird wavy pattern on the disc and makes some of the discs unplayable. Can anyone tell me what is going wrong or how to fix this? no misuse has happened to my console, it has stayed in the same position in my house, or very carefully carried around.</p>

            <p>It is odd that I creates a wavy pattern ? If it created a perfect circle then I would say that the issue is laser burn on the disc.</p><p><br /></p><p>If the console is still under warranty then I recommend taking it back and getting a replacement. If not, then I recommend keeping your&nbsp;</p><p>console horizontal on a stable flat surface. Any vibration, even in an adjacent room can cause the disc to wobble whilst it spins around in the console</p><p>and may cause laser burn. Does anybody walk heavily around the house ? If so ask them nicely to walk a little more gently whilst you play your Xbox.</p>

    <title>XboxOne cloud storage access - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            XboxOne cloud storage access</h2>
                    I have an Xbox one and ran into a limit for game saves in my game. I want to save to the cloud, but cannot access it from my console. I subscribed to Xboxone Live Gold but still cannot access the cloud.

<p>Hey MovedGlitter975! Thank you for reaching out to us today. I'm from the Forums team and would be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Saved games are automatically stored in the cloud while you're connected to Xbox Live. You don't have to select cloud storage. If you sign in to a different Xbox One console, your saves are available from that console when you sign in with your Xbox profile.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, technically you can't really access the cloud storage as it is automatically updated as long as you're connected to Xbox Live. So whichever game you want to save to the cloud is already saved and updated to your cloud. Your cloud storage is limited to
 how much storage your console has because the cloud storage grows as your game library grows. It's not necessarily a storage that adds to your console's storage. It's more like a vault that holds your saved games, so if something happens to the saved data
 on your Xbox, you can sync that same data back from the cloud in the event if you have to delete it locally from the hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our article about <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/cloud-game-saves-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Cloud Saved Games</a>&nbsp;further details more information about cloud storage. I hope that helps!</p>

            Mass Effect Andromeda. I'm new to Xbox One. I get "Save Data Error, 3MB of Space Needed" when the game tries to auto save. I have a 1TB hard drive with 70% of it empty.

            Thank you, I appreciate your help. So the cloud will NOT help me around the limited game saves in Andromeda Mass Effect. Grrr I was hoping I could put the "old game saves" in the cloud to make room for new ones. It doesn't appear getting an additional
 external hard drive will solve this problem either.?

            It looks like this is a pretty common error for that game. I've never played it so I dont know if you can do this from in-game but see if it lets you delete a bunch of old game saves. The do a hard reset on the console (even if you cant delete them this
 may work). To do a reset, hold the powere button down for 10 seconds to shut the console down, unplug it, wait about 45 seconds, then plug it back in and turn it on.&nbsp;

            I'm guessing this issue is due to the reserved space for ME: Andromeda, I suggest you clear local saved games and power cycle your console to force it to redownload your game saves. And if you ran out kf saving slots ingame, sadly there is nothing you
 can do about it :/&nbsp;

<p>Thank you for updating us, JLS422. To further troubleshoot this issue, we suggest that you
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17441/windows-internet-explorer-change-reset-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
reset the Internet Explorer settings. </a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control
 settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature. Resetting Internet Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after reset.</em></p>

<p>Você poderá alterar o seu gamertag dentro de 30 dias após a criação dele. Para fazer isso, entre na sua conta em live.xbox.com, clique em Exibir meu perfil, clique em EDITAR MEU PERFIL e clique em Alterar gamertag.</p>
<p>Se já passaram mais de 30 dias desde que o gamertag foi criado, você terá que alterá-lo no console Xbox, e uma tarifa será cobrada. Para fazer isso, siga as etapas nesta página.</p>

<div><br />
</div>
I had my computer upgraded from XP to Win.7 recently. I am not very computer literate &amp; the tech. that did the upgrade didnt tell me that Outlook Express would not work with Win.7. He said he didnt backup my e-mail files but through some searching of my own
 I found some files titled Outlook Express,but,I cannot open them. I asked another tech. about this &amp; he said that what I found is probably just registry entries &amp; not the actual Outlook Express files &amp; that all my e-mail files were most likely unrecoverable.
 Do you think that he is correct or would one of those DBX file opening tools that you see on the web, be worth downloading to see if it will open these files or whatever they are that I have found?

            <div>OK. You will need a tool then. If you have seen one you think will work, give it a shot. I am familiar with this program, but I need to check if it will allow the extracted messages to be put into Outlook folders. I'll get back to you as soon as I find
 out.</div>

            <div>Perhaps Windows Live Mail will import the messages. It does if they are both on an XP machine. It's free and you can always remove it. If it works, there is a method to move messages between WLMail and Outlook.</div>

<p>Option 1:</p>
<p>If the COA sticker is damaged, then you would need to use the recovery partition to reinstall Windows 7, this will exempt the need to use the product key to activate your Windows 7 instalaltion.</p>
<p>Option 2:</p>
<p>If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee. This will exempt the need
 to use the product key also.</p>
<p>Option 3:</p>
<p>If the neither options 1 or 2 is possible, then you need to invest in a new retail full version license.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes</p>
<p>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
</span></span>
<p>For Samsung: Tap the F4 Key at the Samsung logo when you first power on.</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>

            <p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm an engineer on the Photos app. Currently, there is no feature to add text to Photos in the Photos app. I will pass this feature request on to the team, but the best way for us to understand how many people would want this feature is to use the Windows
 Feedback app. If you submit this idea through the Windows Feedback app (which you can find by searching in the Search bar for "Windows Feedback"), other people can see it and vote for it. This is the best way for us to understand how we can best improve the
 app.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It is <em>not </em>the partition 4 [really partition 5 - remember, there is a secret partition called MSR (Msft Reserved)&nbsp;just before C:] that showed up&nbsp;in your Disk Management. If you open that now, you will see a Disk 1, named Recovery,&nbsp;with the letter
 D:.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is good to have, &amp; it provides a recovery environment very similar to your partition 3 (which really is partition 4 as seen in ReagentC /Info). To boot it for a test, plug it in, &amp; reboot; press &amp; hold your BIOS boot menu key (mine is F12 on this Dell);
 select to boot the USB device from the menu.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Although it did not show up in ReagentC, I still believe that partition 4 is the manufacturer's image of the original installation - all of the original partitions. What is your computer name &amp; model number? I'm sure its site will mention it.</p>

<p>You have to&nbsp;remove the sticky tape strip on the new&nbsp;Ink Cartridges before inserting them in the Printer.</p>
<p>You may&nbsp;have ruined the Ink Cartridges. trying to print a set up page with the tape still in place.</p>

            Hi RAJU.MSC
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />My sincere apologies. Notepad doesn't provide auto save functionality. There is no registry hack for this, You will have to save this manually every time.
<br />
<br />Autosave as a feature is implemented in MS Office suite of apps provided the file is in Onedrive / Sharepoint. If you need Autosave, I would suggest that you should use MS Word for this purpose not Notepad.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi RAJU.MSC
<br />
<br />The notepad app in Windows 10 is the most basic of apps, it does not have an Autosave feature, nor will that feature be added to Notepad
<br />
<br />A very good free alternative to Notepad is Notepad++ that ahs a lot more functionality than Notepad, is totally free and had a huge amount of plugins available to add whatever functionality you need . . .
<br />
<br />Download Notepad++

<br />
<br />AutoSave Plugin for Notepad++

<br />
<br />Honestly, there is no point in waiting, Notepad has been around 25 years and is unlikely to change from a very basic text editor

            Thanks for information . Builtin notepad is&nbsp; very simple and its&nbsp; user interface is&nbsp; good . I love this application , it helped me a lot from many years&nbsp; . I&nbsp; hope microsoft engineers team should&nbsp; reconsider this useful appication and they will add some&nbsp;
 extra features in next future updates.

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a lot of problems in my windows 10 laptop so I found that solution is checking for system files so I go to cmd then write&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</p>
<p>
</p><p>it worked until 84.8% and then stopped for a while then I pressed enter to see what will happen and it throws error 50 the request is not supported</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did it 3 times and it prints that error</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows up to date&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>so what can I do please?</p>

            If you don’t press Enter &amp; wait does it progress?
<br />When DISM fails then try an in-place upgrade repair:
<br />To repair Windows without losing any data then follow the instruction here:

<br />This will also upgrade you to the latest version of Windows - currently 1903.
