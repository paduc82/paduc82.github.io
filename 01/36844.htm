<h2>            Can&#39;t log into Windows 10 anymore</h2>
                    I upgraded to 10 on a brand new computer and was able to get in with a local password fine until I loaded Microsoft Office and now I can't get in. It tells me I must change my password but when I try to change it it tells me the passwords don't match.
 &nbsp;I'm thinking this has to do with my university Exchange account but that password doesn't work either.

            <p>I created the Win 10 ISO file and followed the System Restore instructions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the only target operating system offered for restore is Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to enable the Administrator account so I can log in!</p>
<p>I can't believe that you disabled the Admin account without asking permission!</p>
<p>How many people are going to be screwed by this presumptuousness on the part of the Win 10 development team?</p>

            <p>@TomDeMoor --</p>
<p>Thanks for your comment.</p>
<p>You have perfectly expressed my frustration with MS so-called "support".</p>
<p>I finally reinstalled Windows 7 from a backup. I had to download and install some updates, but it was less frustrating than dealing with the MS yahoos.</p>
<p>I have&nbsp;now tried several times to disable the Win 10 logo on my rebuilt task bar. I thought I had removed it, but two days later it was back, daring me to install Win 10. I might resort to putting a piece of black tape over that portion of my screen.</p>
<p>Good luck with solving your problem.</p>

 do not work:</p>
<p>- On the old computer, right click on My Computer and go to Properties</p>
<p>- Go to the Advanced Tab</p>
<p>- Under User Profiles click Settings</p>
<p>- Check for any Unknown Accounts or accounts with no username, just the SSID number, and if you find any delete them.</p>
<p>- Try the transfer wizard again.</p>

            Hi asja2017
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Go for 1903 now. You should upgrade to 1903 through Media creation tool. Execute the below steps to go to 1903 
<br />
<br />1. Windows Key+X &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin)
<br />Type following (or copy and paste following) one by one and Enter
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />net start cryptSvc
<br />net start bits
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />2. Type following in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) and hit Enter %systemroot%\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log to something else.
<br />If it doesn't allow you to rename - Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update, SFC etc)
<br />

<br />
<br />3. A. Take a backup of your computer before you proceed.
<br />B. Disable any third party Antivirus (After update is successful, you can enable it again)
<br />C. You can go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />You can download the latest Windows 10 package from this link (media creation tool) and follow the instructions there to upgrade. Use the very simple instructions given under Using this tool to upgrade this PC to Windows 10
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi asja2017, you would be amazed how many users with 32GB of internal storage ask the exact same question here on Community each day. . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer,  backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you 10GB more internal storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>I have tried to install the 64 Bit OS without any success.&nbsp; I was hoping to find a Microsoft Readiness Program to check for</p>

            There may be a reason if these came preinstalled with 32 bit WIndows, like weak processors or less than 3.5 gb RAM which is all that 32 bit can utilize.   
<br />
<br />Otherwise 64 bit is no more long-lasting than 32 bit so that is not a concern.  There are some systems that 32 bit runs better on, especially less than 2gb RAM, so I'd let that guide you.  
<br />
<br />What exactly is the problems when you boot and try to install 64bit?  Does it provide an error, or what is the exact failure behavior?

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>First these are older machines circa 2005 and the 32 bit windows seven was installed by the purveyor thereof.&nbsp; Since I had these machines and the upgrade to win 10 pro 32 bit was free I updated all three of these machines with no problem at all.&nbsp; Because
 I read somewhere or other that eventually Microsoft was going to cut the 32 bit out I recently decided to update these 3 intel motherboard based computers by downloading from media creation the 64 bit iso.&nbsp; Once it was downloaded, I set about attempting to
 load it.&nbsp; I set the bios to boot from the dvdrw drive which it did and then it went on for serveral minutes and ignoring the install program (which never showed on the display) the computer went back and booted from the win 10 pro 32 bit which was supposed
 to be over riddent by the 64 bit install.&nbsp; I tried that on all three of the exact same computers with the same result.&nbsp; Following that I went back to the media page on microsoft and had it download the 64 bit program onto a usb drive.&nbsp; Then went to install
 and chose boot from the bios boot menu and the same thing happened.&nbsp; No microsoft install screen&nbsp; from either the dvd install or from the usb install.&nbsp; Both went back to the onboard OS and booted.&nbsp; Tried a new HD and that did not get the install screen or
 anything else as it just sat there.&nbsp; I've installed about a hundred win 10 home and pro 32 bit programs and never had this problem before.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks<br />

            CPU Not Compatible	
<br />To install Windows 10 on your PC, the processor (CPU) must support the following features: Physical Address Extension (PAE), NX, and SSE2. Most CPUs have support for these features, so if you receive this error, it is likely because the NX feature is not enabled on your system.
<br />
<br />So, it looks like you are stuck with the 32 bit version or you might have to downgrade to 64 bit Windows 7.

            Did you use only the Media Creation Tool to create the bootable flash?  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Then folllow these steps which compile the best possible install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, and has zero reported problems.:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />As illustrated in the steps keep the Hard drive set first to boot in BIOS setup for a Legacy BIOS, or Windows Boot Manager set first to boot if this is UEFI.  You can check which by typing System Information in Search box to check BIOS mode.
<br />
<br /> 
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup   to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. <a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-lis...</a>

            I've given up on trying to update the three Nobilis machines.&nbsp; When they were built with the D915GAG intel board and the Pentium 4 775 2x3.0ghz cpu they were not a very good machine and I can see why.&nbsp; They will be running the Windows 10 Professional 32
 bit OS instead as they run that quite well.&nbsp; I have another 21 computers to update and most of them are a lot newer than these door stops.&nbsp; Thanks for the help.<br />

<h2>            Mail app shows emails as unread even after I read them</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I have started using the windows 10 mail app, which I find really nice and handy. I have synced my outlook.com mail and gmail ids here. But one ridiculous thing I am encountering here is that even after clicking and reading the new e-mails, they
 appear as unread till I right-click and click "Mark as read". For every single mail, after reading it, I have to mark them as read manually. It's really ridiculous. Please suggest solutions to make it automatic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to inform, I have tried updating the&nbsp;mail app, but the problem is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Jagannath</p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that the DVD drive fails to work on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>　</p>
<span>
<p>For better understanding of the issue, <span>please reply to the following questions.</span></p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Did you make any recent changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Do you get any error message for DVD drive in Device Manager?</p>
<p>( To check, right click on <strong>Start</strong>, select <strong>Device Manager
</strong>and expand <strong>DVD drive</strong>)</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>This issue might occur if the drivers are corrupted, incompatible or due to hardware problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with devices and hardware. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Open <strong>Control Panel </strong>by right click on <strong>
Start</strong> Button.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> In the search box, type <strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Click on the <strong>view all </strong>option on the left panel.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Run the <strong>Hardware and Devices </strong>troubleshooter and follow on-screen instructions.
</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Update the Drivers</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>Most <strong>hardware interfaces </strong>require driver software to work properly. If you recently upgraded from one version of Windows to another, power outages, viruses, or other computer problems, it's possible that the drivers have become corrupted.
 Downloading and installing the <strong>latest driver </strong>can resolve these types of problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer below article to know how to <strong>Update drivers</strong>:</p>

<div>
<div>
<p>Choose the Mastered format when you need a disc that will play on any computer or in some different consumer electronic devices, such as CD, DVD, and Blu‑ray Disc players, that can play digital music files, pictures, or video files.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Insert a writable disc, such as a CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, or DVD+RW disc, into your computer's CD, DVD, or Blu‑ray Disc burner.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the <span>AutoPlay</span> dialog box that appears, click
<span>Burn files to disc using <span>Windows</span> Explorer</span>.</p>
<div>If the AutoPlay dialog box doesn't appear, click the <span>

<span>Next</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Open the folder that contains the files you want to burn, and then drag the files into the empty disc folder.</p>
<p>To select more than one item, press and hold the Ctrl key, and then click the files you want to burn.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the toolbar, click <span>Burn to disc</span>, and then follow the steps in the wizard.</p>
<p>The selected files are copied to the disc. When the disc burning is complete, the disc burner tray will open and you can remove the disc. You can now use the disc in another computer or in some CD or DVD players. The disc session is already
 closed.</p>

    <title>CommOSD malware&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mehminer  say:</h3>
<h2>            CommOSD malware&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The past month I've been experiencing suspicious problems with my Win7-64bit system online. &nbsp;Something seems to be taking control of my cursor and/or my audio speaker setting. &nbsp;The cursor responds very jerkily and the speaker turns on and off erratically
 and automatically. &nbsp;Simultaneously, the Lenovo communications settings window opens. &nbsp;The only options are Close and Change settings. &nbsp; If I Close, the window is likely to re-display. &nbsp;Turning the speakers back on when they are off often leads to them being
 turned off again. &nbsp;Although I haven't experienced it in the past few days, something takes control of text entry in the address bar of my Chrome browser and enters long strings of apostrophes. &nbsp;Once in a while, I see a message window saying that CommOSD.exe
 has shut down. &nbsp;If I let it remain off, the above problems cease, for a while, at least. &nbsp;Inspecting the Memory window of the Resource Monitor can show that CommOSD is still occupying memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have rn SpyHunter (with Chrome on and off) and Norton Power Eraser and they find no suspect files or rootkits. &nbsp;I have Symantec Interne\t Security running in background at all times.</p>
<p>\7'w'hg</p>
<p>My best guess is that CommOSD has become contaminated .</p>

            In downloading SpyHunter you have probably given yourself a virus as SpyHunter is not a legitimate program and is designed to scare users by reporting fake infections and then prompting the user to buy a license.

<h2>            Skype for Business recording gives warning &#47; Runtime error, what is the error&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently Skype for Business is unable to save my recorded meetings. I record a meeting where I present my desktop.</p>
<p>When the recording is completed, the recording manager processes the recording but reports a warning / Runtime error.</p>
<p>The resulting MP4 file has the audio but claims the was no content presented (there was).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I find out what the error is?</p>
<p>

            Hi Geert,
<br />
<br />Could you identify the version of Skype for Business you are using? 
<br />
<br />I suggest you clear your Skype for Business client cache to isolate the issue. To clear the Skype for Business cache, you can refer to the following steps.
<br />1. Sign out your Skype for Business.
<br />2. Click "Delete Sign-in information".
<br />3. Open Run bad and type  in %AppData%. Make sure you're in the AppData directory and navigate to Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync for Skype for Busines 2016 
<br />4. Delete all files in Tracing folder. Do not delete the folder itself.
<br />5. Clear DNS cache: in Command Prompt run ipconfig /flushdns command.
<br />6. Re-start your Skype for Business client and sign into it.
<br />
<br />Also, make sure you are using the latest Skype for Business client version. You can try opening any of the Office Apps, like Outlook, Word or Excel and then click "FILE"&gt; "Office Account"&gt; "Office Update"&gt; "update now" to check if your Office can be upgraded.

<h2>            Error message states that the CPU fan is not working and shuts the computer down.</h2>
                    The power supply was replaced on my computer and ever since, when I try to start my computer it kicks back an error message stating the CPU fan is not working and shuts off. I am running Windows XP, and the fan is working fine. So how do I get the computer
 to recognize that the fan is working properly? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

            Whoever replaced the power supply forgot to attach the power to the CPU fan header. With the computer off and unplugged, attach the connector from the new power supply to the CPU fan header. Refer to your motherboard manual if it isn't obvious to you where
 to plug in the connector.

<h2>            Vista - Error Code&#58; 80070643 &#40;Can&#39;t install updates&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I literally feel like I over the last many months have tried every solution suggested for this problem as I ever since November 09 I've been unable to get updates for Windows Vista (32 bit, Ultimate). I am unable to install the update to Windows Update
 as it errors with the code 80070643. I own a Dell XPS 1330 and I have noticed a disproportional amount of users that are on this particular system when trying to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Here's a small sample of the stuff I've already tried,</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed and reinstalled all versions of Microsoft NET including using the NET cleaner (e.g.: http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en/vistawu/thread/c4ba05b9-5f9a-4a52-906d-b182db553140 but also other threads)</li><li>Played with ose.exe (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903772) </li><li>I've used Microsoft Fix-It function (aggressive mode) and tried the manual approach outlined (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058)</li><li>Uninstalled anti virus software (McAfee SecurityCentre subscription edition) </li><li>Remove the "softwareupdate" folder and ran disk cleanup </li><li>Booted in clean boot </li><li>Disabled UAC (User Account Control) </li><li>Tried to manually install the Windows Agent Update (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949104)</li><li>Installed the system readiness tool (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821) </li></ul>
<p>... and most of them in random patterns and more than once.</p>
<p>I am getting quite desperate! Can't believe I pay that much money for an OS and occur something that is incredibly difficult to fix when trying to update it.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p><span>Hi jakobv,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I see that you have already tried many ways to fix this problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Let`s check to see if the following Knowledge
 Base Article can help.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/958052/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">You receive error code 0x80070643 or error code 0x643 when you use the Windows Update or

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>If these don’t help, then perform a SFC (System
 File Checker) scan to check for any system file corruptions and then try installing updates again. To do so, follow these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start, All programs and then Accessories. Right Click Command Prompt and select Run as administrator.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the Command Prompt window type “sfc /scannow” (without quotes) and then press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>After
 the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check for the issue.</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I understand that you already tried these steps but I would recommend you to try these in this order:</p>
<p>1. Run the FixIt in KB 971187 - How to fix MSI software update registration corruption issues by clicking the link below:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971187</a><br />
2. Retry the Update.<br />
3. If the Update fails, proceed to Step 4.<br />
4. Download .Net Cleanup Utility from the link below:<br />
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2008/08/28/8904493.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2008/08/28/8904493.aspx</a><br />
Look for (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Components-PostAttachments/00-08-90-44-93/dotnetfx_5F00_cleanup_5F00_tool.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Components-PostAttachments/00-08-90-44-93/dotnetfx_5F00_cleanup_5F00_tool.zip</a>)<br />
5. By using the Cleanup Tool, uninstall all .Net Framework entries. (You will not be allowed to remove the .NET Framework 2.0 on Vista and higher because it is an Operating System component.)<br />

<p>@Syed N</p>
<p>Thanks for the two suggestions. On Method 1 I made the change which initially gave a new error in Windows Update coded 8024001B, but after googling I tried again and it proceeded to attempt to install. It however failed with the usual code thereafter of
 80070643. I tried to find the log file in the temp directory, but don't see it(?)</p>
<p>On Method 2, I have run this before and everything is reported as being OK. I should have mentioned that I had done this step before, but getting difficult to keep track :)</p>

<p>Thanks for the steps. Step 1 I ran and was no change when trying afterwards. I then ran the .net cleanup utility (selected "All" as the removal category), rebooted and installed 3.5 SP1 of .Net from the link provided. I had tried this procedure before, but
 with installing 4.0 of .Net. I followed the steps suggested, but no luck - still getting same error.</p>

<p>Is Vista SP1 or SP2 installed?</p>
<p>Have you reinstalled McAfee Security Centre and is it working properly?</p>
<p>Did a McAfee or a Norton application come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it?</p>

<p>I am running Vista SP1. For SP2 I would have to fix this issue before I can upgrade I suppose.</p>
<p>I have removed McAfee Security Centre, which came with the computer, since I read somewhere it could cause problems. I don't believe any Norton application has ever been installed.</p>

[Looks like Sayed &amp; jayde have abandoned you. What's up with that?]</p>
<p>Please answer all of the following questions by number in your next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</p>
<p>2. When (approx. date) did you uninstall the preinstalled McAfee Security Centre (90-day? 12-month?) free-trial?</p>
<p>3. What anti-virus application is installed now and did you download/run the <a href="http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool</a> &amp; reboot before you installed it?</p>

<p>1) Around March 2008</p>
<p>2) About a week ago. It was a 36-month prepaid subscription version that came with the notebook.</p>
<p>3) Yes I did download and run that tool, then rebooted and tried Windows Update (same error as always). I then went ahead and installed AVG Free Edition.</p>
<p>I've also within the last week added "SuperAntiSpyware" and "Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware", but as said the problem has been occuring long before these products were added.</p>

<p>So you had another ~8 months left on the McAfee Security Centre subscription and you uninstalled it in hopes of fixing your problem.</p>
<p>Moving on...</p>
<p>1. <strong>Start | Control Panel | System and Maintenance</strong> (if using Classic view, skip this step) &nbsp;<strong>Programs &amp; Features | Installed Updates</strong>: What are the KB numbers &amp; corresponding Installation dates of the last three or four updates

<h3> th3ligh7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Zune software causes &#39;blank&#39; screen of death&#63;</h2>
                    For no reason, my computer started acting up. I have Windows 7x64 and it has been running fine up until this week. Every time I try to start Zune software by connecting my Zune or starting it by itself, my computer gets a blank screen of death, that is,
 a colored screen with nothing on it and I cannot do anything. Yes, it is simply a colored blank screen; I've gotten yellow, pale tan, and brown before, but the curious thing is that these register in the event logs as a BlueScreen. I assure you, the screen
 i got is not blue, nor did it have any words on it. <br />
<br />
I have both of the latest updates, the software and the firmware for my Zune.

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Restart the computer and press and hold F8 key (Press and hold f8 key before the windows logo). From the advanced boot option
 select ‘Safe mode’.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Skype screen sharing</h2>
                    Can you share screens using Skype free version or do you need Skype for Business?

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/4b902eb3-765f-4533-a077-79923d484bad" title="Marcelvan Oosterom">
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can share your screen with personal Skype. You just need to start a voice or video call with a single person or a group. If you are using Skype for Windows 10, tap or click the
<strong>more icon</strong> <strong>(...) </strong>in the call bar during a call, then choose
<strong>Share screen</strong>.&nbsp;See <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34680/how-do-i-share-my-screen-in-skype-for-windows-10?q=screen+sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How do I share my screen in Skype for Windows 10?</a></p>
