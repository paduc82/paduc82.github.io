    <title>Windows 10 DVD Disc &#47; ISO &#47; License Key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> esper wyrenth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 DVD Disc &#47; ISO &#47; License Key</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>While it's great that Microsoft is offering this upgrade for free, I have a number of questions about how to deploy this, both at home and at my workplace.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.)&nbsp; Will it be possible to order a DVD or download an ISO?</strong></p>
<p>I will need to be able to perform a clean install of this OS, as doing the "Install Windows 7, then upgrade to Windows 10" procedure consumes more time than I believe is strictly necessary (especially in an IT environment).&nbsp; I would like to simply be able
 to pop in a disc on each computer that needs a fresh install (say, for example, when a hard drive crashes or if I decide I just want to get rid of all the "bit rot" in the system and start fresh).&nbsp; I need to be able to do this well after the upgrade offer
 has expired, and wish to ensure that I will not suddenly be forced to buy Windows 10 or go back to Windows 7 if I reformat my hard drive 2 or 3 years after Windows 10 is released.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2.)&nbsp; Will we receive a separate License Key for Windows 10, or will it be the same as our Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1 License Key?</strong></p>
<p>This falls back to the fresh install question, as I'll need to know whether I need to write down a separate key once everything is ready, or if I can continue using my current key.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3.)&nbsp; If using the Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1 License Key, will there be a separate counter for Activations Remaining for Windows 10, or does it share activation count with the earlier OS?</strong></p>
<p>While this isn't a huge concern (since there are 50 activations to a key), it's still something I'd like to be made aware of.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4.)&nbsp; Does the Windows 10 Free Upgrade offer also apply to Volume Licensing solutions?</strong></p>
<p>I perform IT for a public library with computer terminals for our patrons to use, and will be upgrading all of these devices.&nbsp; When we bought Windows 7 for our aging Windows XP computers, we did so via TechSoup, and our License Keys and ISOs were provided
 from the Microsoft Volume Licensing Center.&nbsp; We have one "Master" key, plus additional Standard Keys (I forget their exact terms) linked to our account.&nbsp; Are these devices / licenses eligible for the free upgrade, or will we need to return to TechSoup to purchase
 the operating system for our public library again?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>5.)&nbsp; Can we install Windows 10 for free as a Dual Boot option?</strong></p>
<p>Some people may prefer to make sure that Windows 10 will run all of their software as expected once the final release is pushed for Windows 10.&nbsp; Can we create a separate partition for booting Windows 10 and leave our existing Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1 installation
 intact?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>6.)&nbsp; Can we choose to upgrade later, but receive the upgraded license now?</strong></p>
<p>Some people might have their computers working how they want or need them to work with their current OS, and won't be ready to "rock the boat" with a new OS for years down the line.&nbsp; Can we reserve our upgrade / Windows 10 License Key now, but wait until
 after the upgrade period expires to use it?&nbsp; Or do we have to both Reserve it AND Use it in order for it to be permanently applied as free?&nbsp; To clarify:&nbsp; This scenario has a Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1 user receive the free License Key for Windows 10, but wait to
 install it until over 1 year later, after the upgrade offer has expired.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>The primary reasons for wanting to wait, but still needing the free License Key</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong>Large amounts of data to migrate </strong>from the OS hard drive to a backup solution,
<strong>Waiting to ensure their work software is compatible</strong> with Windows 10,
<strong>Waiting to ensure their hardware is compatible</strong> with Windows 10, <strong>
Waiting until their work software has been upgraded</strong> to be compatible with Windows 10,
<strong>Waiting until they can purchase hardware</strong> to make their current PC compatible with Windows 10; in all cases, presume either a<strong> low-income family</strong> that cannot afford to buy the upgrade, or a
<strong>non-profit organization</strong> that does not have funds budgeted for purchasing upgrades and for one of the aforementioned reasons must wait over 1 year before the funds are available or must wait until after the free upgrade offer has expired for
<strong>grant money to become available</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time.</p>

            <p>1.)&nbsp; Will it be possible to order a DVD or download an ISO?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I </strong><strong>multiple computers, do have to download Windows 10 on each computer?
</strong></p>
<p>You can download a .ISO file and upgrade each computer offline. The ISO should be available by the time Windows 10 launches.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-upgrade-from-previous-versions-of-windows/31722b30-1da9-42bb-b331-0edc4649bf43" title="As we approach the launch of Windows 10 this summer, hundreds of millions of existing Windows users will be taking advantage the opportunity to upgrade their current version to Windows 10 for free. This represents an unprecedented change in Microsoft's business model of requiring purchase of a license. Windows 10 will be offered two ways to existing Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1 users. You will be able to download the update through Windows Update or you can download .ISO media and use it do an in place upgrade. For many persons, using ISO media will be the preferred method since you will have a backup copy for reinstall purposes if needed. Also for persons with limited bandwidth, this will be an excellent way avoid the need to download the update more than once if you have multiple computers. So lets take a look at upgrading 
 to: upgrade from previous versions of Windows using Windows 10 ISO file</span></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Please note, you might have to download the appropriate edition Windows 10 for the version/edition of Windows you are upgrading. If you upgrade to the wrong edition, ie. Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 Pro, you will have to purchase a license for
 Windows 10 Pro or rollback Windows 7 Home Premium and upgrade to Windows 10 Home.

 are the editions of Windows 10 available?</span></a></em> </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2.)&nbsp; Will we receive a separate License Key for Windows 10, or will it be the same as our Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1 License Key?</p>
<p><strong>By default, Windows 10 builds are pre-keyed, meaning, you do not have to enter a product key and should not be prompted to enter one even after Windows 10 has completed setup.</strong></p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Retrieve your product key:</p>

<span>
<p>Designed for users of Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10, our embedded product key tool will retrieve and display the Windows setup product key embedded in the BIOS or EFI, allowing you to store it for safe-keeping or use it to reinstall Windows with an
 official Windows setup image.</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>3.)&nbsp; If using the Windows 7 / 8 / 8.1 License Key, will there be a separate counter for Activations Remaining for Windows 10, or does it share activation count with the earlier OS?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You can rearm it up to 5 times. After the 5th reinstall, reactivation by telephone might be required:</strong></p>

</p>
<p>4.)&nbsp; Does the Windows 10 Free Upgrade offer also apply to Volume Licensing solutions?</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Volume License customers running Windows 7 Enterprise or Windows 8/8.1 Enterprise or volume license editions of Windows 7 Professional or Windows 8/8.1 Pro do not qualify for this offer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How will I know when Windows 10 is available?<br />
</strong>Between now and launch, the following KB update (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3035583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3035583</span></a>)&nbsp; should be installed on your Windows 7/8.1
 computer. Volume License customers will not receive this update because of&nbsp;IT requirements in managed environments. If its not already installed, open Windows Update and check for Updates.</p>
<p>5.)&nbsp; Can we install Windows 10 for free as a Dual Boot option?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will I have the option of choose a different drive or partition where I want the upgrade installed?</strong></p>
<p>No, it will require that you are running a previous qualifying version and start the upgrade from within the qualifying version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.)&nbsp; Can we choose to upgrade later, but receive the upgraded license now?</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4df98526-5fef-4515-aa8f-4b79dce4e521" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>Get Windows 10</strong> app will provide with a tutorial of how the reservation works.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Reserver yoru FREE upgrade to Windows 10 now. It will download* once available, and you can cancel your reservation at any time.

<p>Have not recieved an update since 3/15/2009, don't know if one has been put out since then but after that update whenever I turn my computer on, after so long an icon appears on the taskbar saying windows can not cant check for updates click here. Auto update
 is on and have went in to windows update to have it manually check for updates but will not connect says need to install&nbsp;a windowns update for windows update. I click the install now and the defender pops up asking if its ok to do it, click yes then after
 some time it goes back to the beginning of it all or sometimes gives me this error code</p>

</p><p>This issue occurs when there are broken&nbsp; components on the boot configuration data of your system. To troubleshoot your boot loop issue, we suggest that you boot in safe mode through the Windows Recovery Environment option. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Turn on your computer. When the Windows logo appears, unplug and replug the device. Perform these steps three times.</li><li>On the fourth instance, turn on your device without unplugging it. The Windows Recovery Environment window will appear.<br />
</li><li>On the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Choose an option</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>screen, click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Advance</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>options</strong>.</li><li>Click Startup<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Restart</strong>.</li><li>Once your computer restarts, you will see a list of options. Press the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>F4</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>key</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>to start your computer in<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>safe</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>mode</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, we suggest that you perform a system restore after booting in safe mode. System Restore will be able to revert your PC or laptop to their previous state, which can be used to repair and recover system malfunctions or issues. Restoring won’t affect
 your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Right-click the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>button</strong>, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Control</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Panel</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Search<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Control</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Panel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>for<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Recovery</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Recovery</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Open</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>System</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Restore</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Next</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Choose the restore point related to the problematic<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>app</strong>,<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>driver</strong>, or<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>update</strong>, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Next</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Finish</strong>.</p>
<p>

<p>Since the issue persists, we recommend that you restore or reset your device using a USB recovery drive. Your Surface comes with a Windows recovery info that will allow you to refresh it or reset it to its factory condition. This
 is stored in a dedicated recovery partition on your device. If in case that the recovery info has been removed, you can use a USB recovery drive to access the recovery tool. To do this, kindly click on this

    <title>Windows 10 Links Toolbar...File Download Security Warning - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spaz2.3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Links Toolbar...File Download Security Warning</h2>
                    <p>After that last Windows 10 Update...suddenly my web page links in the Links Toolbar are all triggering the File Download - Security Warning window.&nbsp; Anybody else running into this?&nbsp; I've spent an hour searching online for a solution...but no luck.&nbsp; These
 are simply .url files for various web sites (Amazon, banks, news, etc) that I keep&nbsp;on the Toolbar for convenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

</p><p>[<em>We could normally ask a moderator to merge them into a single thread for us but, having read each thread, I think that a combined thread would be too convoluted so we are better off as we are</em>]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for info, I do not have any of the updates that are currently being seen [in the threads] as the potential sources of this problem so the fault seems to lie somewhere else.&nbsp; I first saw the fault today on my Windows 10 Home x64 &amp; my Windows 10 Pro x86.&nbsp;
 I sometimes open urls from folders and sometimes from within IE so I cannot be sure just when my computers were afflicted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One user has reported that urls opened from the Desktop do not exhibit the security warning.&nbsp; Mine play up wherever they are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a recent system image [11 September 2016] but I am going to hold off restoring that until we find a common factor so that my image restoration can be of mutual benefit by testing that common factor.&nbsp; Hopefully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround you have applied will need to be repeated for any new urls you make.&nbsp; I can confirm that the workaround can be applied to entire drives.&nbsp; I ran it in the root of both my data drives and their existing urls behave themselves now [but new ones
 do not].</p>

    <title>Missing Remote FX USB Redirection Support Surface RT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mateoanglacious  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Remote FX USB Redirection Support Surface RT</h2>
                    <div><b>Backend Setup:</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows 2012 Hyper V Hosts with RemoteFX configured and Graphics shared to&nbsp;</div>
<div>hyper v children VDI's and RDS servers across the hosts</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is a known good and running configuration that works with Remote FX Clients including&nbsp;</div>
<div>Windows 8</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>My attempts at Surface RT configuration:</b></div>
<div>Local GPO set to allow RemoteFX USB direction</div>
<div>Attempted manually adding Device Class ID's to the Registry</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Remote FX is forwarding DirectX Applications from the servers</div>
<div>My Demo: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-AUZne9M5c&amp;feature=g-upl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
RemoteFX Demo on RT</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/X-AUZne9M5c?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/X-AUZne9M5c?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Problem:</b></div>
While testing with the Surface RT I've found it is not forwarding RemoteFX USB
<div>devices cameras, controllers, etc</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Again these same devices will forward across on other clients ( ThinPC, Win8, Win7 )</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm guessing the problem resides with the Surface RT device as it is refusing to show the</div>
<div>devices for forwarding regardless of the tricks i try.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there planned support for RemoteFX USB on the RT or is it disabled for some reason</div>
<div>that im not undestanding?</div>
                </div>

            Hi JinSitu
<br />
<br />The minidump file indicates the system crashes are caused by 360Hvm64.sys
<br />
<br />This is a really rare virtual device driver, are you using a 3rd party Anti Virus by Qihoo 360 Software?
<br />
<br />If so, you should check to see if any patches are available for that software, if not, uninstall that software and check if your system becomes stable  . . .

<h2>            Windows 7 cannot detect Wifi &#40;drivers&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    I have a laptop with Ubuntu 12.04, I wanted my Win7 back (messed up by an error)
<div>I downloaded the Home Premium ISO from digital river, and used the Ubuntu Disk Burner to burn files on my 4GB DVD. Then I used GPARTED to make a 25GB Partition for Win7, Booted from the DVD and installed Windows.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Then I had to reinstall GNU GRUB (since Win7 replaces GRUB).&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now that everything was done I booted Win7 and I was able to get to the desktop, &nbsp;But the problem was Win7 didn't install network or Video Drivers (since it couldn't run GTAIV), When I click the network icon it shows nothing except trouble shoot network
 options which says drivers not supported...</div>
<div>How am I supposed to download and install drivers when I am not<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<div>&nbsp;even connected to the Internet?&nbsp;</div>
<div>NOTE: I can easily browse internet through Ubuntu.... So my NIC and WiFi are perfect. Also the laptop is Lenovo Ideapad Z580.</div>

            Thank you very much! Windows is now running perfectly fine! Hats off to you. Thanks again.
<div>BTW I have a question..</div>
<div>Do I have to Install these drivers every time I perform a Windows Install? I think it's a problem with the install disk I created. Cause I had bought a Win7 Home Premium Disc, and it installed without these driver issues (But sadly the disc stopped working
 because of a huge scratch on it) and so I had to make a new one.</div>
<div>My question is, is there a way to make the install disc automatically install the required drivers?&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Yes, you would.&nbsp; Windows install DVD have a limited list of drivers, usually at the time the DVD was create.&nbsp; Not possible to always have the latest drivers available to be added to the install disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can search the Internet and find people who made "utilities" or step by step guide on how to create a new install DVD with "your" computer's required drivers.</p>

<h3> chani179  say:</h3>
<h2>            Facing Blue Screen of Death</h2>
                    <p>I'm facing blue screen of death from quite a long time. It happens randomly. I posted about it on this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/facing-blue-screen-of-death/b3af5392-86f9-42f4-a6b6-62acb3ba4126?tm=1528026487146">
link</a>.&nbsp;The solution recommended there helped me to fix the problem for some time but now this issue is resurfacing and its instances are increasing in number. Please find screenshots attached.</p>
<p>I raised the same issue as a reply to the thread in the above mentioned <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/facing-blue-screen-of-death/b3af5392-86f9-42f4-a6b6-62acb3ba4126?tm=1528026487146">
link</a>, but no one replied this time. So I thought it would be better to start a new post instead.</p>
<p>Please help me with this!</p>
<p>PS: I'm sorry for the inverted image. The image is upright on my laptop but it gets inverted when it is uploaded. I tried rotating it but it didn't worked.</p>

            Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:

<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.

<p>I don't have any such application installed. One thing that I noticed after the blue screen of death was that some data from my browser (Edge) was also deleted. Like my saved passwords. I had to enter all the passwords again. Also, my frequently visited
 sites were not there after this event.</p>

            That behavior might be normal after a blue screen error.
<br />
<br />Can you provide the following information which may help determine any issue(s): 
<br />
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; type msinfo32 in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; File &gt; Save &gt; then save as an .nfo file 
<br />
<br />Then make the resulting .nfo file available via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site. 
<br />
<br />Also, can you do the following: 
<br />
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; type eventvwr in the "Open" box &gt; OK &gt; expand "Custom Views" and then right-click "Administrative Events" &gt; select "Save all events in Custom View As" and save as an .evtx file

<p>No. I wasn't using any of these. In fact, I was not even using the bluetooth at all. It was turned off as far as I remember.</p>
<p>I don't use bluetooth much. I use it occasionally to transfer files from my phone to the laptop. That's it. After that I would turn it off.</p>

<p>Last time I had problems with the same driver. It was causing the BSoD. So, I had to downgrade it to current version.</p>
<p>One thing I would like to inform you here is that I faced BSoD today also. You can find the dump file on the following link.</p>

    <title>Need biometric device driver for Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tim924f  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need biometric device driver for Windows 10</h2>
                    I stupidly deleted the Biometric device driver and now, of course, the Windows sign-in options tells me that Windows Hello is not available on this computer. I've tried rebooting which didn't help. The Device Manager doesn't show any Biometric heading,
 which it did before I deleted the driver. I tried selecting "Display Hidden Devices" in the Device Manager, but nothing appears. I've gone to Settings-&gt;Update but nothing is available. So, where can I get a Biometric device driver for my Windows 10 Home Edition
 version 1809, and get it reinstalled?

            I was able to create another account with administrator designation, but the 'vacant' admin account, I was unable to delete because I would need to access the e-mail. &nbsp;..... But that is okay with me if all is fine, as long as I can access my computer.

<h3> chrischarette  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype in the taskbar disappears after some predetermined time</h2>
                    <p>I don't know what the purpose is of Skype disappearing from the taskbar after some preset time span but having it go away seems to also affect its ability to respond to an incoming call. Many times I've had to call someone back because there was ringing
 but no option to pick up the call. This is presumably because after disappearing from the taskbar much of the app itself seems to go to sleep. Nothing more annoying than an incoming call with no buttons to answer the call with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no power saving features enabled except screen blanking. All my other active apps continue to show up even if I don't use them for days but Skype likes to go away on its own. This seems to happen whether Skype is minimized..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot find a setting that prevents this nor enables it in the first place.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My apologies...I see now that I was not very clear in my original message about it's appearance on the taskbar. I have the icon pinned to the taskbar so it's always there, but the icon shows up with a line under it when it's logged in and active. What was
 occurring is that the line under the icon would go away indicating (presumably) that it logged itself out. That's what I'm concerned about, the indication that Skype logs itself out when idle for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I minimize Skype, it continues to show in the taskbar with the line under it indicating that it's active, but a few hours later I would notice that the line was missing so I'd click the icon to start Skype. It's possible that it's just the interface
 closing because I don't have to log in each time, but it shows the interface launching as if it's just starting up rather than already open and just maximizing. And, there's the added issue that I don't always get a button to answer a call that could be related.<br />
</p>
<p>If the notification area setting works to keep Skype logged in <em>and </em>the indication that it's logged in remains, that's great. I'll leave it for now and see if that improves things. I'll check back in when something changes.</p>

            This is an issue I can also confirm. 
<br />
<br />Do you have Skype configured to run in the background?
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps
<br />Scroll down and make sure Skype is toggled on
<br />
<br />I do see the issue where, you will minimize or leave Skype idle for a while then when you restore its signing you in again.

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />If you're talking about Skype for Business you need access to a tenant Global Admin, then go to groups in the Office 365 admin center, remove the group admin and add a new one.
<br />
<br />If you don't have access to the global admin create a ticket from the portal and they will help you trough.
<br />
<br />Regards.

<p>As I stated in my orginal post, "The admin of a group chat that I belong to has left the company, but is still showing as the admin of the group. There is no current active admin"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The person who created the group is no longer with us. He never left the group, so it shows that he is the admin still, but I want to take over as the admin.&nbsp; I don't have any way to contact him to get him to change the roles. Is there away to do this with
 out him?</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Verbindungsabbr&#38;&#35;252&#59;che</h2>
                    
<p>Hallo zusammen,</p>

<p>ich hätte da mal ein Problem. Ich verliere bei Onlinespielen wie World of Tanks in unregelmässigen Abständen die Verbindung zum Server und fliege auch gleichzeitig aus dem Partychat. Mal gehts 20 Minuten, mal ne Stunde bis zum nächsten Rauswurf. Von Xbox
 Live werde ich nicht getrennt und auch die Kacheln etc. sind da.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ist irgendwie immer nur eine kurze Unterbrechung von ein paar Sekunden.</p>
<p>Battlefield 4 dagegen läuft Problemlos den ganzen Abend, höchstens mal ein kleines Lag.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ich hab alle Ports offen und auch die Nat steht auf offen. Verbindungstest sind immer alle in Ordnung mit ca. 50 Down und 12 Up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anbieter ist Kabel Deutschland mit einer Fritzbox. Die Rechner die am gleichen Netz hängen haben keine Probleme und alle Streams, Games laufen hier einwandfrei.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Auch Netflix und Prime laufen den ganzen Abend problemlos. IPV6 habe ich nicht - kann man also ausschließen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verbunden ist die Xbox mit Land Kabel und auch ein anderes Kabel wurde schon getestet - gleiches Problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hat jemand eine Idee was man noch machen könnte?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Daran hab ich auch schon gedacht - aber das erklärt nicht warum ich dann auch aus der Party fliege.
</p>
<p>ich denke das World of Tanks nur empfindlicher reagiert bei Problemen als z.B. Battlefield.

<p>Bei der Xbox One ist das Partysystem ein anderes als auf der 360. Bei der 360 war der Partychat immer komplett unabhängig vom Spiel eine eigene Peer to Peer Verbindung,
</p>
<p>Nun macht ein Multiplayerspiel automatisch eine Party auf, und fügt alle Teilnehmer in der Spielsitzung zur Party dazu, wenn nicht schon eine Private andere Party besteht.
</p>
<p>World of Tanks hat auch eigene Server, genauso wie die meisten EA Spiele wie Battlefield ihre eigenen EA Server haben. Daher ist laut Deiner Schilderung ziemlich offensichtlich, dass Deine eigene Konfiguration mit offenen Ports und allem Drum und Dran korrekt
 ist, und auch sonst funktioniert. </p>
<p>Dass die Abbrüche dann bei WoT auftreten liegt dann an deren Servern oder am Spiel.
</p>
<p>Du müsstest Dich also mal beim Wargaming.net support melden. Mit Xbox Live hat dann dieses Problem nichts zu tun.

<p>Da man hier ja fast immer nur Probleme liest aber selten eine Problemlösung wenn es wieder funktioniert hat - tu ich das mal! :-)
</p>
<p>Also an den WoT Servern lag es nicht da es auch bei The Crew und BF4 etc. auftrat.</p>
<p>Ich habe hier zum Glück mehrere Internetleitungen und konnte ausgiebig testen.
</p>
<p>Mit meiner 200k Kabel Deutschland Leitung auf der Dual Stack läuft (also eine reine IPV6 und eine reine IPV4) in Verbindung mit einer FritzBox 4990 bekomm ich die Xbox nicht mehr zum laufen. Ich habe nur noch Lags ohne Ende. Nat war offen, Ports waren offen,
 UPNP an und aus, als DMZ eingerichtet etc.) </p>
<p>Mit der normalen 50k Kabel Deutschland Leitung ist zocken garnicht mehr drin dank Dual Stack lite - ohne Umstellung seitens KD keine Möglichkeit mehr zu zocken.
</p>
<p>Bin jetzt auf die gute alte Telekom DSL 12k Leitung zurück und siehe da - Ports auf und die Xbox läuft wieder wie eine Eins. Keine Lags, keine Abbrüche - wunderbar.
</p>
<p>Im Vodafone / Kabel Deutschland Forum gibt es mittlerweile an die hundert Einträge zu Problemen mit Lags und Abbrüchen mit der Xbox und anderen Systemen - aber es scheint fast überall nicht mehr wirklich zu klappen.
</p>
<p>Trotzdem Danke für Deine Hilfe ArminatorX </p>

    <title>Speech Recognition could not start because the language configuration - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> freekschoenmakers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Speech Recognition could not start because the language configuration is not supported.</h2>
                    <p>So I've been trying to get Cortana to work on my Windows 10 PC. However, even after setting all languages and regions to English (US), the speech recognition software refuses to launch.</p>
<p>A lot of solutions said that you have to go to Control Panel -&gt; Speech Recognition -&gt; Advanced Settings, but the Advanced Settings link is missing. I only have Control Panel Home and Text to Speech listed.</p>
<p>I've tried running ctfmon and adding it to the registry, but that does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to get this mysterious Advanced Settings link visible?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, this also did not help. The command ran successfully, showing that both the restore operation and the operation completed successfully. However, the issue remains exactly as it was before. I've included a screenshot of the speech recognition
 settings page in the control panel, maybe it helps illustrate my problem.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e2237436-0d24-4832-ab11-4f251e05d1ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e2237436-0d24-4832-ab11-4f251e05d1ac" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>QUICK EDIT: My PC just bluescreened (THREAD_STUCK_IN_DRIVER). Not sure if it's related or not, but if it happens again I will be restoring to the restore point made by DISM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT 2: My PC has not since bluescreened, so I think it was just a one-off.</p>

            <p>Update: I may have discovered something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So all system settings are set to US English, however if I click on one of the question mark boxes (for example the one in the top right of the speec recognitions settings window) the browser automatically searches for a question in Dutch, not US English.
 Apparently, there is some mysterious extra setting that sets just this part of Windows to Dutch. Any idea where that may be located? I think it may be causing my problem here.</p>
