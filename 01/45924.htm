<h2>            BFE will not start and is not found.</h2>
                    <p>I am having issues with BFE services.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I‚Äôve read many post and tried just about everything except for ‚ÄúRestore to Factory Settings‚Äù.</p>
<p>Here is how I discovered the issue with BFE.</p>
<p>Live updates for Semantic End Point are not installing.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Downloading the files is fine, but it fails to update with the new definitions.</p>
<p>I decided to uninstall Semantic End Point to get a fresh install of End Point.</p>
<p>The process failed because BFE service was not running.<span>&nbsp; </span>I did some searching and discovered BFE to be the Windows Firewall.</p>
<p>I opened MS Services but did not find BFE listed as a service, however I did find BFE.dll in C:Windows\System32</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran ‚ÄúFixit‚Äù from Microsoft site:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/mats/windows_firewall_diagnostic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/mats/windows_firewall_diagnostic</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It failed because it detected Semantic End Point services running.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
This was puzzling as I uninstalled Semantic and deleted all semantic entries from the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to look back into the registry to discover there was no entry for BFE.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I manually created the BFE registry entry.<span>&nbsp; </span>I used the same names, types and values from another Windows 7 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really thought this was going to do the trick.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The service does not start automatically, so when I try to start it from the Services Window it fails with error:</p>
<p>Service BFE will not start, Error 2 ‚Äì The system cannot find the find the specified file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I messed with the permission, added everyone and grant all, etc.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I exhausted the options described in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am posting just in case someone has a suggestion before I start the restore process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            please help&#33; got blue screen &#40;BSOD&#41; suddenly in xp</h2>
                    
<p>i am using xp with sp3 installed on dell vostro220, with 2gb ram x2 (totally 4gb), and<strong> blue screen (BSOD)</strong> appears with no sign for lots of times, the following are the details of the problems and they ways i have tried, please help!</p>
<p><strong>1. ram</strong> <br />
i suspect it was ram problems, and tried unplug one of them and use the desktop as normal, but i still got BSOD</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ram A:</span> <br />
BCCode : 10000050&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BCP1 : BAD0B148&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BCP2 : 00000000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BCP3 : 805BB442<br />
BCP4 : 00000002&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OSVer : 5_1_2600&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SP : 3_0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Product : 256_1<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ram B:</span> <br />
BCCode : c2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BCP1 : 00000007&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BCP2 : 00000CD4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BCP3 : 02060002&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
BCP4 : 889301F8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OSVer : 5_1_2600&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SP : 3_0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Product : 256_1<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ram A+B:</span> <br />
the error code maybe ram A, or ram B, and sometimes like this:<br />
BCCode : 10000050&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BCP1 : BAD0B148&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BCP2 : 00000000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BCP3 : 805BB442<br />
BCP4 : 00000002&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OSVer : 5_1_2600&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SP : 3_0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Product : 256_1<br />
<br />
i <strong>tried both memtest86 and Windows Memory Diagnostic</strong> to test the ram one by one, and even test them together, all for overnight, all combination<strong>results "PASS"</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. driver</strong> <br />
i tried 2 software to locate the problems<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">an error is caught when testing with Dell Crash Analysis Tool</span><br />
Category: Application Drivers<br />
Driver: vsdatant.sys<br />
Manufacturer: Zone Labs, Inc<br />
Version: No Version Information Available<br />
<br />
i have no idea whether it is the source of problems, i google it, the error code with 'vsdatant.sys' problem from the others arent those i saw on my desktop, should i make a clean uninstall on the zonealarm firewall?<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">verifier.exe</span> <br />
it shows me this<br />
BCCode : c4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BCP1 : 00000081&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BCP2 : 893D4870&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BCP3 : 0000008A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
BCP4 : 00000000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OSVer : 5_1_2600&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SP : 3_0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Product : 256_1<br />
<br />
although the error code is the same, it is triggered from different driver test combination...</p>
<ul>
<li>i try testing all the driver and results with no error, desktop boots up as normal</li><li>test on all non microsoft drivers, it is fine </li><li>test some of the non microsoft driver together (2 to 4 drivers at a time), sometimes, it shows me BSOD with the above error code, sometimes boot up normally</li><li>an then i test the non microsoft driver one by one, similar to above, sometimes BSOD, sometimes not</li></ul>
<p><br />
should i trust the result or it is similar to the ram test (even all pass, but still have possible problems on it)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. overheat</strong> <br />
it shows BSOD with no sign, sometimes, BSOD after using a half day, sometimes after leaving it on overnight (more often), sometimes, just after it boot up in xp (off for long long time before), should i rule out overheat?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>let me summarize the above, i got <strong>3 error code (10000050, c2, c4)</strong> , and the<strong>results vary from different tests</strong> .<br />
<br />
i am confused with the problems and could anyone advise me what action i should take to fix it? should i reinstall xp? or reinstall all drivers? or simply uninstall zonealarm firewall? any software/hardware problem should i rule out?<br />
<br />
the desktop was pre-installed with vista and 1gb ram x2 from factory, it works fine<br />
later, i pluged 2gb ram x2 to replace those 1gb ram, it works fine<br />
after some while, vista was replaced by xp and looks fine at first, but later it has more and more BSOD, and now it comes 1 or 2 times everyday<br />
<br />
i lose all unsave work because of BSOD and always dont know what would happen on it in the next second!<br />
<br />
please help and thankyou very very very much!!!</p>

<h2>            2 x Games&#58; 1&#41; Sniper Ghost Warrior, 2&#41; Call of Duty4 Modern Warfare - Don&#39;t Play on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi, when I purchased my Acer Aspire V3-571G laptop computer, it came with Windows 7 pre-installed. I purchased two games being:</p>
<p>1) Sniper Ghost Warrior, 2) Call of Duty4 Modern Warfare and never had a problem playing them. However, since I upgraded to Windows 10 they no longer work. Is there a solution to this - apart from buy new updated games? Thank you. Regards 1Convict</p>

            Hi 1Convict, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />Those games are over 10 years old, which is most likely why the latest version of Windows 10 doesn't support them anymore.
<br />
<br />You could try compatibility mode, which might help them run correctly:
<br />
<br />- Right-click on the program, and then select Properties.
<br />- Go to the Compatibility tab.
<br />- Check the box for Run this program in compatibility mode for.
<br />- Click the drop-down menu, and then select older versions of Windows. Whichever works.
<br />- Click Apply, and then OK.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work, the only other option I could suggest would be running a virtual machine with an older version of Windows. It's a complicated process, so let me know if you'd like more information about it.
<br />
<br />Thanks!

<p>I don't have Sniper GW 2, but COD4-Modern Warfare runs well on Win10, and I have no doubt Sniper does to as it was released in 2013.</p>
<p>Do the games load the splash screens and setup options, and fail to load the game play, or are they doing nothing ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rarely find it necessary to use a Compatibility setting, and COD4 is no exception.</p>
<p>What versions of the game are you using, disc based or download from Steam, or another on line game retailer ?</p>
<p>Some games from Steam require you to run Steams '<em>Verify Integrity of Game Files</em>' after upgrading to Win10 and after
</p>
<p>the bi-annual Win10 version updates.</p>
<p>If you are using the disc based version patching it may help. COD4-MW has about five patches. I don't recall if any of them are cumulative.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The vast majority of games, going back at least as far as 2004, are compatible with Win10, but there are a few issues with</p>
<p>disc based games regarding DRM that you do not get with games from Steam, etc .</p>
<p>Most disc based games that have issues with DRM will run well on Win10 if you use a noCD fix\hack.</p>
<p>I have more details in my post at&nbsp; <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/login-as-administrator-warning/56cf28ad-c7e5-432f-89ab-d22e08a06544">
---this thread---</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Have you downloaded and installed any dedicated Win10 drivers since 'upgrading' to Win10 ?</p>
<p>Use any dedicated Win10 drivers Acer has available for your machine on their driver download page . Particularly for
</p>
<p>the graphics and audio. You may also need to do a BIOS update, if one is available.</p>
<p>Because laptop mfg's tend to drop driver support earlier than Nvidia\AMD do for desktop graphics, a Win10 graphics driver</p>
<p>may be you biggest issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are no drivers available from Acer (likely not) the next best option for the Nvidia graphics driver would be....</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NVIDIA Driver Downloads - Advanced Search</a></p>
<p>However, the driver from Nvidia is not guaranteed stable on your machine.</p>

<p>Changing the language is not what you need to do. Go to Control Panel<br />
| Region and Language. Click the Keyboards and Languages tab, then<br />
Change Keyboards. Pick the correct keyboard (US or UK).</p>

<h2>            &#40;0x81000035&#41; Error When Attempting to Restore Backup to Another PC from Removable Media</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>The hard disk on my laptop recently failed.&nbsp; Fortunately I have a recent backup on SD card and a netbook on which to&nbsp;restore my data whilst my laptop is being&nbsp;repaired.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, whilst I can access my data by manually sifting through the compressed files on the SD card, I haven't been able to perform a full restore.&nbsp; When I attempt the restore on my netbook, I get an error message:</p>
<p>"Restore encountered a problem while verifying the backup device:</p>
<p>D:\</p>
<p>The following information might help you resolve your problem:</p>
<p>Windows Backup encoutered invalid MediaID.bin file on the drive where the backup is saved... (0x81000035"</p>
<p>Manually restoring the files is not an option as I have hundreds of files and it would take an unacceptable length of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've followed the advice on the forums to fix the restore,&nbsp;having changed the system name of my netbook to that of my laptop, but to no avail - I receive the same error message.&nbsp; I've also downloaded the sdutil file and&nbsp;executed it in accordance with the&nbsp;instructions,
 but during the "verifying media data..." stage an error appears:</p>
<p>"Cannot generate the mediaid file for a removable media using the global catalog. Use the local one instead."</p>
<p>Am I doing something wrong? Can anyone help me to restore my files?</p>
<p>Thanks for reading,</p>
<p>Zeke</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It seems that MediaID.bin file is invalid, it can be missing or corrupt. I would like to suggest:</div>
<div><br />
1. Manually create another Backup and copy the MediaID.bin file to the old backup file, and see if you can restore from it.</div>
<div><br />
2. Manually restore files backed up by unzipping it, please visit the following guide:</div>
<div><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/970914" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to Manually Restore Files Backed Up Using Windows Backup</span></a></span></div>

                    <p>I am getting several unexpected 'Restart to repair drive errors'.</p>
<p>In the Windows Log, I can see corresponding Event 98 ('Volume Recovery (\Device\HarddiskVolume11) needs to be taken offline to perform a Full Chkdsk.')</p>
<br />
<p>The errors occur while working with a Local Account ('user' privileges), and there is a SUBSTituted drive used; however, the drive containing the subst'ed directory is perfectly sane (chkdsk = no errors); same for all drives on the PC.</p>
<p>The catch is, when I run diskpart / list volumes, there is nothing listed as Volume 11 on this system ! WTH ????</p>
<p>
<br />
</p><p>Where is this volume 11 ????</p>

            Hello BarbaraDickson1 - 
<br />
<br />You're in luck. It's very simple to access your pictures and use them as a screensaver in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Go to all settings.
<br />Select personalization.
<br />Click on lock screen.
<br />Under background select slideshow and
<br />Choose album for your slideshow
<br />Select the folder which includes your photos. 
<br />
<br />That should get you setup to do what you wanted to do. If not, please let me know and I'll be happy to assist you further.       
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>We develop a windows-based software and deploy it through ClickOnce for our customers. It works fine for all OS (Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8)
<strong>excepts on computers having Windows 10,</strong> if we run software through
<strong>ClickOnce program</strong>, we always see at least 10 messages popping up when starting the program with the same content:</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Windows Defender KB2267602</h2>
                    <p>Original Title : barry_772<br />
<br />
In windows 10 updates all the updates are working fine except one and that one is [ definition update for windows defender KB2267602 definition 1.211.2403.0 error 0x80240017] it downloads but will not install I do not want this update as windows defender is
 turned off because I use Kaspersky security.</p>
<p>How can I update manually and delete the updates I do not want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also if I download a pdf in internet explorer above the task bar it shows a bar with [open, save, view download] seeing as I do not want to keep the download I click open and when finished it does not save the download.</p>
<p>In the edge browser&nbsp;if I click open it saves the pdf that I do not want and I have to go into my folder and delete it manually. it does not matter how you go about it still saves&nbsp;the pdf. To me that is not a&nbsp;better system than windows 7
</p>
<p>it is going backwards.</p>
<p>thank you Barry.</p>

<h3> kuodo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 1809&#58; Right-click &#34;New&#34; lags and sometimes causes Windows Explorer to Reset. Windows Lag after.</h2>
                    <p>Endless Windows 10 1809 issues. Now after fixing the Network issue activating SMB 1.0(temporary fix until they fixed it in the next patch) after formatting countless time, and installed everything I need, just before I could back up and clone an image, I
 noticed my right-click "New" takes very long to load. And it sometimes causes my Windows Explorer to crash and reset. After which the whole Windows will be extremely laggy. I am running on SSD, it should not be that slow. Also, this is the first time I encountered
 it.<br />
<br />
I have tried the following suggested solutions and none of which works:<br />
-ran DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth<br />
-ran sfc /scannow<br />
-ran Windows installation Media Creation tool upgrade<br />
-deactivate every third party app that has influence over Context Menu, using ShellExView</p>
<p>-Deleted and re-created "New" under regedit.msc HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\Background\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers\New<br />
Modify {D969A300-E7FF-11d0-A93B-00A0C90F2719}<br />
<br />
I really don't see why it is so difficult for me to get a working Windows back to what it was? Please don't tell me to clean install AGAIN. It is as clean as it can be. I don't want to keep formatting my SSD and reduce its lifespan.</p>

<h2>            Can anyone help me understand the story.</h2>
                    
<p>So i just beat Dead Space 1 and will likely be getting #2 soon but din't fully understand the story. I watched a video and they said the the marker was originally in mexico and a man was basically able to copy it. I don't understand what the marker does
 and how it creates the necrmromorphs. If their was one on america what was it doing and why wasn't their necromorphs on america. How did the second one end up on ageis 7. Does the marker make people go crazy and worship it or were the people on the ship actually
 a church. Sorry but i basically didn't understand any of the story which never happens to me but i'd like to before i play dead space 2 thanks</p>

<p><strong>So i just beat Dead Space 1 and will likely be getting #2 soon but din't fully understand the story.&nbsp; I watched a video and they said the the marker was originally in mexico and a man was basically able to copy it.&nbsp; If their was one on america what
 was it doing and why wasn't their necromorphs on america.</strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">

I just started reading the book (1 out of 3) <em>Dead Space Martyr.&nbsp;</em> It takes place about 200 years before the first game.&nbsp; In it, they find the
<a href="http://deadspace.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Marker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
 that may have caused the mass extinction of the dinosaurs approximately 65 million years ago. The existence of the Black Marker had been known to the locals that lived near its resting place for generations, but was never spoken about to outsiders and was
 referred to as the "The Tail of the Devil." The locals tend to cross their index and middle fingers when speaking of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
The Black Marker's influence is similar to the Red Marker's. It was revealed in <i>
<a href="http://deadspace.wikia.com/wiki/Dead_Space:_Martyr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Dead Space: Martyr</span></a></i> that there is a different force surrounding the Black Marker than just the ability to cause madness in humans.
 Altman thought that there was something in the human mind that caused the hallucinations - a kind of defense mechanism that is activated in the human brain when in the Marker's presence. Altman was not immune, but he was able to resist the madness caused by
 it. It is possible that in all of these cases, there are actually two forces working on people's minds; this is shown when many people in
<i>Dead Space: Martyr</i> claim to hear two voices. One of these voices tell the people to kill themselves, while the other appears to be trying to protect people from the Necromorphs by telling them to run, or in the case of Isaac and the Red Marker, manipulating
 them to help the Marker stop the Necromorphs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">The symbols on both of the Markers apparently represent DNA, and the double-helical structure of the marker itself alludes to this."</span></p>

<br />
<strong>I don't understand what the marker does and how it creates the necrmromorphs.&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">
<br />
<br />
I'm still a little fuzzy on how exactly they form, but the code on the marker was found to be a DNA code for the virus, or whatever you'd like to call it. Scientists followed the code, and created the virus to study upon. They ended up experimenting with it,
 which in turn created necromorphs that ended up overrunning the facility. That's how it first started.&nbsp; I think...<br />
<br />
"The writing on the <span>
marker</span> is a DNA code for the necromorphs, the marker itself creates the tissue that creates necromorphs, the tissue has to find a host to infect (colony members) and the first host is always an infector that proceeds to infect other hosts which become
 slashers (or any other necro, including other infectors). The marker was sent to Ageis 7 because it was too dangerous to control, (that is also why that planet is restricted). the hive mind was created by all the necros being merged in to one being (convergence
 event). the hive mind can control other nercos telepathically. When there are a large amount of any type of being, dead or alive near by the marker a convergence event is triggered."&nbsp; -<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110707121128AADMrMQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Source</span></a>.</span><br />

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
"It does not mean the Marker is bad, or that it was made to create Necromorphs. The Marker is most likely a benign 'monument' to the genetic material of a long-extinct alien race that built the Marker - so that the essence of their race would not be extinct
 completely, as the DNA would be there for a future species to possibly rebuild their race and resurrect their civilisation (possibly the writings on the Marker referring to "rebirth" and "an undending community" that
<a href="http://deadspace.wikia.com/wiki/Michael_Altman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Altman</span></a> and
<a href="http://deadspace.wikia.com/wiki/Unitology" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Unitologists</span></a> deciphered were misread and were not talking about humans at all, but the aliens who created the Marker). The original aliens would not
 have looked and behaved like the Necromorphs or been similar to them in any way, because if they did, they could never build the kind of advanced civilisation needed to produce the Marker.
<strong>The Necromorph infection is simply a horrible accident caused by contact between our DNA and alien DNA, causing the two to somehow merge into a freakish hybrid.</strong> If so, the Necromorphs are not aliens in their own right any more than they are
 still human. The original aliens would have been equally shocked and repulsed by the Necromorphs as ourselves, if they had any way of knowing what would happen to us when we tried to recreate their DNA. It is even possible the Marker's ingenious builders anticipated
 such a cataclysm, however, because they made the Marker also have the ability to contain the spread of their DNA as well as bring it back. References to 'eternal life' on the script of the Marker deciphered by Altman were probably talking about the Marker's
 role in preserving the essence of its creators by recording their genetic material, not about giving humans eternal life by mutating them to Necromorphs - as some
<a href="http://deadspace.wikia.com/wiki/Mercer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<br />
There is a low probability that the necromorph virus is a natural occurrence, but there is a higher probability that the virus was created by or is the race that created the Black Marker</span><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
It seems hardly likely that a species would want to build their only surviving monument to preserve a disease, so clearly what is a disease to humans was not a disease to the Marker's builders. The recombinant life-form was probably benign to the Marker's builders
 - perhaps a way of quickly re-evolving their lost world - but extremely dangerous to humans because of its alien nature. I don't like to get technical and this is only fiction, but DNA can be 'advanced' or 'primitive' - for example, a less evolved form of
 bacteria will quickly be consumed by a more evolved form. The alien bacteria described in various logs in the game reproduces by agamogenesis and its basic form is the organic mass spreading throughout the
<i>Ishimura</i>. Apparently, it does this process extremely fast and infects host cells 'with viral-like behavior'. One explanation is that the 'viral-like behavior' is that the bacteria can somehow penetrate host cells like a virus and fuse its own DNA with
 them - and the new genetic material can vary, represented in the diversity of the different kinds of Necromorph. Given it is completely alien, it could be considered neither bacteria, virus nor cell, but something completely different and beyond the biology
 that humans have so far been aware of - if so, the vague description 'virus' is probably more appropriate, as it is 'virulent' and is therefore an agent that could be called a virus.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
Most likely, what is on the marker is a formula to create a retro-virus, which can re-write the DNA of any life form it comes into contact with. (Retro-viruses are known to act fast, explaining infector mutations that occur in under 30 seconds.) So an alien
 civilization probably <i>did</i> create the Marker to re-build their fallen civilization, but the creation of the necromorphs could be an error on humanity's end, because, obviously, a race capable of creating a device that can repel and...calm down any varients
 of their DNA, even vastly inferior DNA (which probably the necromorph virus would be), is so far ahead of us, we couldn't possibly exactly re-create a retro-virus of their design."</span> -<a href="http://deadspace.wikia.com/wiki/Talk:Necromorphs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Source</a>.</span></p>

<p>I'm very excited for DS3. &nbsp;Not sure if the story or gameplay will be good, but from what I've seen and read, I think both will be good. &nbsp;But then again I'm a huge fan. &nbsp;The 20 minute gameplay featuring the singleplayer mode looks sick. &nbsp;Co-op looks fun too,
 though I'll be playing singleplayer first. &nbsp;With the story, "the source" sounds interesting. &nbsp;Might be where they reverse engineered the Black Marker and things went bad. &nbsp;Looking forward to getting more answers. &nbsp;I've been waiting for the game for some time
 now. &nbsp;To answer your question, no I don't believe it's a game just being pumped out there. &nbsp;The past two games have been absolutely amazing, and from the 20 minute video DS3 looks just as good, while being a bit different. &nbsp;A lot of people are upset with the
 changes, but it's time for change. &nbsp;The exact same formula for a third game would make the series stale. &nbsp;Looks like a fresh view, with the same feel. &nbsp;But that's my opinion. &nbsp;</p>

<p>So as best I can tell I had a BToE pairing problem at the point in time I was testing this.&nbsp; The "Switch your device" process is working.&nbsp; there is a small icon in the lower left corner (near call Forwarding) of the Skype for Business window that either
 looks like a TV or a Telephone.&nbsp; (see the relevant BToE user guide for more details)&nbsp; I now see 2 (not sure before but I assume just 1) icons and can choose between them to set the default.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only issue with this is one can not change sources while dialing, which would really be the best time to do this, as opposed to after someone has picked up.&nbsp; NBD if you leave it on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Call Forwarding vs Call Handling is still open</p>

<p>Hi RangerZ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the screenshot, it should be not feasible to do it. Since you are following the Polycom Guide and there isn‚Äôt any Microsoft official document about this, please contact Polycom support to check if it is feasible. There is another method may help
 you, you can try to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Transfer-a-Skype-for-Business-call-f9f312a3-ccc9-4215-86e8-8928b2df1f97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>As I noted above, I have addressed the aspects related to the Polycom device.&nbsp;

<p>Hi RangerZ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your clarify.&nbsp;If you see&nbsp;<strong>Call Forwarding</strong>&nbsp;in the list, then Skype for Business is not set up to work through your desk phone. If you see&nbsp;<strong>Call Handling</strong>&nbsp;in the list, then your desk phone is integrated with Skype
 for Business. For your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-your-desk-phone-to-make-a-Skype-for-Business-call-6a316c11-a05e-460c-b969-32ff0ad848e6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, switch your device option is used to switch to a different audio device. And you can also set up you device via
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-Audio-Device-options-in-Skype-for-Business-2533d929-9814-4349-8ae4-fca29246e2ff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Carlos, I have the same question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read the article.&nbsp; Under the "Prep" section it says "From <strong>Tools</strong> &gt;
<strong>Options</strong>, click <strong>Call Handling</strong>. (If your UI says Call Forwarding, then you are not configured to use Skype for Business with your Phone System desk phone.)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is where is this configured?&nbsp; I assume it is someplace in the SfB Administrators section but I am unable to find this.&nbsp; I am the Administrator.</p>

<div>Medion do not appear to be able to assist. They claim the 64 bit disk was supplied with the computer...well, if so, I have never seen it, I was given a 32 bit disk and a restore disk but I see no sign of a 64 bit system on the disks supplied with the computer.</div>
<div>Moreover, if I have understood what I have read on the MS Vista site it appears that Vista was sold as a 32 bit system and a 64 bit DVD can be purchased subsequently.</div>

<p>Unfortunately there is no way to "upgrade" from 32-bit Windows to 64-bit Windows, so that's not possible.&nbsp; But since Windows came preinstalled on your computer, the choice of what versions and flavors of Windows came with it are made by the hardware manufacturer.&nbsp;
 Retail copies of Windows (those purchased in stores) do come with both 32-bit and 64-bit discs but OEM copies (those sold with new computers or those intended for installation on new computers) only come with one or the other, not both.&nbsp; So in the end yes,
 whether or not you can get a copy of 64-bit Windows without buying it is between you and the computer manufacturer.</p>

Thank you for your interest. <br />

I now have Windows 7 64 bit. I am of the view that Vista users should have been offered Windows 7 on at least very preferential terms if not as a free optional upgrade.<br />

            <p>Retail copies of Windows Vista Home Premium and Business only contained the 32bit dvd and instructions on how to obtain the 64bit dvd from Microsoft.&nbsp; Only retail Ultimate contained both dvds.&nbsp; Home Premium and Business users had to log onto a Microsoft
 website, supply the product key, and pay $10 in order to get the 64bit dvd.&nbsp; The dvd was sent by mail.&nbsp; The website was closed when Vista was removed from retail sales so Vista users who did not order the 64bit dvd before that could longer get one.</p>
<p>Users whose Windows came preinstalled on their new computers were only entitled to the version they ordered at the time of the computer purchase.&nbsp; They could not use the website to obtain a dvd because that priviledge only applied to retail purchasers.&nbsp;
 OEMs were not required to supply alternative media either so Vista OEM users were never entitled to both versions of the software.</p>
<p>The practice changed with Windows 7.&nbsp; All retail copies of Windows 7 include both dvds.&nbsp; However, it is still true that OEM users are only entitled to the version supplied by the OEM at the time of purchase of the computer.</p>

<h2>            How to backup whole D&#58;&#92; drive by FileHistory&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'd like to backup my whole D:\ drive by FileHistory, so I added D:\ as a new backup folder; and the backup storage was in NAS.</p>
<p>But any files and folders in D:\ doesn't backed up, since the other files and folders in my Users folder in C:\ were backed up properly.</p>
<p>I tried another way, added a subdirectory of D:\ as a new backup folder; and it worked. After that, I tried to add D:\ to Libraries in order to be backed up with the other Libraries; but it doesn't worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folders in my D:\ drive can be added or removed, so I'd like to backup the whole D:\ drive.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your patience.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful day :)</p>

<p>Try this first.</p>
<p>Grab the corners of the window and drag it to full screen size. Do not use Maximize.&nbsp;<strong><em>Close all other windows first via the Taskbar and this one last</em></strong>.&nbsp; Windows will remember the size used of the &nbsp;<strong><em>last</em></strong> window
 closed the next time you open the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3> richardduffysc  say:</h3>
<h2>            My libraries are dead ends, can&#39;t open them or put anything in them</h2>
                    When I go to Documents, Pictures, Music or Video they won't open, I've tried a few routes but none open them. If I right click on any of them and go to properties I get an error message that simply says "The properties for this item are not available."<br />
<br />
Right clicking on libraries and hitting "Restore default libraries" does nothing.<br />
<br />
I can't create a new library either, all that happens when I his "New Library" is an error message that says, "Unable to create the file 'New Library.library-ms'&nbsp; Access is denied."<br />
<br />
It's as if the library feature has been removed from my system leaving behind dead-end directories.<br />
<br />
It's quite annoying as I've an external hard drive full of music which I can't get media player to recognise because I can't put the music in the music library.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
