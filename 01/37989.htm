    <title>Windows 8 install on multiple computers&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8 install on multiple computers&#63;</h2>
                    OK, So I recently built a friend a new gaming PC. He had gotten a copy of Windows &nbsp;8 Pro from his school. I am looking into upgrading my laptop to run windows 8 and figured I'd just give it a shot to use the product key again. On the update file thing
 that I had from when I installed it on his computer it says I am all good to install the OS. I am just worried that it's going to do something to his computer if I install it.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I continue to install Windows 8 using this product key will it mess up his PC at all? I have heard you can use the same key on a main PC and a backup but you just can't use them at the same time which isn't a huge issue for me as we are never home at
 the same time.</div>
                </div>

<p>Yes, you might be prompted to go through the install routine with just the 5 mb web installer, but you don't actually have to do the download, just make the acquisition and the product key will be presented to you in the Upgrade Assistant (you will also
 have a copy sent to your email address).</p>

<p>I don't know where you heard that you could use the same key on a main PC and a backup but from whatever source you heard it, it was wrong.</p>

<p>You can only use the copy of Windows on One computer (unless the copy is a multi licence copy). This is regardless of whether you have permission from the original owner of the software,</p>

    <title>Win 10 upgrade change language - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laakspen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 upgrade change language</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I have Windows 8.1 pro and now I upgrade it to Windows 10. My current os version is Finnish. Can I upgrade my current version to English&nbsp; Windows 10? I want to change because in problem situations it is easier to find solutions when terms are in English.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that I can change display language, but now I mean "os core" language. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards</p>

            <p>The official statement (in the FAQ) was that you need to stick with your language. But that might change when you do a clean install afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the Media Creation Tool and upgraded by wiping everything (one of the option during the upgrade process) and it asked me about the language to use. My previous one was a Win7 Home English, my target upgrade was Win10 Home English (UK) and it
 warned me that the display language is going to change. Not sure whether that would also work in your case (English to English (UK) might be a special case and plain English was actually not an option).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure about Win 8.1 Pro, but cant you download an additional language pack for that? I have another Win7 Ultimate, with which that's actually possible, but that might have been the reason why I chose the Ultimate over the Pro in those days.</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>I can download language pack, but it changes only display language. "Near core OS" remains still terms which is in the language the original OS is installed. And in some error situations reported term are in Finnish and must be translated to English to get
 help from the net.</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I'm now quite sure that I can not change win 8.1 pro x64 <strong>fin</strong> to win 10 pro x64
<strong>EN-US</strong> in upgrade process keeping my programs and settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created using Media Creation Tool DVD Windows 10 pro X64 En-us. In win 8.1 pro x64 I changed region and language to en-us, I changed also locale to En-us. And language pack en-us is installed and in use my account I use for upgrade. After these changes
 I rebooted and started installation from DVD. I tried to keep my programs untouched, but I got message that I can only keep my own files not programs and settings because I want to change system language. Maybe this is due to some installed applications that
 has Finnish program paths etc. I do not know ? </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I downloaded Win 10 pro x64 Fin and installed (upgrade) Finnish version keeping programs and settings too. Installation ok.</p>
<p>I had still display language En-us in my account as I had before upgrade process in Win 8.1, but in menu File explorer, Settings, Power and All apps was in Finnish (Resurssienhallinta, Asetukset, Virta, Kaikki sovellukset). I uninstalled (not only remove)
 En-us language pack and rebooted. Then I installed En-us language pack again and changed it to default. Now in menu File explorer, Power and All apps are in English, but Settings is in Finnish (Asetukset).</p>
<p>Does anybody know which causes this "minor error" and how I can correct it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards </p>
<p>Laakspen?</p>

<h2>            How do I get mp4 video files to appear in genres other than the genre of &#34;Other&#34; in Windows Media Center&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have mp4 video files that I can't get to list under the genres I want them to in Windows Media Center.<br />
<br />
I list the genre I want them to appear under in the Details section on the right click of the video file but in the Movies section they only appear under the genre "Other"? Why???<br />
<br />
Do I need an ".XML" data file to get this to work?<br />
<br />
I've noticed all the movie files that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">can</span> draw the meta date from online have 2 to 3 ".XML" files in their folders. These video files do appear under the genres they should.<br />
<br />
I've tried making a single .XML file for the video files that can't dry from the online meta data but they still appear under "Other" genre only.
<br />
<br />
Do I need more than 1 .XML meta data file? If I do what are they and how do I make them myself?<br />
<br />
Can someone lead me to a site that explains how to make all the .XML meta data files that I need to make this work.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
John<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I've done this a long time ago and it doesn't help.<br />
<br />
However, I have found a solution. <br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.mediacentermaster.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">"Media Center Master"</a> (the program's free version) will download MetaData XML files and place them in the video/movie folder. It will even force making a MetaData XML file if it can't find anything online.<br />
<br />
Apparently Windows Media Center uses XML files to determine what genres to display movies under.<br />
<br />
Without an XML MetaData file Media Center will place the video file under the genre "Other" even if you have written a genre under details.<br />
<br />
Now, if I can only get my Windows Media Center to stop crashing when I open "Movies"!<br />
<br />
John<br />

<h2>            Still waiting for KB4284848 to show up in my WSUS server</h2>
                    <p>Im running WSUS v6.3.9600.18694 on a Windows Server 2012 R2 server. I have yet to see KB4284848 appear in the downloads for me to approve.</p>
<p>I've seen a lot of posts online about this KB screwing up computers but one of our software vendors says we need to get this installed for this software to work. Sure I can manually download it but I would like to know if there is a WSUS problem. The SSU
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4338853" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB4338853</a>&nbsp;that is mentioned that needs to be installed before installing this KB has already been downloaded and installed. So the question is why WSUS is not getting this KB?</p>

    <title>BSOD after Window 10 updates System_Service_Exception - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevecramer2  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD after Window 10 updates  System_Service_Exception &#40;asmtxhci.sys</h2>
                    <p>Original title: BSOD after Window 10 updates </p>
<p>
</p><p>My main system (10.0.10586) went down with error message: System_Service_Exception (asmtxhci.sys). The system crashes if I try booting with a external hard-drive attached to a USB. After booting the system will run with the external then plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I fired up my backup system (wasn't connected to the internet normally). After a fury of downloads and updates, that system now at 10.0.10586 will no longer boot and displays the very same error message: System_Service_Exception (asmtxhci.sys).
 This system always has a external drive attached, a Western Digital(WD) 2Tb with USB2, about 2 years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Main system tries to uses a brand new Samsung D3 Station. I have a 4 and 5Tb using USB3. Neither drive will boot if attached.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both systems will not boot up when any drive is attach. Both computers will work fine if the hard-drives are attached 'after' booting up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both systems are running the same motherboard but diff CPU's. The boards are Asus Sabertooth 990FX R2.0 with latest UEFI/BIOS of version 2501.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help...thanks everyone!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Steve,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to resolve the issue with blue screen notification:</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1</strong>:</span></span></p>
<p><span>Start your computer in safe mode and check if the issue persists:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/changing-the-start-up-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/changing-the-start-up-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2</strong>:</span></span></p>
<p><span>If it works fine in safe mode, perform clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: After troubleshooting, see the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>” to return the computer
 to a <strong>Normal startup</strong> mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2</strong>:</span></span></p>
<p><span>As per the error message
<strong>asmtxhci.sys </strong>is related to XHCI Host Controller Driver from ASMedia Technology Inc. I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the latest drivers.</span></p>

    <title>My Win 10 Bluetooth just disappeared today - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bruce martin  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Win 10 Bluetooth just disappeared today</h2>
                    <p>I have been running a clean install of Win 10 on my Dell XPS 15 9530 for a week now, using my Microsoft bluetooth Sculpt Touch Mouse. But today, my Bluetooth just disappeared midmorning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Task Manager shows Bluetooth Support Service running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Settings &gt; Devices does not list Bluetooth.<br />
<br />
Device Manger does not list any Bluetooth device.<br />
<br />
Devices and Printers shows my Microsoft bluetooth Sculpt Touch Mouse. but I am unable to make the "Remove device" selection work to remove it.<br />
<br />
In Devices and Printers when I right click on the device icon of the computer name and select “Bluetooth settings”, I get the settings dialog, but the Hardware tab shows Devices as empty with no entries.<br />
<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Bluetooth is empty except for a left column sub-entry: "FileSquirtInstalled".<br />
<br />
What can I do to fix this?</p>

            <p>Hi,　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update your Bluetooth adapter:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Search your computer for<strong> 'Device Manager</strong>'. </li><li>Open it. Find the <strong>'Bluetooth</strong>' section and expand it. Check if the drivers can be found under other devices.</li><li>There will be a list of all of the devices you have connected to via Bluetooth (or most of them). However, there will be one that looks more like a Bluetooth adapter. Right click on it.</li><li>Click '<strong>Update Driver Software...</strong>'.</li><li>Click '<strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>'.</li><li>If it says that you already have the latest software, this method has not worked as you already have the newest one available.
</li></ol>
<p>Also try to install the drivers in compatibility and check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            Thanks Anish,<br />
<br />
As I stated, the Device Manager did not list Bluetooth. Just Batteries, then Computer.<br />
<br />
But I did fix this just this morning. I had been installing a lot of programs after doing a clean install of Win 10 a week ago, so I had some System Restore points with one just one day before my Bluetooth disappeared. So I used that to revert to that status,
 and what do you know, my Bluetooth was restored. There were quite a few programs listed that were removed while doing that, so I can not pin point the one causing the problem. But as I re-install the ones removed that I find that I need, I will be checking
 Bluetooth as I go, and will update here.

            <p>Hi, with exactly the same hardware (xps9530 and microsoft sculpt touch mouse) I have just experienced the same issue. I do not want to go back with my System Restores. Did you find anything else that may have caused this ?</p>
<p>By the way, your restart times when the mouse is connected to the notebook are the same as when it is off ? I was experiencing also longer (1m or more) restart times when the mouse was left connected during the restart process. If I just turned it off, it
 went back to normal (15/20secs).</p>
<p>Thx.</p>

            <p>Sorry, I have no new information to add to this. After I did the restore as described in my post, I reinstalled the missing apps, but had no problem with the Bluetooth mouse. Everything has been working correctly since then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what do you know, I do have the same problem with restart times as you mention. 15secs with the mouse turned off, and 1m 10secs with the mouse turned on. I had not noticed this before, since I rarely ever do a restart. Maybe it is from the Bluetooth
 driver trying to establish the pairing with the MIA device. Let me know if you fix this, please</p>

<p>Also I don't seem to receive an update of Windows 10 (10.0.16299.125), was stuck at 10.0.16299.98. I tried to do a repair of Windows 10 on usb (keeping apps and files) to install updates but instead downgraded me to 10.0.16299.15 without installing any updates.
 Will really need the latest version and need connect to Microsoft store, cortana, without doing a clean install losing my apps. Also my Windows Update is now stuck at checking for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will look forward to your favorable reply as soon as possible :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Cant choose many topics, the topics are linked.</p>

    <title>PC Boot Loop - Continuous BSOD Errors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve kingman  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC Boot Loop - Continuous BSOD Errors</h2>
                    <p>My specs:<br />
<br />
Ryzen 5 1600<br />
Gigabyte AB350M-HD3 Motherboard<br />
GTX 1060 6gb<br />
8GB RAM (Crucial 8GB (1x8GB) DDR4 PC4-17000 2133MHz Single Module)<br />
<br />
I am desperately in need of some assistance; my less than 6 month old machine has suddenly started returning continuous Blue Screen errors, barely ever starting into Windows. This happened last night - during a normal gaming session, the PC Crashed.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After that, the following BSOD errors have been seen:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Kernel Security Check Failure</li><li>MEMORY_MANAGEMENT Error</li><li>Page Fault in Nonpaged Area</li><li>Kmode exception not handled</li><li>Driver Irql Not Less or Equal</li><li>Attempted execute of noexecute memory</li><li>system thread exception not handled</li><li>Attempted to read write protected memory<br />
</li></ul>
<p>On the rare occasions I have managed to get back into Windows, it has crashed or frozen within a minute or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The three last things that happened with my machine were:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Installed Assassins Creed Origins (which ran fine for the first day or so).</li><li>Windows Updates at shutdown on the 9th - the issues started on the 10th.</li><li>NVIDIA Graphics Update - performed on the 9th.</li></ul>
<p><br />
<br />
This morning I was able to get back into it, and I decided to try uninstalling some drivers - the very latest ones I installed with the newest NVIDIA drivers (other than Windows updates the other night), but when I tried to load NVIDIA Experience it said the
 files couldn't be found.<br />
<br />
I tried re-downloading it, but Chrome wouldn't launch.<br />
<br />
I got Edge to work, but when I ran the installation it said that no NVIDIA card was installed.<br />
<br />
I tried to system restore, but the system had lost all my restore points.&nbsp; I have also tried a REFRESH, but this ended up with the same startup issues.<br />
<br />
-----------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any advice on this one as to what might be the case?<br />

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Boot loops and blue screen errors are usually occurring to a Windows computer due to some corruption within the drivers or with the system files. For further troubleshooting, we suggest booting your computer into
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a></strong> before creating a test user profile. Using the test user profile, check if you'll be having the same
 issue with starting up your device. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To create a test user profile, follow these steps: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Using Cortana search, type Settings and then hit the Enter key. </li><li>In the Settings window, select Accounts. </li><li>Select Family &amp; other people. </li><li>Choose Add someone else to this PC. </li><li>Click I don't have this person's sign-in information. </li><li>Click Add a user without a Microsoft account. </li><li>Name the user as TEST and then provide a password. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the same issue persists within the test user profile, you can use this <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14238/windows-10-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> as a guide on how to troubleshoot blue screen errors.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if further assistance is needed.</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply.<br />
<br />
I am unable to do this right now (as I am at work), but I should probably note that (after multiple attempts of BSOD cycles) I was able to get the system into Safemode.&nbsp; Once in Safemode, I ran sfc /scannow, which brought up no errors.&nbsp; During my time in Safemode
 however, I saw no errors.<br />
<br />
As I'm having a massively difficult time getting back onto my PC at all however, can you clarify how creating a test user would circumvent the Bluescreen errors?<br />
</p>
<p>Also, the only way I've managed to get into Safemode so far was getting the Recovery page to come up and selecting it from the list - is there an easier way to get into Safemode - perhaps there is a keypress during boot that will do it, like in the old days?</p>

            It looks like the culprit was botched RAM - I'd ironically ordered replacement RAM before the issues happened, and as soon as the old stick came out and new sticks went in the issues were resolved.

<h2>            Color blindness</h2>
                    Since moving to my dorm, my computer is confusing the colors red and blue on one of my games, there is no setting to change this in the actual game, so I'm wondering if it's an issue with my computer itself. It's a Blizzard game, so if anyone has experienced
 something like this before, I'm interested to know how you solved it.

            Hi Linda, 
<br />
<br />Is it only 1 particular game doing this? 
<br />
<br />If that’s the case, I’d uninstall and reinstall the game (assuming that once you log in your progress is saved... I don’t game much sorry) and see if it’s remedied. I feel like something is messed up with the sys files of the game for that to be happening, and a fresh install may cure.
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

<p>Colour-blind mode, when available, enhances certain part of the colour spectrum. I don't think it wouldn't be swapping red and blue around.</p>
<p>If the image is also blurred/distorted it sounds like you may have accidentally enabled 3D in....</p>
<p><em>Settings &gt; Display</em>. The <em>3D Display Mode on/off</em> toggle is just below
<em>Multiple Displays.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- You should normally need to also use a keyboard short cut after launching the game to enable and disable 3D in game</p>
<p>but some games may go straight to 3D mode when you launch them.</p>

<h3> jwatters  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 will not start after update</h2>
                    <p>I got a Windows driver update on Nov 1.&nbsp; After the update the computer would just randomly reset (like a power off, no errors).&nbsp; There was no option to remove the update, so I did a system restore to the previous day.&nbsp; Everything was fine for about 2 hours,
 then the reset.&nbsp; Won't boot since in any way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On power up it gets to the windows logo and spinning dots, then blue screen with CRITICAL PROCESS DIED error.&nbsp; Reboots and goes to Automatic Repair, which fails.&nbsp; NONE of the advanced options work with the exception of Command Prompt.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>Reset this PC fails.&nbsp; </li><li>System Restore shows several restore points that cannot be selected.&nbsp; A command line (Rstrui) manual restore will allow the restore points to be selected, but they all fail.</li><li>Safe Mode fails (same blue screen).<br />
</li><li>Safe Mode with Networking fails (same blue screen).</li><li>Safe Mode with Command Prompt fails (same blue screen).</li><li>Startup Repair fails.</li><li>SFC scans to 100% then says "Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation".<br />
</li><li>Chkdsk finds no problems.</li><li>Bootrec options look normal and change nothing.&nbsp; Even rebuilt BCD.</li></ul>
<p>I would appreciate any thoughts anyone may have on getting this running again.&nbsp; I see no problem with the drive.&nbsp; All files are accessible.&nbsp; I really don't want to rebuild from scratch if I don't have to, and really don't feel like I should have to when
 I have no ability to prevent Microsoft from forcing updates on me.</p>

<p>https://answers.micro &nbsp; &nbsp; soft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/how-to-fix-bootresdll-is-corrupt-in-windows-10/8c70abfb-91a1-4693-ad6e-73c00b45697b</p>
<p>
</p><p>For each the regback and bootres.dll there were case reports of copy and paste files from one computer to another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Working on the boot may be moot until the underlying problem with the operating system is fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best option is the equivalent of reset save files.</p>
<p>The Windows operating system will be a new 1803.</p>
<p>Drivers should be downloaded and installed always from the computer or motherboard manufacturer websites.</p>
<p>If a driver is not displayed then use the component manufacturer website ( Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Killer Networks, Realtek, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Years ago I had used a Microsoft store for a Windows 1607 boot loop.&nbsp; Two weeks after a clean install there was a failure to upgrade and another clean install was performed.&nbsp; Each time the files were saved.&nbsp; They may not offer the backup of files or it may
 be on a case by case basis. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Making backup images allows you to be prepared for the unexpected.&nbsp; Typically in less than one hour you are back to using the computer again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best option now appears to be the equivalent of reset save files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the operating system, applications, and drivers are installed and the computer is working to your satisfaction you can make a backup image with free third party software.&nbsp; There are multiple software available (free and pay) depending on the features
 needed.</p>
<p>With backup images you can fix problems with ransomware, malware, operating system and registry corruption, failure to boot, etc. in less than one hour.&nbsp; Again this could be for free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For imaging:&nbsp; Acronis, Aoemi, EaseUS, Macrium, Paragon, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an example for Macrium:</p>

<h2>            Blue Circle of Death</h2>
                    <p>Have been running Windows 10 on a Toshiba laptop (C655D-S5540) for a few months with no issues. Yesterday I looked at the screen and it was blank, with only the cursor arow and a small spinning blue circle. &nbsp;I tried a few keys but couldn't get a response.
 &nbsp;I tried rebooting the machine and the process appears to go correctly until it plays half of the little "welcome tune" and then appears to hang with the cursor and small circle. &nbsp;I presume one of the start up applications is hanging; is there a way to interrupt
 the boot up sequence to identify which one is the problem ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later updade: &nbsp;I tried the expedient of mashing all of the Function keys (&amp; Escape) while it was booting and got it into the error mode where it offered me the option of reinstalling windows. I'm trying that now.</p>

<p>Hi CapeLee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were using some older Windows version and have installed Windows Fall Creators Update, your system will automatically use the sign-in information to make the device ready for the new update. This is the reason why you see the login screen once more
 even after entering the login credentials. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To disable this feature, go to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Accounts </strong>
&gt; <strong>Sign-in options</strong>. On your right-hand side, you should find a <strong>
Privacy </strong>category. By default, the <strong>Use my sign-in info to automatically finish settings up my device after an update or restart</strong> option is enabled. You should toggle the button to the
<strong>Off</strong> position disable this functionality. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance. </p>

    <title>NT Kernel and System using too much RAM on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dominic14  say:</h3>
<h2>            NT Kernel and System using too much RAM on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I need your help, last July 30, I upgraded my Laptop from Windows 7 Home Basic to Windows 10 Home. Well windows 10 is actually good and all but my problem is when I looked on to my Task Manager I saw the NT Kernel and System in the processes is using
 about 200K(on start up) upto 700K (after 30mins) of RAM. I still remember when I was on windows 7, my RAM would be below 60% after 30 mins but now I use windows 10 it doesn't go down and it''ll be at 85%-90% constantly and it overheats my laptop. Is there
 something wrong with windows 10 or with my laptop? </p>
<p>
</p><p>My Laptop info are:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Model: Acer Aspire V5-431</p>
<p>Processor: Intel(R) Pentium(R) CPU987 @ 1.5GHz</p>
<p>Installed RAM: 2GB (1.8GB Usable)</p>
<p>System Type: 64 bit OS, x64-based processor</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be glad if someone would help and know what is the problem. Is my Installed low RAM is the culprit or some hardware or software in my acer laptop is not compatible or can't keep up with windows 10? My last resort would be reverting back to windows
 7. Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I had a similar issue when I first installed Windows 8. Find SuperFetch in the taskmanager and stop the process. then run services.msc and find SuperFetch and make sure it is stopped and disabled from restarting at reboot. found in properties when right
 clicking on the service. Reboot and you should be good to go. not sure what the purpose is for this service, but it is only trouble. I ran my laptop for 2 years with no further issue when I had a similar issue with Windows 8 and am running fine with it disabled
 for Windows 10. Microsoft should address this. </p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry to know that you&nbsp;had issues&nbsp;with Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>SuperFetch simply preloads and makes programs you use more often quick to access. It also enables background programs, defragmenting for example, to run in the background while you do your work.</p>
<p>If you have the issue in future, then please&nbsp;try the below method to check the memory status of the Computer.</p>
<p>1. Tap on <strong>Windows Key </strong>and </p>
<p><span>2. Type <strong>"Windows Memory Diagnostic</strong>" without the quotes&nbsp;in</span> search box<span>&nbsp;and click on it.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click on <strong>Restart now and check for problems</strong>.</span></p>

            <p>I had this issue and tries both solutions given here by support but none works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using intel i5 -4440 CPU @ 3.1Ghz, with 8GB RAM and my memory was used up to 2GB just by 'System' by NT Kernel &amp; System. Overall memory used around 7GB when it happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really wants a solution on this. I have read a solution on my search that uninstalling new drivers or softwares could solve this and so I've tried. It works, but only for a while. The 'System' memory usage continues to increase by time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I've just restarted the PC and it seems it does not add up yet. I normally shut down my PC only over the weekend. I will update when it does happen again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your information, the driver/software that causes the problem is from my cellphone. An Asus phone.</p>

            <p>Ghadaffi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to turn off Prefetch/Superfetch. That is what's causing all the usage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the video that will help disable those. I have done it and there has been no side effects and high usage has stopped.</p>

<h2>            Error code 8024A008 when trying to check for updates</h2>
                    Hey, I just upgraded my computer from windows 8 to windows 8.1. After the installation I tried to run the Windows update and after sever minutes of checking for updates the following error occurred "8024A008".&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3fc8f3ae-0a49-4697-aa6d-56abc778c56b" />&nbsp;I
 tried several methods to solve this, first of all I restarted the computer but nothing changed, then I ran the "Windows Update Diagnostic" tool with no luck either.&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6153a740-72a5-48c3-9cb2-1c7584df34d8" />I'd
 appreciate&nbsp;any advice on how to solve this problem. Thanks a lot!

            <p>Look at the bottom of this thread:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/afc7f693-f742-402f-b513-063989b79c2f/windows-81-enterprise-windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/afc7f693-f742-402f-b513-063989b79c2f/windows-81-enterprise-windows-updates</a></p>

</p>
<p>http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/2d191bcd-3308-4edd-9de2-88dff796b0bc</p>
<p>1.)&nbsp; Copy the whole module folder (after unzipping) to %WINDIR%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules
</p>
<p>2.) Start up PowerShell ISE as admin from admin tools </p>
<p>3.) Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned</p>
<p>4.) Import-Module PSWindowsUpdate</p>
<p>5.) Get-WUInstall</p>
<p>6.) The rest should be automated with some prompts</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsocial.technet.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fgetfile%2f368904" /></p>
<p>After Reboot</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsocial.technet.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fgetfile%2f368906" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>follow the instructions to run the PowerShell script and it will force a Windows Update. Make sure you follow the instructions in the second relevant post:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is a great solution! I just tested it and I only had one small issue. "Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned" was not sufficient in my case because the files were flagged as coming from another computer and were blocked when trying to import the module.
 Simple solution: copy the zip file locally and unblock the zip file BEFORE extracting the files, otherwise you have to unblock the files one by one. You can do that in the properties dialog of the file. You can also use "Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted" but
 I do not suggest doing this.</p>
<p>If you want to execute without prompts, maybe to automate the process, you can execute:</p>
<p>Get-WUInstall -AcceptAll -IgnoreReboot</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So great work by these Guys and a big thumbs down to Microsoft. I have run it successfully and it download 39 updates (including Office).</p>
