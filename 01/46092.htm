            The fan is supposed to run constantly.<br />
Laptop or PC ?<br />
Has there been an increase in the ambient air temperature, or have you been doing<br />
things on the machine that put it under increased stress ? These things will make the<br />
machine hotter, and that will cause the fan(s) to speed up. <br />
Unfortunately some cpu and graphics card coolers have fans that get very noisy at high revs.<br />
<br />
Run a temperature monitor to verify the temps are not getting too high.<br />
<br />
If temps&nbsp; are too high read on -<br />
It could be that dust is blocking the air intakes or cooling fins on the cpu and graphics<br />
card (if you have one) making the cooling less efficient. The dust can be cleaned off the fins<br />
with a small brush or can of compressed air (don't use a vacuum cleaner as they are said to<br />
cause static electricity) . <br />
Disconnect the power to the machine when working inside.<br />
If there are filters on the case fans these can be cleaned with a damp sponge or removed and washed.
<br />
If it's a laptop you may have to settle for using a vacuum cleaner ( I know - static, but on the<br />
outside it should not be a problem) on the air intake slots.<br />
<br />
Then there is the possibility the fans bearing is worn out and you need a new fan.<br />

<h2>            Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro won&#39;t boot after restarting do to critical_process_died</h2>
                    <p>I was browsing Internet explorer and all of a sudden everything froze up and then a new blue screen came up reading CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED. Then the computer shut down and restarted, but the screen would not move from the black screen that read Lenovo (screen
 pictured). I read that this does not mean that the computer is doing nothing so I have left it for over an hour and a half and still nothing. I tried powering it down and restarting it but still nothing. The computer is brand new, I recieved it for Christmas.
 At this point I do not know if I can do anything and would love some guidance on what steps I should take.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be greatful for a speedy response because I need this computer before I head back to school.&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f411010-41e5-42d1-9911-843c3a9645a8" /></p>

<p>Hi Devlin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last time I used my computer was on Tuesday.&nbsp; I never had any issues prior to that.&nbsp; I turned it on today for the first time since Tuesday and all of sudden everything is enlarged and stretched off the screen.&nbsp; To answer your questions in order as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; No, I have not noticed any system changes since I last used my computer.&nbsp; At least nothing I am aware of unless something automatically changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; No, I am not receiving any error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; I have tried most of the general troubleshooting that I have found on the internet, such as, checking resolution and scaling settings.&nbsp; They are all at the original settings.&nbsp; I also checked for graphic driver updates and it said everything was up to
 date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have included two screen shots but I'm not sure how much you can tell from them since they do not look as bad as it really is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would a virus do something like this?&nbsp; I have virus protection.&nbsp; I'm hoping you can help since I am unable to work with it in this condition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lisa</p>

<p>I woke up to my computer having the exact same problem today and I cannot find a solution anywhere. What is bugging me most, however, is that when I reset my computer, the screen went back to normal for a few minutes and then reverted to the enlarged/stretched
 distortion.</p>

            This should not have happened to begin with. It is sad buy something and have to work the bugs out ourselves. They should have someone to come and do it, as some of us are not computer savvy, and not able to do it.

<p>Sounds to me like a display adapter driver problem.&nbsp; This is a known issue currently rather widespread&nbsp; for devices using AMD graphics cards.&nbsp; It resulted from MS providing less than perfect driver updates for AMD Radeon
 display adapters.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Do you have an AMD display adapter?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Determine what brand name graphics card aka (display adapter, video card, graphics processing unit) you have on your device... by&nbsp;<span>right</span><span>&nbsp;</span>clicking the Start menu&gt;Device Manager&gt;Display Adapter&gt;Expand it&gt;Properties&gt;all
 right clicks.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>AMD is your brand name display adapter, you should update the driver by going to the manufacture's website&nbsp;<a href="https://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>&nbsp;
 selecting "Autodetect" then download what autodetect finds for you.&nbsp; This is the easiest way to do it&nbsp;<span><span>if&nbsp;</span></span>you have an AMD display adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have a AMD Radeon Display Adapter on your device, then this wouldn't apply to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My display resolution problems were corrected immediately after updating the Display Adapter Driver from the AMD website found above using AutoDetect.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi wtfury,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I've been digging all day on this matter and getting more and more frustrated!&nbsp; Apparently, from what I found is that my graphics driver, ATI Radeon HD 4200, does not and is not putting out any driver updates.&nbsp; It apparently is not compatible with
 Windows 10.&nbsp; I upgraded to Windows 10 at the beginning of the year or end of last year and eventually the driver will no longer work since the company last updated it for Windows 8.&nbsp; This is awful because my computer is perfectly fine otherwise.&nbsp; But to now
 have to spend a few hundred $$ to get a new graphics card and have to make sure the motherboard, etc is compatible with it is ridiculous.&nbsp; At that point you've soaked in enough money to just purchase a new half-way decent computer.&nbsp; Ugh!&nbsp; Odd that it has happened
 to so many people right before "black Friday" hmmm....</p>

<p>I have been losing my mind all day trying to figure this out, find the right forum, etc.&nbsp; You nailed it LJames, so thank you.&nbsp; I just arrived at that same conclusion.&nbsp; This sucks.&nbsp; Whats even worse is that I cannot choose a restore point to roll back and
 then prevent the Windows Update from installing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seals it for me.&nbsp; I am going to have to move to a new OS and no longer use Microsoft.&nbsp; This is absolute BS.</p>

                    <p>Hi all, I seem to have stumbled across an issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really like to be able to stream Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3 HD Collection via Twitch, but for whatever reason, using the app on the console, it won't allow me to stream the gameplay. I have double checked my account, checked parental settings, home
 console, hard reset the console, rebooted the router, modified DNS settings, disabled VPNs etc you name it, I've tried it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar issue and if this is a common thing where the game is straight up blocked from being broadcasted on Twitch.</p>
<p>If you're wondering which version of the game I'm playing, it's the PAL release on disc being played on a launch model Xbox One</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has been experiencing this, please let me know, I'd really like to stream this game!</p>

<p>Quite possibly, however I've tried searching on the web to see if anyone else has experienced a similar issue and had no luck finding out. I've recently tried relaunching the game again and broadcasting it, each time I'm greeted with "It's us, not you" from
 the Twitch app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had a look through their FAQ and such and haven't been able to find anything, so these forums are more or less a last ditch attempt to trying to find a definitive answer.</p>

            <p>I am experiencing the same battery drain problem, also having recently upgraded from 8.1 to 10. I tried both methods you listed (sfc found no problems), but the problem persists. My laptop's battery currently looses about 1% per hour with Windows 10 when
 shut down, while the loss was at most 1-2% per whole day with 8.1. I have tried other recommendations from elsewhere on the web such as turning off fast startup and putting the laptop into the most power saving mode possible before shutdown, but have had no
 luck in solving the problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A small edit: I forgot the post title was regarding hibernate, while I wrote about trouble with full shutdown as well. Hibernate looses almost the whole battery in a day on my machine! I used to be able to let it sit a week or more hibernating before that
 happened.</p>

            <p>HP released a new BIOS version for my laptop (an envy dv6) that has fixed the issue. With that updated installed, my battery is back to keeping its charge perfectly, both for hibernate and shutdown with both options for fast startup (enabled or disabled).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For any other HP users reading this, the BIOS update I got was listed under the Windows 8 drivers and software, not Windows 10. If I selected Windows 10 as the operating system, the HP site just gave a message saying that Windows 10 would do any driver updates
 automatically through Windows Update, and there was nothing at all listed for download under that OS option. I've had no problems since installing that BIOS update; the battery problem is solved and everything else continues to work fine.</p>

            <p>I'm having the exact same issue with my Dell laptop Inspiron 15 7375. All of the above resolutions did not help. SFC scan found nothing, and neither did the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Funny thing is: I have been running Windows 10 for several weeks without problems and with hibernation functioning correctly without draining the battery.</p>
<p>The problem first occured after updating a series of (Dell recommend!!) drivers, like for the Chipset for instance and the Intel HD graphics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BIOS is the already the latest version, so that resolution won't help either.</p>

            <p>It seems I have found the solution to this (or at least in my case) :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a lot of contact with Dell support (kudo's guys for the endurance of hunting this down!) it came down to problems with the video drivers. Apparently these control 'sleep' and 'hibernate' to a great extent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Dell laptop has a Intel HD graphics card as well as a NVIDIA Geforce GT950M discrete GPU. It turns out that the order of installation of the drivers for these is CRITICALLY important!</p>
<p>So first I got myself the correct drivers: the drivers from the Dell website that were certified by Dell for my system and tested for Windows 10 (this is important!). After that I proceeded in this EXACT order (also VERY important):</p>
<p>
</p><p>-FIRST uninstall the NVIDIA driver</p>
<p>-ONLY THEN uninstall the Intel HD driver and also delete it (check the box in the uninstall prompt!)</p>
<p>-Reboot system</p>
<p>-Check the Device Manager that you are now running on a generic Windows Display Driver and there's an unknown 3D device listed (this verifies your drivers are truly gone)</p>
<p>-Now FIRST install the correct Intel HD driver</p>
<p>-Reboot if prompted (don't wait :) )</p>
<p>-Only then install your correct NVIDIA Geforce driver from the laptop manufacturer. ATTENTION: choose 'custom' install here so you can check the box to make it a full CLEAN install that resets all old settings (if any found).</p>
<p>-Reboot again</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case the problem was solved with this. Hope this helps others where to look at! :-)</p>

                    <p>I am new to Windows 10 and have managed to sync two of my email addresses.&nbsp; However, Ymail (my main email account) will not sync.&nbsp; It tells me to update the account, I retype the password, nothing.&nbsp; When I have to do it again after another failed sync, it
 has not saved the password and shows something else.&nbsp; Again I re-enter the password and it still won't sync.&nbsp; I get a notification saying my Ymail settings are out of date.&nbsp; I type in the password, still the sync fails.&nbsp; I have tried all the suggested fixes
 and nothing works.&nbsp; I did get an error code of 0x80004005.&nbsp; I tried everything that they said to fix it and still Ymail will not sync.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it my Windows settings?&nbsp; Could somone please help, and perhaps tell me what the settings should be to allow Ymail to
 sync.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks - I am losing patience!!!!!</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thank you for your response.&nbsp;It is in relation to the Mail App which comes up in the Start menu that I am having trouble with.&nbsp;
 It syncs my other two email addresses&nbsp;but will not sync my Ymail emails which are my most important ones. &nbsp;I have tried the two things you suggested, but nothing was found in Troubleshooting and the Proxy Server settings were unclicked.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Further information for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I received a notification telling me my Ymail settings were out of date so I retyped the password again because it was blank and
 is obviously not saving the password.&nbsp; I try to re sync the account again and it&nbsp;takes several minutes, then it comes up with&nbsp;a box saying "Attention Required" and "Please update the password for this account".... which I do and SAVE it.&nbsp; Then I tried to re
 sync&nbsp;the account again.&nbsp;&nbsp; After a further six minutes it comes up with the same "Attention Required" Box.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If I right click on the Ymail Account
 Settings it already shows that a longer password has been&nbsp;entered, so I replace that with my current and correct Ymail password and Save it.&nbsp; I then try to sync again and the "Attention Required" box comes up with a blank password box which I complete again
 and Save.&nbsp; It won't even start the syncing process now and keeps going back to the box asking for my password...............it&nbsp;appears to be going round in circles.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Also, in the Ymail&nbsp;Account&nbsp;Settings box I cannot "Change Mailbox Sync Settings" as this box is greyed out.&nbsp; I have also checked
 and rechecked my&nbsp;independent Ymail Account Settings and can't see anything wrong and am still&nbsp;getting the&nbsp;Notifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Are there other settings I&nbsp;should be checking?&nbsp;&nbsp;Any step by step suggestions would be appreciated.&nbsp; Many thanks&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Multi row taskbar settings are lost on reboot &#40;explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattcoll  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multi row taskbar settings are lost on reboot &#40;explorer restart.&#41;</h2>
                    <p>For years i have configured my Windows taskbar with two rows - instead of the default single row.<br />
<br />
With multiple toolbars active this works better for me split over two distinct rows.<br />
<br />
This has been possible since around windows 7 i think, but it has always had a really annoying bug - in that on restart of the machine - the two row layout is reset to a single row</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Double row</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76c57620-e272-466e-a1e3-2d32df71150f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76c57620-e272-466e-a1e3-2d32df71150f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After restart it returns to a <strong>Single Row</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d672f6c-9912-4de3-b7f6-363e3c563001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d672f6c-9912-4de3-b7f6-363e3c563001" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to stress - this is not a new problem with any particular machine - but a consistent "shortcoming" in the retention of the settings in windows.<br />
<br />
Or am i missing some setting that "retains" the taskbar settings.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
Matt</p>

<p><span>Hi <strong>Matt</strong>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The settings that you’ve made with the taskbar may haven’t retained due to software conflicts or an application is possibly causing the issue when you’ve set the multi-row in the taskbar. To learn more about your concern, we’d like to ask the questions
 below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Which Windows <strong>version</strong> and <strong>build</strong> is installed on your computer? To get this information, type
<strong>winver</strong> in the search box.</span></li><li><span>Are you using any <strong>third-party applications</strong> that are pinned on your taskbar?</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the meantime, try to lock the taskbar after making the changes. Right-click the taskbar and select
<strong>Lock all taskbar</strong>. Then, restart your computer and check if you'll see still see the multi-row. Please refer to the screenshot below:</span></p>

</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We can also isolate this behavior by performing a <strong>clean boot</strong>. This will help us identify if there are applications that may cause the issue to change it from the default settings. Click

 to personalize the taskbar and restart your PC. Then, verify if the it will have the same result.</span></p>

<p>Do you have a real mouse?&nbsp; Some Touchpads have a option which inhibits their use then.&nbsp; Then the reason that you weren't seeing a pointer would be because you were not moving the pointer with the real mouse.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>

<p>Anytime game disc (or any disc for that matter) is inserted the console stays on the Xbox 360 (white logo screen) and when I press play it says attempting to read disc. The console make no noise and never plays disc, only gives message. New disc, old disc,
 movies, doesn't matter. &nbsp;Does not make a differnece when hard drive is removed and re inserted or console restarted. &nbsp;xbox live and all other gaming options working fine.</p>

<p>Is this what you are talking about?</p>
<p>Here is an MS article that tells you how to do it:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/Q184419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/Q184419</a></p>
<p>Before making any changes to your registry, back it up with this popular free tool:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html</a></p>
<p>Disabling this feature is generally not a good idea on workstations and home&nbsp;environments&nbsp;where applications and memory requirements might change frequently. &nbsp;XP usually knows what it is doing.</p>
<p>If you make the adjustment and are hoping for a performance increase, you may end up with a performance decrease as XP might then be forced to perform otherwise unnatural acts.</p>
<p>It is sometimes a good idea in a server environment where applications running are fairly static.</p>
<p>Surely you have read the myths and legends about this feature and how to use it&nbsp;appropriately.</p>
<p>You can read all about it by performing a Google search for:</p>
<p>DisablePagingExecutive</p>
<p>Maybe you will get some benefit from it in your environment.</p>
<p>You can certainly make the adjustment and hopefully do some timing measurements to see if things get better or worse and it would be&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;to know what happens.</p>
<p>After you conduct&nbsp;some before and after benchmarking performance tests to see what effect it has on your system, get back to us with the results. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can pinpoint a specific issue you are having and why you think this might help, let us know about that too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;can always use more information.</p>

            I've done some tests with all possible DisablePagingExecutive subkeys =1, and than all =0, and I could not really see any difference in the Taskmanager/perfomance tab. At the bottom the Kernal Memory(K) pane kept on showing 68 MB paged and 24 MB non-paged.<br />
<br />
I then finally switched off the Virtual Memory and removed the Pagefile.sys file from the root. I've rebooted the computer a few times just to be sure there there was no pagefile on disk.<br />
<br />
However, the Kernal Memory(K) pane in the Taskmanager/perfomance tab still shows 74 MB paged and 24 MB non-paged, although there is definitely no pagefile on disk. All this makes me wonder what the exact definition is of notions like "Pagefile", "Paging out
 to disk" and especially how to interpret the info in the Taskmanager?!<br />
<br />
I did notice, though, that applications run indeed a bit faster, until they crash when the system reaches the 1 GB limit (the RAM size in my case).<br />

The whole paging issue of the Kernel remains a bit of mystery in Windows XP, I think.<br />

<p>Don't bother with these tweaks, there is little to gain from most of them and some are just plain detrimental.&nbsp; Don't try to run without a pagefile, as you have already seen it just causes problems that you don't need.</p>

<h2>            XBox One wired controller&#58; left stick triggers right stick</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My XBox One wired controller was working fine until recently, when suddenly the right stick was being triggered when using the left stick. I.e.: in a third-person game, I would move with the left stick, and the camera would spin around, or in a dual-stick
 shooter, I would move in a direction and it'll fire in that direction even though I'm not touching the right stick. It's an on-and-off problem; sometimes it does this and sometimes it doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked in joy.cpl, and the left stick triggers only the X rotation; the right stick triggers X and Y. This doesn't seem like what it should be doing, but I'm not sure since I've never used that panel before. I tried unplugging the controller and plugging
 it back in, to no avail, tried calibrating it there and in Steam Big Picture, but still having the problem? Is the controller just broken? Thanks.</p>

<p>¿Por qué pasa esto?, en mi anterior xbox 360 (antes de descomponerse) tenia todos mis juegos digitales y todos funcionaban sin Internet, ¿no se supone que el always online ya no se iba a hacer???, no saben que coraje me dio, me esforcé mucho en ahorrar dinero
 para <span>&nbsp;</span>comprar un nuevo xbox 360 (por cierto es la versión Xbox 360 E, la que viene con el FIFA 14 de regalo) y que Microsoft me salga con este chistecito ¿y si a mi me gusta jugar sin Internet? ¿y si el día de mañana decido por x razón cancelar
 mi servicio de internet?, mi xbox solo va a ser un pisapapeles caro, espero que puedan ayudarme a no arrepentirme de mi invercion</p>

<p>bueno pueden ser un par de cosas</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>una que el servicio de xbox se haya caido y que no se pueda tener acceso a todo en ese momento</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>otra que tal vez te falte alguna actualizacion para esto asi que deberias de checar si no te llega el mensaje de actualizar
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>en realidad no existe el always online, pero a veces hace sus raros</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>como veo pudo haberse dañado tu perfil al desconectarse del live y al querer volver hacerlo o hacerlo off line ya no te dejo</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>aunque parezca curioso pero te recomiendo que le borres el cache a la consola y tal vez se resuelva tu caso asi de facil</p>

<p>Lo que pasa es que ese juego no es completamente tuyo. A lo que voy es a que no tienes las licencias activas de ese juego. Y no lo vas a poder jugar offline con tu perfil. Y si estas online solamente tu perfil lo va a poder jugar.</p>
<p>La solucion es simple adquiere las licencias del juego y listo. Si no sabes como ve a la opcion de transferir licencias.</p>

<p>Disculpen, a mí me sale lo mismo y me bota del juego, pero ese juego sí es mío (me lo dieron en Games With Gold) y estoy en 360. Se me había cancelado la suscripción pero la renové a los pocos días. Igual me sale que tengo 10 minutos, y de fondo a parece
 como si el juego fuera a actualizarse pero ya no termina porque me saca al menú principal :(</p>

<p>@WarblingEye Como ya se dijo, <strong>la solución es transferir las licencias</strong>, así demostrarás que los juegos son tuyos. Aunque no se explicó bien como hacerlo. Estar conectado a Xbox Live (primordial), desde la consola ir a Configuración/Cuenta/Transferencia
 de licencias/continuar. Listo, ahora también se podrá jugar sin internet, no más cuenta regresiva.</p>

<p>Cuando compras un juego te dan una licencia de consola y una licencia de perfil, para jugar online necesitas licencia de consola, si solo tienes licencia de perfil necesitas estar conectado a internet forzosamente, si compraste tus juegos y despues cambiaste
 de consola es necesario hacer transferenca de licencias.</p>
<p>&nbsp;y como comenta "Warblingeye24" Los juegos descargados a traves de "games whit gold" solo te reglan licencia de perfil, no de consola... En pocas palabras necesitas estar conectado a internet y tener Gold activa, de otra anera no podras jugarlos...</p>

<p>Acabo de comprar una segunda consola X360 nueva de paquete, la empecé a usar hace 6 días, la transferencia de ambas licencias (las que mencionas) para juegos &nbsp;'Games with GOLD' y juegos comprados a sido un éxito. Al principio me pasó lo mismo que a "Warblingeye24"
 y "Avallavch", no podía jugar los juegos 'Games with GOLD' sin internet, pero una vez hecha la transferencia de licencias ya explicada, ES POSIBLE JUGAR SIN INTERNET juegos GOLD adquiridos en otra consola.</p>
<p>Hace un par de minutos he vuelto a transferir otro juego 'Games with GOLD' (TC's RainbowSix Vegas2) a la nueva consola y el resultado a sido el mismo.</p>
<p>Y sobre tener Gold activo para jugar los susodichos juegos pues, el perfil que uso NO TIENE GOLD y arrancan sin ningún problema, sin internet, sin suscripción GOLD.</p>
<p>PD: Lo que mencionas actualmente sucede en Xbox One ;)</p>

<h2>            Frequent Bugchecks Type 133 with parameters &#40;1, 1e,0,0&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My computer crashes hourly with this bugcheck. It doesn't seem consistent as to when it does it. The only app I had open this last time was VirtualBox - I was running an Ubuntu VM under VirtualBox.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It only appears to behave this way when it is unattendede. On the most recent occasion I had started a long running job on my guest VM. Waited 5 minutes, saw that it was running OK and left to do some other chores. On returning to the computer about 15 minutes
 later, it had rebooted after this bug check. So maybe it is related to sleep/wakeup?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thank you for any help/support on this issue. I have attached this morning's minidump and the output from msinfo32.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for equipment configuration, I think everything is in the msinfo32 output. The c: drive is an SSD of 128GB. It has 49.4GB free. There is also a Goflex mountable drive of 1TB (mounted as E:, on a USB) and a hard disk (mounted as D;) of 2TB</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this in my event log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following boot-start or system-start driver(s) did not load: <br />
dam<br />
EhStorClass</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>After some time I got another BSOD telling me that a driver had failed. This one was terminal. I couldn't repair the system, I couldn't reboot, I couldn't perform any sensible diagnosis. I eventually did a reinstall of Windows 10 (the version that allowed
 me to keep all my own data, but I had to reinstall all applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gradually been adding applications back. So far, so good. But I have only added back Office, Chrome, and a couple of others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a log that has been retained somewhere that shows the Verifier output so I can at least get a clue as to which driver caused it. By the time I was able to look at the computer it had gone way past giving useful diagnostic data and just told me it
 couldn't be repaired.</p>

    <title>Dealing with extreme lag after a Windows 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john ec  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dealing with extreme lag after a Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Good day everyone. I have been a holdout in upgrading to Windows 10 but recently decided to bite the bullet and do it. The upgrade process itself seemed to go smoothly. Immediately after upgrading, my programs seemed to work fine and all was well. The first
 sign of trouble came the next day after I had my computer turned off. Once on, most anything I opened seemed to lag. The only exception being Chrome or any other browser worked fine. I work in Excel most days and trying to navigate a spreadsheet was painful.
 I would click in one cell and then try to click in another but it would not respond. Strangely, if I moved my mouse cursor away from the spreadsheet (to one of my other two monitors), it would complete the move. The lag was not isolated to Excel though. Even
 pulling up a resource monitor would take a while to respond. I was so desperate the other day to get Excel working, I went to the store to purchase Office 2016 to upgrade from my 2010. When I got back and was preparing to install it, I noticed that everything
 was working fine again and the lag had gone away! The next day though, it was the same thing again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not appear to be a resource issue. At least not something I can see visually. CPU stays at about 1% and memory uses less than 30% of the 16 GB available. I'm hoping someone can help me narrow this down. I'm no tech expert but I can probably follow
 any basic instructions.&nbsp; Btw, I have checked to make sure all of my hardware and software is up to date. Thanks.</p>

            Hi John.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />For 10 days you can roll back Version 1803 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />To try to fix it, go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Let me just ask this so I'm clear. I did not update Windows 10 here. I was using Windows 7 and found that I could still upgrade for free to Windows 10 so I downloaded and upgraded. Are you saying there is a way I can back out of Windows 10 and get back to
 Windows 7? This would help at least temporarily so I can get my work done. Please advise. Thanks.

<p>When I look at the Recovery tab, the only options I see available are, "Reset this PC" and "Advanced startup" I don't see an option to go back to Windows 7 now. I read that I had 30 days but I just upgraded 2 or 3 days ago. Not sure what's happening. Can
 you tell me what would happen if I used that Hide Update tool you mentioned above if I have upgraded to Windows 10 from 7? If it rolls back the update, will it reinstall Windows 7?</p>

            You can do the Reset which will save your files, but you'll need to reinstall your programs.  This may solve many of the problems you're facing without having to do all the steps in the Clean Install (which is still a far better install).

            The Hide Updates tool only works in Windows 10.  
<br />
<br />I would do all the steps I've given earlier to try to fix your install, or since I don' t see any motivation to try to improve the install , I'd do the automated Reset you found which might resolve it.
