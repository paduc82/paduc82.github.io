<h2>            How boot from flash drive</h2>
                    <p>How can I boot from a usb stick on my surface pro 3?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the windows article about holding volume down, pressing power, and then releasing volume down when the surface logo appears. However that doesn't work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It isn't possible for me to use any gui because start menu search and actions bar do not work (botched windows 10 upgrade). The only thing I can really do use a command prompt or run via task manager. This is either during regular bootup or safemode.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate
 if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Are all the device drivers and Windows updates are updated?</li><li>Did you make any significant changes prior to the issue?</li><li>What is the model number of your laptop?&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are getting a blue and white flickering screen. This type of issue generally occurs if display drivers get corrupted or outdated and need an update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the below mentioned methods and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Step 1: Boot the computer in Safe Mode</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let’s boot the computer in Safe Mode and check if issue reappears. Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you’re using. You may refer to the article mentioned below to boot the computer in safe mode.</span></p>

</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2: Perform Clean Boot</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If your computer works fine in safe mode, I would suggest you to perform clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

</p><p><span><span><strong>Note</strong><span>: Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>If issue persist, I would suggest you to update the <strong>display drivers</strong> and then check the status of your issue. You may refer to the steps provided in the article mentioned below to update the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drivers are updated occasionally. Windows can update them automatically, or you can install the updated drivers yourself. It's important for you to have confidence in the updated drivers you install. Windows notifies you if it detects a suspicious or unsafe
 driver you shouldn't install.</p>

</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If it shows that all drivers are up to date and updated then try to update the drivers from the manufacturer's website and then see if it helps you to fix the issue or not.</p>

    <title>Where do I find an extra-long cable to connect my SP3 docking station - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ramzid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where do I find an extra-long cable to connect my SP3 docking station to an external monitor&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I need an extra-long cable (18 ft or longer) to connect my SP3 docking station to my external monitor. It needs to be that long because of my home office setup. I wasn't able to find any mini-DP to Displayport longer than 15ft. I tried using a displayport&nbsp;extension
 cable but that didn't work well because of signal loss. What are my options? Are there any manufacturers who make mini-DP to Displayport cables this long? Should I try another extension cable or look for Mini-DP to HDMI cable instead?
</p>
<p>Is there an advantage of using Displayport compared to HDMI? </p>
<p>
</p><p>My external monitor resolution is 3440x1440</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>I would probably recommend to go to http://www.tigerdirect.com and get their support phone number and call them.&nbsp; Tell them what your configuration is (they sell Surface Pro 3's and HDMI cables) and they may even test it out, make a recommendation, and sell
 the proper cable to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have the HDMI adapter already for the Surface Pro 3, basically, all you need is the cable (male to male).&nbsp; HDMI cables are available at almost any length.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a limit for distance from the computer due to signal loss because of resistance in the cable and I think that is about 100'.&nbsp; They can check that specification for you as well if you discover that you may need a longer cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure you have some slack.</p>

            <p>A better solution for me would be to find a long cord for my docking station power&nbsp;adapter but I couldn't find it anywhere! It is annoying how short Microsoft makes their power cords without offering options!</p>

            <p>Well, even if they did, the HDMI cable is cheaper and Microsoft's A/C adapters are exotic and very rare to find something compatible as a replacement if one even broke.&nbsp; HDMI cables are everywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can, however, check with Amazon.com and do a search for "Surface Pro 3 A/C adapters and cables".&nbsp; There are some 3rd party companies working to make those and there may even be an extension cable in the mix.</p>

            <p>The displayport basically "is" HDMI.&nbsp; It is a newer interface being used for devices that by default, output HDMI and you can generally find some cables that have a mini-plug at one end and a standard plug on the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The port, however, can have adapters (if made) to output VGA and DVI as well.&nbsp; I didn't check to see if a VGA adapter was made for the Pro 3 but one was available for the earlier models.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The adapter you get is wired for the particular device it is designed for to the HDMI output.&nbsp; Apple makes one as well for theirs and it may also be compatible with the Pro 3 (not tested by me, but I do have one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question with the docking station is why it requires an adapter and does not have a standard port like all other docking stations on the market!&nbsp; Pretty stupid design, if you ask me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I ever get a docking station for my Pro 3, I will gut it and rebuild it from the ground up internally.</p>

            <p>So I bought the MiniDP mirosoft adapter and a 20ft HDMI cable from Amazon that supports up to 4k/60Hz resolution but it failed to transmit signal. I'm not sure if this is related to the cable length or cable quality. Any suggestions? Is it worth it to try
 a signal booster?</p>

            A signal booster "may" work because it looks like the video port is not putting out enough power.&nbsp; Drawback of a tablet.&nbsp; See if you can find one to test before spending any money.&nbsp; A Best Buy store may even help you out.

<h2>            Windows 7 keeps trying to install updates unsuccessfully - can&#39;t stop it &#47; fix it</h2>
                    What's the deal? Windows 7 x64 home hasn't been able to install updates for the past month. It keeps trying to install them during shut down, then when it reboots it says 'completing the install' or whatever, says 'failed to install, reverting back...'
 , reboots again, then we're OK. I try and disable the updates by unchecking the boxes but Windows 7 seems to ignore my requests and keeps installing the same updates each time I shut down, causing major annoying delays when shutting down and rebooting each
 day.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't know what to do but have run the 'fix it' thingy which was, as expected, useless. I've also heard that an option is installing each update individually, which makes me laugh because I'm way to busy to do that for the 50 something updates its requesting,
 let alone writing this email to begin with. I just want everything to work the way it was before.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And please, no suggestions to run the 'troubleshooter guide' - we all know that that NEVER solves anything and just wastes more of my time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows support please.</div>

    <title>After switched microsoft account to local acount, Metro App cannot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> d. anuwat  say:</h3>
<h2>            After switched microsoft account to local acount,  Metro App cannot sign in</h2>
                    I found this problem in my new home PC (has many user accounts).<br />
After I used microsoft account to log in to my user account, it could use metro app (mail, message, skype, people...) without any problem.<br />
But when I switched back to local account (with password) , it could switch back to local account. However, I cannot use metro app that require microsoft account at all.
<br />
All of them show after i opened app "We're having trouble signing you in, Try again in a few minutes", without any error code.<br />
At setting of problemed app, shows nothing than permission , rate and review....<br />
<br />
I used to switch back on my notebook without any problem (it has 1 user account anyway) ... I don't know why it happened to my new home PC.<br />
Any idea to resolve it? <br />
<br />
Thanks <br />

            <p>Hi Anuwat,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you facing the issue with Local account or Microsoft Account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are on Local account, when you click on an app for example Mail app, it would request you to
<b>Add your Microsoft Account</b>. You need to enter the details and then sign-in. If you have already added a Microsoft Account and then if you get the error, follow these methods:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow these steps and run the <b>
Internet Connections</b> troubleshooter:</p>
<p>a. Open <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/where-is-control-panel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Control panel</a>.</p>
<p>b. Click on <b>Troubleshooting</b>.</p>
<p>c. Click <b>View all</b> on the left pane of the screen.</p>
<p>d. In the list of options, click on <b>Internet Connections</b>.</p>
<p>e. Click <b>Next</b> and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>app troubleshooter</b></a> which would check if there are any issues with an app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the results.</p>

I am facing issue with local account.<br />
The apps show only "We're having trouble signing you in, Try again in a few minutes" in screen, cannot add or remove account at all.<br />
<br />
After following method 1 and 2 .... problem still remains.<br />

            <p>Hi Anuwat,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you using any proxy internet connection on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p>I would suggest you to temporarily disable or uninstall third party anti-virus software temporarily and then check if the issue persists. Follow these steps to uninstall any third party anti-virus software:</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <b>
Search</b>.</p>
<p>(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<b>Search</b>.)</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Enter “<b>appwiz.cpl</b>” without quotes in the search box, tap or click
<b>Apps</b>, and then tap or click <b>appwiz.cpl</b>. </p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Uninstall any third party anti-virus software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Running the computer without firewall or the anti-virus software is a potential threat to the computer; make sure to enable the security software after completing the troubleshooting steps and after identifying the
 issue.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p>Check to see if <b>User Account Control (UAC)</b> has been turned off. You need to have UAC enabled for Windows Apps to work:</p>
<p>a. Go to <b>Start</b> Screen.</p>
<p>b. Type “<b>Control Panel” </b>without quotes.</p>
<p>c. Tap or click on <b>User Accounts</b>.</p>
<p>d. Click on <b>'Change User Account Control Settings</b>'.</p>
<p>e. Do not set to ‘<b>Never Notify</b>’ or UAC will be turned off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the results.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, <br />
method 1: I use windows defender as anti-virus software from start. <br />
method 2: my UAC has been turned on all time.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not sure about my altered register about user selection.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I tried to create a new local account with admin privilege (without any microsoft account info).<br />
It cannot sign-in to windows store.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can enter store but when try to push sign-in button, it does not show input box for entering id and password, just show nothing.<br />
<br />
Also I tried to enter mail , message , people,&nbsp; same problem as before.&nbsp; it does not show where to register your account for app.<br />
<br />
I think something wrong with user account system now.<br />
Because, now when standard user tried to change setting to system, normally it will show pop-up dialog asking admin permission . Right now, it tried to pop-up the dialog but immediately closed.<br />
<br />

<p>It would be nice if they could actually release a patch that would make the game more stable for those who have suffered the reset glitch and freezing issues, before they release DLC like everything is perfectly fine with the game</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>But the DLC has gotten good reviews so far, so no doubt it will be very popular for those who get it, but for me, until the game is more stable, not investing money or time into it

<p>i've been sat for an hour n a half trying to d/l this. it keeps cancelling and it taking forever. checked my tinterwebz and that is fine so i can't see why (other then a huge amount of people all trying to d/l it at the same time) for why its taking so long.
 89% of 1.29gb whoop whoop looks like i am not going to get to play much of it tonight.

<p>Both the raid boss's are once per 24 hours (so if someone joins you who HAS killed it that day, you can't do it with them in) and have the mega crappy 0.00001% drop rates like the rest of the game -_-</p>
<p>Also seem to be tuned for the bee to not work well, the first raid boss I can not kill on my own, got no chance :/</p>

<p>this is absolutely brilliant only done the first few missions but for level 50 like myself it just adds to the game which is great,and about ya badass rank reset thats not the end of the world i mean ya can play the game perfectly fine with out ya badass
 rewards activated its just a bonus really so @cokney charmer dont let that put u off cause u was really enjoying it seems a shame to miss out on the dlc,seen as tho ya game didnt cost ya anything i would say its defo wort a punt even without your badass bonuses
 so go on take the plunge,its actually a good deal to get the season pass as it includes 4 major story campaign add ons and the first is around 8-10 hrs also 800 points each otherwise so ya actually get one free by pirchasing the season pass</p>

<h2>            Audio and Cursor lag - After recent Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday my Asus laptop did a Windows 10 update (already previously running windows 10) and now there is a problem with the Audio making Short "Buzz or Crackling" sounds intermittently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the Cursor has started to Lag or freeze for a millisecond when using the touchpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of these problems have only started since the update yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice or resolutions to these issues out there.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back with a reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are experiencing this issue and do not want to wait for the patch to be released, we recommend resolving the issue by temporarily uninstalling the Anniversary Update.&nbsp; We will try to release a patch as soon as our developers can.&nbsp;To uninstall the
 Anniversary Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Open the Settings app.<br />
2.&nbsp;Select Update &amp; security and then the Recovery tab. <br />
3.&nbsp;Under “Go back to an earlier build”, click the Get started button and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Note: The “go back” option will only appear for up to 10 days after installing the Anniversary Update.&nbsp; If more than 10 days have elapsed or the “Go back” option is otherwise not available, we ask for your patience until a patch can be released.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please
 check back on this thread for an update.)</p>

            <p>Ok, I have tried this and rolled back to a previous version and still have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Audio Crackle / Buzz, goes away when the computer is not plugged into the power charger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also downloaded and used a Latency Checker (DPC Latency Checker) and it spikes quite alot. It noticeably improves and stops spiking when I disable the "Microsoft AC Adapter" in the Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The audio buzz also goes away if I Disable the "Microsoft ACPI - Compliant Control Method Battery" from the device manager</p>
<p>

            <p>After having tried everything, except reinstalling Windows, I have come to the conclusion that it's a bug. Microsoft has not full control over language settings in Windows 10, apparently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue, most likely relating to the same cause, is that Windows Search does not return any hits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I switched back to 100% Swedish and now everything works. Too bad since I prefer English Display language.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned Windows search does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>

            <p>I am sorry, but I think you do not understand the problem correctly. Let me try to explain it again. I have the problem too and is as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing dutch, I decided to shift to English, because I read that this is possible. Now, if I type, for example, "language" in the search bar, I get as first hit "instellingen voor land/regio en taal", which is dutch for "country and region settings".
 So, the problem is that, although the search function apparently searches inside the English section&nbsp;"country and region settings" (otherwise it would not find a hit on the English word "language"), the hit that shows up is the dutch hit. When I then click
 on that, it cannot find it. (I guess because it then searches for the dutch settings file again, which is not there anymore, because I switched to English)<br />
I completely agree that this is a BUG, not something that happens because of incorrect settings.</p>

            Hi MimiWoodward   I'm Cristhian,an independent advisor willing to help
<br />
<br />thank you for posting your query. I understand you are attempting restore computer to an earlier point using windows 10
<br />
<br />This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point. Restore points are generated when you install a new app or driver, and when you create a restore point manually. Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.
<br />
<br />1. In the search box on the taskbar, type control panel, and then choose it from the list of results
<br />
<br />2. In the Control Panel search box, type recovery.
<br />
<br />3.Select Recovery &gt; Open System Restore.
<br />
<br />4.In the Restore system files and setting box, select Next.
<br />
<br />5.Select the restore point that you want to use in the list of results, and then select 
<br />
<br />Scan for affected programs.

            Hi Mimi
<br />
<br />System Restore is turned off in Windows 10 by default, but hopefully that may have been turned on at some point . . .
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, then just type restore
<br />
<br />Click 'Create a Restore Point' in the resulting list (its counter-intuitive)
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, select your C drive, is the System Restore Button enabled?
<br />
<br />If so, you will have a restore point to go back yo - click that button and choose a restore point . . .
<br />

<h2>            Stuck on welcome screen.</h2>
                    <p><span>I am currently having an issue with my windows 7 64-bit computer running windows 7 home-premium. When I boot up my computer I get stuck on the welcome screen with the little circle "Its moving so it’s not completely frozen". When I run windows 7 in
 safe mode all works fine. The problem started after the update: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2742613?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2742613?wa=wsignin1.0</a> failed. I tried all the possible solution I can think of but still doesn’t work. I started off with scanning my computer with windows defender offline then a Start-up Repair after I try the System Restore
 to reverse the update but the start-up repair found a problem but failed to fix it and the system restore failed as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Help would be greatly appreciated.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Region and language</h2>
                    Is there any way for me to have my country as Mexico and for the language in the menus and games be English? The thing is, I prefer to play my games in English. If I have my language settings in English it forces me to choose an English speaking country
 which makes sense but I can't make any purchases since my credit card is from Mexico, and I live there. If I chose Spanish and Mexico the games' menus and the dialogues are in Spanish. Can anyone help me?

<p>Microsoft just need to return the SAME functionality that was available with the Xbox 360, and proclaiming it has anything to do with Kinect is ridiculous since the 360 allowed exactly this.</p>
<p>For the past two years I have had my 360 set to language English, location Germany and it has been fine, yes the Marketplace is displayed in German language but that is not a huge problem.</p>
<p>The fact that this has been a problem since launch and hasn't even been responded to on any of the several threads about it by OFFICIAL MS staff is just disappointing.</p>

<p>I'm really *** with this crap. I'm on the Xbox boat for over 10 years and this is the first time I'm feeling like I should have bought a PS4 this time.</p>
<p>I live in Austria and I have to change my region to UK to have english language on my games, which makes the whole store useless to me, since I can't use the region-specific apps or buy anything. Well, I can change the region again and restart the system,
 which takes an absurd amount of time. I'm playing LESS video game since I bought this crap, and that is probably one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Xbox One is a mess EVERYWHERE! And all that crap just makes everything slow.</p>
<p>Makes me *** that I bough a 500 euro console that is SLOWER than my from 2006.</p>
<p>I guess it's not too late to sell it and go Sony.</p>

<p>I'm in the same boat... I live in the Netherlands where English is a gamers second language.. and I have to switch my locale to the UK to get English screen texts.. playing Halo with dutch text is just utterly awful.. and it doesn't make sense that all the
 menu text is in English.. like what the hell? Can we please have ONE Microsoft employee that is lurking around in these forums to at least confirm it will be fixed in the (near) future? Because I now have to switch back and forth my locale if I want English
 text or be able to use my Paypal. And I don't even know if having my locale on UK had any impact on matchmaking thinking I live in the UK and will connect me to the wrong servers or something...</p>

<h2>            Legality of Using Windows 7 Key on Clean Install of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to upgrade my existing PCs from Windows 7 Professional and Windows 7 Ultimate to Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was researching online and discovered the solution of the ability to clean install Windows 10 Pro using a USB flash drive and using my existing, genuine OEM Windows 7 license keys attached to my computer or a genuine full product retail key. I read about
 how the solution was bound to work 100% by giving my PCs a 'digital license'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I want to make sure I am acquiring this software legally, for business protection and integrity purposes. There is no official Microsoft documentation of this workaround and I want to make sure I am staying on the legal green-side, not breaching
 any EULAs or laws.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,<br />
Matt<br />

            Hi Matthew.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />That method of activating the free Upgrade was extended after the Free Upgrade ended more than two years ago.  There are sporadic reports it still works.  But I would save a System Image backup first so you can go back to Windows 7 at any time in 20 minutes:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>
<br />
<br />Then  following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />SKip the key during install and afterwards try inserting it in Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation &gt; Change Product Key.   If it works you'll have permanent Digital License for that version on the PC. 
<br />
<br /> If not you'll need to buy a Product Key or go back to WIndows 7.  Buy only from Microsoft or a major retailer that back their sales, as any discount key for retail WIndows 10 is most likely bogus:  <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-10-Home/productID.319937100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Unable to turn on hyper-V in Windows Features - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drprofpenguinmaster  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to turn on hyper-V in Windows Features</h2>
                    So I've recently decided to try my hand in making some windows phone apps, but on my first test of my app, it said that hyper-v wasn't started. The Windows Features window pops up, I enable it, my computer restarts, and one the configuring setting page,
 it says "Failure to configure settings, resetting to previous" (not verbatum but close enough).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I've tried reinstalling the windows phone SDK, still wouldn't let me turn on hyper-V. I've tried disabling all non-Microsoft start up processes, I've updated my computer, cleaned caches, updated the .net framework, made sure all the virtualization
 stuff was turned on in my BIOS, and probably a few other things I've forgotten to mention. The problem isn't with the Windows Phone IDE, but something to do with windows 8. Also, I am running Windows 8 Pro, so as far as I can tell from what info I can find
 I should be meeting all the prerequisites, but I'm obviously missing something &gt;.&lt;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I really appreciate whatever help I can get and I'm willing to take any suggestion at this point.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you so much any one who answers</div>
                </div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
In Windows 8, to use client Hyper-V, it requires a 64-bit system with second level address translation (SLAT) capabilities and additional 2 GB of RAM (Windows 8 Pro only).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your system meets all these requirements and still if you are unable to turn on Hyper V on your Windows 8 computer, then I would suggest you to post this question on the TechNet&nbsp;Forums from the below given link:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hope this information is helpful. You may post all your queries related to Windows on Microsoft Community Forum and we will be happy to help.</p>

<h2>            Change GT feature bug</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,<br />
some months ago I changed my gamertag from "ReprovedAnTo" to "I Anto I". I have realized a few weeks ago that in Xbox.com and every other website it shows "I ANTO I" instead of the correct spelling "I Anto I".<br />
It's annoying, how can it get fixed?</p>
