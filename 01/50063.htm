<h2>            Cached local credentials allowed to login with expired password after it has been changed.</h2>
                    <p>I cannot seem to find the answer to my question -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scenario </p>
<p>
</p><p>An employee in a high profile position was recently terminated from my company.&nbsp; Typically we disable the account,&nbsp; but were asked just to change the password for this account.&nbsp; In error, security allowed this employee back on the property, where he/she
 was able to login to his/her computer from the lock screen using the previous password.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tested with other accounts and determined, even if the computer is connected to the network and communicating with the domain, a user is allowed to login in from a locked screen (1) time before the system recognizes the password has changed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This allows access to the system along with files.&nbsp; If the user then locks the machine, the cached credentials will not work again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence we are changing our off-boarding procedures, however I am wondering if this is configurable and if so where?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Press the Start button, blue power light blinks once, accessory lights blink once then nothing</h2>
                    <p>I have a HP Elitebook 8740W running Win 10 Pro. When I press the start button the power light on the front of the laptop comes on for 2 seconds, then the accessory lights across the top of the keyboard blinks once, then nothing happens. The screen is blank.
 If I hold the Start button down, the power light stays on for about 9 seconds then the accessory lights blink and then the screen is blank.</p>
<p>I have removed the battery and power wire, then held down the Start button for 30 seconds. Put the battery back in and the power plug. No change is anything.</p>
<p>The power light does not come on when the laptop is plugged in.</p>
<p>Any ideas on what to do now.</p>

<p>Hi Chuck, it sounds like a hardware issue . . . <br />
<br />
Here is the LED codes for HP laptops, see if any of those matches what you are seeing . . .
<br />

<br />
Try this, pull the battery and disconnect the power lead, leave your laptop like that for 30 minutes. Then reconnect everything and see if it kicks into life . . .

<h2>            Systemservice.exe</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lately I've been noticing the sudden appearence of two cmd instances which usually dissapear as soon as the appear, but sometimes the second is there long enough to read the path of the process and says to be&nbsp;C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Systemservice\Systemservice.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>The containing folder has 4 files. The .exe, another .cmd with the same name which calls to the .exe and I assume these two are the responsible for the two cmd instances and finally servicedaily and servicelog with no extension and with 0 kb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Kaspersky Total Security and I have run a complete analysis and nothing shows up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what is possibly triggering the processes, and I don't know if it could be something related, but sometimes I hear the processor fan working very hard with no appareant reason and when I press Ctrl + Alt + Esc to check which process is working
 that hard the fan slows down whithin seconds and the % of processor usage drops to the normal ~5% like when you use the pc just for reading of something like that. Is like whatever is consuming process usage feels when I'm looking for it and hides!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a bit worried that I might have a worm or malware and I just wanted to share this and ask if this have happened to someone or if someone knows something about it. Or if Systemservice.exe is even a microsoft file that it is supposed to exist in my computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            This is expected behavior. &nbsp;Unlike old "tube" CRT monitors, LCD panels can only show one resolution -- because they have a specific number of pixel dots available. &nbsp;When the resolution is designed to be 1600x900, that's because that's exactly how many
 pixels their are on your horizontal and vertical axis.
<div><br />
<div>If you choose a smaller resolution, you are literally telling the computer to use less dots. &nbsp;It has two choices:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>It can use fewer dots, but double up the size of them to stretch out the image to try to fit the display. &nbsp;This results in the full display being used, but everything becoming slightly blurry and distorted (circles no longer appear round, for example).<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>It can do exactly what you asked, using exactly the number of dots you want, and simply keeping the rest of the dots turned off (black border).</li></ol>
<div>Some -- and only some -- computer graphics systems have options to choose which method they use when you change your resolution. &nbsp;But this happens at the hardware layer and Windows cannot control (or even detect) these options. &nbsp;You'll have to look at
 the settings for your ATI graphics card or even contact them directly to learn more about the capabilities of your graphics card.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; Look in windows.old folder</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Browse through C:\Program Files to find the program (.exe), right-click it, select Copy, browse to C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs, right-click any blank area in the window, and select Paste Shortcut. That will give you the Start
 Menu (All Programs) shortcut back.<br />
<br />
3) It might have to do with the administrative permissions<br />
<br />
1. Just type gpedit.msc in the search programs and file box.<br />
2. In the left panel of the new window go to User Configuration -&gt; Administrative Templates -&gt; Start Menu and Taskbar .<br />
3. In the right panel right click on Remove All Programs list from the Start menu and click on edit.<br />
4. In the new window select Not Configured and click Ok<br />

                    <p>Sorry, but this is not helpful at all (response to prior question).</p>
<p>When computer set up, my name is spelled one way (not the correct spelling). I have been trying to figure how how to make this correction for months now. It's in all types of locations, i.e. Users, backup, etc. Sometimes both spellings appear in
 the same file folder, etc.</p>
<p>Has nothing to do with any email accounts.</p>
<p>I use Live Mail, and my name is spelled correctly.</p>
<p>OS: Windows 10</p>
<p>Appreciate any help you can give.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>The hard drive is required because it has the emulation software required to run Xbox originals. Non-officials hard drives don't have that software so that's why I asked if yours was official. Sometimes people will buy a hard drive from Ebay because it's
 cheap, but they're usually knock-offs and don't work the same way.</p>

<p>[quote user="ExplosiveRounds"]wow! its works with my original 20gb hard drive, wtf,[/quote]Methinks your 120GB HDD is a knock-off and is missing something.[quote]why the hell does it need a hard drive for in the first place?[/quote]All games on the original
 XBOX could expect a 2GB cache partition on the integrated HDD. Official 360 HDDs have a 2GB cache partition explicitly for this purpose. This is why a 360 HDD is required to play original XBOX games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your 120GB HDD is apparently missing the cache partition. It's very likely that the drive is not an official 360 HDD accessory.</p>

            <p>I fixed it! The key was being able to update the driver software for a device that wasn't showing up anywhere in my driver list (even with the "show hidden items" option checked).</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. in Device Manager, right-click any device driver and select "update driver software"</p>
<p>2. when the "how do you want to search for driver software" box opens, select "browse my computer"</p>
<p>3. select "let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer". </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I did #3, I saw a generic MTP device. I clicked on that and got a driver update. Then, I saw a notification asking what to do when the Nexus 7 was attached and selected the "open files" option. That made my device (and its files) visible in File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Arrg! You had me hopeful, but this did not work for me. After I did that the phone companion popped up, but the file exploration was still shaded out. When trying to merely drag and drop in explorer it says that is disconnected even tho it's showing up in
 explorer.</p>

            I am also unable to get this working, despite following prior advice concerning the MTP driver. It is installed but still will not allow proper access, even to just view and certainly not to actually transfer.

            Typically, autorun.inf shouldn't be used on hard drives, especially hard drives that can't be removed without taking the PC apart.&nbsp; That's reason for concern, aye.<br />
<br />
The file is not itself a virus, but it's used by software both benevolent and malicious alike.&nbsp; It's a text file that tells Windows how to handle the Autorun feature of the drive.&nbsp; The file has two essential lines:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>icon=somefile.ico -- This tells Windows where the icon it should use for the drive is.</li><li>open=somefile.exe -- This tells Windows that it should open and run this program every time the drive is accessed.</li></ul>
<br />
If the autorun.inf file is being used toward a malicious end, then the "open=" line points to the actual virus/trojan/whatever sort of malware it is.<br />
<br />
What is the antivirus program you're using that said autorun.inf was blocked?&nbsp; Does it say why it was blocked?&nbsp; Also, are this antivirus program and its virus definitions both up to date?<br />

Hello-First time poster. My wife's HP Pavilion DV3000 laptop withWindows Vista recently experienced a spat of Blue Screen of Deaths(BSODs) on start up. Safe-Modes did not work as it wouldautomatically restart. We have not added any new hardware recently.I can only recall adding some memory but that was almost a year ago.We also bought a Logitech wireless NANO mouse, but again have used itfrequently with no issues. I managed to do a system recovery buthad to go all the way back to early in the year for a restore pointbefore it seemed to take. Last time I did a sys recov on it it wentback to the BSODs after I ran all updates. Attached should be theminidump file link (hopefully). I have noticed on similar posts with others on Win7that some have had problems with the Xfinity Constant Guard w/ NortonAV suite and other helpsites say it could be hardware. We are reallyembedded with the Xfinity **** and would hate to loose the purpose ofits functionality particularly the free Norton AV. If I sh

<p>90% of the time I go into a game it lags like crazy.</p>
<p>Does it have to do with my Strict Nat type?</p>

<p>Not specifically, no.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>However, Strict NAT will limit you to connecting with fewer people, which will limit your selection of good Hosts. It isn't exactly unlikely that there are more problems there too.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If you're experiencing lag every game, however, it is likely that you have someone using your network at the same time you're playing, or perhaps you're using wifi from too far away. You'd know more than we would about your network but NAT does not directly
 affect your connection, no.</p>

<p>Hey OP...you are not alone. This has been the laggiest COD yet for me...and a lot of my friends as well. Don't let a few fanbois try to convince you otherwise</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I dont think anyone has tried to convince him that its not the laggiest game for you or&nbsp;your friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been coming around these forums for years and every release is the laggiest release for some people. I dont think anyone questions that. Personally my experience has been that its been the least laggy of all that I've played. The laggiest was probably
 either bo2 or waw.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The worst lag I've experienced in any of them was in mw2 and bo&nbsp;.... but I found that it was an issue with my own internet provider and was able to fix it. Thats also the reason people give helpful tips rather than just criticising the game. ChainSmokingBob
 gave excellent advise. Strict nat will definitely limit the matchmaking possibities for him. Suggesting someone fix obvious issues on your own end isnt a "fanboy" answer .... its a&nbsp;sensible one.</p>

<p>its strange how it lags for some people and not for others, yes we know this but its just so so frustrating for those of us it does lag for, and because of this the game is simpy unplayable, for those of you that the game doesnt &nbsp;lag for, you have no idea
 how bad it is for us because it means thats another cod wasted, i dont get it though it was fine pre world at war, they must be doing something very different now. i can understand why people moan about lag so put yourself in our shoes, it would be interesting
 to know where everyone else is from and who it does or doesnt lag for, im gonna get to the bottom of this and please dont mention lag thingy with people who have the worse connections its suppose to be better, why cant they go back to the cod 4 days, that
 was perfect.</p>

<p>&nbsp; I can put myself in your shoes because I've dealt with it in the past. ..... and just made the best of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Switch up your tactics, watch the time of day you play, check everything you can think of with your internet and your router settings ..... different releases sometimes neeed different ports forwarded etc.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are having problems now, its probably because you were always lucky with a good connection before and just havent learned to adapt.</p>

            I'm having the same issue, but mine goes as far as several store apps as well as default apps. As you can see from this screenshot, the grayed out apps are just
<strong><em>some</em></strong>&nbsp;of the corrupt ones. Choosing uninstall gives me the same error as Kohit.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30b963fb-71a5-4517-b0b9-92e4ff0b2ead" />

            I have a similar error with all "Bing" Windows Store Apps.&nbsp; They won't launch or uninstall.&nbsp; I ran all of the suggestions here, to include powershell commands, system file checker, windows store reset.&nbsp; ALL OF THEM!&nbsp; I refuse to refresh or reinstall WIndows
 10 because of the all of the work.&nbsp; This is clearly a windows 10 store problem.

            Ditto on that...I am having identical problem with Store Apps. Says they are installed but can't open them or uninstall them. Tried all 3 methods described here and none worked.

            <p>Same issue here. I even spent one and a half hours on the phone with Microsoft support and they gave up. This is ridiculous. Windows 10 and the Store have a lot of operational problems. Isn't somebody going to help fix them?</p>

            <p>Hello Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the MS app and MS store issue is a greater problem than the IT engineers realise as there are so many forums on the web at this time for the exact same issues. After the latest Windows 10 update release and install, things&nbsp;have gone horribly&nbsp;wrong
 in computer land. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of my issues were/are:&nbsp; WiFi dropped off (despite confirmation that there was no actual connection issues); installed apps suddenly went blank and wouldn't work any more; apps couldn't be uninstalled/reinstalled; MS store is hit and miss, etc., etc..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did manage to get my WiFi back up again, but that was a real pain and took almost an entire day to accomplish. Eventually, as a last resort,&nbsp;I managed&nbsp;to get it back (strangely)&nbsp;via the use of a recovery file, however, I did lose a couple of other things
 in the process which grinds me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the remaining issues I still have, I've checked every system file I can think of, but no errors are showing up, I've run scans on the system, but no errors were found, I've tried your suggestion of safe mode to no avail, and, I've even tried to run
 the MS troubleshooter program, but it says that it cannot run as it is incompatible with the current version of Windows 10 (what the???).&nbsp; Overall I know that I have tried pretty much everything (and wasted so many hours of my time)&nbsp;trying to resolve the issues
 to no avail. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, Microsoft need to get in and find whatever the glitch is that is causing all of these issues and misery for everyone with Windows 10, then come up with a patch to fix the issue, but please, bench test that patch before it is released for install
 as&nbsp;I think we've suffered enough with the current glitches without adding any further misery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to you Microsoft.</p>

<h2>            How many partitions to delete with clean Windows 8 installation&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Okay I am planning to reinstall Windows 8 cleanly on my brother's ASUS S400CA notebook, however I have a doubt when it come to the partitions where I can install Windows on and delete once I get into the installer screen. I decided to check on Windows
 8's partition manager and I found a mess of partitions and I can't account for which one has to go. Here's what I see on screen...</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/485f86ee-d76d-4dc4-8ba9-098fb2c1100c" /></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Disks 2 and 3 are removable one is an external HDD and the other a USB flash drive. What I worry is in disk zero, as you can see there is an EFI partition with 300mb, then a 900mb recovery partition, then the C: drive where the OS is, and then three additional
 350mb recovery partitions. I wonder which of those I can delete when I install Windows 8 cleanly. This computer has some history my brother decided to test out the Windows 8.1 Consumer Preview when it came out in June and then he had to cleanly reinstall his
 laptop and I think is in that event where the discrepancy and additional recovery partitions lie. Can anyone tell me what I would need to do in order not to mess up the EFI partition on his drive? Also is Disk 1 an on-board SSD? I am not sure what that drive
 is because the computer claims to have come with only one standard HDD.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for any help on the matter.</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Remove Laptop from Windows 10</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Apparently Windows 10 will tie your laptop to your hotmail or other windows account. Your mail and such will be displayed on your laptop. I did not want this.&nbsp; Now I received the following instructions to reset my device (which
 requires re-installing photoshop, video editing, etc... from scratch..) Essentially it will keep windows products and then make you re-install everything else.&nbsp; Or you can do the 'Disconnect my Microsoft account' under settings. That is not a option that is
 displayed in Windows 10. ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Message from https://account.microsoft.com/</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>We removed your laptop at 8/13/2015, 9:22:46 PM. </p>
<p>Now, reset your device or remove your Microsoft account from it to make sure it won't show up here again.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reset your device: </p>
<p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update and security</strong> &gt; <strong>
Recovery</strong> </p>
<p>Under <strong>Reset this PC</strong>, tap or click <strong>Get started</strong>
</p>
<p>Follow the instructions on the screen </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To Remove your Microsoft account from your device: </p>
<p>Go to <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Accounts</strong> &gt; <strong>Your account</strong>
</p>
<p>Tap or click <strong>Disconnect my Microsoft account</strong>, and restart the device &nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>When you sign in with your Microsoft email address, the tiled apps will show your emails, photos and other account related details in your tiles. If you don't such personal information to be displayed on any tiles, you can just right click on the tile for
 that particular app and select 'Turn live tiles off' and these information won't be displayed anymore.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't want your Microsoft account details to be linked to your user account at all, then you can also disconnect your Microsoft account from your user account. To do this, click on the start button, click on 'Settings' and then click on 'Accounts'
 in the left pane. Under "Your accounts' section, click on 'Sign in with a local account instead'. Click on this option and follow the prompts to disconnect you unlink your Microsoft account.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
</strong><br />
This error is usually a driver&nbsp;issue and display adapter (video) driver is the most suspect though it
<br />
could be others.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs, hardware (heat) and major software issues
<br />
can also cause the error. When you get to the driver section of the troubleshooter use my generic<br />
methods in the next message and then return to the troubleshooter if needed. <br />
<br />
Have you added hardware recently or updated drivers? Be sure to look in Control Panel - Windows
<br />
Updates to see if any drivers were updated there. Other lessor possibilities include antivirus/anti-<br />
spyware/security programs.<br />
<br />
When you get to the driver and memory sections of the troubleshooter refer to the next message to
<br />
update drivers and test memory and then refer back to the troubleshooter if needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 7E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0x0000007E&nbsp; which is also 0x1000007E</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong>
<p>The SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a very common bug check. To
<br />
interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates a memory access violation occurred.
</li></ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the <em>Ntstatus.h </em>file that is located in the
<em>inc</em> directory of <br />
the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).</p>
Resolving the Problem
<p>If you are not equipped to debug this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have enough disk space. </li><li>If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the
</li><li>manufacturer for driver updates. </li><li>Try changing video adapters. </li><li>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. </li><li>Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. </li></ul>
<p><em>If you plan to debug this problem</em>, you might find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter&nbsp;2
<br />
(the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system
<br />
was started with the <strong>/NODEBUG</strong> switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly,
<br />
make sure that a kernel debugger is connected and the system is started with the <strong>
/DEBUG</strong> switch.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame supplies additional information.</p>
<p>If you do not know the specific cause of the exception, consider the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware incompatibility<em>. </em>Make sure that any new hardware that is installed is listed in the
</li><li>Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List. </li><li>Faulty device driver or system service<em>. </em>A faulty device driver or system service might be
</li><li>responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts,
</li><li>and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error. </li></ul>
<p>If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable
<br />
or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup
<br />
sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS file system, you might be able to use Safe
<br />
Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process
<br />
in Safe Mode, you must start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote<br />
control program. If such software is installed, you can remove the service by starting the computer
<br />
by using the Recovery Console and then deleting the offending system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help identify the
<br />
device or driver that is causing bug check 0x7E.</p>
<p>You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS might to try to resolve the error. You should also
<br />
run hardware diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, that the system manufacturer supplies.
<br />
For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or
<br />
after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is lack of disk space for installation and system
<br />
BIOS incompatibilities. For problems during Windows installation that are associated with lack of disk
<br />
space, reduce the number of files on the target hard disk drive. Check for and delete any temporary
<br />
files that you do not have to have, Internet cache files, application backup files, and
<em>.chk </em>files that <br />
contain saved file fragments from disk scans. You can also use another hard disk drive with more
<br />
free space for the installation. You can resolve BIOS problems by upgrading the system BIOS version.<br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info
<br />
that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other error

information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.
<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,
<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate
<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -
<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after
<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually
<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers
<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as
<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check <br />
manually by model. <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be
<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then
<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

</p><p>Thanks for reaching out! Unfortunately we would not be able to make the changes for the account ourselves. If this is related to the Xbox Insider Preview, I would advise to post in the

<p>
