<h2>            Touchpad problems with Windows Vista, HP Pavilion dv7</h2>
                    For some time now, I've had problems using the touchpad on my HP Pavilion dv7-1260 laptop.&nbsp; Whenever I press the left mouse button, I get the menu that appears when you press the right mouse button.&nbsp; I've changed the settings about a million times, and
 I've reinstalled the drivers, but nothing seems to work.&nbsp; Perhaps I need to change touchpad sensitivy or something, but I don't know how to do that on Windows Vista.&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Sounds like there is a hardware issue with the TouchPad so check with HP Support, their on-line<br />
documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about known isseu with that model.<br />
<br />

<br />
========<br />
<br />
Settings for TouchPad are in Control Panel - Mouse (there might be several tabs with TouchPad entries)<br />
and some have a utility that loads in Notification Area near clock on lower right.<br />
<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
If needed : (make sure you have rebooted at least once if the above did not work)<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Mice and Pointing Devices - Double Click on Touch Pad - Driver's Tab -<br />
Click Update Driver (this is may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers), now RIGHT CLICK<br />
on TouchPad and UNINSTALL.<br />
<br />
Then go to USB Controllers and UNINSTALL EVERYTHING except the category itself (all in it). REBOOT<br />
<br />
This will refresh the TouchPad Driver and the USB Stack. This does not stop the touchpad from working.<br />
<br />
Here is the similar procedure in XP, Windows 7 and Vista's is the same except we need to clear the specific device if present.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575</span></a><br />
<br />
Then go to System maker's site&nbsp;and get the latest touchpad drivers.<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
From the problem description, I see that you want to know how to change default saving location for Camera App.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To let you know the default storage location is Camera Roll folder. The pictures can be only saved to Pictures Library.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>However you may create a new folder inside pictures library and change the default location to that folder.</div>
<div>Follow these steps to change the default location to a folder inside Picture Library.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Right click on Picture Library.</div>
<div>b) Click on Properties.</div>
<div>c) Click on Add button.</div>
<div>d) Choose a folder that you want to add to&nbsp; Picture Library.</div>
<div>e) Click on the newly added folder.</div>
<div>f) Click on Set save location.</div>
<div>g) Click on Apply and Ok.</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Windows 10 doesn&#39;t remember the state after it wake up from sleep</h2>
                    <p>Hi I have recentry re-installed windows 10 on my computer and I have been getting the problem where my computer doesn't remember the state of machine after it wakes up from sleep. Example:- If i'm working on something and have opened couple of browsers and
 Microsoft word, I then leave everything open and go to bed, the following morning when I am waking up my computer from sleep by pressing any key on my keyboard and I see that all of the open windows are gone. This has never happened prior to re-installing
 windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I monitor the ram of the computer before and after the sleep, my computer was using the 4gb of ram before sleep and when I woke it up it was using 5gb of ram. I was thinking could it be doing because of stack is overflowing due to memory leak, maybe there
 is a bug in windows that is leaking memory while its in sleep mode.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the system is deciding to close all of the applications due to inactivity if a user is using a certain power plan which results in this scenario. For us to know the reason behind this, kindly provide the information we need below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Aside from reinstalling Windows 10, have you made any significant changes to your computer that may have triggered the issue?</li><li>Are you using any power plans on your computer?</li><li>Have you checked if you have any pending updates for Windows 10?</li><li>To remove any possibility of unsuccessful updates, are you using any third-party antivirus programs?</li><li>If yes, have you tried to disable them and check for any pending updates?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>

<h2>            My wife&#39;s Microsoft Account has been hacked</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm new to the forum and I'm hoping someone may be able to offer some advice/guidance. It's not actually a Windows 10 settings issue but it's the closest match I could see.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife's Microsoft Account was hacked last weekend and with it we've lost (and someone else has gained) access to personal and financial information including all info on her One Drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background - albeit too late to act on them she received a number of e-mails from Microsoft indicating that her password had been reset and that some of her security info had been deleted and new info added. When she eventually saw the e-mails she attempted
 to log into her account but the 'hacker' has changed the account name and she now get's a message advising the Account does not exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Sunday we have spoken with various reps from Technical support and completed a number of Account Recovery forms but unsurprisingly these have not been successful. This evening I was on the phone for 90 mins with another Tech Support Rep and although
 she was very patient and willing despite me being able to provide her with the e-mail address the hacker is now using on the account she didn't have the tools or knowledge to take the issue forward. She spoke with her supervisor and also Account &amp; Billing
 but the only suggestion she was able to suggest was for us to complete another form in relation to scams which we've done but we are not expecting much success.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there a Dept (Security?) who we can speak with and who, based on the info we can provide, interrogate their systems in order to check what we are&nbsp; saying is true and then immediately block the hacker from accessing the account etc. etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, and until we get the original issue resolved, how do we change the Microsoft Account associated with our PC and showing in Settings Info? We can't alter it in Manage My Account (as ours no longer exists) and it gives us the option to "Verify
 your identity" but that's not our e-mail address (it's the hackers!)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help you can offer would be very much appreciated as we are very very worried and frustrated</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Steve.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Change your Microsoft Account to a Local Account at Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Your Info choosing the link to Sign in with a Local Account:
<br /><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-switch-back-to-a-local-account-from-a-microsoft-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-swi...</a>
<br />
<br />If the link isn't there then create a new Local Admin Account, sign into it and move your files over, test all programs run correctly, then when ready delete the old account.   
<br />
<br />You can later link your recovered or new MS account to the new one:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5375-switch-microsoft-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5375-switch...</a>
<br />
<br />Frankly I'd just create a new Microsoft Account with a more secure password (e.g. childhood address + phone number + best friend) that's easily remembered but not traceable or intuitive.  
<br />
<br />I also back up my User folders to Google Drive backup so I have a secondary backup, and quarterly back up my User folders and a System Image to external HD&gt;
<br />
<br />I'm really sorry this happened to you, and hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Thank you Patricia.&nbsp; I've seen the page regarding compromised accounts and followed their guidance (to a degree) but in essence the only option was the Account Recovery form and I've now completed 2 or 3 of these but the recipients just don't seem to grasp
 the issue and I've received responses along the lines of that "account doesn't exist" or "sorry you've received spam communications". Until you shared it I hadn't seen the generic New Support request and will use that if I don't get any timely response from
 my last request issues earlier tonight. Thanks for taking the time to respond.

<p>Thanks Greg that's really thorough and much appreciated. I think I will take your advice and just set up a new account. We do have everything backed up elsewhere so we wont lose any data but it's worrying having someone gain access to our photos, docs etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's been so frustrating is that I know the e-mail address that the person is now using with 'my account' and I've told Microsoft but they don't seem able or willing to do anything about it or maybe I just haven't been able to contact the correct Dept
 yet i.e. Microsoft Security as if they exist then they certainly don't publicise their presence.</p>

            Steve -
<br />
<br />It sounds like you followed the procedure suggested here fully:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/my-outlook-com-account-has-been-hacked-35993ac5-ac2f-494e-aacb-5232dda453d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/my-out...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then I'd contact them and ask for a manager to stress that they are holding your account hostage and you can prove it is yours.  Let us know what they say.

<p>Thanks for the info and suggestions and I've already changed the passwords associated with our financial accounts etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks also for sharing the form but as I mentioned to another person earlier I've tried the Account Recovery form and route but they don't seem able to grasp the issue i.e. the account name and security info has been changed and even though I can give them
 the e-mail address the hacker is now using I can't find the right Dept that has the ability or willingness to take action&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player 11 Zoom Capability</h2>
                    Have tried searching with no luck. I am wondering if there is a way to zoom in when using the Microsoft Media Guide in wmp 11. I am using a 37inch lcd at 1920x1080p and its impossible to see even with my glasses on :). I have my windows settings all set
 up for text size etc which works awesome and makes everything nice and big but does not affect the guide. If anyone knows how to zoom or enlarge the guide it would be much appreciated. This is not the guide in media center...

            Wifi LIMITED on Windows 8.1 TOSHIBA S55-A5139 Laptop with Qualcomm Atheros AR956x Adapter - HOW I SOLVED THIS PROBLEM.
<div>
<p>Bear in mind, this is what worked for me and my particular Laptop Computer... &nbsp;this may or may not work for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After&nbsp;<strong>MONTHS&nbsp;</strong>of not being able to maintain Wireless connectivity for more than ten minutes to an hour or so, I now have a strong and stable Wifi connection that no longer suddenly disconnects from Wifi or goes "Limited"....
 even after sleep. Rock Solid. Like every other Computer &amp; wireless WiFi Device in my House ... as it should be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device Manager&gt;Network Adapters&gt;Roll back or install Qualcomm Atheros AR956x Adapter to Version&nbsp;10.0.0.263 - (In MY case, this was a 'roll-back')</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;Device Manager&gt;Network Adapers&gt;Uninstall the Bluetooth Wireless Adapter</p>
<p>
</p><p>(The only Network Adapters I have left are my Qualcomm Atheros Adapter for&nbsp;<em>Ethernet</em>&nbsp;and my&nbsp;<em>Wireless Network Adapter)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;Disable the function in the Adapter's Power Management "Properties" - "Allow the Computer to turn off this Device to save Power"</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;network and sharing center. &gt;Click on your WiFi (blue link of your broadcasting Wifi Connection) to open WiFi status window &gt;Click wireless properties &gt;Check the dialog "Connect even if the network isn't broadcasting it's name (SSID)"&nbsp;<strong>-
 Be CERTAIN the "Connect automatically when this Connection is in Range" is also checked!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel&gt;Power Options&gt;Select "High Performance" then select Link "Change Plan Settings" - "Put the Computer to sleep" (when plugged in) should be changed to "Never" and then select Link - "Change Advanced Power Settings" &gt;Scroll down list
 &amp; tick on "Wireless Adapter Settings" &gt; Change "On Battery" and "Plugged in" to "Maximum Performance" &gt;Click OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also uninstalled Google Chrome and re-installed it, but this time I did not sign in to my Google Account. Now I honestly don't know if this made a difference or not, but I read elsewhere on a Thread within this Forum that this is what did it for
 another User experiencing these issues, so I figured, "What the heck, why not?"... but to be honest, it didn't 'fix' the issue until I performed the following;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I literally 'unplugged' my WiFi Modem supplied by Bright house Cable and kept it unplugged for TEN Minutes. While waiting on the Modem, I performed the following;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows Key" &amp; "Q" to open 'Search &gt;Type "Command Prompt" then Select "Run as Administrater"&gt; After Cmd Prompt enter;</p>
<p>
</p><p>NETSH INT IP RESET C:\RESTLOG.TXT - (hit enter)<br />
<br />
NETSH INT TCP SET HEURISTICS DISABLED - (hit enter)<br />
<br />
NETSH INT TCP SET GLOBAL AUTOTUNINGLEVEL=DISABLED - (hit enter)<br />
<br />
NETSH INT TCP SET GLOBAL RSS=ENABLED - (hit enter)<br />
<br />
To verify that these settings are disabled, type<br />
<br />
netsh int tcp show global -(hit enter)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>(Don't reboot UNTIL your have plugged your Modem or Router back in and it's once again 'view able' in your Networks!)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once your WiFi Network is view able in your Networks, reboot your Computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should now reboot into Windows and automatically be connected to your Network with no issues... (hopefully!)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>THIS</strong>&nbsp;is what worked for me. &nbsp;</p>

            Windows 7 should only affect the partition it's installed on, but just to be safe you should backup anything important.<br />

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(36, 44, 46, 1)">I upgraded to Windows 10 and all was well. After a few weeks I did a clean install of Windows 10. After the clean install I am experiencing
 problems with the laptop freezing when I remove power cable from computer. The computer will completely lookup and has to be rebooted to resume usage. The problem is this is not consistent. It does not happen every time and I cannot determine what is causing
 the problem. I have uninstalled and reinstalled almost every driver. I have updated everything I know to update and still the problem happen. Anyone else having this problem?</span></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If creating a new user profile does not fix the issue, I suggest you to refer to the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
Perform a Reset of the operating system and check if it helps to resolve the issue.
<p>
</p><p>Resetting lets you choose whether to keep your files or remove them, and then reinstalls Windows. To get started, go to
<span>Settings</span> &gt; <span>Update &amp; security</span> &gt; <span>Reset this PC</span> &gt;<span>Get started</span> and choose an option.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <div>Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
What is your Internet browser and version?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)?<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
What do you see that you don't think you should be seeing and when do you see it?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?
<div><br />
<div>Does your system seem to boot okay and then crash or does it not boot at all?</div>
<br />
<div>Can you make the system crash any time you want? &nbsp;For example, would you say that there is any particular system activity that coincides with the crashes (like watching videos, playing games, etc.).</div>
<div><br />
The next time your system crashes, provide more information about what you see.</div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If there is a file name listed under the STOP message, be sure to include that information too.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you. &nbsp;We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know what your BSOD looks like.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now provide more information about your system and information from the most recent crashes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click Start, Run and in the box enter:</div>
<div><br />
<div>msinfo32</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All,&nbsp;Copy and then paste the information back here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to&nbsp;be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Download BlueScreenView from here:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Unzip and run it (BSV installs nothing) and let it finish scanning all your crash dump files. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you double click on of the dumps, you will get some information about it (including the&nbsp;Caused By Driver field) and you may be able to spot the problem right away - especially if&nbsp;you see a pattern in the dumps where the Caused by Driver field is the
 same (start with that&nbsp;driver).</div>
<div><br />
<div>BlueScreenView tries to locate the right driver or module that caused the blue screen by looking inside the crash stack. However, be aware that the driver detection mechanism is not 100% accurate, and you should also look in the lower pane, that display
 all drivers/modules found in the stack.<br />
<br />
Sometimes BlueScreenView will implicate XP files as the cause of the crash (ntoskrnl.exe, win32k.sys, hal.dll etc.) but they are probably not the real cause of the crash (BSV does the best it can) and you need to look at some other crash dumps or use the Windows
 debugging tools to dig a little deeper into the crash dump to find the real cause.<br />
<br />
You would have to either gather up some more example crashes and look through them, or find some where XP files are not the "cause" or you could upload your crash dump files to your
<a href="http://explore.live.com/skydrive-get-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SkyDrive</a> and somebody with the Windows debugging tools can help take a look at them in more detail.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Select (highlight) one or more of the most recent dump files by clicking them and holding&nbsp;down the Ctrl key to select multiples files. &nbsp;Try to select just the most recent ones that&nbsp;relate to your issue (maybe five or so dump files to get started).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click File, Save Selected Items and save the information from the dumps to a text file on&nbsp;your desktop called BSOD.txt.
<br />
<br />
Open BSOD.txt with a text editor Notepad, WordPad, etc.), select all the text (Ctrl-A), copy all the text to the Windows clipboard (Ctrl-C) and paste the text from the clipboard (Ctrl-V) back here in your next reply.
<div><br />
<br />
<div>Here is an example of the BSV report from a single BSOD that I initiated on purpose that&nbsp;shows the cause of the crash as the i8042prt.sys driver belonging to Microsoft Corporation:</div>

Reboot your computer and troubleshoot remaining issues.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it is easiest to just upload the memory dump files from your most recent crashes to your SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing file).&nbsp;&nbsp; Then somebody that already has the Windows debugging tools can take a closer look at things and figure
 out what is going on.<br />
<br />
The memory dump files from the recent crashes and BSODs are usually in this folder:<br />
<br />
<br />
The files will be named something like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
You need to upload the most recent ones...&nbsp; maybe 5-10 of the most recent crash dump files ought to be enough if you have that many.&nbsp; If you do not have that many, send what you do have.<br />
<br />
Getting started with SkyDrive:<br />
<a href="http://explore.live.com/skydrive-get-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com/skydrive-get-started</a><br />
<br />
After you get your files uploaded and are looking at them on your SkyDrive, you need to "share" your folders/files so others can see them.<br />
<br />
Here is a link that tells you how to do that:<br />
<a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-skydrive-change-access-permissions-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com/windows-live-skydrive-change-access-permissions-faq</a><br />
<br />
Then choose the "Get a link" button.&nbsp; When you click that, a window will open that contains the link to your SkyDrive files.<br />
<br />
Copy the contents of the box "Copy this link to share:" by selecting the link contents (it will all become highlighted), press Ctrl-C (copy) and then come back to the forum and in your next message press Ctrl-V to paste the contents of the link back here.<br />
<br />
What you paste back will look something like this link to my SkyDrive:<br />

    <title>Windows 7 not working in Windows 10 dual boot system and blue screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 not working in Windows 10 dual boot system and blue screen appears</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: windows 7 and 10 dual booting</p>
<p>I recently tried to dual boot win7 and win10 to test out win10, i formatted and changed 1 hdd from mbr to gpt, i shrank a partition for win10 (50gb) and installed it without any hiccups, i booted up win10 no problems and the 1st couple of times switching
 to win7 was fine too, but after those 2 times when trying to boot win7my mouse and keyboard became unresponsive, i couldnt login or shutdown or restart without pressing it on my case. I tried disabling the xHCI in the bios, which worked for that 1 time booting
 win7. After that, the only way i could boot win7 and logon was if i disconnected my hdd with win10 on it. So i decided to cut my losses but without being able to logon win7 i used the win10 installation from the boot menu to reformat the hdd with win10 on
 it, now i get the blue screen with error code 0xc0000225 on it, the same as having my hdd with win10 on it disconnected. How can i get rid of this? Basically going back to how things were before the win10 install. I didnt backup any of my drives since they
 were all pretty much full, but the hdd that had win10 on it is completely empty and seperate from win7.</p>

            I can logon win7 fine, but only after the blue error screen... it has an option to press f9 to load another os. I used the media creation tool and made a boot drive on a usb for win10. Can i use that or do i still need to create the ISO? And by reinstalling
 windows10 can i uninstall it altogether and just leave windows 7 how it used to be?

<h2>            Family tree Maker 2017 indicates not online</h2>
                    <p>I have been successfully using FTM 2017 since inception. Sync works fine. But, in recent weeks, maybe after a recent large Windows update, I can no longer complete a sync. It moves to a point, not always the same point, and issues a message "FTM may be off
 line. Check your connection". It is NOT on my end, Utah gave a green light for sync so It must be a bug.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FTM says it is likely Windows Security. I cannot figure out how to put FTM 2017 in the trusted list. Any ideas on cause, solution or how to add FTM to list?</p>
<p>I am up to date on FTM 2017 and up date date on Windows 10.&nbsp; Running on a Surface Pro 4 with high speed direct connect internet.</p>
<p>THANK YOU</p>

<p>Thank you for confirming this, Patricia. Try out these methods to to resolve the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Uninstall and reinstall the app.</p>
<p>There may have been a setting on the app causing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Add exception to your antivirus software.</p>
<p>It may be possible that the antivirus software you're using is blocking the connection between your app and the internet. If you're using Windows Defender, here's an

                    I just got it, I'm super pumped.&nbsp; But so far it's really not impressing me and I'm really easy to impress.

            <p>I have the preview and love it. I was very skeptical after windows 8 and especially after 8.1.. But so far Microsoft has pulled it off.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It, in my opinion, takes everything someone would want from an operating system and puts it in there. I am in the fast ring so there has been bumps and error along the way, but I couldn't be more excited about the official launch!
</p>
<p>If you have any specific questions, let me know! I'd be more then happy to answer them!

 a few minutes while it thought about it and then it just merrily booted win 7 again. My netbook is samsung, came loaded with 7 starter. I have read a few posts where windows has to be deleted before a new os can be installed but cannot work out how to do this.
 Thanks in advance for the help.</span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Am also interested in whether it is better to have a dual boot of xp and 7 or to just go back to xp. Is there anything that will only work with 7 cos at the moment it seems to be the other way around?! Instructions
 needed and appreciated either way. :)</span></div>

            Before you consider replacing Windows 7 with Windows XP. Have you tried familiarizing yourself with the OS first?<br />
<br />
http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2009/08/19/for-the-former-windows-xp-user-welcome-to-windows-7/<br />
<br />
If you want to run Windows XP, you might want to consider dual booting Windows 7 and Windows XP. You should first find out if your computer is compatible with Windows XP. A lot more modern computers are phasing out support for Windows XP.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is important you have a reinstallation or repair disc in case you need to reinstall or repair your WIndows 7 installation.
<br />
<br />
The following article will show you how to create a repair disc:<br />

If your XP disk came with a Toshiba computer it is OEM and you can not use it with your Samsung. The XP Toshiba disk is only good with the computer it came with.<br />

<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">BIOS - How to Enter the BIOS and Change Boot Order To Boot From CD/DVD</span></p>
<p>
<span>If your BIOS settings are correct, when the computer restarts if there is a message to "press any key to boot from disk" you must press a key on the keyboard to boot from the
 DVD. </span></p>
<br />
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>The computer may need to be set to boot from the DVD drive.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Every computer is different, when you first turn on the computer it should tell you what button to push to enter the BIOS. It's usually one of the following and you must push
 it within the first 5 seconds: </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>F1 &nbsp;F2 &nbsp;F10 &nbsp;F12 ESC &nbsp;DEL
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Once in the BIOS you have to find the menu with the boot order and change it so it boots from the CD/DVD drive first. Every computer is a little different for this process
 as well so I can't give exact directions. </span></p>

<span>Windows 7 Downgrade To XP</span>
<div>
<p>
<span></span></p>
<p>
<span>Are you sure you want to remove Windows 7? Compare Windows 7 vs. XP vs. Vista:</span></p>
<p>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/compare?T1=tab20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/compare?T1=tab20</span></a></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>If it's a new computer it might not have drivers for the older Windows system, meaning it will not work correctly.&nbsp; First you would need to check with the computer manufacturer if they have XP drivers for your computer.
<br />
<br />
Then you would need to use an available XP license you have, or buy a new one and install it on your computer. Insert the install disk into the computer, reboot, and start the install. During the install process you can format the Windows 7 partition then continue
 installing Windows. You'll have to backup your files and reinstall all your programs.<br />
<br />
You can not use a Windows 7 key to activate XP.<br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>In case you ever want to reinstall Windows 7, make sure you have a way to reinstall. If you don't have install disks, you can make a system image:</span></p>

                    I have a Visual Novel application downloaded which requires me to change the System Locale to Japanese, I don't sure if System Locale will change the overall language used in the OS.
<div>For example, the word "START" will change into Japanese characters (Kanji) or does it affect only on programs which requires Japanese language but the whole OS Language is still in English language?</div>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The exact error is Microsoft visual C++ runtime library error. related to system 32/logonui.exe&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop boots to the Asus screen and then stays there thinking for about 5 mins and then the error comes up and just keeps popping up no matter how many times you enter through. it doesn't get as far as Windows 10 or allow us to login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far we have done 4 x system restore and this has had no affect. we've held down F8 and tried several times to put it into safe mode and his has no affect and restarts in the same way and then the error comes up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from a trial of Adobe PDF writer we've done nothing different. it's just stuck in the blue screen of death loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mobile for an Huawei GR5&#47;Honor 5x</h2>
                    <p>Hello there, I recently heard about the Windows 10 Mobile Flashing ROM for an an Android device, precisely the Xiaomi MI 4.</p>
<p>I was wondering if it would be expanded to others models/make too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, I would be really proud to test it on my Huawei GR5/Honor 5x. I sincerely prefer much more Windows 10 Mobile than Android.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>

    <title>Movie Maker&#47;DVD Maker Images Too Large - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joe hegyi iii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Movie Maker&#47;DVD Maker Images Too Large</h2>
                    I'm using&nbsp;Windows Movie Maker and DVD&nbsp;Maker to create a slideshow of pictures. I have tried to resize the images but it seems regardless what size I make the&nbsp;pictures, they are too large when I view the DVD on a television.<br />
<br />
Is there perhaps a setting&nbsp;I'm missing?<br />
<br />
I really expected&nbsp;the program would either size the pictures to fit a television or the preview would show the picture as too large since I'm obviously&nbsp;planning to view them on a television.

<p>Joe Hegyi III,</p>
<p>Check the Aspect Ratio on your project in both DVD Maker and Movie Maker:</p>
<p><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/d7783074-18d6-4f9a-8dfb-e0b1ab6c45e11033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/d7783074-18d6-4f9a-8dfb-e0b1ab6c45e11033.mspx</a></p>
<p>Also check any potential filter conflict by turning them off, see the following:</p>
<p><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/60baf31b-16cb-409f-91cf-e99c9e9a495c1033.mspx#EYB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/60baf31b-16cb-409f-91cf-e99c9e9a495c1033.mspx#EYB</a></p>
<p>Can you please clarify what you are experiencing as too large; is the picture magnified? Is it stretch and cut off either horizontally or vertically? How much of the original resolution is missing?</p>
<p><span>Please reply with your results so that we may further assist you.<br />
