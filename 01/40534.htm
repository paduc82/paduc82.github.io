<h2>            Why won&#39;t my CD&#47;DVD player operate &#40;come on&#41; after I put in a CD&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo 11681KU PC, operating on Windows 7, run a Microsoft Works program&nbsp;for my spreadsheets, data bases, and&nbsp;letter writing. I am very dumb on the workings of computers, although I have had many over the last 15 or so years and I use it in my home
 business. It is several years old but I don't think that should be a problem. I'm a 70+ year old past prime citizen and I'm still working okay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I push the button on the front of the computer case&nbsp;at&nbsp;the CD/DVD slot. The door drops down and the loading tray comes out. I place the CD in the tray of the&nbsp;unit, push the button again and the tray retreats back into the&nbsp;PC. And that's it. No&nbsp;indication
 of any kind that a CD has been loaded. Previously,&nbsp;a small light illuminated after the tray shut and the CD worked fine.&nbsp;I really do not have $199 to spare to have a geek/nerd to come out from a retail store.&nbsp;PLEASE HELP ME.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Walter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>While waiting for responses from our community members, you may also contact the manufacturer of your computer or the CD/DVD slot for them to provide you what options you may do on your device.</p>
<p>

<p>Replacement of a Desktop PC CD/DVD drive is not nearly that expensive.&nbsp; You can buy one for about $20.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Keep in mind that DVD/CD device failure is one of the most common things that happen to PCs.&nbsp; This is particularly likely if your PC is say 5 years or so old.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If yours is a desktop PC, the replacement is easy and inexpensive.&nbsp; Usually about $20 to buy the replacement.&nbsp; Shut down, remove power, hold the ON switch in for 7 seconds or more.&nbsp;
 Lay the computer on it side with the side where all the plugs are located down.&nbsp; Remove the side panel.&nbsp; Remove the 2 screws that hold the drive in place.&nbsp; Remove the two plugs at the back of the drive.&nbsp; In some cases, you may need to remove the front panel
 to slide it out.&nbsp; Do that with caution so that you do not break any of the little holders off.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reverse the procedure for the new one.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If yours is a laptop PC, replacement is physically not difficult.&nbsp; Usually one screw.&nbsp; But this is a proprietary device that is different for every laptop.&nbsp; Finding one could be a
 problem and your only likely source will be the OEM.&nbsp; Price will be high.&nbsp; Likely like $100 or so.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A great alternative is an external drive that connects via USB.&nbsp; Usable in any PC.&nbsp; Cost about $25.</span></span></p>

<p>Thank you PreciousLeb and Canadian Tech. I ordered (reading from my Order Sheet from Best Buy):
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"LG - Ultra Slim 8x Max. DVD Write Speed External USB DVD RW/CD-RW Drive-Black", cost $29.99 On Sale</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I am disabled, my wife is going to Best Buy and pick it up. As soon as I can, I will attempt the installation. Hopefully, everything will come together and I will be back with y'all with more thanks.</p>

            That is an external unit.&nbsp; One that can be plugged into any Windows computer.&nbsp; So, it will not replace the one that is installed inside.&nbsp; Installation should be as simple as plugging it in.&nbsp; It is also slower than built-in ones 8 instead of 16.&nbsp; But that
 probably will not be much of a problem for you.

            I would not want to take a chance of opening the computer case to change out an internal unit. I might possibly buy the wrong item since I know nothing about machinery. External will be fine for my usage. I agree with you that 16 is better than 8, but
 8 is better than having nothing. At least I&nbsp;should now&nbsp;have one that works. My wife hasn't picked it up, yet. I'll keep my fingers crossed.

            Well, I'm back to square one. I Read the instructions , plugged the USB into the PC and the new unit. The box included a CD "CyberLink Media Suite 10 For DVD". Instructions: "Insert the disc and Autorun will automatically launch the program". I did and
 it didn't. The light came on for a few seconds then went out. I sat and waited....nothing happened, so I re-did the whole thing again. Same result. I then placed an ATF Informational disc and still no response. When&nbsp;the internal unit&nbsp;worked a couple of years
 ago, I would place the disc in the drive, close the door and it would load automatically. What do you think my problem might be, now? I still don't want to call the Geek Squad and I don't know anybody to come over and fix me up.&nbsp;

            Thanks "DB" for your input. I just finished printing the seven pages in reference to your response. I'll read it over&nbsp; tonight and maybe get some insight&nbsp;of what it will take to&nbsp;get this darned thing running. I did&nbsp;not receive any error messages or codes.
 I just&nbsp;wish I knew of a person in the Mesquite, TX area who could fix my problem without charging an arm and a leg for their services. I really appreciate all the help&nbsp;from the Microsoft Community people.

            Next time please post in the Vista forums. You've posted in one for Windows XP. Since you're here now:<br />
<br />
<span>You can change your password to something you will remember from another administrative user's account. If you only had one administrative user account and you've forgotten the password, all is not lost. You might then want to follow
 the general recommendations for setting up user accounts in Vista that I'll give you at the end of this post.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Doing all this requires a certain level of computer skills. You know yourself best and whether taking the machine to a competent local computer tech (not a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place) is the better solution for
 you.<br />
<br />
</span><span>If you have a Vista installation DVD (not a recovery DVD) you can boot the system with it. Select the default language, then choose "Repair your computer". Then select "Command Prompt". At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:yes [press Enter]<br />
net user [insert your user account's name here] [insert new user password like 1234 here] [press Enter]<br />
<br />
[Note: Do not type the brackets!]<br />
<br />
Remove the installation DVD and reboot the computer. Now you will be able to log into your user account using the password you set; i.e., 1234.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a Vista installation DVD (only have a recovery disc), the computer mftr. may have given you the Vista System Repair option (not a System Recovery!) on the diagnostic menu. This diagnostic menu is the same one where you can choose Safe Mode.
 Get to this menu by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting up. If you don't have this option you can make a bootable Vista Repair DVD from the file at this link:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</a>
<br />
<br />
Note: All the Neosmart recovery disc downloads are torrent files. There is a good explanation of torrent files at the Neosmart website. You will need a torrent client such as
<a href="http://www.utorrent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">muTorrent</a> to get the files. The torrent client will download the .iso file with which to create the bootable DVD. You will need to use third-party burning software such as Nero, Roxio, or the free ImgBurn (<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com</a>
 ) to burn the .iso as an image, not as data.<br />
<br />
Once you have fixed things, log into the extra administrative account you will make per the suggestions below and disable the built-in Administrator account again for security purposes:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: cmd<br />
When cmd appears in Results above, right-click it and choose "Run as administrator" [OK]. Now you will get the command prompt. At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:no [enter]<br />
<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP and all other modern operating systems, Vista is a multi-user operating system with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, and Guest. These accounts should be left alone as
 they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Vista because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily work and that
 account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult.&nbsp;</span> <span>
It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it may be more than you want to do. Better not to put yourself into a bad situation to begin with.</span>
<span><br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. Running as a Standard user is best practice for security
 purposes and will help protect your computer from infection. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).</span>

    <title>Xbox One X requires nearly daily restarts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> programram  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One X requires nearly daily restarts</h2>
                    So I've had this Xbox One X for quite some time bought it shortly after launch and recently it's required a full shut down and unplug to actually function properly, out of the blue sounds in games will be choppy (Reboot fixes it) or games just flat out
 will not start. If you guys have any suggestions on what to do that would be great all my games are installed on my external hard drive so anything I can really do at this point I've tried resetting to factory settings and so far the only thing I've managed
 to do has been signing up for beta console updates I can now go on a few days without needing a full reboot but I still need it. Another issue is download speeds every week or so if I do not completely shut it down and unplug it my download speed caps out
 at 500Kbps. It's out of warranty so repair wise my only option is either a new Xbox or pay the $200~ to get it fixed through Microsoft&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Also a lot of ppl don‚Äôt don‚Äôt think of this: make sure your xbox directly into wall not a power strip or extension cord. Not having enough power might be the issue since your using a external drive. Let me know how it works out.&nbsp;</p>

            Everything was moved to the external drive which is brand new because these issues were happening which of course are still happening on this new external drive. I have nothing besides game pics now on the internal drive and this still happens. The xbox
 is plugged in directly to the wall and the external hard drive has its own power supply its 8TB and its full (Yes I know I have problems XD).&nbsp; Energy saver is also off its set to instant on

            My one x has performed unsatisfactory since purchase a full SHUTDOWN in the options has been mandatory or issues will occur one of the most frequent is the microphone will not work in multiplayer headset audio will continue to work but no voice support.
 Other issue include games not loading and apps refusing to launch but a full shut down corrects this. Very odd indeed.

<h2>            Chkdsk very slow processing corrupt WD MyPassport 1TB Hard drive</h2>
                    I<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">'ve been having problems with my Western Digital MyPassport hard drive. It started when a download to the drive I was in
 the midst of froze and locked up my computer, so I did a hard reboot. Since then, the drive is either unrecognizable, or functions okay for a little bit after being plugged in before slowing to a crawl, or otherwise has problems, such as some folders being
 inaccessible, some (but not all) files unable to be viewed, etc.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I've been trying to retrieve all my data from it (it's a little less than half full) and have tried a whole array of options.
 Using my Windows 7 desktop, the drive would generally not be found. It'd show in My Devices but not in My Computer or Disk Management. The few times I was able to get it to recognize the drive, my attempts to run chkdsk, TestDisk, GetDataBack and some other
 processes would fail. The drive essentially locked up my computer - GetDataBack would freeze upon scanning for drives until I unplugged the external drive, for example. My Windows 10 laptop was able to recognize the drive, and for a little bit I'd be able
 to view all the folders and files, but the processing was incredibly slow. It took 15-20 minutes to copy over 40 mb of files, for example.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">My friend brought his Linux laptop over because I read that Linux was much better at dealing with broken file systems than Windows.
 We tried ntfsfix and it seemed to run successfully, but the drive was still unable to be mounted. When I tried again on my Win10 laptop, it seemed to work okay, albeit a bit slow. I set it to copy a large folder of pictures and videos and let it run over night,
 but shortly into the copying, it broke, and viewing the folders/files at this point was as I mentioned earlier where some folders would say "inaccessible" and some files simply couldn't be viewed, while others were fine.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">At this point, I tried running GetDataBack on my Win10 machine and it spit out a bunch of errors saying that it can't read sectors.
 I tried Uneraser, same thing. I also saw a suggestion to create an image before running either of those programs, and then using the image instead of the drive itself. I downloaded Macrium Reflect and attempted to make an image of the drive, but it gave me
 an error that the MFT was corrupt and to run chkdsk G: /r.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">As mentioned, chkdsk was not working on my desktop, but I started to run it on my laptop now and all seemed to be going well.
 However, it got to Stage 4 " looking for bad clusters in user file data" and seems to have effectively frozen. When I left it last night it was at around 102 of 129520, and this morning it was at 138, and 140 a couple hours later...</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">So, my simplest question is - what is the proper way to cancel chkdsk given that it seems to have essentially locked up? Without
 potentially causing further harm to the hard drive? In addition to that, any other suggestions for getting my data off this drive?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Thank you!</span>

            Hi mate.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to hear about the problems you're having with the external drive, I know this could be an extremely unpleasant experience...<br />
<br />
You did your best trying to extract the data from the drive with various software, but I believe that at this point it will be best to consult with a data recovery company and see if they will be able to help you in this situation. Also, do have in mind that
 the more you try to repair the drive, the worse the damage and the extraction of files may become.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Here's a link with few WD data recovery partners you can take a look at if you want:<br />

<br />
Hope this help and best of luck!

    <title>Having trouble with the Xbox Originals game, Fable. Tried MANY things - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blue breeze  say:</h3>
<h2>            Having trouble with the Xbox Originals game, Fable. Tried MANY things already.</h2>
                    
<p>Okay so about a week ago I decided to purchase Fable from Games on Demand. The transaction went smoothly; I purchased 1200 MS points, Xbox LIVE took them and the download started. Then things messed up. It stayed on 1% completion for roughly two minutes
 and then backed out of the 'active downloads' tab of its own accord. When I tried to go back to look at my active downloads, it tried for around five minutes to load before telling me there was a problem with Xbox LIVE and to "try again later". Okay. Fine.
 I'll come back the next day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not so, apparently. I come back the next day and when I sign into Xbox LIVE, I can't access my download history, points balance, active downloads, payment options, etc. (Game patches, too, will no longer download.) I figure that glitched download from yesterday
 is still in there mucking it up. I sign out, go to my HDD and delete Fable (which is only a 40 KB file after all this time and marked as "unknown game"). I sign back in, and LIVE is still messed up. Same problems as before - can't access active downloads,
 etc. I sign out yet again and I check my HDD again - only to find that unnamed 40 KB file is back! I delete it, clear my cache and turn of my Xbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point I decide that I need to get Fable off my download queue somehow. So I got to xbox.com, sign in and cancel the download. Then I go turn my Xbox again, sign into LIVE and guess what? LIVE is working perfectly now. I can access my download history,
 payment options, etc. I figure this was all some weird glitch and I restart the Fable download by using my download history tab... and the same problem repeats itself. I try accessing the download tab a few times, just to see if it will eventually work. After
 a few times of it simply backing me out, I am eventually signed out of LIVE entirely and I receive the error message 80072741. I Google this and find out the problem is either on LIVE's end or mine. After some research I find out that I may need to forward
 specific ports on my router (in spite of the fact that this exact connection has worked fine with two 360s for almost three years), and I forward those ports (I'm reasonably knowledgeable with network systems but I use a guide just in case).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forwarding the ports doesn't help. Xbox LIVE still glitches up every time I have Fable in my download queue (when I manually take it off from xbox.com LIVE works fine). To again make sure this isn't on my end I purchase and download something else - Total
 Miner: Forge - and it works fine; the download goes smoothly and I am able to play the game without issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's only one thing on my end that could be causing the problem at this point: my LIVE profile (ZenithSeas). While I was researching the problem, I read that sometimes the profile itself can glitch and it needs to be deleted and then recovered. I do this,
 and it doesn't help the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, as a last ditch effort to solve this on my own, I say to hell with it and delete the profile for good even though it has six months of prepaid LIVE left on it and probably close to $100 worth of downloadable content. I format the HDD, clear the
 cache and make a new profile titled Blue Breeze. LIVE on this profile works perfectly... until I try for Fable again. Forking out another 1200 MS points ($15), I once again purchase Fable. And the download once again screws up LIVE for me. I'm now experiencing
 the exact same problems on the Blue Breeze profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I figure at this point, the problem HAS to be on LIVE's end. And I'm thinking the problem is specifically related to Fable. What can we do about this? I've spent $30 total already on a game that refuses to download and messes up the rest of my Xbox LIVE
 experience in the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some information that may be relevant:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The Xbox system in question is one of the newer slim models.</p>
<p>- I've downloaded most Mass Effect 2 DLC, all Fable II &amp; III DLC, Halo: Combat Evolved and several other small things which total several GB on this connection with this Xbox, so I know the problem isn't with my network.</p>
<p>- I'm living in the United States and have been since I bought the Xbox, my Xbox is a United States region Xbox.</p>
<p>- I usually use a wireless DSL Qwest modem to connect my Xbox to the internet, but I also tried a wired connection when attempting to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really hope this can be resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading the wall of text.</p>

Also, try connecting your console directly to the modem via ethernet cable to try downloading that way.<br />
<br />
When you are unable to view your profile and purchase history on the console, are you still able to view it on Xbox.com (<span><a href="https://live.xbox.com/en-US/Download/History" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://live.xbox.com/en-US/Download/History</a>)?</span></p>

<p>Hey there aurellieD1!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue using your new external hard drive.
</p>
<p>I would say that if you have already gone through all the troubleshooting steps listed here on
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/troubleshooting/console-doesnt-detect-external-storage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshoot external storage detection on Xbox One</a>, then I would suggest what we call a soft reset&nbsp;and see if that helps out.
<span>
<span>It's a reset of your console back to factory settings but one that does not uninstall any of your games or apps and is a really good troubleshooting step for most issues.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>Just
 make sure that before you go ahead with it, that you do know all of the sign-in information for any/all of your accounts</span></span><span><span>(as</span></span><span><span>they

 have easy access to your internet network</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hello Aurelie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Pc will not let you format for some reason, you will need to get with the manufacturer and find how to format the drive. As it is the hard dive is probably formatted as a media device which is why the Xbox is not picking it up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Help me remove a virus</h2>
                    How can I remove a virus from my computer when the virus is blocking my use of the internet. this is our main home computer with the wi-fi router, etc. I am able to access the internet from my husband's computer in the other room. I get a ton of popups
 that I just close out of but everytime I go to open a program, system restore, explorer, I get a warning prompt that tells me the program/file is infected. Well most virus removal programs need to be done via the internet---any ideas. I was working with microsoft
 but it became an 'escalated' problem and now I need to wait for a call back anywhere from 3-5 days between 5-7.

            <p>A better Graphics card (GPU) could help, but as I said it depends upon where the graphics bottle-neck is? If its CPU related (and the P4 appears to be below the minimim spec) then the improvement from changing the GPU may not be that great.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I found on this site - <a href="http://www.systemrequirements.in/prince-of-persia-the-forgotten-sands.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.systemrequirements.in/prince-of-persia-the-forgotten-sands.html</a> the following info:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>Supported Graphics Cards:<br />
<br />
NVIDIA GeForce 6800 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 100 / 200 / GTX series<br />
<br />
ATI RADEON X1600 / HD 2000 / HD 3000 / HD 4000 / HD 5000 series<br />
Laptop versions of these cards may work but are NOT supported.</em></p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p>Because of the age of the rest of the PC, I wouldn't spend a fortune on a modern card as you wont get the full benefit from it in this system. I'd have guessed something like 6800 or 7800 from the NVIDIA range should do at a reasonable cost if you want to
 try it. Unfortunately, I can't recommend any cards as I don't have the game or a P4 system to actually try it with. Hopefully someone else may have. Or you could try the forum for that game mentioned above (or this section -<a href="http://forums.ubi.com/forumdisplay.php/95-Prince-of-Persia-Community-Technical-Help?order=desc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p>My guess would be the user shut off the computer a long time ago during a lengthy "configuring, do not turn off computer" some time ago and something has been corrupt ever since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ran various malware programs, nothing found, have norton antivirus installed with no issues found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SFC /scannow fails in both regular mode and safemode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I obviously cannot restore to a period prior to this problem because it started occurring so long ago, but just now looking at it, because of the additional issue below that just started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, might be unrelated, but I recently restored this machine from a different machine using a 3rd party backup/clone utility, now windows backup fails, but might be related, although backup was working prior to moving to new hardware using the 3rd party.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to check in Clean Boot state as below and try to install the windows Update, check whether the issue persists or not.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the article How to perform a clean boot in Windows in the below link and check if it helps:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a>
<strong>(Applies to Windows 10 as well).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong><strong>:</strong> Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section
<strong>‚Äú<span>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</span>‚Äù</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.</p>

            <p>Dell used to include a utility to create a Windows XP&nbsp;re-installation CD-R / CD-RW that they called a
<em>System disk</em>.&nbsp; You'll have to look through your menu system or your Dell utilities to find it [the utility is not included in the re-installed version so I am unable to help as I used it for re-installation on my XP some time ago - all I can remember
 was that it was somewhere in the <em>Start menu</em>, <em>Programs </em>menu entries].&nbsp; Please note that the System disk only allows you to reinstall from scratch so that's what you would have to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A much easier form of reversion would come from getting an imaging utility such as Acronis True Image.&nbsp; They normally provide a free 30 day trial version so you could make a
<em>System image </em>&amp; an <em>Acronis TI boot disk </em>during the trial period then use them to recover your entire system as it was the day you made the
<em>System image</em> [the ability to recover would not be limited to the trial period - the
<em>System image </em>&amp; <em>Acronis TI boot disk </em>would be usable forever].&nbsp; There is some explanation &amp; some useful links in JWStuart's post in
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-windows_install/updating-windows-xp-to-windows-10/513eb583-fc7f-4bfa-a351-5916bb00e94a">

<p>
</p><p>Once you have upgraded to Windows 7, look for its <em>Backup &amp; restore</em> utility and you'll see a link [in the bottom left-hand corner of its opening window] for making a
<em>System image</em> &amp; a <em>System repair disk</em>.&nbsp; These allow you to make regular
<em>System images </em>using Windows 7 native tools and to recover the image, again using Windows 7 native tools [the
<em>System repair disk</em>].&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I got a Windows 7 computer, I thought <em>System images</em> were just things that IT departments used to avoid having to fix faults properly but I was wrong - as long as you make sure you always back up / copy all your own files to an external drive,
 restoring a System image can take as little as 20 minutes and can become your preferred method of recovering from system problems if initial / straightforward fault-finding procedures don't fix things.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 unable to create recovery disc</h2>
                    <p>HI</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to create a recovery disc (dvd or USB) of my newly updated windows 10.</p>
<p>I have also tried to create a system repair disc of the same windows 10 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both attempts do not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded from windows 7 pro to windows 10 pro.</p>
<p>If I choose to create a recovery disc by going:L</p>
<p>Search &gt; recovery &gt; system settings &gt; Recovery&nbsp;</p>
<p>there are only two options</p>
<p>Reset PC and Advanced start up&nbsp;</p>
<p>there is no option to create a recovery disc or partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If i choose to create a system repair disc (windows bootable DVD):</p>
<p>Use search &gt; control panel &gt; file history &gt; system image backup &gt; create a system repair disc</p>
<p>the error i receive is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>" The files needed to create a system repair disc were not found on this computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can still create a system repair disc if you have a Windows installation disc."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise on how I can create a recovery disc as well as a system repair disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>

            Hi JakubMilu≈°ka
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />My sincere apologies. It is not possible to change Skype ID / Skype Name. This is one of the heavily demanded features and under consideration by Microsoft.
<br />
<br />However, you can change your Display Name.
<br />
<br />Login to your account
<br /><a href="https://secure.skype.com/account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/account/</a>
<br />
<br />Click on Edit Profile &gt; Edit Profile to enable in Edit mode &gt; You can change your Display Name here
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>It's IGN.&nbsp; The same people who gave "GTA IV" a 10/10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can't trust them for reviews but you can read between the lines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's nice to see them condense a review to a single page.&nbsp; 3 - 6 pages of a nonsense review can be pretty hard to take.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm looking forwards to this as I enjoy hitting things and people and that's apparently what you do most of the game.</p>

<h2>            Is MS Project 2003 compatible with Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to find out whether or not MS Project 2003 will work on a virtual machine that has Windows 7. I&nbsp;searched the Microsoft website but was only able to find the minimum&nbsp;system requirements for Project 2003.&nbsp;Thanks in advance for any help.<br />

            Yes, it should, just ensure you install the latest Service Pack for it. I have been running Office 2003 applications on Windows 7 Ultimate without any issues.

Ol√°! Galeria preciso mais uma vez da ajuda de vcs! Ent√£o... Eu penso em comprar o Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition... Mas para poder jogar √© preciso instalar o jogo no HD do xbox? Ou √© s√≥ por o jogo e jogar sem precisar instalar nada? E fiquei sabendo tambem

            <p>Hi Sahil,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. You have reached the right place and I will try my best to assist you with this query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Side-by-Side configuration error usually happens when you do not have the correct version of Microsoft Visual C++ software on the computer or some corrupted system files related to Microsoft Visual C++ software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, let us first check if you have any corrupted system files on the computer. To check this let us run the SFC Scan and check the scan result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Run an SFC Scan</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The ‚Äú<strong><em>sfc /scannow</em></strong>‚Äù command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>a) Press ‚Äú<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>‚Äù + ‚Äú<strong><em>X</em></strong>‚Äù keys on the keyboard and select ‚Äú<strong><em>Command Prompt (Admin)</em></strong>‚Äù from that menu.</p>
<p>b) On the command prompt window, type the following command, and then press ‚Äú<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>‚Äù</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in"><strong><em>sfc /scannow</em></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in">&nbsp;</p>
<p>c) Follow the on-screen instructions and complete the scan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information, you may refer to the article given below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</em></strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn‚Äôt help, then try uninstalling and reinstalling the version of the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable package required for this game on the computer and check if that resolves the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>Hope this is helpful. Please get back to us with the result.</span>
