<h2>            Start up error in Windows 7</h2>
                    While logging into windows 7.... get an error.... <br />
"<strong>c:\Windows\System32\wshbth.dll is either not designed to run on windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support."<br />
</strong><br />
I am getting these error on multiple applications like Gtalk, winamp, msn msngr etc. I have already uninstalled and reinstalled these applications and still no use. Hope you guys can suggest me some steps to fix this issue.

<p>Hi v-2vina,</p>
<p>a. Since when have you had this issue?</p>
<p>If the issue is recent, you may try System restore.</p>
<p>System Restore returns your PC's system files and programs to a time when everything was working fine, potentially preventing hours of troubleshooting headaches. In Windows 7, System Restore is even more helpful. You can create more system restore points
 and see exactly what files will be removed or added when your PC is restored.</p>
<p>To open system restore,</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Open System Restore by clicking the Start button. In the search box, type System Restore, and then, in the list of results, click System Restore.<br />
If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>Refer the below links for more details:</p>

If sfc doesn't fix the error, create a new user account and try installing the apps. Do you still receive the error? I suppose not.
<br />
<br />
Your user profile is most definitely corrupt. <br />

<br />
copy the file "C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log" to your document folder (otherwise you can't open it) and open it with notepad. Now search for errors. Which errors do you see?<br />

<p><span>Hi Vinay,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the System File Checker tool cannot repair a file, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>At an elevated command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>takeown /f
<em>Path_And_File_Name</em></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, type
<strong>takeown /f E:\windows\system32\jscript.dll.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type the following command, and then press ENTER to grant administrators full access to the file:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>icacls
<em>Path_And_File_Name</em> /GRANT ADMINISTRATORS:F</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, type
<strong>icacls E:\windows\system32\jscript.dll /grant administrators:F</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type the following command to replace the file with a known good copy of the file:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Copy
<em>Path_And_File_Name_Of_Source_File Path_And_File_Name_Of_Destination</em></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, type
<strong>copy E:\temp\jscript.dll E:\windows\system32\jscript.dll.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft article for more information:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If SFC scan doesn’t fix the issues, the next step would be to do a startup repair:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Startup Repair is a Windows recovery tool that can fix certain system problems that might prevent Windows from starting. Startup Repair scans
 your computer for the problem and then tries to fix it so your computer can start correctly.

    <title>Messed up sound - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 3quin0x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Messed up sound</h2>
                    I know this post will be a bit the same like all the others, but still im gona make a different thread for it since the other ansers are rather.... dumb...<br />
<br />
2 days ago i upgraded from xp to 7 ultimate, i used the advanced install, formatted my harddrive, and made a fresh start..<br />
The install went fine, no problems at all, after i installed all the updates available and the drivers for win 7 (which are available)..<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the sound is all messed up, i do get sound, but it doesnt use the subwoofer and center speakers..<br />
It basicly sends all the sound to the front speakers, which arnt designed to handle the full frequency range, and so act distorted..<br />
<br />
Offcourse now your thinking, try the correct drivers.. But FYI i have tried absolutely everything..<br />
<br />
At the time i used my onboard realtek hd audio..<br />
I tried the microsoft driver (which comes with win 7), ive tried the driver offered on the mobo website, and the driver on the realtek website, without succes..<br />
<br />
After a day of fiddling i totaly had it, formatted the drive and installed xp again.. At my surprise the same problem now occurs in win xp.. Which is not possible as it has always worked there.. Again i tried all the drivers available including older version,
 which had no effect at all.. After i formatted again and reinstalled win xp once again, and offcourse again tried all the drivers i didnt know what else to do..<br />
<br />
So for my final attempt i bought a creative x-fi extreme pci-e sound card..<br />
This card supports the upmix which from win vista had been left out, where everything goes in stereo, this card would repair that..<br />
After i installed it in the pc, i immidiately after formatted again, and installed win 7.. I installed the latest driver for the sound card, and ran auto update once more to insure everything is up to date...<br />
<br />
Unfortunately it didnt improve, even more, it made it worse.. The sound is now even more distorted than it was before, where even the win startup sound is nothing more than a bunch of distorted noise..<br />
<br />
Now im prolly getting the same answer as all other thread, install the correct drivers and such.. But if you actualy read this you know this is not a driver issue.. Not only have i tried all drivers (new and old) but also have i bought a new sound card with
 win 7 drivers, which has exactly the same problem..<br />
Offcourse this can be a massive coincidence.. Or maybe theres just something wrong with win 7..<br />
<br />
Its easy to blame it on the drivers, but maybe have a look at win 7 instead as this is where the problems are..

            I am having the same problem. However, it only happens after power my computer back up after sleep mode. That is the only time that the mouse starts to click repeatedly when I merely hover over an icon.

    <title>Network failure caused by Array SSL VPN, and hard to repair. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Network failure caused by Array SSL VPN, and hard to repair.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just installed a Win 10 uncompatible by mistake, and it stuck during installing its network adapter, and I stopped it, and then, comes the nightmare.</p>
<p>I can not enable those adapters, and their names are bizarre.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9aedfef3-c8bc-49d3-ae40-1006f475abf4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9aedfef3-c8bc-49d3-ae40-1006f475abf4" /></a></p>
<p>Also, there're nothing in the network adapter properties window:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c41475a0-9c9a-4481-86ab-9416e1fe5216" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c41475a0-9c9a-4481-86ab-9416e1fe5216" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to be intuitive, I reinstalled my network drivers, and Device Manager looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a262cf0e-3fb8-46d5-a459-b778a55d6873" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a262cf0e-3fb8-46d5-a459-b778a55d6873" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I tried some internet instructions to start "Network Setup Service", but it doesn't work at all, this service stopped immediately after I started it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really appreciate it if someone could help me with this, without suggesting me reinstalling my whole OS...</p>

    <title>Is it possible to use an Image backup of my system in a virtual - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dirtyradar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to use an Image backup of my system in a virtual environment and restore it to a physical machine</h2>
                    <p>Since making the mistake of migrating to windows 8; I've been running my windows 7 in a virtual environment (VMware Player).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I would like to know is:</p>
<p>If I create a backup image of my operating system drive (Windows 7) inside my VMware Player; Am I able to use this image to restore my system on a physical hard drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've researched many possibilities but none of them ... aside from VMware knowledge base articles seem to offer any plausible remedy. It deals with using VMware vCenter Converter to facilitate the process or using a version of VMware Workstation to achieve
 something close to what I need. But ... both systems; from what I've read; deal with converting physical machines to virtual machines. The process I would like to achieve goes the other way round. From virtual to physical machine.</p>

I understand that the you need help for the windows 7 in VMware to take a backup but the issue you have posted would be better suited in TechNet forums.

<p>You can do this in the current version, but not by picking a value in the drop-down.<br />
<br />
Select all your pictures in the storyboard (<strong>Ctrl+A</strong>) and then click the 'Video Tools / Edit' tab.&nbsp; For the duration, click in the box and

<h2>            xbox 360 with beeline iptv &#40;mediaroom&#41; - in russian language</h2>
                    
<p>Добрый день!</p>
<p><br />
Пользуюсь xbox 360 и услугой от beeline интернет телевидение. Приложение используется mediaroom. Хотелось бы уточнить почему в этом приложении нет возможности выключить приставку xbox 360 по таймеру?<br />
xbox 360 подключена к монитору и у монитора тоже нет функции выключения по таймеру - если вдруг ночью забыл выключить и уснул - приставка будет работать всю ночь и шум телевизора и приставки может разбудить - это приносит много неудобств и оставляет отрицательное
 мнение о самом приложении и вообще об этой услуге.</p>
<p>При этом не совсем понятно - кто ответственный за функционал этого приложения - похоже что все не в курсе!</p>

<p><strong>[<span>Good day!</span></strong><br />

<strong><span>I take the</span>&nbsp;<span>xbox 360</span>&nbsp;<span>and the service</span>&nbsp;<span>from the</span>&nbsp;<span>beeline</span>&nbsp;<span>Internet</span>&nbsp;<span>TV.</span><span>The
 application is used</span>&nbsp;<span>mediaroom.</span>&nbsp;<span>I would like to</span>&nbsp;<span>clarify</span>&nbsp;<span>why</span><span>this application</span>&nbsp;<span>is not possible to</span>&nbsp;<span>turn
 off the</span>&nbsp;<span>xbox 360</span>&nbsp;<span>console</span><span>on a timer</span>?</strong><br />

<p>I wrote a request to the beeline. They said they gave information to the center of development. Hopefully soon I can turn off the console on a timer in the program from beeline (mediaroom). It seems to me that Microsoft have little to standardize the application
 issued by customers using mediaroom sdk. And to make off-timer function mandatory.</p>

    <title>AppData Folder in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> p o&#39;c  say:</h3>
<h2>            AppData Folder in Windows 7</h2>
                    Recently, I restored a backup of C: drive in Windows 7. The reason for this was a reinstallation of Windows 7 (Boot Camp) on my MacBook Pro. For some reason, I believe I did not make the right choice with regard to the options for copying the backup files
 and cancelled the restore. I then started the restore process again, which went fine. However, I now discovered that I have two AppData folders in my Users folder. My machine is running fine and I could just ignore this issue. However, I would like to get
 rid of one of the AppData folders. When I try to delete one of these, I get a message about the action not being possible because the program is open in another folder which needs to be closed. At this point I am stuck for a solution. I would be grateful for
 some advice. Thank you.

            Hi Simon,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Not sure if there is a solution to this. You should chat with a live agent from Skype Support to see if there is a way to find the video.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Not all options will allow you to chat with a live agent. Select following one from the categories dropdown to get the option for chat.
<br />
<br />Payments &amp; purchases
<br />Account, profile &amp; sign-in
<br />Privacy &amp; security
<br />
<br />On the next screen, you get the Chat link which you can click.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e46d5102-0149-4341-8e55-dbc3fe9221d9?upload=true" />

</p><p>- Windows Media Player, Movie Maker and Photo Gallery? I have them and don't want to lose them. Are they separate from Windows Media Center which is being ditched?</p>
<p>- Google Chrome? Will I have that after the upgrade, please?&nbsp;</p>
<p>- All my programs, software etc., will be safe won't they? I have Gimp PhotoEditor and cannot afford to lose that.</p>
<p>- What does "Apps: 0 Compatabile" mean?</p>

            <p>Hallo Vanessa, thank you for answering so quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;1. From my rapid search for "what are apps!" and my understanding of the answers I can say that I have the following apps on my Windows 7 Home Premium Service pack 1:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Microsoft Word Starter 2010</p>
<p>- Kindle for PC</p>
<p>- Any Video Converter (AVC)</p>
<p>- Audacity</p>
<p>- Wondershare Video Editor</p>
<p>- Windows Live Movie Maker</p>
<p>- Windows Media Player</p>
<p>- Virus Total Uploader</p>
<p>- Grammarly</p>
<p>- Acrobat Reader DC</p>
<p>- Paint</p>
<p>- Belarc Advisor&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Perfect Effects 8 (photo editor)</p>
<p>- Roulette Bot Plus</p>
<p>- Windows DVD Maker</p>
<p>- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fax and Scan (never used)</p>
<p>- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Live Mail (never used)</p>
<p>- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Windows Live Messenger (never used)</p>
<p>- Clear.fi (never used)</p>
<p>- DX Optics Pro (photo editor)</p>
<p>- Desk Babes/Virtual Girl</p>
<p>- Egis Tec ? (never used)</p>
<p>- Freemake (audio and video converter) Never used</p>
<p>- HP (for my HP Printer)</p>
<p>- Microsoft silverlight</p>
<p>- Nero</p>
<p>- Zoom downloader?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please excuse my lack of knowledege, I hope it hasn't infuriated you Vanessa, as it has others! I'm thinking in the list some are software and some are apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer is an Acer and came with Windows 7 Home Premium preinstalled so I also have in the All Programs list Acer- eRecovery Management, Acer updater.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. "Apps: 0 Compatible" is a message I recieved when looking at the provided info on Windows 10 after clicking the icon on my Task Bar, which said it had also scanned my computer and gave it the thumbs up for compatibilty. The "Apps: 0 Compatible" message,
 however, concerned me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Vanessa what do you mean by a&nbsp;<strong>CLEAN INSTALL</strong>, please? I'm thinking it has to do with the upgrade? If so, I have been informed by the message received that Microsoft will do it all for me, automatically. And the "Windows.old folder"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally Windows Media Center I really haven't used, yet I am an ardent fan of Windows Media Player and, if possible, would like to keep it. I am wondering that because in All Programs on my computer they are listed separtely albeit consecutively, if they
 are two distinct entities? The pro pack purchase, if necessary after installation of 10, will it be a one off or a subscription, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your assistance.</p>

            <p>I'm also running Windows 7 and merely want to open my LiveMail, but got the same Bad Image message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;ran the repair tool as you suggest, and found that LiveMail&nbsp;opens now;&nbsp;shows me a login box that accepts my username and password;&nbsp;but then shows a message box saying it&nbsp;has to shut down.&nbsp; All this follows my attempt to install the update recommended in
 an email I received today from Microsoft.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, my mail was fine 'til I updated and now it doesn't work.</p>

<h2>            Media Creation Tool very slow at &#34;Getting Updates&#34;</h2>
                    I got the media creation tool to download w10. The download process went smooth but now it's at the stage of "getting updates" where it says it will only take a few minutes but is going up very slowly. It's been 6 hours and it's only at 23 percent and
 my pc was fully updated before hand before starting the download. Is it just my internets horrible or something else? The download itself only took about an hour&nbsp;

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Please could someone advise. I am having a very unexciting recurring nightmare.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I got a new laptop a few months ago with Windows 8 (&amp; Mcafee) preinstalled on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Every couple of days I started getting messages saying updates need to be installed, followed by all sorts of errors when I tried to ‘update’.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I tried to resolve previously but eventually gave up on this a while back and just to accepted that my PC would automatically reboot itself every 48 hours followed by all the error issues.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I put this issue off until about a week ago, when I decided it was actually rather a pain. So since then have been trying to get this issue sorted once and for all, but no luck so far.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">My <b>recurring nightmare</b> is always the same sadly:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Seeing on various forums, it says ‘In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands exactly as they appear. Press the<span>&nbsp;</span>Enter<span>&nbsp;</span>key after each command:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">(1)·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I did the above and eventually both got to 100% and the first then says ‘</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">the component store is repairable. The operation completed successfully’. The second (restorehealth) also gets to 100% and
 says ‘repaired’.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I then go to windows updates and click install. </span>
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It then says:‘installing updates’. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Then: &nbsp;‘there was a problem installing updates’</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Then: ‘restart your pc to finish installing updates. Your Pc will restart in 2 days if you don’t restart now.’</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">So then I click ‘restart now’</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">On restart – &nbsp;I get ‘preparing to configure Windows updates’</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Then ‘Preparing to retry’</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Then &nbsp;PC restarts itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Once restarted, I then click check for updates in <b>
<u>windows update</u></b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Then ‘download and install updates (usually it says around 33 or 36 mb total) – when click see details it says 26 important updates.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">*Sometimes I also then turn Mcaffee firewall off to see if that makes a difference*

My gut feeling says it is your McAfee. I would remove it and use the built in defender in its place.<br />
<br />
Use this uninstaller<br />

<br />
Then try to update and see if it succeeds.<br />
<br />
If not we can pursue it<br />

            <em>Assuming Win8 64-bit</em>, roll up your sleeves, cross your fingers and try the following multi-step fix...
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ACTIONS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>[You may want to print these instructions for offline reference. Run all steps in one (1), uninterrupted sitting. Don't skip any steps. If a step says to reboot,
<em>reboot!</em>] </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Right-click on the following link, select SAVE AS... &amp; download the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:
<a href="http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">After making certain you have a copy of your Product Key /Product ID handy</span>, uninstall the&nbsp;<strong>McAfee
</strong>application (e.g., <strong>McAfee&nbsp;Security Center</strong>) via <strong>
Start | Control Panel | Programs |</strong><strong> Programs and Features</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. <strong>IMPORTANT! =&gt; Make sure the Windows Firewall is enabled <em>immediately</em> after rebooting!</strong> [Should happen automatically but I want you to doublecheck.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NB: You're "working without a net" now: Don't to ANYTHING <em>else</em> online (e.g., browsing; reading email; chatting) until you've completed Step #7 below!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1 above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to run the utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. <strong>OPTION A:</strong> Do a clean install of the McAfee application (using your Product ID, if need be) &amp; reboot. If you purchased your software directly from McAfee, go to
<a href="https://home.mcafee.com/Secure/Protected/Login.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">https://home.mcafee.com/Secure/Protected/Login.aspx</font></a> to log in and download your software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OPTION B (Recommended but still optional):</strong> Enable <strong>Windows Defender</strong> (free &amp; already installed) instead =&gt;
<a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/21962-windows-defender-turn-off-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/21962-windows-defender-turn-off-windows-8-a.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. If you reinstalled the McAfee application in #6 above, manually and repeatedly update the application until you get a "no more updates" or similar prompt - otherwise, you may skip this one&nbsp;step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Reset Internet Explorer manually (do NOT use the Fix It!) per the "Let me reset Internet Explorer settings myself" section on this page:<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TIP: For optimum results, check/enable the <strong>Delete personal settings </strong>
option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Run the Windows Update troubleshooter from start to finish per the instructions on this page, then reboot once more =&gt;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates</font></a>
 [1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Run a manual check for updates &amp; see if you can successfully install your updates now.</p>

            <p>Hi PA Bear</p>
<p>I followed the above steps.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>At <b><u>Point 6</u></b>, even though I have a subscription to McAfee which lasts until next July, I thought it would be best to rule out any McAfee poss issues, so I tried to enable windows defender.</p>
<p>However I was unable to enable windows defender. <b><i>(something was blocking this?)</i></b></p>
<p><b><i><br />
</i></b></p>
<p>So I decided to proceed with the steps (at this point neither windows was enabled and McAfee had been removed).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>At <b><u>Point 8</u></b> – Am not sure if this is relevant but I normally use Chrome for internet, but as I also do have Internet explorer on my PC, which rarely use, so I followed the steps in the internet explorer app anyway. Ie so
 I did nothing to Chrome.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>At <b><u>Point 9</u></b> – running the troubleshooter. This completed, but at the end it said:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Problems Found:</p>
<p>‘Problems installing recent updates - Not fixed</p>
<p>Check for missing or corrupt files – Detected</p>
<p>Service registration is missing or corrupt – Fixed</p>
<p>Windows Update error 0x80070057(2013-12-08-T-11_46_06A) – Fixed’
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Next I tried <b><u>step 10</u></b> – manual check for updates.
</p>
<p>On reboot it says: ‘Installing updates’ then ‘preparing to configure’ then ‘failure’ then ‘reverting changes’ etc</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b><u>IE above steps have failed, back to square one.</u></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other advice, things to try to resolve this Windows 8 update issue?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I wonder if this is relevant: On my PC I also have installed some free Iobit software that a friend advised me to use a few years back and as far as I was aware have never caused issues on this or my previous computer. Anyway, looking
 in my programs in control panel, I have the following products by Iobit: Advanced System Care 7, Driver Booster, Malware Fighter, Surfing Protection, Start Menu 8 and Smart Defrag.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I wonder if any of these could be causing problems, such as the blocking at Point 6 and other general windows 8 update issues? Or do you think that is a red herring?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Many Thanks, again!</p>

            <p>Many Thanks for your reply the other day.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Every day since then, I have spent many hours on this, but still no solution as yet.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Firstly, in response to your point about ‘NOTE: If the McAfee application is not installed and you can't turn on Windows Defender... The computer should NOT be connected to the internet..’</p>
<p>- Yes, as soon as it failed the first time, ie instantly after following point 10 in your ‘roll up your sleeves’ list, I immediately reinstalled McAfee (ie long before I made the above post). I should have said that before. Also just
 for clarification: yes it is 64bit.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anyway, I have tried to be as methodical as poss, so whenever I have had PC issues over the years, I record what I have done including screen shots etc into a word doc so I have a log to refer to.</p>
<p>Anyway things I have done since your last post, in chronological order:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Uninstalled Iobit driver booster and surfing protection.</p>
<p>2. Reboots, usual error messages on restart eg failure to config, reverting, failure etc..</p>
<p>3. Check for Windows updates. Result = 26 Updates.</p>
<p>4. Download &amp; Install above</p>
<p>5. Error Message: 25 succeeded. 1 failed. <b>Error Code: 80070103</b>. Restart now to finish installing.</p>
<p>6. Restart then usual error messages on restart eg failure to config, reverting, failure etc..</p>
<p>7. Uninstalled Iobit malware fighter</p>
<p>8. Check for Windows updates. Result = 26 Updates.</p>
<p>9. Download &amp; Install above</p>
<p>10. Error Message: 25 succeeded. 1 failed. <b>Error Code: 80070103.</b> Restart now to finish installing.</p>
<p>11. Restart then usual error messages on restart eg failure to config, reverting, failure etc..</p>
<p>12. Uninstalled Iobit Start menu 8</p>
<p>13. Reboot</p>
<p>14. Uninstalled Iobit Advanced System Care and Smart Defrag</p>
<p>15. Restart then usual error messages on restart eg failure to config, reverting, failure etc..</p>
<p>16. Check for Windows updates. Result = 26 Updates.</p>
<p>17. Download &amp; Install above</p>
<p>18. Restart then usual error msgs..</p>
<p>19. Uninstalled Iobit ‘uninstaller’</p>
<p>20. Restart twice (error messages both times)</p>
<p>21. Check for Windows updates. Result = 33 Updates.</p>
<p>22. Download &amp; Install above</p>
<p>23. Error Message: 32 succeeded. 1 failed. <b>Error Code: 80070103.
</b>Restart now to finish installing.</p>
<p>24. Restart then usual error messages on restart eg failure to config, reverting, failure etc..</p>
<p>25. Run Windows update troubleshooter</p>
<p>26. Result: ‘Potential Windows Update <b>error detected 0x80070490
</b>– Fixed’. </p>
<p>27. Restart then usual error messages on restart eg failure to config, reverting, failure etc..</p>
<p>28. Check for Windows updates. Result = ‘Windows could not search for new updates’ Error Code 8024A000</p>
<p>29.&nbsp; Tried Automatic Fix @ http://support.microsoft.com/gp/windows-update-issues/en-us</p>
<p>30. This did not work</p>
<p>31. Tried PABear’s ‘roll up sleeve/ multi step fix’ again</p>
<p>32. McAfee uninstalled. Windows Defender enabled. *The fact that I was allowed to enable Windows Defender this time, unlike the first time, suggests that it was some of Iobits software, maybe the Advanced System Care program itself,
 (by this time unistalled) that did not let me enable it the fist time.</p>
<p>33. Windows Update troubleshooter: At end it said: ‘ Problems installing recent updates – Not fixed. Check for missing or corrupt files – Detected. Windows update
<b>error 0x80070057</b>’</p>
<p>34. Restart then usual error messages on restart eg failure to config, reverting, failure etc..</p>
<p>35. Check for Windows updates. Result = 33 Updates.</p>
<p>36. Download &amp; Install above</p>
<p>37. Error Message: 32 succeeded. 1 failed. <b>Error Code: 80070103.</b> Restart now to finish installing.</p>
<p>38. Restart then usual error messages on restart eg failure to config, reverting, failure etc..</p>
<p>39. I then started to consider whether to hide the update. So did this. The update in question that had failed appeared to be: ‘Intel Corporation – Storage Controller – Intel(R) Mobile Express Chipset SATA RAID Controller’ (6.9MB)
 published 27/10/2012</p>
<p>40. After this update was ‘hidden’, restart PC</p>
<p>41. Restart then usual error messages on restart eg failure to config, reverting, failure etc..</p>
<p>42. Check for Windows updates. Result = 32 Updates. (ie not the 33 like last time, so suggests that one update was ‘hidden’)</p>
<p>43. Download &amp; Install above</p>
<p>44. Restart then usual error messages on restart eg failure to config, reverting, failure etc..</p>
<p>45. Check for Windows updates. Result = 32 Updates.</p>
<p>46. Restarted the PC for good measure again at this point</p>
<p>47. Windows Update troubleshooter: At end it said: ‘ Problems installing recent updates – Not fixed. Check for missing or corrupt files – Detected. Windows update<b> error 0x80070057’</b></p>
<p>48. Decided to reinstall McAfee now, as its uninstallation appeared not to make any difference to the issues.</p>
<p>49. Check for Windows updates. Result = 30 Updates this time!!
</p>
<p>50. Installed above and rebooted.</p>
<p>51. Restart then usual error messages on restart eg failure to config, reverting, failure etc..</p>
<p>52. Run windows update troubleshooter again, but this time got slightly different message: ‘Potential Windows Update Database
<b>error detected 0x80070490</b> – Fixed. Windows Update components must be repaired – Fixed’</p>
<p>53. Check for Windows updates. Result = it said ‘Windows could not search for new updates.<b> Error 8024A000’</b></p>
<p>54. Run windows update troubleshooter again. Result = ‘Potential Windows Update Database
<b>error detected 0x80070490</b> – Fixed. Windows Update components must be repaired – Fixed’</p>
<p>55. Check for Windows updates. Result = still saying 30 Updates
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above has taken many hours each day, for the last few, but the issues are still similar although the error code slightly different.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can you suggest a next step that I should be trying now to break this cycle?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As always, many thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>In my previous reply, I asked, "Does Advanced SystemCare's Rescue Center&nbsp;contain backups of ALL the changes its EVER made to your computer?" - but you didn't answer my question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to your last reply, Advanced SystemCare is no longer installed (nor is any of the other IObit applications).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you or did you not restore everything in Rescue Center <em>before you uninstalled Advanced SystemCare?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you're still missing all those updates...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The computer should NOT be connected to the internet or any local networks (i.e., other computers) in its current state. All of your personal data (e.g., online banking &amp; credit-card passwords) should be considered at-risk, if not already compromised.</strong></p>

            <span>No I didn't reply to that question, sorry.</span>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway - at the time, altho I didnt answer your Q, I actually did check the rescue center further to your point and it only showed 2 restore points, which I think were both in the last 2/3 months (ie long after I first started getting) these windows
 8 update issues.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did not restore anything from Advanced Systemcare, before uninstalling, no.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>All &nbsp;Iobit apps are now totally removed from my PC.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do I detect from what you say, that you are sceptical of the Advanced System Care software and think Iobit may have initiated something on my PC in the past (and perhaps not reported it) that has caused these windows update errors?</div>
<div><br />
<div>If so, are you able to suggest what I do... or is reformatting back to original factory state the only option?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Or, as annoying as it is, I could just put up with automatic reboots and failed windows updates every 48 hours as I did previously..</div>

<p><br />
At this point, I can offer two (2) suggestions. See:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to <strong>Refresh</strong> [or] <strong>Reset</strong>...your PC<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</a></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OPTION A: See if doing a <strong>Refresh</strong> [1] resolves the "recurring update nightmares."&nbsp; If no joy...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OPTION B: Doing a <strong>Reset</strong> [2] <em>should</em> do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important! &nbsp;Pay close attention to the <strong>Notes</strong> &amp; <strong>Warnings</strong> sections on that page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TIP: After completing a <strong>Refresh</strong> or a <strong>Reset</strong>, your current McAfee application will have been removed but the preinstalled McAfee free-trialware wil have been installed again. You will need to repeat Steps #1 thru #7 of my
 multi-step fix after doing a <strong>Refresh</strong> and after doing a <strong>
Reset</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'd recommend running the McAfee removal tool &amp; then enabling Windows Defender - at least temporarily - in both cases. Later on, you can do a clean install of your paid McAfee application if you wish.</li></ul>
<p>==============================================================<br />
[1] <strong>Refresh</strong>&nbsp;= a repair install of Win8.</p>
<p>[2] <strong>Reset</strong> = removing everything &amp; reinstalling Win8.<br />

<h3> jovicaspasic  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows server 2012, windows firewall service does not work</h2>
                    <p>
Windows server 2012 Standard. Recently, I had an intrusion of "coin miner" threat, and in attempt to neutralize it, using third party program I accidentally damaged windows firewall service. When I tried to start it(WF), following error appeared:<br />
<br />
'"Windows could not start the Windows Firewall on Local Computer. For more information review the System Event Log. If this is a non-Microsoft service, contact the service vendor, and refer to service-specific error code 5. "<br />
<br />
<br />
Snap-in message:<br />
<br />
"The windows firewall with Advanced Security snap-in fail to load. Restart the (WF) service on computer that You are managing. Error code 0x6D9."<br />
<br />
I tried many different options, but without success.<br />
<br />
Any help is acceptable. Thanks in advance.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Email Client using wrong email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garysankary  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Email Client using wrong email</h2>
                    <p>I have three email accounts with Microsoft- one for junk, one old live.com account that I don't use anymore and one professional account that I&nbsp;use for everything. When I setup my new Windows 10 computer, and signed in with my professional email account
 my default account the Windows 10 email app selected was my junk account. I can't figure out how to change to my preferred account.
</p>
<p>On the MS Account website it shows the correct account for my default account.
</p>
<p>When I sign into the email client now I get a message that the account needs attention because the account listed doesn't match the account I singed into the PC with. This is really frustrating. It's happening on my PC and my surface, all with Windows 10.
 This seems to be an account issue not a PC issue. </p>

            No that does not help. With Windows 10 Mail you don't have a choice to set up your outlook account with another email. So there is no way to "switch accounts"&nbsp;For example, I had used my Yahoo email as my Microsoft Account in the past. Now I am using an
 @outlook.com email for all my email and Microsoft Account. Windows shows my @outlook.com email when I log in, but when I go to mail, under my outlook account it lists my @yahoo email address and that is the only one I can use.

            And yes, I switched my @outlook.com email to my primary email for my Microsoft account (obviously since windows login changed) And I deleted all traces of the @yahoo.com email from my Microsoft account...yet it still shows up in windows mail and won't
 go away .

            <p>No, doesn't help at all. The issue is I&nbsp;have two microsoft accounts. BTW the reason I have two is because when I upgraded to 8.1 it created a new one for me to long in with and I didn't notice. Now, I want to use the account I've told everyone one know is
 my real email. Microsoft Windows 10 Email client picked the wrong one. I have no way to change it. I keep getting messages that my account is out of sync and needs to be fixed. (Not possible to fix it) and finally when I sent emails my friends are getting
 notes from the wrong email confusing everyone. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This feels like a Windows 10 error. Is there a solution?</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Itzik Eshed,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting an <em>unknown device</em> after an upgrade is usually triggered by having an outdated or incompatible driver. To address this issue, I suggest updating the driver for your&nbsp;<span>I<em>ntel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R)</em>.
 You may perform the update via Device Manager or you can download and install the driver manually. Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Right-click the Windows key and select
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Look for your unknown device, right-click it, and select
<strong>Update Driver</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Follow the on-screen instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In case Windows doesn't find a new driver for your&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I</span><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ntel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R)</span>,&nbsp;</em>then I suggest that you try looking for one
 from Intel's website and search for it<em>s latest driver.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please update this thread with the results so I'll be able to help you further if needed.</p>
<p><em><br />
</em>Regards.</p>

<p>Hello Vanessa,</p>
<p>Thanks for your advice,</p>
<p>I have checked that i have the latest&nbsp;</p>
<p>intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R)&nbsp; driver version.</p>
<p>Also i want to point out that all my&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bluetooth devices are functioning OK on my laptop ( Lenovo T460s&nbsp; ).</p>
<p>My question though is how do i remove the unknown device driver&nbsp;</p>
<p>from my drivers list .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Itzik Eshed</p>

<p>Thanks for getting back, Itzik Eshed. The reason why I've suggested to update the driver is that having an outdated driver is the common cause of having an unknown device. But since the driver of your&nbsp;<span>I</span><span>ntel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R) is
 already updated, then let's try to remove or disconnect one at a time any external or any USB peripheral devices from your computer. If unknown device no longer show after removing a particular device, then the issue is with the driver of that device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, if you're still getting the same error though the external devices are already disconnected, then there's a possibility that this unknown device might be created by a software. To verify that, please start your computer in safe mode, then
 check your Device Manager again and see if the <em>Unknown Device </em>still appear. Kindly click

<p><span>Hello Vanessa,</span></p>
<p><span>Again thank you so much for trying to help me out.</span></p>
<p><span>I don't have any external USB devices attached to my laptop and the&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I started my laptop in safe mode and the unknown device is no longer&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback. Kindly go back to the <em>Device Manager </em>and expand the
<strong>Other devices</strong> category. Does it show the name of the unknown device or any description about it? To check further, please right-click the
<em>Unknown device</em> and click <strong>Properties</strong>. If possible, take a screenshot of the
<em>Properties page</em> and include it on your reply. This is for us to further check on why the device keeps on reinstalling.</p>
<p>

            Phan,
<br />I don't know what you tried for "recovery" as that word means different things to different people. Can you tell me what you tried to do exactly and details on what went wrong/error messages etc. 
<br />
<br />If you want to do a complete wipe and reimage to rule out all software issues, here are instructions: 
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacereco...</a> (with a different computer if yours is not working properly) and download a recovery image for your Surface. You will need a 16GB USB stick formatted FAT32. Unzip/extract the recovery zip to the formatted USB stick and then-
<br />
<br />To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:
<br />Step 1:	Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in (hold down the power button for 30 seconds).
<br />Step 2: 	Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.
<br />Step 3:	Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the power button on your Surface.
<br />Step 4: 	When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.
<br />Step 5:	When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.
<br />Step 6: 	Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.
<br />	If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of the screen.
<br />Step 7: 	Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.
<br />Step 8:	Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.
<br />Step 9: 	Choose Just remove my files.
<br />Step 10:	Select Reset.
<br />	Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process continues (this can take a while).
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. If it was of assistance, please DO mark as Answer.

            How long has it been on this screen? If over an hour, shut down by holding the power button for 60 seconds, then turn on normally. Exactly what do you see?
