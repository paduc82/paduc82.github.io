<h2>            Staying Signed-In on Xbox One During Standby&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Since launch I have not been able to keep my Gamertag signed-in on the Xbox One when the system goes into standby. I have checked all the settings and such but to no avail. Every time I wake the Xbox One out of standby I have to re sign-in. It isn't so bad
 for Dead Rising 3 as it just sits in the Pause Menu and I can resume the game. But for Battlefield 4, it doesn't work. Even though I sign back in I have to take the disc out and reload the game thus negating keeping the game in standby.</p>

<p>I believe that you get signed out that way it shows on live that you are offline. What they should have it do is leave you logged in but disconnected from XBL that way the game doesn't see a profile change.</p>

<p>I can play Dead Rising 3 fine by keeping it loaded and just signing in as soon as the Xbox One wakes. It's just BF4 so far that requires the entire game to be reloaded in order to re-access the multiplayer.</p>

<p>I have this same problem and when I post about it some one always brings up the kinect sign in. It just does not work good enough. If I have my controller on and in my had it sees me just fine but with out it I have to stare at my connect for like 10 seconds
 with a grin that shows all of my teeth before it will see me. I know you can go click sign in manually but the point is on the 360 you can alway stay logged in on the one you can't and it has added one more very annoying step to do so. Microsoft please address
 this issue!</p>

<p>Hey! Just have the kinnect recognize you when it sees you or since we had the update you can make it so that you automatically sign in when you turn on your Xbox without the kinnect even seeing you. I hope that helps. The reason it does that is to make it
 so that you are offline when its in standby mode but I agree they should make it so that you just sign out of XBL instead of your whole profile that would be nice! :)

                    <p>Windows 10 completed successfully updating to version 1709 and aside from losing dual boot entries (windows 7) everything looked ok until I powered up the PC the next day.</p>

<p>Press Ctrl+Alt+delete to restart</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The boot loaders that you are seeing is not an error. According to the information that you gave, your
<strong>Windows 7 boot partition </strong>has been dismounted or corrupted and it is now causing boot issues on your
<strong>PC.</strong> To troubleshoot this, we recommend <strong>formatting your Windows 7 drive partition.</strong> After doing so, kindly reinstall your Windows 7 partition. This should resolve your issues with the startup boot prompt.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do get back to us if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>Results verified by WinDBG, DumpCHK, and BlueScreenView.<br />
</strong><br />
The Bug_Check was 7A CAUSE&nbsp;memory_corruption which could be RAM or even hard<br />
drive or cabling issues.<br />
<br />
BugCheck 7A, {c0417568, c0000185, 4ddd3860, 82ead0e8}<br />
Probably caused by : memory_corruption<br />

<br />
<strong>1.</strong> The first thing to do is to check thoroughly for malware, especially RootKits - see the
<br />
methods below.<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
<strong>2A.</strong> Check with Sony Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums<br />
about any known issues. <br />
<br />
<strong>2B.</strong> Be sure to check the laptop's cabling and hard drive as best you can (which is not much
<br />
or easy on a laptop so you may need technical support from a real computer shop or Sony's
<br />
Support). Run Checkdisk&nbsp;to&nbsp;check the&nbsp;drive - see methods below.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>2C.</strong> Check for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and
<br />
separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those<br />
without Dump in their names (see driver update methods below).<br />
<br />
BiosMajorRelease = 5<br />
BiosMinorRelease = 0<br />
FirmwareMajorRelease = 5<br />
FirmwareMinorRelease = 0<br />
BiosVendor = Phoenix Technologies LTD<br />
BiosVersion = R1050J8<br />
BiosReleaseDate = <strong>07/18/2007</strong> &lt;- check for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers,<br />
and the makor on-board and separate device drivers.<br />
SystemManufacturer = Sony Corporation<br />
SystemProductName = VGN-AR51J<br />
SystemFamily = N/A<br />
SystemVersion = C3LQLGN3<br />
SystemSKU = N/A<br />
BaseBoardManufacturer = Sony Corporation<br />
BaseBoardProduct = VAIO<br />

<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Check the memory very thoroughly. Keep in mind that memory tests do not detect all<br />
errors such as the tiny speed differences between memory modules that appear to be<br />
identical. So it may be necessary to swap the modules in and out in different combinations<br />
and patterns&nbsp; (see memory test methods below).<br />
<br />
------------<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Use ALL the other methods in the troubleshooters below and in the next reply.<br />
<br />
========================================================</p>
<p><strong>Are you using an SSD? Or RAID? Double Check "EVERYTHING" relating to the hard drive,<br />
controller, and cabling (of course remove ALL power first).<br />

<strong>Cause</strong>
<p>Frequently, you can determine the cause of the KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR bug check from the error status (Parameter 2). Some common status codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0xC000009A, or STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES, indicates a lack of nonpaged pool resources.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC000009C, or STATUS_DEVICE_DATA_ERROR, typically indicates bad blocks (sectors) on the hard disk.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC000009D, or STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED, indicates defective or loose cabling, termination, or that the controller does not see the hard disk.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC000016A, or STATUS_DISK_OPERATION_FAILED, indicates bad blocks (sectors) on the hard disk.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC0000185, or STATUS_IO_DEVICE_ERROR, indicates improper termination or defective cabling on SCSI devices or that two devices are trying to use the same IRQ.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC000000E, or STATUS_NO_SUCH_DEVICE, indicates a hardware failure or an incorrect drive configuration. Check your cables and check the drive with the diagnostic utility available from your drive manufacturer. If you are using older PATA (IDE) drives, this
 status code can indicate an incorrect master/subordinate drive configuration.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>These status codes are the most common ones that have specific causes. For more information about other possible status codes that can be returned, see the Ntstatus.h file in the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).</p>
<p>Another common cause of this error message is defective hardware or failing RAM.</p>
<p>A virus infection can also cause this bug check. <br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Resolving a bad block problem:</strong> An I/O status code of 0xC000009C or 0xC000016A typically indicates that the data could not be read from the disk because of a bad block (sector). If you can restart the computer after the error, Autochk runs
 automatically and attempts to map the bad sector to prevent it from being used anymore.
</p>
<p>If Autochk does not scan the hard disk for errors, you can manually start the disk scanner. Run
<strong>Chkdsk /f /r</strong> on the system partition. You must restart the computer before the disk scan begins. If you cannot start the computer because of the error, use the Recovery Console and run
<strong>Chkdsk /r</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; If your system partition is formatted with the FAT file system, the long file names that the Windows operating system uses might be damaged if you use Scandisk or another MS-DOS-based hard disk tool to verify the integrity of your
 hard disk from MS-DOS. Always use the version of Chkdsk that matches your version of Windows.</p>
<p><strong>Resolving a defective hardware problem:</strong> If the I/O status is C0000185 and the paging file is on an SCSI disk, check the disk cabling and SCSI termination for problems.</p>
<p><strong>Resolving a failing RAM problem:</strong> Run the hardware diagnostics that the system manufacturer supplies, especially the memory scanner. For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.
</p>
<p>Check that all the adapter cards in the computer are properly seated. Use an ink eraser or an electrical contact treatment, available at electronics supply stores, to ensure adapter card contacts are clean.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help identify the device that is causing the error. You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS to try to resolve this error.</p>
<p>Make sure that the latest Windows Service Pack is installed.</p>
<p>If the preceding steps do not resolve the error, take the system motherboard to a repair facility for diagnostic testing. A crack, a scratched trace, or a defective component on the motherboard can cause this error.</p>
<p><strong>Resolving a virus infection:</strong> Check your computer for viruses by using any up-to-date, commercial virus scanning software that examines the Master Boot Record of the hard disk. All Windows file systems can be infected by viruses.

=============================<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as
<br />
the cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is
<br />
clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also
<br />
run&nbsp;them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from<br />
tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not does not mean you should not<br />
check with the other methods below.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower

memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory

tests fail to show a problem.<br />

<strong>Could be a driver related issue though less likely than memory.</strong> Update your drivers<br />
manually by looking at System maker and Device maker's sites.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (Check for BIOS and driver updates.)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model. <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Internet connection keeps disconnecting. Can I have a solution that works&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new Surface Pro (13 Feb 2018), Windows 10 Pro, 64 bit. It was bought with internet connectivity in mind, but every few minutes the connection is lost:</p>
<p>I have a shared router, and my Dell and my Android, and my wife's old laptop can still connect when the Surface Pro cannot.</p>
<p>I have streamed a video feed simultaneously to my Dell and the SP, and while the Dell plays flawlessly, the SP keeps stuttering and quickly drops behind.</p>
<p>Hovering over the wifi icon in the task bar shows that there is internet connectivity, even when the Surface Pro cannot connect.</p>
<p>This is a brand new laptop, so after two hours of updating, I believe all drivers are up to date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Windows Defender running, but no other anti-virus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see solutions that mention changing the power plan to the wifi adapter, but THERE IS NO POWER TAB.</p>
<p>I have already swapped the SP for a second one, as the retailer could not correct the fault, and believes that it is machine specific, however a quick Google - or Bing - shows that my issue is common.</p>
<p>The adapter is a Marvell Avastar Wireless-AC Network. I looked on the Avastar website, and there are no drivers listed for Windows 10, just for earlier versions, but as this is a brand new Microsoft machine, and after 2 hours of updating I expect to have
 the correct latest drivers.</p>
<p>I have tried running Edge and Firefox, but both are equally poor on this brand new Surface Pro machine.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
These should help. You can set the monitors to work as one desktop (can drag and drop across<br />
them however the programs can't be in full screen - reduce size) or they can be set to work as<br />
two separate monitors where you open the programs you want on each.<br />

each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description,<br />
version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This<br />
is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a<br />
driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t play game, Settlers 7 because of locked display settings in Windows XP mode</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've a new i7 PC running Windows 7 64-bit Pro and I am having problems getting my old software to run under the new Windows.&nbsp; My current fav game, Settlers 7 just refuses to run.&nbsp; It worked fine on my old XP machine, so I tried today to install it on the
 Virtual Machine in the XP mode environment.&nbsp; It loaded, but crashed when I tried to launch it.&nbsp; The error message said that 'Video mode could not be initialized.&nbsp; Could not set screen mode'.&nbsp; I've went to the display panel to alter the display settings, but
 cannot change the resolution or the colour setting (which is currently at Medium 16 bit).&nbsp; Ubisoft support are being 'unhelpful' and insist that the problems I am having are down to Windows 7 and it is therefore a Microsoft problem.&nbsp; Does anyone know of a
 way to change the settings?</p>

<p>According to the&nbsp; <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/windows-xp-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows XP Mode</a> web page, Microsoft designed it to allow small- and medium-sized businesses to run older Windows XP business software on Windows 7.&nbsp; The virtual machine's simulated hardware capabilities are adequate for typical business software, but not
 for playing games.</p>
<p>I don't think that the i7 processor is causing any problems.</p>

            Windows XP Mode doesn't have a real video adapter.&nbsp; It uses a virtualized, software-simulated video adapter with only basic capabilities, so it doesn't support advanced video settings that some video games require.

<h2>            Windows 10 - &#34;Bluetooth is not available on this Device&#34; &#40;Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 8260&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I built my PC back in September 2016, with an MSI X99A xPower Gaming Titanium motherboard, which contains an integrated/attached Intel Dual Band Wireless AC 8260 (w/ Bluetooth). I have Windows 10 running off of a Samsung 950 M.2 SSD, and a 2 TB WD HDD for
 storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I built the PC I've been having troubles particularly with the Bluetooth capabilities. It seems like after each windows update the Bluetooth settings will disappear from my PC altogether. It won't appear in the device manager or anywhere in the &nbsp;Control
 Panel or Settings menu. When it happened previously, I eventually ended up clearing CMOS and re-flashing the BIOS, as well as re-installing Windows fresh, which worked for a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only just noticed recently that Bluetooth capabilities have disappeared yet again. I'm not sure if this is a problem with the Intel chip itself. I have an RMA set up with MSI in case I need to use it, but before I tear apart my PC and send it away for
 a month, I'd like to see if there are any other fixes I haven't tried yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried updating to the latest drivers from Intel, running device and driver diagnostics, troubleshooting, checking the services menu and setting "Bluetooth Support Service" to Automatic. What worked before is no longer working. The only thing I have
 yet to do is CMOS and fresh install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to the Settings and run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter under "Updates &amp; Security", it informs me "Bluetooth is not available on this device. Please try using an external adapter..." even though the adapter should be already connected. Any help would
 be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Erik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have already tried a couple of steps, and even a fresh/clean install that works for a while but still the device fails, it seems that the issue is with the Bluetooth device. We suggest that you contact the manufacturer for fixes/replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Allyn, <br />
<br />
<br />
Your disappointments are understandable. To address this issue, we need to consider both ends should be compatible with each other (Version of Windows 10 and the Bluetooth device which Intel).<br />
<br />
You also mentioned on your reply that the device is no longer appearing under the
<strong>Device Manager</strong>. One of the reasons that the driver may not appear under the Device Manager is that the
<em>Bluetooth device <strong>is</strong> <strong>compatible</strong> with the device</em>,
<strong>but not with the version of the OS</strong>. Please consider to perform this method and tell us if this will help:<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>Device Manager</strong>, select it from the list of results, and then expand
<strong>Other devices</strong> in Device Manager.</span></li><li><span>Select the unknown device, press and hold (or right-click) it, and then select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select the <strong>Details</strong> tab, and then select <strong>Hardware Ids</strong> from the
<strong>Property</strong> list.</span>
<p>Look for the hardware ID for the Bluetooth radio. The hardware&nbsp;ID typically looks like this, where
<strong>{ID}</strong> is a series of numbers and/or letters: <strong>USB\VID_{ID}&amp;PID_{ID}<br />
<br />

<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>
<p>
</p></li><li><span>Press and hold (or right-click) the hardware ID, and then select <strong>
Copy</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Search on the web for the hardware ID you copied to try finding the name of the Bluetooth radio manufacturer. After that,&nbsp;visit the Bluetooth hardware or&nbsp;your PC manufacturer’s website to download a Bluetooth driver that’s compatible with Windows
 10.<br />

 my card reader (all of which previously worked fine) I've tried with blank memory cards (compact flash memory) and ones with photos on none work! I also can't find any drivers to uninstall please help :( all of my USB ports work fine, thanks in advance!<br />

If I need to reinstall drivers please could you tell me specifically which ones (there are many on the Canon site) Thanks!</div>

<div>
<div>Hi,</div>
<div>1. What is the make and model of the computer?</div>
<div>2. How are you pluggin in your memory cards? Is it using an USB Card Reader or using the Card Reader built into the computer?
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>You may check if there are any error messages for USB and Card Reader devices in device manager. You may refer to the below steps-<br />
a. Open<strong> Device Manager </strong>by clicking the <strong>Start button</strong>, clicking
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking<strong> System and Maintenance, </strong>
and then clicking <strong>Device Manager</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
b. In <strong>Device Manager</strong>, locate the device and then right-click the
<strong>device name </strong>and <strong>go to properties</strong>.<br />
c. Now under the general tab check the <strong>device status</strong>. Let us know the status of the device. Also you may inform any error code stated with the status.<br />
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>You will need to install the latest drivers for the card reader to work. I suggest that you go to the computer Manufactures’ website to download the latest drivers for the Card Reader. You can check out the below article that will give you information
 on how to update drivers:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</strong></a></div>
<div><strong>Step 3:</strong></div>
<div>I would suggest you to use the troubleshooters and check if it makes any difference:<br />
<strong>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</strong></a><br />

Hope this helps!</div>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>Did you try performing the steps that I mentioned in my earlier post and check in your device manager about the status of the device?</div>
<div>Apparently, the card reader device needs a proper driver in the computer at the moment. You will have to contact the manufacturer to know the website from where you dould download drivers for your card reader.</div>
<div>Hope this information helps.</div>

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to Mac shared drive</h2>
                    I just upgraded to Windows 8 from Windows 7 (I have a whole new computer) and now I can't connect to my Mac's shared drive. I can see the drive in Network, and I can put in my User Name and Password, but it keeps telling me that the User Name or Password
 is incorrect. I know it is correct. I've tried adding new user accounts on the mac, but that hasn't worked either. This works fine on my Windows 7 machine. I can't figure out why it won't work in 8.<br />

<p>Thanks for the explanation of how to connect to a Windows shared drive, but the question was how to connect to a MAC shared drive from Windows 8. &nbsp;You didn't answer the question. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to connect to a Mac Shared drive from a Windows 8 computer? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a Mac Server with several shared drives with 30 Macs connecting to the shares, and (1) of our (3) Windows computers can connect because they have Windows 7 which we had to perform a Regedit parameter change, but the (2) Windows 8 computers can't
 connect, no matter what I do. &nbsp;There is no documentation online or a Microsoft to perform a similar Regedit fix for Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>

<strong>1. </strong>Very often a memory issue. Remove ALL power then remove and reseat the memory.<br />
It may be necessary to swap the memory in and out in different combinations and<br />
patterns. See memory test methods below.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Check with AsusTek Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their foruma about any known issues. Update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers (see driver update methods
 below).<br />
<strong><br />

</span></a><strong>3.</strong> As needed use ALL the other methods in the troubleshooters below.<br />
<br />
<strong>4. </strong>If needed run Driver Verifier to see if it can indicate a Cause (see Driver Verifier methods below).<br />
<br />
=================</p>
<strong>BCCode: 1a&nbsp; 0x0000001a<br />
<br />
</strong>Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when
<br />
possible) -&nbsp;actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Make sure the vents <br />
are clear and that the&nbsp;fans are working. Even though the temp is OK do not <br />
assume heat can't affect the video,&nbsp;sound or other system functions it those <br />
get to hot. Try adding a small fan blowing into&nbsp;the vents as a test. (Those are <br />
mostly for a PC not a laptop.)<br />
<strong><br />
</strong>Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before
<br />
these started?&nbsp;(Check Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers <br />
were updated there about the&nbsp;time this started) Main likely culprits are Video <br />
driver, other major drivers, memory, and&nbsp;antivirus/antispyware/security products <br />
could be at fault as well as drive issues.<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.</p>
<p><br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

For the Windows&nbsp;Memory Diagnostic Tool.<br />
<br />
Type in Cortana's search box -&gt;&nbsp; Windows Memory Diagnostics&nbsp;<br />
at top&nbsp;of list&nbsp;- click it. <strong>in Windows 8/8.1/10 the&nbsp;name is "Windows Memory
<br />

</p><p>This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView -&nbsp;set
<br />
VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers - update&nbsp;those without Dump in their names (and<br />
&nbsp;BIOS and chipset).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 build 1703</h2>
                    <p>Tonight I have spent 4 hours with the gurus of MS to try and resolve the download issues with this new build of Windows 10. 1703</p>
<p>We have just found out it is not compatible with 4GB ram HP hard drive, after being compatible when I first purchased my license for Windows 10 using the compatibility test.</p>
<p>Their gurus proceeded to download for me the wrong format of the 1703 and the previous build if I it didn't work, so I could start from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, I paid for my licence for Windows 10. Please send me an ISO suitable for my hard drive you morons.!!!</p>

The next version of Windows 10 Creators Update version 1703 is another release users will need to prepare for before upgrading. The unfortunate reality is, even though you might be able to run a version of Windows 10, it does not guarantee you will be able to run the latest version or the version after that. If you have been making attempts to upgrade without success, you probably need to check the manufacturers website for your computer model to find out if its compatible with the Creators Update or Anniversary Update or not.">Check

You must completely reinstall Windows.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Reinstall Windows 7 Preinstalled On Computer<br />
<br />
OEM computer manufacturers are required to provide at least one way for you to reinstall Windows if you buy a computer with Windows preinstalled - your computer should have included either a restore partition on your hard drive, or Windows install/restore disks.
 ﻿Most computer manufacturers also have a feature to make your own install disks.<br />
<br />
If the restore partition is still there and was not removed, it will reinstall Windows 7. There is usually a prompt when you first start the computer telling you what key to press to start the restore﻿ - check your manual if you're not sure how to. If you have
 install disks - insert them, restart and boot from them to start the reinstall process. Reinstalling will remove any personal files on the computer, back them up first.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you don't have the restore partition or install disks:<br />
<br />
Contact the OEM computer manufacturer and ask them to send you an install disk for your computer - they may or may not do it. If they agree to send you one they may charge a small fee.

<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 1</strong></span></p>

off</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, under Choose your accent color, click on a tile to select and set it as the color for your taskbar, Start menu and action center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>B. Change the taskbar color to match desktop background.</p>

            The solution which u gave were useful in a way but i still have some issues for which i need a help to fix it. The font color in the task bar or in start menu some time appears dark or some times black in color. Through which the fonts written in tiles
 in start menu become really difficult to be read. Kindly help me with some sort of tips or recommend me some software needed to fix this problem.

<p>I think I have an idea on this problem and I am testing it out now. I noticed that if you just let netflix start the next show on its own, like when the show is over it says that the next episode will start in 10 seconds that next episode will not count
 because you did not start that episode yourself. I just got the Triple Play earlier so I am testing out my theory now and will see if I get the next achievement for 5 shows.</p>

<p>It took about 9 days of watching for the 7 days in a row achievement to unlock for me, then another 8 on top of that for the 14 days in a row, and now it's been about 20 days after the 14 day achievement, and the 30 day one still hasn't popped for me.</p>

<p>Apparently it started me over for no reason in the middle of last week. For those who don't know, I found out that you can compare games with a friend, then select Netflix, then select the tile that has number of consecutive episodes. That will pop up another
 menu with some stats including consecutive days watched.</p>

<p>I just chatted with a rep from support and was told to post in the forums because that is how this will be fixed. I do not see how it will be fixed through here, but I am doing as I was told. I am now on day 8, I know this by looking at my netflix history
 and My 7 day achievement says I am at 42% which is about 3 days. This never really mattered until achievement points actually earn something in the rewards program now., I know it seems frivolous for those few points but I think it should work the way it is
 supposed to work if the points actually add up to money essentially.</p>

<p>I just spoke to a rep on the phone about this and was told that the app resets if it is not launched within 24 hours of the last time it was launched and not when it was closed or the xbox was turned off. I am going to try out launching the app twice a day
 for a week to see if this works or not and post again if it does or does not just for a possible answer to this problem.

<p>Using the snapped achievements update &nbsp;to track the 7 day counter, the achievement didn't start to show any progress at all until Sunday when the % started to go up. it increased again on Monday and again yesterday, however today it has reset back to 0%.
 really frustrating as I've been using the app every day for the last 2 weeks.</p>

<p><strong><span><span>Hi lounascar3,<br />
A. </span></span></strong><span><span>what exactly are you trying to accomplish using batch files?<br />
</span></span><span><strong><span>B. What happens when you run this batch files?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to run the batch files one by one and see if that help, all the batch files may not run in windows XP.
</span></strong><span><span>The path you have created for batch files in Windows 98 would not work with Windows XP. So you might have to create a new batch for XP.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Artificial Girl 3 is developed by Illusion company from Japan, based on my experience playing this game. it will run without a lag mostly on NVIDIA cards. it can run on GT1030 / GTX 970 / GTX1050
<br />
</p>
<p>For Radeon or AMD Cards : R7 250X or higher</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>if you are using one of this cards and still you are lagging. you have to download and replace the DirectX on the Artificial Girl 3 Folder with a DX9 since Windows 10 uses DX11 and DX9 games will provide lower frames. for more info you have to look on a
 site that will give you instructions on how to replace the DirectX DLL file on the game.<br />

<h2>            Play offline.</h2>
                    Is it true if I open my console and it's offline but want to launch the game but two of my games I own and it's delisted, does it uninstall itself from internal HDD? Can a disc of the digital game I have but bought from GameStop keep me lucky if I play
 offline and my digital game doesn't appear on my Home Screen? I'm in offline mode as a test just in case.

<p>Hi there&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox doesn't automatically uninstall a game or app unless a update is canceled. Further more digital games can be played offline if the account is set as the active home Xbox.</p>

            <p>Hi Walter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The magnifier might or might not open depending on the type of game that you play. However, I suggest you to try opening the magnifier using the command prompt and check if it opens.</p>
<p>1. After loading the game in full screen, press Windows key + R.</p>
<p>2. Type magnify.exe and press enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result. </p>
        </p>

            <p>Sounds like a corrupt download, I recommend you redownload Windows 8.</p>
<p>Which browser are you using?<br />
<br />
Try to rename or delete the <b>WebSetup </b>folder and try again.<br />
<br />
C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\<b>WebSetup</b><br />
<br />
Please let us know if you're able to continue after trying the above</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>Redownload or resume</p>
</span>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>When you purchase Windows 8 an email with the download link and purchase details will be sent to your email address that you use to purchase/register your product, you can just access that email and use the download link in it to re-download it on your computer.</p>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<p>Below are the links that will help you download Windows 8.</p>
<p>Note: Please refer to <b>option 4</b> in first link below and to download the correct version from second link and use the product key of windows 8.</p>
