<h2>            Why every few minutes i see the wifi icon go from white to black, its like its losing connection but it never actually looses the connection.</h2>
                    Can someone please explain to me why every few minutes i see the wifi icon go from white to black, its like its losing connection but it never actually looses the connection. Yes all my drivers are up to date. I also notice that sometimes if i removed
 my home wifi connection and reconnect it, it takes awhile to actually get it connected, it was just say that it cant connect to this network. I will have to try and connect multiple times before it will actually connect. Thanks!!

<h2>            Windows 10 is ignoring Group Policy and Patching the computer on its own</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 is ignoring Group Policy and patching our computers on its own. &nbsp;We have a centralized and controlled patch management solution that allows us to tell each PC what patches to install and when. &nbsp;(Solarwinds)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 seems to ignore the settings we apply in Group Policy. &nbsp;It patches the computers and reboots automatically causing serious frustration from the end user as well as IT Administration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This completely undermines our Patch Management solution and policy as we have no control over what patches are being applied. And obviously causing inconvenience to the end user as it randomly reboots their computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we stop this behavior in Windows 10 and make it act like all our other machines (Win 7 Pro 64bit)</p>
<p>This is the reason all corporate environments are so resistant to migrate to Windows 10. &nbsp;Dear Microsoft: You can't disable IT Controls for an OS in a corporate controlled environment. &nbsp;</p>

 make this more clear, I have not taken my clipboard off the laptop and still this power difference isn't correcting itself. I'm confused, hope I can receive help.&nbsp; &nbsp;

<h3> blindberg-1968  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t get Homegroup to work in Windows 7.</h2>
                    After recovering from my system being hacked and cleaning my system my Home Group does not work any more. I have left Home Group on both PCs that I am trying to link to and then recreated a new Home Group on my main PC and when I went to try and join on
 the other one it only gives me the option to Create New Group. Once PC lists Home Network as Network 3 and the other lists it as Network 2. The are both connected to the same WiFi network.
<div><br />
<div>I have even tried the Fix It tool for Home Group and that failed to install and gave me an error that it was expired. I am currently running Microsoft Security Essentials and the stock Windows Firewall. The main PC is connected via ethernet to my Netgear
 N600 wireless router and the other is connected via WiFi. I am also running into challenges with both PCs seeing my stereo receiver that is also connected to the network via WiFi for audio streaming. I am trying to be able to stream via DLNA feature. BTW I
 have spent upwards of 12 hours + working to try to solve this issue and I have gotten no where.</div>

                    I was trying to change my password for SSH in Cygwin, and was unable because of the above message<br />
<br />
I THEN tried to change my windows user password, and keep getting the above message.<br />
<br />
My local group policy editor settings are:<br />
<br />
Enforce Password history&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 passwords remenbered<br />
Maximum password age&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0<br />
Minimum password age&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0 days<br />
Minimum password length&nbsp; 3 characters<br />
Password must meet complexity requirements&nbsp;&nbsp; Disabled<br />
Store password using reversible encryption&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disabled<br />
<br />
My laptop is a HP ProBook 4520s running Windows 7 Professional<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated..<br />

Set <strong><span>Minimum password length</span></strong> to at least a value of 8. If the number of characters is set to 0, no password is required. In most environments, an eight-character password is recommended
 because it is long enough to provide adequate security and still short enough for users to easily remember. This value will help provide adequate defense against a brute force attack</font></span></p>

            I changed my minimum password length to 8 per your suggestion - and I get the same results...<br />
<br />
Cygwin uses the Windows password utility.&nbsp; If I can change my password in windows, I should be able to create an ssh password in Cygwin.<br />

            <p>Hi Harry,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.<br />
We appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>Have you installed latest updated drivers?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Blue Screen error usually occurs when a serious problem causes the computer to shut down or restart unexpectedly. This type of errors usually happens when there are some driver issues on the computer. However, it might also
 be due to some other software/hardware reasons.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In this case, the <strong><span>System Thread Exception Not Handled</span></strong> error seems to be due to the incompatible or old graphics card drivers on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to fix this issue, the computer must be restarted in safe mode. Once after booting the computer in Safe Mode, you have to uninstall the incompatible graphics card driver from the Device Manager and then download and install the latest drivers
 from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Boot the computer in Safe Mode </strong></p>
<p>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers necessary to run Windows. The words
<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Use the power button on the sign-in screen to <strong>
Shift + Restart</strong>. This will take you to the recovery boot menu. </p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Click <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>,
<strong>Advanced options</strong>, <strong>Startup settings</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You then see a list where you can choose&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong><span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Safe Mode with Networking</span></strong><span>&nbsp;(depending on whether you think you’ll need the Internet).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To know more about <strong>Safe mode, </strong>following is an article on
</span><strong>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode):</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Update drivers.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1: Press <strong>Windows key + X key</strong> and click on <strong>
Device manager</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Search for <strong>Display Adapters</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 3: Right-click on the <strong>graphics</strong> <strong>card</strong> and click on
<strong>Update driver</strong> software.</span></p>
<p><span>You may also download and install the latest graphic drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Following is a <strong>Wiki Article</strong> on <strong>Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d</strong></span></p>

            <p>It's a real shame to see that Microsoft's team of support people aren't even really reading our problems before copying and pasting generic responses. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. &nbsp;The make and model of the PC is the first thing the user noted. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
2. &nbsp;All the support tips that were given are based on the assumption that the user can boot to a usable point, but the whole point of his post for support is that he can't get to that point. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;Not reading the original posts doesn't just waste the end users' time; it waste the support teams' time as well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everyone tries to do a good job. &nbsp;I know the Microsoft team does too. But sometimes these obvious things do need to be pointed out. &nbsp;Good luck. &nbsp;</p>

            Buenas a todos, a relacion con ese problema que tienes con el dell, el problema es que la controladora ahci la tienes desactivada. En la bios los DELL vienen por defecto en la bios RAID ON ( dejalo asi ). Vete a modo seguro y en el registro activa el ahci
 a valor 0 (storahci=0) ; luego vuelve a modo normal y se te habra resuelto el problema.

            <p>I am having exactly the same problem, also with the ntfs.sys driver.</p>
<p>It occurs on the original computer when I boot.</p>
<p>So I removed the hard drive from that computer and with a USB caddy, plugged it into another computer. After about 4 seconds, exactly the same error came up. Plugged the USB caddy into yet a THIRD computer. Again as soon as the HDD was plugged in and initialised
 that computer also immediately crashed with:&nbsp;system_thread_exception_not_handled (ntfs.sys).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So ... here we have a problem with the ntfs.sys driver that with a certain type of error in the ntfs file system of an attached drive, it will just crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, attached the drive to a Win 7 computer, no crash. Could then run chkdsk &lt;driveletter:&gt; /f to fix the NTFS errors. Connected back to Win 10 computer, not crashing Win 10 anymore, problem fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: it would seem to me that there has been a regression in NTFS.SYS from Win 7 to Win 10 in that it now cannot gracefully handle situations it previously could.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Paulo,  </span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span> </span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community, we appreciate your interest in Windows 10. </span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span> </span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I understand the inconvenience that you are facing on Windows 10, we will help you with this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>In order to assist you better, I would like to know the following queries:</span></p>
<p><span>Were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to try the methods below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1:
</strong></span></p>
<p><span>This file could be related to touchpad drivers.
</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to visit the computer manufacturer website and install the touchpad drivers and all the latest available drivers and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>If issue persist, I suggest you to try method 2.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:
</strong>Check if issue persist in<strong> Clean Boot.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A <strong>
clean boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows
 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please refer the steps given in the link below to perform a
<strong>Clean Boot</strong>:</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the
 Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></p>

                    <p>Since my computer updated in December with (KB4053580) Cumulative update for windows. Every time I try to send an email, my outlook closes down.</p>
<p>I have an error message from my Sophos anti-virus saying IAF exploit.</p>
<p>If I remove the update, then my outlook is sending emails okay.</p>

            Block that update, which I believe is a servicing stack update for Windows 10. These cumulative updates have been exceptionally buggy.
<br />
<br />I recommend you block it using the Show Hide Update Tool until further notice.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.

            Depends on the options you choose, but in most cases, yes, it will. 
<br />
<br />If you use Reset, you have the option of keeping your files:

<br />
<br />You can also perform a custom install, which will archive your files to a folder called Windows.old:

            Hi Will,
<br />
<br />You have the option of keeping files. However, it is best to do a backup just in case.

<br />See the Clean Install help links in my previous replies.

            Data on C:/ would be lost while doing a clean Install and formatting Windows.
<br />If you do not format the drive, the Files would be moved to Windows.old folder.
<br />Applications in both the cases would be lost.

<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Prevent Windows 10</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>January 29, 2016</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Microsoft has turned a decades-long respected process — Windows Update —&nbsp;into a malware distribution system.&nbsp; It is for all intents and purposes forcing innocent and content&nbsp;Windows 7 computer users into “upgrading” to its new Windows 10 version.&nbsp; It promises
 to allow return to Windows 7 within 30 days.&nbsp; That return process is flawed and leaves your computer virtually unusable and requires re-installation of Windows 7.&nbsp; For some owners without a re-usable Microsoft product key or a factory restore partition on
 their computers, it results in a useless thing that used to be a computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is a completely new and very different Windows.&nbsp; Nothing like anything you have used before.</p>

<li>It is primarily an advertising/sales vehicle.&nbsp; That’s the keen motivation and reason it is free.</li><li>By adopting Windows 10, you sacrifice any privacy — essentially, anything on your computer is Microsoft’s and its partner’s to use as they see fit.</li><li>Windows Update becomes non-optional.&nbsp; You, as owner of your system no longer have control over what happens to your computer.&nbsp; Microsoft will re-make Windows (on your computer) into what serves its purposes without asking your permission or opinion.</li><li>Windows 10 as a system is still full of un-fulfilled promises and bugs.&nbsp; Many of your programs will not run on Windows 10.&nbsp; In fact, the “upgrade” process removes some.</li></ol>
<p>So, if you like Windows 7, and most do very much so, I advise you to reject Windows 10 for the foreseeable future.&nbsp; Be advised that Microsoft has committed to support Windows 7 until at least January, 2020.&nbsp; Most of your current computers will last that
 long.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>You must adopt a protective stance to prevent your Windows 7 system from becoming something you do not want.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;advise my clients to&nbsp;change the Windows Update Setting to <em><strong>Never check for updates</strong></em>.&nbsp; Once a month,&nbsp;on&nbsp;the 2nd Tuesday, they will get an email from me advising to manually start WU and then hide every update except for ones specifically
 labeled Security.&nbsp; In other words, only security updates will be applied.&nbsp; In all of 2015, not a single update that was not security, was something that improved Windows 7.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Some may scoff at this idea.&nbsp; Well they are incorrect.&nbsp; Never means you are never giving Microsoft a chance to decide what you download and install.&nbsp; It does NOT mean you will never update.&nbsp; The difference is that now you take control and the responsibility
 of updating of Windows and Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some may believe that Microsoft would not do such a stupid thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You must read Woody Leonhard (one of the most respected writers in the trade)&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2983777/microsoft-windows/how-to-clean-the-windows-10-crapware-off-your-windows-7-or-81-pc.html?nsdr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 have Windows 7, keep it, you are better off by far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see the Windows flag on the bottom right of your screen, chances are pretty high, your computer already has the Win10 files.&nbsp;Even if you do not, it may be on your computer&nbsp;shortly anyway. &nbsp;Here are instructions on how to rid yourself of it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First download and run GWX Control panel.&nbsp; A free app:&nbsp; <a href="http://ultimateoutsider.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2979572/microsoft-windows/gwx-stopper-an-easy-way-to-permanently-delete-get-windows-10-nagware-in-windows-7-and-81.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.infoworld.com/article/2979572/microsoft-windows/gwx-stopper-an-easy-way-to-permanently-delete-get-windows-10-nagware-in-windows-7-and-81.html</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It will allow you to prevent any future operating system upgrades and&nbsp;delete downloaded Win10 files, but it will
<em><strong>not</strong> </em>remove any of Microsoft’s installed or attempts to install spyware.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>This process works, but it only works if you do all the steps and do them in order.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Take Windows Update off automatic — <strong><em>Never</em></strong> <em><strong>check for updates</strong></em></li><li>Windows Update, Installed updates, WAIT a long time till you see the green bar complete its long trip to the right</li><li>Now, search for each of the listed updates, uninstall them.&nbsp; You must wait until the list is re-created each time.</li><li>If there are others you want to uninstall, click Later</li><li>Then, clear the search box and after the list is again displayed, enter another KB number.</li><li>Restart the PC.&nbsp; It may take a long time to process this.</li></ol>
<p>If you choose “check for updates, but let me choose whether to download and install them”, Microsoft will download “important” updates like KB3035583 to your computer.&nbsp; It will be pre-checked — selected.&nbsp; Unless you check Windows Update (WU)&nbsp;and discover
 this BEFORE you shut down, it will install it during the shut-down process.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hiding accomplishes nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is more than annoying.&nbsp; It goes way beyond that.&nbsp; It is underhanded, dishonest and just plain wrong for Microsoft to do this.&nbsp; There is no offer to accept or refuse.&nbsp; There is no informed consent.&nbsp; There is not even an idea of what it is&nbsp;your getting
 and what the result is if you change your mind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>List of updates that if already installed should be removed:</p>

</p><p>This month when I try the group I am told "It can't Be sent now try again later", I have sent the letter out for one group of thirty, listing the individual address' four times, they all went (I think).</p>

    <title>Cannot send friend requests - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> idunkbiscuits  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot send friend requests</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Hopefully this is in the right thread! Basically, I created a second Xbox live account on my Xbox for my son to use. This was challenging enough due to the .com/.co.uk e-mail domain issues with the two account as has already been
 discussed elsewhere on the forums. However, now he finally has his account with his 3 month gold subscription he cannot add friends. Everytime he tries to send a friend request it simply pops up with an Xbox error saying it "Can't complete this process. Please
 try again. Fro more info, visit <a href="http://www.xbox.com/supprt.&quot;" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.xbox.com/support."</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is pointless as I cannot find the answer anywhere and even after scrolling though the forums I can find the same question has been asked but with no answer!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked all the privacy settings and content settings and I'm certain they are set correctly to allow him to send &amp; receive friend requests but still no luck.</p>
<p>Not sure if it is related but he also can't play Minecraft now either. It keeps popping up with a message saying that another local profile has restriction settings???</p>
<p>Help please, can someone give me pointers in the right direction as to what 'm doing wrong.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>VS</p>

<p>Click on Disk Management</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may find the drive shown there but in a state which Windows does not recognize.&nbsp; That means it has lost its header identity and needs to be re-initialized and formatted.</p>

    <title>Win 7 Icons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sgatipon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7 Icons</h2>
                    Simple question - <br />
How do I assign a .png or .ico file to be recognized as the icon for a certain program or file.<br />
It seems that the icons are now embedded in .dll files in Windows 7.<br />
How can I use some of my "old and familiar" icons?<br />
Thanks!

            Typically, Windows will display the icon for the program used to open the file.&nbsp; For example, if you set Adobe PhotoShop to open all image files, all your PNG files will have an Adobe icon.<br />
<br />
• The easiest way to change the icon is to change the program used to open the file.&nbsp; Click Start and choose
<em>Default Programs</em> and change your default there.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, there is a more advanced way to control the icon on a deeper level.&nbsp; If you want the icon for all PNG files to be a specific icon, you can set that this way:<br />
<br />
1 - Click Start, type<em>&nbsp;Folder</em> and then click Folder Options.<br />
2 - On the File Types tab, find the type of file for which you want to change the icon, then click Advanced.<br />
3 - Choose <em>Change Icon</em>.<br />

    <title>Webcam image upside down since reinstalling drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> landik  say:</h3>
<h2>            Webcam image upside down since reinstalling drivers</h2>
                    Original Title:Asus K50IJ Notebook<br />
OS win 7 x64. <br />
By mistake I uninstalled the built in camera driver and win did the perfect job by automatically installing the microsoft driver for the web cam but its just not the right driver since the view is upside down. I uninstall the driver from device manager and
 by the time i scan for hardware changes so the cam will show with no driver, the os will automatically install the driver though i did what you described and disconnected the internet connection too. It wont let me update the driver since os considers its
 driver as it doesnt need to be updated. I tryed to delete the driver that the os is using so once disconnected from the web the os wouldnt find the drivers to install so i would take over. I couldnt delete the drivers from sys32 since i need permit from trustedinstaller
 and i cant change the permit settings on the properties/security etc. Thank you in advance, any ideas will be very helpful

            1. I turn off automatic updates so the windows wont download the driver from microsoft. But the windows has saved the driver in its drivers folder. I try to delete the driver from there but it will say access denied.
<br />
2. I uninstall the driver from device manager and the camera disappears. As soon as i click on "Scan for hardware changes" the camera will appear and windows will automatically install the driver.
<br />
3. I have the driver downloaded on my computer, whenever i try to update the driver from the windows driver to the asus, the message will be that the driver doesnt need to be updated.
<br />
4. I have also turned off the automatic drivers update from windows but windows will still install the driver as soon as i uninstall it.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your concern but sincerely i have tried all these steps and logically the simplest way would be for me to:
<br />
<br />
Turn off the internet<br />
Delete the driver (system32/drivers...) that windows is using to install for my cam. Once i uninstall it from device manager. Then windows wont find the driver in its folder and theres no access to the internet so i can install the asus driver. i just cant
 delete the driver from the windows folder cause access is denied etc. <br />

<h2>            The user name or password is incorrect</h2>
                    
<p>When I first got my brand new Laptop with Win7, I thought I would automate the logon proceedure. I think I used Task Scheduler, which looked completely different to windows XP (What I was used to)</p>
<p>I managed to get this thing to run every time the computer starts, but Ive made a silly mistake. I just put a login name ... and a password.. and forgot that windows uses "Workgroup" as a default domain (Or something like that.. such as Alphacomputer/martin
 as the login part)</p>
<p>Because of my little error it now gives me that annoying error (The name or pwd is wrong) every time I boot the computer: So I have to type my password manually, each time, which is exactly what I wanted to avoid.</p>
<p>My big problem is I cannot find the little schedule that I put in originally.</p>
<p>PLEASE can someone explain how I can search for the Scheduled task. It is so differrent from XP, and there are 225 Active tasks once the computer is logged in as me..</p>
<p>(I tried a quick fix dowloading tweak for win7-which has an auto logon feature-&nbsp;and it fixed the problem, but unfortunately this version of tweak is not free and expires, leaving the original problem)- Bummer</p>
<p>Thanx In Advance</p>
<p>PS. It is just a laptop on its own in my flat (No Network)</p>

<p>Instructing you to go through x GUI screens without exactly knowing where you gets a little tedious, so let's nail this one down with a number of console commands.</p>
<p>1. Click Start.<br />
2. Type the three letters cmd into the Search box.<br />
3. Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter<br />
4. Click "Run as Administrator" (<strong>this is important!</strong> )<br />
5. Type the following command and press Enter:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; schtasks /query /fo list &gt; "%UserProfile%\Desktop\Tasks.txt"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Leave the console screen open - you will need it again)<br />
6. Double-click the file Tasks.txt on your desktop<br />
7. Locate the problem task and make a note of its name. Let's assume it is \MyTask.<br />
8. Return to the Console screen.<br />
9. Type this command and press Enter:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; schtasks /Delete /TN "MyTask"</p>
<p>When creating a scheduled task next time then it would be a good idea to keep records of its details so that you can manage it easily.</p>

<h2>            Folder names missing after dot &#40;&#34;extension&#34; of the folder name&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Another surprise from this peace of **** named "Windows 8.1".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Couple of days ago, all folder names like "Folder.one" start appearing just like "Folder" - without dot and "extension". Only in windows explorer window. In CMD, in application dialogs - even in address bar of win explorer, if to put cursor there
 - everywhere folders has that "extension".</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I found an old question and solution of exactly the same problem, dated 2010, but FixId doesn't work for me as it is for Windows 7. Has somebody ideas/experience how to win again&nbsp;this time-eating-**** (Windows 8.1 I mean)?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: wasted 1 hours of my life, I'm extracted from one of the solutions in 2010:</p>
<p>
</p><p>explorer.exe /n,::{20D04FE0-3AEA-1069-A2D8-08002B30309D}</p>
<p>
</p><p>if to run this line from command prompt, explorer shows the name normally. But this is NOT THE SOLUTION!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS: great! The windows forum knows the real names for Win 8.1 so all real words were replaced by ****. But they was c_r_a_p and ****!</p>

<div>To properly analyse and solve problems with Activation and Validation, we need to see a full copy of the report produced by the MGADiag tool (download and save to desktop -<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012</a>
 )<br />
Once saved, run the tool. <br />
Click on the Continue button, which will produce the report.<br />
To copy the report to your response, click on the Copy button in the tool (ignore any error messages at this point), and then paste (using either r-click/Paste, or Ctrl+V ) into your response.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
OEM 'codes' can mean many things - there are OEM SLP Product Keys, OEM COA Product Keys, and OEM PID's, just for starters.</div>
<div>an OEM SLP Key is the Product Key used by a major manufacturer for the install on Windows on multiple Keys - they use one Key for all installs of that model of machine, and it's activated by the BIOS, which has specific 'bits' which validate the install.</div>
<div>an OEM COA Key is the Product Key on the COA Sticker on any machine which has been installed using OEM software - it is specific for use in that one machine, and cannot be used on any other.</div>
<div>an OEM Product ID (PID) is generated whenever a machine using either type of OEM Key - it is identified by the -OEM- characters in the second group of characters in the PID. This code is specific to an install, because it uses details from the machine,
 as well as the Key used, in its formation.</div>
