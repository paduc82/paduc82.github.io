    <title>Problem setting up Windows 10 fax and scan with new fax modem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lakeshoremill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem setting up Windows 10 fax and scan with new fax modem</h2>
                    <p>I have a new USRobotics 56K fax modem High Performance V.92 which I have attached to my computer with the USB connector and it says it is working properly. &nbsp;When I try to send a fax, it says there is no modem. &nbsp;Looking at other posts, I learned I need to
 start the Windows Fax and Scan program. &nbsp;Following instructions for Win 7 I went to Control Panel/Admin Tools/Component Services/Services (local)/Fax. &nbsp;It is set to Manual but when I press Start, I receive the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The Fax service on Local Computer started and then stopped. &nbsp;Some services stop automatically if they are not in use by other services or programs."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what this means or how to get the fax programme to recognize the modem and send/receive faxes. &nbsp;Help would be appreciated.</p>
<p />

            <p>Thank you for your reply to my request. &nbsp;I followed your instructions but then the program said there was no fax modem installed. &nbsp;Upon trying a number of things, I ended up with messages that indicated the device installation was migrated, installation
 not complete, installation status was 0x0. &nbsp;I tried opening the WFS account unsuccessfully and the computer twice shut itself down with a WDF_Violation and afterwards it began requiring me to log on as Administrator when I attempted to send the fax. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I give up - it is too much bother for a program I would use so rarely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thank you for your time and effort on my behalf.</p>

<p>Hi Christina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A device such as a headset needs specific drivers to work on Windows 7. We should also consider the compatibility of the device itself to the platform. Since the device drivers doesn't download in Windows 7 Ultimate, it could be possible that there might
 be a compatibility issue that would be best checked with them so if in case, other troubleshooting or options can be provided to you. We suggest that you contact its manufacturer if they can provide you with the drivers for Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back should you need further assistance.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Driver Error - Seagate Expansion Portable SRD00F1</h2>
                    <p>Really hoping you guys could give me a bit of help:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Seagate Expansion Portable Drive, 1TB SRD00F1. It was working perfectly on Windows 7, and then I made the upgrade to Windows 10 (now currently on build 1511) and then it just won't detect the drive. It makes the connection sound, but then the drive
 never shows up on the list of available drives on This PC. On the Connected Devices menu, it says "Driver Error", and it's classified as "Unspecified" among the Devices and Printers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked into the Device Manager and there's an exclamation point alert on USB Attached SCSI (UAS) Mass Storage Device. I've tried updating the driver (if I let it look on its own, it says the driver is up to date. If I search my PC and try to apply it,
 it says error Code 10: Device cannot start, and the exclamation point doesn't go away). I've tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it, with the same results. I've tried directly connecting it to port at the rear of my computer, but the problem remains. I've
 even tried connecting it to a USB hub with its own power source, but it still won't get detected. I've tried to use Troubleshooting for Hardware and Devices as instructed in the other threads, but it only tries the same thing I have (reinstall, restart), and
 the problems are&nbsp;<em>still</em> there. It just won't let me access or even see the drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried connecting the drive itself on a Mac and on a PC that isn't Windows 10 and it works fine. So it's really a driver error in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried virtually everything, decided to turn here for help because I really need the files in there; I've been using it as a backup drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anybody got any ideas on how to fix this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>Usually, "<strong>This device cannot start: Code 10" </strong>error is generated when Device Manager can't start the hardware device, a situation usually caused by outdated or corrupted drivers. This usually fixed by replacing the existing driver with the
 updated and latest driver. </p>

            <p>Hey there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried everything suggested. I've even tried things suggested in other similar threads. I've tried updating the drivers to the point that Windows now just keeps telling me everything is up to date. Still no change. I even downloaded the Seagate Media app
 for Windows and still that would not recognize my device. It keeps saying Driver Error no matter what I do. It just can't see my device. I've been regularly updating Windows 10 in the hopes that a fix will appear, to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I did notice: My laptop, which has Windows 10 as well, can recognize the device. But my desktop on Windows 10 cannot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Still hoping to get a working solution, really hope you guys can help.</p>

<p>Provided you finished the plotline with Conrad in the first Mass Effect, which meant speaking to him three different times, you'll encounter him again when you get to the planet Illium. If you didn't finish the original Mass Effect plot with him, he will
 likely not appear.</p>

<p>Yes. You can speak with him up to three times in the shops of the Upper Wards of the Citadel. However, you have to leave the Citadel and return to that area in order to get the second and then third chances to speak with him. If you only spoke with him once,
 then the side-quest was never finished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first time he wants an autograph. The second time he wants a photograph. The third time he has a proposal for you.</p>

<p>If I understand correctly, the sure way to get Conrad to turn up in ME3 is to ensure Shepard puts a gun to his head. So that probably involves picking the renegae option when you speak to him the 3rd time you pick. I am sure someone can correct me if I am
 wrong.</p>

<p>Conrad will also show up if you pick the Charm/Paragon option on the third conversation. The transfer file reads the interaction as renegade regardless of whether you pick Charm/Paragon or Intimidate/Renegade. What's important is that you get to the third
 conversation and use one of them.</p>

<p>I think what Kimieva says is accurate. In the third conversation I believe that you have to use one of the coloured Paragon or Renegade lines to activate Conrad in ME2.</p>

<h2>            Wifi Speed In Task Manager of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>We all know the 'Send' and 'Receive' network speeds in Task Manager are shown in
<strong>Bits/second</strong> like Kb/s or Mb/s.Is there a way I can make it display the same in
<strong>Bytes/second</strong> instead (in KB/s and MB/s)?</p>
<p>That would really be convenient,since we regulary deal with file downloads of size Bytes and not Bits.Thanks in Advance!</p>

            You can use Resource monitor to get speed in Bytes/Second. Or simply a 3rd party Software that offers a widget.
<br />For specific Task manager, you should log a suggestion in Feedback hub.

<h2>            Windows 10 reinstall after expiration of free upgrade</h2>
                    I had the windows 10 free upgrade installed this past winter.&nbsp; I had to revert back to Windows 7 Pro because Autodesk Inventor would not run on windows 10.&nbsp; I just found a patch and was able to get inventor to run on another windows 10 machine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since
 I had already installed windows 10 shouldn't I be able to reinstall it?&nbsp; In other words I did take advantage of the free upgrade before it expired last night.&nbsp; However, when I try to install it now I am told that the free offer has expired.

            <p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license
 you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key. </p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>

            <p>You have to keep track of all the photos, videos and music files that you are using in your project so that you can copy them. If I were to do this, I'd probably copy all my source media files to a single folder so I know what is in my Movie Maker project.
 I'd also create the project file in that folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when it comes time to copying, I just take everything in the folder, and copy it to an identical folder on the other computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But again, is this actually something you need to do regularly? Can you explain more about why you need to do this?</p>

<h2>            The Group Policy Client Service failed the logon, Access is denied.</h2>
                    I have tried restarting in safe mode but it does not allow a logon there. There is no secondary logon to use. The only restore point record was from the prior evening which did not corrct the problem. Where can I go from here?

            Hi Conrac,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers!<br />
<br />
Did you perform the system restore from the Windows Recovery Environment?<br />
If not, I would suggest you to perform a system restore from the Windows Recovery Environment.<br />
<br />
To do this, you need to have the Windows Vista Operating System DVD.<br />
<br />
Also, to use System Restore option, there must be a System Restore point at which the logon was successful.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insert the Windows Vista or Windows 7 DVD, and then restart the computer.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you receive the following message, press any key:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD.<br />
</strong><br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set the following preferences, and then click Next:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Language to install<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time and currency format<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keyboard or input method<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Repair your computer, select the operating system that you want to repair, and then click Next.<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click System Restore, and then click Next.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the restore point that you want to use, and then click Next.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> : Click a restore point that will return the computer to a state where the logon is successful. After you use the System Restore feature, reinstall any programs or updates that may be removed. You will not lose any personal documents.
 However, you may have to reinstall programs. You may also have to reset some personal settings.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confirm the disks that you want to restore, and then click Next.<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Finish, and then click Yes when you are prompted.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the System Restore process is complete, click Restart to restart the computer.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the computer restarts, click Close to confirm that the System Restore process has finished successfully.<br />
<br />
11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use an appropriate method to log on. For example, log on by using an older password, or log on by using another computer account.<br />
<br />
Check out this link which talks about How to use System Restore to log on to Windows 7 or Windows Vista when you lose access to an account<br />
<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/940765/en-us <br />
<br />
I would also suggest you to perform a <strong>startup repair</strong> from the Windows Recovery Environment.<br />
<br />
Hope this information is helpful.<br />

<p>Hi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The model is the B540. This problem occured 4 weeks back after a Windows 10 update (not the 1809). I was at home in Ukraine visiting relatives. When I returned to UK and started the computer Windows started downloading all the updates that I missed. After
 this I had this problem. The Seagate and Toshiba external drives work on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try your suggestions and write back to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. No blue screen, just the message. Seems to do it when in sleep mode. Still shutting down. Last Action Center message said that the WiFi adaptor stopped six times causing my computer to shut down.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps a compatibility issue? Another WiFi driver? Don't know why Windows is saying it is OK yet still identifies the driver as the issue.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">I would suggest you to provide us complete information about the Event Viewer error logs and status, so

Event logs are special files that record significant events on your computer, such as when a user logs on to the computer or when a program encounters an error. Whenever these types of events occur,
<span><font>Windows</font></span> records the event in an event log that you can read by using Event Viewer.</font></span></p>

            <p>Appreciate your assistance. I followed the steps but could not get the programs to list the driver as a program. I found the Radlink Program file but it&nbsp;did not list the driver. I have done all the driver updates (none available) and Windows states that
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not know where the event log is located. The search tab does not list "Event Viewer" as an app. I appreciate how Microsoft is using "Apps" to attract the demographic that uses smart phones but for an old fart like me, it is just one great big pain in
 the rear. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My searches on the issues does not reveal a lot of results. Apparently, this laptop is the most popular laptop (highest sales) from Future Shop so I was a bit flabbergasted when I could not find similar problems on the net. I also went to HP support, and
 it was all just checking the status and update of the driver. I found for these issues, the net has been most helpful in the past, in particular the good people at Microsoft. I do not like to bring my computer back, as I did not "purchase" the extended warranty,
 where you can have it serviced by the company who sold it to you, otherwise you have to send it back to the manufacturer. Why should I have to buy extended warranties, are you telling me that the product is going to breakdown or something?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you from Microsoft? How do I get my event log and send to you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

    <title>Gamertag Changed &#40;NO option to file case&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Gamertag Changed &#40;NO option to file case&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I've had the gamer tag "Zoa" for a confirmed time since July 2018. Upon Xbox Support enforcement team changed the gamer tag without my authorization. They changed it because of a violation to the code of conduct but I have never done anything to violate
 my code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I know I would have to contact Xbox enforcement regarding this. However (THIS IS THE KEY PART NEXT) there is no OPTION to contact Xbox Enforcement on the account of the gamer tag change. Please help as i really care about tag and in no way was it offensive.
 I contacted support and in no way can I get in contact with enforcement without submitting a case. I do not have an option to submit a case.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Isn't this against Xbox policy to not have a case as a option and also not notify me why my gamer tag has been changed or how it violated the code of conduct? That is a violation of security to me and I am truly upset and disappointing. My new&nbsp; gamer
 tag is now QuietPup5443787. I check my gamertag on a new xbox account to see if it was available to change and it is not. Please help.</p>

<p>Hi Kirneill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us! For more information about what each type of enforcement means, visit
<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/Home/HowTo#sub-topic0-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Xbox Live Suspensions</span></a> and

<p>
The Gamertag that received the forced change will remain unobtainable. A forced Gamertag change may be issued if a Gamertag visually resembles, sound likes, represents, hints at, abbreviates, or otherwise insinuates any of the following:
</p><ul>
<li>Profane words or phrases</li><li>Topics or content of a sexual nature</li><li>Hate speech</li><li>Controversial religious topics</li><li>Notorious people or organizations</li><li>Sensitive current or historical events</li></ul>
<p>When XBLPET issues an enforcement action, an <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/Home/HowTo#sub-topic0-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
email message is automatically sent</a> to the address associated with your Xbox Live account. If you are using a child account, an email is also sent to the Microsoft Account associated with your parent or guardian. Each email message explains that the account
 was subject to enforcement action and links to pages that provide additional information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps</p>

<p>Hi Jasmine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I reviewed those rules before I posted this question as I spoke to a representative and he could also not confirm that any was broken. According to the code of conduct I am also suppose to receive a case because XBLPET is changing information without authorization
 of myself. I have reviewed both email as you recommended and I see no information from XBLPET regarding the forced gamer tag change. I am sure I have not broken any rules regarding code of conduct as I only used Zoa for GameBattles and UMG matches. I only
 have 1 report in regards to my status on my account. The Previous Xbox support representative can confirm Zoa was mine since July about.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also for reference I have the conversation with Xbox representative here:</p>
<p><strong><span>1444404551</span></strong><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Please help as I find this completely Unfair and I have done nothing to get banned. I would just like my Gamertag turned back to Zoa as XBLPET did put the gamertag in a phase where it cannot be
 obtained so it is possible to retrieve it back. Please assist as I have no contact with XBLPET as the only way to contact them is via: Case. I feel that my Gamertag was improperly changed</span></span></p>

<p>Hi, the only thing I could find is a now classed right wing organisation called Zionists of America using the acronym ZOA. It could well be this loose connection that got your gamertag changed and why it is no longer available. Whilst it may seem an innocent
 gamertag, you also have to think on a global scale and it could have some slang or offensive meaning, in another language.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is an unfortunate thing to happen but if it has been deemed unsuitable, there is nothing else you can do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your new tag that you have created is close to a slang term in the UK for a certain outburst of profanity. It is a fine line we all walk, when trying to create a unique gamertag.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately if your gamertag violates the ToS, MS can change it without notice.&nbsp; Honestly in your case this sounds like it was done in error, so I would reach out to them as I am sure they can correct the mistake 😀</p>

<p>I researched for ours regarding that but if that is the reason why which we don't know as of yet I feel like that would be stretching the meaning. By referring to "Slang", This is automatically exempt from Global Scale meaning. Also, If it was offensive
 I would've had multiple reports regarding the gamertag. I understand that Microsoft is trying to keep the community in that fine line but that would be completely taking it out of proportion. Zoa is also referred to for marine animal classification and that
 is the true global meaning. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you though for your reply. I Hope XBLPET can send me any kind of notification regarding this.</p>

<p>Thank you. I wish XBLPET would just contact me in regards to this just so I can respond. All I want is Zoa back. I don't violate MS ToS. Nobody reported me except 1 person way before for unsportsmanlike conduct. I am currently a college student and I have
 taken World Religion including learning about Zionist and I would say to relate this tag is a stretch." Zoa" is different from" Zio".

<p>Hello Kirneill,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you very much for bringing this issue to our attention. We're sorry to hear about the account changes that where made. The moderators, ambassadors and volunteer moderators do not have the ability to manage
 enforcement actions on an account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We recommend&nbsp;to contact ou<span><span><span>r enforcement team in order to file a case
 review if eligible. They can be reached at their website,<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howTo#sub-topic0-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/Home/HowTo#sub-topic0-0"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Xbox
 Enforcement&nbsp;Team</span></a>. The decisions are made and upheld by the enforcement team.
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>(Also, when receiving an enforcement action you get notified on the console under messages&nbsp;and to the emails linked to the account.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should there still be issues, then the only thing I can recommend is to refer to these two posters information as these are the most likely answers.

<div>If you are dynamically aquiring an IP address make sure the connection is using

So maybe check the wireless interface for the right configuration.<br />
If that is right and still no internet then it must be the driver (In which case you'll have to download the driver from your computer manufacturers website).<br />
Or you can always set up a connection to the router.<br />

Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />

Have you tried to use Windows Compatibility Mode?<br />
If you have an older application for Windows XP or Vista that doesn't run in Windows 7, you may be able to get it working properly by running the program in compatibility mode.<br />
1. To begin, find the application or shortcut that is causing the problem, then right click on it and select Properties.<br />
2. Then, select Compatibility from the tabbed menu at the top of the properties page:<br />
3. Now, check the "Run this program in compatibility mode for..." box and select the OS you wish to emulate. For most applications, it will be Windows XP SP2. Once you are done, click OK.<br />
4. When you next launch the application it should run under compatibility mode using the OS you selected. If it still fails to run correctly, try another OS selection in step 3 and try again.</p>
<p>Run the installation program in compatibility mode:</p>
<p>1. Right-click the installation file's icon.<br />
2. Click Properties &gt; Compatibility .<br />
3. Select the compatibility mode for Windows XP.<br />
4. Click OK .<br />
5. Run the installation program.</p>
<p>After it's installed, run the program in Windows XP compatibility mode by doing the same with the installed program.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work and you have Windows 7 Professional or Ulitmate, you may use XP mode.<br />
Running Windows XP Mode requires:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate editions.<br />
2. A computer capable of hardware virtualization. This means your computer has a central processing unit (CPU) with either Intel-VT or AMD-V virtualization features.<br />
3. Virtualization features turned on in your computer’s basic input/output system (BIOS).</p>
<p>Please look at the following website for information:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/install-and-use-windows-xp-mode-in-windows-7#section_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/install-and-use-windows-xp-mode-in-windows-7#section_1</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
To determine whether your computer’s CPU is capable of hardware virtualization, go to the Windows XP Mode and Windows Virtual PC support website and download a utility that can check whether your Intel or AMD CPU is compatible.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/support/configure-bios.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/support/configure-bios.aspx</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
To find your brand of processor so you can download the appropriate utility, click the Start button , right-click Computer, and then click Properties. Under System, next to Processor, you can see what type of CPU you have.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Even if your CPU can run Windows XP Mode, you might also need to turn on virtualization settings in your computer’s BIOS. Procedures vary depending on the BIOS manufacturer. For more information, see BIOS: frequently asked questions.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/BIOS-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/BIOS-frequently-asked-questions</a><br />
If you run W7 Professional / Ultimate, install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP mode (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx</a>) and execute your software in Windows XP.</p>
<p>If you run Windows 7 Home version you can try 3rd party virtualization programs.&nbsp;Try VirtualBox (<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.virtualbox.org</a>) older VMware Player (<a href="http://www.vmware.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.vmware.com</a>) and install a separate copy
 of Windows XP (either Home Edition or Professional) for that purpose.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</p>

            <p>While that is true (and perfectly valid) - Adobe Reader also works fine in Windows 10.&nbsp; If there is something wrong with this persons' system, this is likely just one symptom of a larger issue (which, admittedly, could be centered around as much as the system
 as a whole or as little as just Adobe Reader.)</p>
