<h2>            Distributed COM Error &#35;10016</h2>
                    <p>I asked about this error about a week ago and another user suggested I create a recovery drive. &nbsp;Although I understand that is a good idea, that is not my main concern. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really like to know how to prevent the error from occurring. &nbsp;Does anyone know how to do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that in this community the question has been repeatedly asked going back several years. &nbsp;I am running Windows 10 on a Dell with an AMD A8 processor. &nbsp;I have run a couple of utility programs to clean the registry already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be helpful and appreciated.</p>

            <p>Firstly, would you check the dates and times of the events.&nbsp; I see some which seem to occur at specific times such as at system startup.&nbsp; There may be several in a row but I assume those are related to the system not being able to access certain items during
 startup.&nbsp; If you can copy and paste the GUID numbers for the CLSID and AppID we can check what they are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been certain ones, during different times of Windows updates which do seem to present a problem.&nbsp; If you want to repair it will take changing permissions so you can alter the basic behavior.&nbsp; It appears, to me, that during some updates after being
 replaced, this entities don't follow the default settings and will not react as designed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I am getting the one with the AppID </p>

            This has happened a few times. &nbsp;I frequently have several applications opened at once so I don't exactly recall which applications I was using when the problem occurred. &nbsp;If I were to guess, I would say it happened when using Windows Live Mail&nbsp;Version
 2012 (Build 16.4.3528.0331)<br />

I also distinctly recall that it occurred when I was using Microsoft Office Professional 2010 Word application. &nbsp;I know this because I was concerned about the loss of some work I had been doing.

<h3> accelshift  say:</h3>
<h2>            Teredo and Live support issues</h2>
                    
<p>Okay so i've been trying to play Killer Instinct on PC since launch, the game itself runs fine but i was unable to play online, i looked into it and noticed that i don't have a teredo address, i follow all the instructions laid out for me and nothing works.
 I take to the internet for alternate solutions and none of them work, i'm at a dead end at this point because nothing results in a obtaining a teredo address.</p>
<p><br />
What's worse Is can't even ask live support for an answer because when i go to start the chat it requires i have a first and last name attached to my account, which i do have, but the page claims i don't and when i go to add them in, the fields are greyed out
 so i can't do anything with them. I've been wanting to play KI with my friends but because of teredo i'm unable to do so.</p>
<p>Is there anything that can be done about either issue?</p>

<p>As for me, I tried the microsoft provided steps, they didn't work for me.</p>
<p>Later I stumbled over this post on reddit: <a href="https://m.reddit.com/r/killerinstinct/comments/4ctslv/possible_fix_for_those_having_trouble_with_teredo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
m.reddit.com/.../possible_fix_for_those_having_trouble_with_teredo</a> </p>
<p>with this I actually managed to get the xbox app to obtain the teredo address.</p>
<p>But sadly I still can't play KI-Multplayer whatever the reason may be. Teredo Filter in router is also disabled.</p>

<p>Sorry that didn't work either, i have a teredo driver running but it still says i don't have a teredo address. I looked it up and it seems that my ISP, BT, isn't running IPV6 until the end of the year.</p>
<p>I think it's kinda ridiculous that Microsoft would force such a method of connectivity without offering an alternative just as it's ridiculous that BT hasn't gotten around to rolling out IPV6 yet.</p>
<p>Shame on both of them.</p>

<p>Sorry the methods suggested did not work. &nbsp;Unfortunately this was the only tips the developers shared at this time for they are still investigating. &nbsp;If they have further tips to share we will post a new thread. I would also suggest to continue to report
 this issue if you keep observing by using the "Report a Problem" via Xbox App (Beta).</p>

<h2>            Works suite 2002</h2>
                    I am trying to load works suite to my window 10, it is from when I bought a desk top back when. It asks for a product key to activate the program. I kept the CD but not the box. What can I do to activate this program?

            Hi Dean, 
<br />
<br />I’m sorry, if you didn’t keep the box, the only other way would be to get it off the original pc you installed it on. I doubt you have that still running. 
<br />
<br />You may be able to reach out to MS directly and they MAY be able to help you, but given the age of the software, it might be out the window where they can help. 
<br />
<br />I have 2 links below - MS support numbers, and the Microsoft Support Virtual Agent

<h2>            Skype to Skype not working</h2>
                    <p>All of a sudden my Skype user name is listed as my email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't make or receive Skype to Skype&nbsp; calls.&nbsp; All that function is 'greyed out' in the drop down menue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also use Pamela for Skype - it is installed on my laptop and at one point I had to "use classic Skype' to make it all work together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just this morning - Skype or Windows informed me that there were two accounts. It looks like what once was my stand alone Skype account (that had my original user name was no longer recognized by microsoft and my email address had replaced my original user
 name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just merged them - so now I don't have a clue how this will affect everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to delete and reinstall because when I tried that on my Windows Surface tablet - Skype would not reinstall and I lost it forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help me to get my Skype working. It's important to me and I love Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. Todd Smith</p>

<h2>            What is Silverlight&#59; failing updates slow my pc</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 10 on an old Inspiron; using Firefox.&nbsp; Every so often, it won't load websites or is extremely slow.&nbsp; So I usually Restart and everything's OK.&nbsp; However, the past couple of days there was a message, updating App; do you want to continue.&nbsp;
 It doesn't say what app (why not, Windows 7 always did).&nbsp;&nbsp; So I say continue restart; ignore updating app.&nbsp; Checked the update history and it's always Silverlight.&nbsp; The message is Security Update for Microsoft Silverlight (KB3173713) and then Failed to Install
 on 02/05/17, etc.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>What is Silverlight and do I need it?&nbsp; Ever since I've been on Windows 10, all updates fail and the updates slow the PC down.&nbsp; The first time I saw the app was when I saw all the Update fails.&nbsp; And with security updates all failing, do I really want it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my PC mainly for going on websites, email, letters and spreadsheets.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Answer-by-number:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Have you ever run the <strong>McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Is Internet Explorer and/or Edge working properly when you intentionally choose to use one of&nbsp;them (i.e., instead of Firefox)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Is it the same computer - not necessarily the same problem - as in one or more of these previous threads of yours?...<br />

<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; Checked McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool:&nbsp; Says it's to remove McAfee Products</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Don't have Internet Explorer (it's not listed on the Start Menu under Window Accessories) so I don't use it.&nbsp; Almost never use Edge.&nbsp; And when I do, the Silverlight Updates may not be running so don't know if Edge is affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3)&nbsp; Yup, it's the same computer as mentioned in my other threads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, I just uninstalled Silverlight.&nbsp; As the slow downs have been happening more frequently, I figured no Silverlight, no updates.&nbsp; I don't watch movies or shows on my pc, so figure I don't need it.&nbsp; If I decide I do, I'll reinstall, but since all the updates
 fail, don't know if it would be worth it.</p>

<p>1. Correct: Have you ever run it? [YES/NO]</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Is Edge working properly when you intentionally choose to use it (i.e., instead of Firefox)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have uninstalled Silverlight but chances are you'll see more Silverlight updates. If and when that happens, you'll need to hide it/them.</p>

    <title>Compatibilty issues with The Sims 2 on Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Compatibilty issues with The Sims 2 on Windows 7</h2>
                    Hi, I am having trouble playing the Sims 2 on my laptop. My laptop was originally windows vista, and I then had it updated to windows 7. I installed the sims 2 and it worked at frist then once i exited and reopened it said 'the application has crashed,
 it will now terminate'. I looked online for tutorials and solved problems and followed steps by downoading the sims 2 patch on the sims 2 website and adjusted the compatibility mode in order for it to run as instructed on a tutorial i found. I have tried making
 it compatible for windows XP service pack 2 and windows vista service pack 2 and other windows but it is still crashing. Is there any other way I can get the sims 2 to run properly?

    <title>Changing Windows 7 Starter login screen name - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kangaroo1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing Windows 7 Starter login screen name</h2>
                    Thank you.&nbsp; How simple!&nbsp; However, I now find that the original (incorrect) user name has firmly attached itself to my working folder called C:\Users\[incorrect (locked?) file folder name].&nbsp; How now can I change the name of this folder to what I want it
 to be?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When I first started up my Windows 7 Starter after purchase, I was given a screen to enter a name for my computer.&nbsp; I hit return too soon when typing in this name, and now cannot find a way to change it.&nbsp; I have tried the 'change computer name' process, and
 although that seems to accept the change, it still does not appear on the opening screen with password&nbsp;when I start up the computer.<br />
<br />
How can I fix this?

<br />
<div>That's not the COMPUTER name, that's your USER name.</div>
<div>Just create a new User with the correct name.....</div>

<br />
You can't. You need to copy all the data from that folder to the one created for your new Username.<br />
You will probably have to "take ownership" of the old folder to allow you to copy from it.<br />
<br />
Look up "Taking Ownership of Files and Folders" in Windows Help.

<p>Sorry &nbsp;to hear you're having problems with the update. I think we should start by clearing your cache memory first. Don't worry, this will not delete any account information or anything important.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Press the Guide button on your controller, go to Settings, and select System Settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select Storage or Memory</p>
<p>Clearing the cache temporarily removes:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Previously downloaded game updates. You will be prompted to download these updates again the next time you try to play the games.
</p>
<p>Highlight any storage device, and then press Y on your controller. (It doesn't matter which storage device you select; the cache will be cleared for all storage devices.)</p>
<p>Select Clear System Cache</p>
<p>When prompted to confirm storage device maintenance, select Yes.</p>
<p>Clearing the Xbox 360 cache does not remove:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Your gamertag</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Content that you have downloaded</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Game files</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Console software updates</p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Try this first and see if this corrects your problem. If not, post back and we can suggest other options.</p>

                    <p>My volume mixer in windows 7 has no effect on the applications in its list.</p>
<p><br />

<p>I can slide the bars up or down while the audio is playing and no change will occur. Even pressing the individual app mute buttons does not work. The only slider that effects volume is the main one for the playback device.</p>

<p>Applications also disappear from the app list in the mixer after a while even though they are still playing sound i.e. Winamp.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong><em>ACPI.sys</em></strong> is the ACPI Driver for NT (New Technology), it's a System driver and is not the true cause of the crash and it being faulted by possibly another device driver or form of hardware.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to Uninstall/Disable Avast Antivirus to check if this causes the blue screen error.</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable
 it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></span></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue persists, then run the Driver Verifier tool which will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.</div>

<div>In the <strong>Start</strong> search, type <strong>Command prompt</strong> and right click on it and select
<strong>Run as Administrator</strong> and type <strong>verifier.exe /all.</strong></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, then consider uninstalling the hardware drivers and install the latest drivers from the computer manufacturer website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- In the Device Manager, right click on the display adapters and click on Uninstall. Restart the computer and install the drivers from

    <title>Windows 7 vs 8.1 privacy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ralfralfralf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 vs 8.1 privacy</h2>
                    W8 is slightly faster and more secure with a few other benefits, but I probably won't notice.
<br />
W8 UI looks like an April fools joke but it should eventually become second nature.<br />
W8 metro App thing is all/mostly force-fed bloatware that I can hopefully remove after every format to save CPU usage and would be better replaced with one's preferred internet shortcuts, favorites, and widgets. It's like MS wants you to sit on their lap when
 using your computer. <br />
<br />
<br />
For some reason to me, Windows 8 has a vibe like it would default share things without me realizing, and that it's easier to accidentally share things through like apps etc eventhough I don't have things like facebook, twitter, or an MS Outlook email.
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't want my whole computer able to be logged into with any W8 computer, so I know to create a Local Account when formatting instead of a Windows Account to not have the cloud sync. But would the cloud still be there and I'd have to do as much disabling
 anyway with W7 skydrive?<br />
<br />
<br />
Does anyone who knows these OS know if I'm worried about nothing because they both have equal things I need to delve into explorer to disable?<br />
<br />
I don't put my computer on the home network when formatting, but I still have to disable Simple File Sharing afterwards. Is file sharing more easily accidentally done with W8.1 than W7?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The only reason I want W8 is because it's $100 for OEM which is allowed to be installed on more than 1 motherboard unlike the $100 W7 OEM which is forever tied to the first motherboard it's installed on unless I spend $200 for W7 Retail Version.<br />
I know I can call for a code when formatting and trick OEM 7 to reinstall on another motherboard, but it still might be like stealing- I'm waiting for an email from MS if they even care if I 'trick' it because either way, I'd still spend only $100 if I got
 W8 and it's allowed to be installed on other motherboards. They'll probably say no and I might end up spending $200 for W7 Retail which sucks because $100 goes a long way in computer parts.
<br />
<br />
I don't think I've stolen even a penny in like 8 years or something, but something tells me to just Buy W7 OEM and not consider it stealing if I trick it to install on future motherboards. But they might make a slightly bigger profit on W8 for $100 vs W7 $100,
 so maybe I'll donate $20 or something to MS and get the $100 W7 OEM and hope I never hit a dead end trying to trick it to install.<br />
<br />

<div>Someone on another forum said:</div>
<div>"As for moving a 7 OEM license being "stealing", I would definitely not go that far. At least in the US, its questionable whether copyright law even allows such a limitation. It can easily be argued that the right
 of first sale makes such a limitation non-binding legally. Just because the copyright holder claims a right doesn't automatically mean the right exist in law. I have long suspected this to be one reason MS changes the license in Windows 8 OEM."</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So I asked if I'm reading that correct if it means I can trick it to install again, they replied:</div>

<div>"I wouldn't. Not in the U.S. at least. Not arguing for or against doing it. Just pointing out that it is a more complicated legal question than most give it credit for."<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I heard back from MS. I basically copy pasted my OP here to them. They only replied with a generic copy paste about product keys that was no help. their email had a link to ask further ?s because it was a do-not-reply
 email, but the link was invalid.<br />
I guess I'll get W8 to save $100, but still wondering about all the questions about more easily accidentally sharing with W8 than W7?</div>

<h2>            Drivers won&#39;t update</h2>
                    Hi everyone, i have been trying to update my drivers using the device manager on windows10, all i get is 'downloading driver software'. i have tried uninstalling the driver, restart my system and tried again, no luck.&nbsp; I will prefer a solution that helps
 me make use of my device manager rather than going to manufacturers website to download. (Tried that, can't find the specific driver- intel hd graphics) Connection is working perfectly.

            <p>Hi Jacob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Are you trying to update your display driver?</p>
<p>2. Are you facing any issue with the display which requires your to update the driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might take longer than expected if the most current driver version is already installed in your computer. However, I suggest you to try placing the computer in clean boot state and check again.</p>
<p><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>

<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Once you are done with the troubleshooting, perform the steps in "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot "to reset computer as usual.
</span><span><span>This could be due to any third party software conflict.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>

            <p>As mentioned, if there is no problem with the current driver, I would not bother updating it. Also, you can check Windows Update for the latest drivers, that's how I was able to download updated drivers for my display and not through device manager.

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If the other suggestions don't help then  Check for a newer Display driver on the PC or Display adapter Support Downloads webpage.  While there check if there are other newer drivers to Update.  You can take your time until they are all updated.  
<br />
<br />There is a known issue of incorrect Display driver being pushed by Windows Update which requires rolling back the driver.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose Display device, then Driver tab, then Roll back.  
<br />
<br />If there is no Roll Back or that doesn't help choose Update Driver on Display device Driver tab, then Browse Computer, then Let Me Pick to see a list of all previously installed Display drivers, work backwards trying each to find one that works.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can also go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update to look for the driver under Installed Updates and Uninstall it form link there.   Then you can hide the driver so it isn't pushed again using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of those work try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>.  Make sure System Restore is always enabled for C with plenty of disk space apportioned (5-10%) in its Configuration settings.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows 10 is not working for my 2012 laptop but I can&#39;t go back to Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>My laptop has not handled Windows 10 well (probably because it's not a tablet) I don't have the means to purchase a brand new computer either. I have tried to go back to Windows 7, even though I switched because support for Win7 is ending at the end of this
 year (2019), but it tells me it is too late to switch back now. I have tried very hard to make this work for my laptop but as a digital art student I need an OS that works with my drawing tablet (Parblo A640/Coast10). The OS screws up my screen proportions
 and it throws off my tablet calibrations to the point of them being unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I go back to Windows 7 without being at risk of viruses?</p>
<p>Or can I maybe switch to Windows 8?</p>
<p>OR even better, can I find a way to make Windows 10 work for my drawing tablets??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a ton of art programs installed on my laptop and want to avoid a factory restore if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything I can do?</p>

            Hi KeBos91 
<br />
<br />At this stage, the only way to go back to Windows 7 would be to backup your data and clean install Windows 7
<br />
<br />With regards to the issues you are having with your Tablet:
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />
<br />Expand the display Adapters section
<br />
<br />Is your video card driver installed correctly and what is the Make and model of your graphics card?

<p>Here are my current Graphics Card Details, and yes I realize I am working with a dinosaur of a computer here lol. I just need it to be able to get through one more year of university before I can purchase a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer itself has 1TB of space on it which is why I am able to keep so many programs at a time and is ideal for a multimedia student. (Adobe CC alone is enough to take up a ton of space)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I had major issues when converting to Win10 with screen size, nothing fit and every interface was way too big I had to manually change the resolution. Not sure if it's related to calibration but thought I would throw that in.<br />

            Hi KeBos91
<br />
<br />I am sorry, your screenshots are not coming through, can you please try that again ... 
<br />
<br />How to do that on Community:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type snip and hit Enter - this will open the Snipping Tool
<br />
<br />Set Mode to Full Screen, then click New to take a screenshot
<br />
<br />Save that file to your Desktop and close the Snipping Tool
<br />
<br />Then in your next Post, click the second last button on the toolbar above your post to select that image and upload it to your post . . ..

<br />your Intel Graphics driver is very old, try installing this driver version for you Intel HD Graphics 4000 drive and if that improves things . . .

<p>Unfortunately the problem with my drawing tablet has not gotten any better after.</p>
<p>I think the issue may lie with the drawing tablet itself so I will try asking the manufacturer about the issue.

<p>
</p><p>I know the pen and windows ink can sometimes mess with tablets so I will try looking for some information on that.
