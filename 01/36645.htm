            Thank you very much for replying to my question!
<div><br />
<div>my computer is Sony vaio model vpccw17fdb</div>
<div><br />
<div>And i did some&nbsp;research&nbsp;and it looks like the graphics card i have (Geforce 210M) is not compatible with windows 8 drivers. (from my knowledge that is; i am not a very good tech person so my sources may be wrong) &nbsp;Either I have to go back to windows 7
 or i will have to buy a new graphics card. Unless of course i am wrong and there is a windows 8 driver that is compatible with this graphics card.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would like to uninstall windows 8 i guess since this is a old laptop and i will be buying a new one sometime in&nbsp;December. May i ask how i can uninstall windows 8 and revert back to windows 7?&nbsp;</div>

            This will not work if you use Steam and EA/Orgin to purchase games - you do not get the ability to install the game with a compatibility mode - We need the capability to force the mode in the applications - simple right click option to for -

<div>On this website you can download the most recent drivers for your Nvidia Geforce 210M. Just fill in all fields and click the green "search" button. It should give one result (GEFORCE R304 DRIVER).</div>

<h2>            How to lodge a complaint against Microsoft&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I’ve had much strife getting a straight answer about my repair status from Microsoft and would like to lodge a formal complaint but can’t find an address - it is very unhelpful that there is only one microsoft store in Australia and the phone lines keep
 getting routed offshore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been very patient with the support staff, who sent me on a wild goose chase, and when asked to speak with someone higher, their literal response is we have no phones or email capabilities to communicate with anyone else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reckon it is atrocious that Microsoft is allowed to absolve itself of its liabilities through strict offshore procedures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.s. anyone has Microsoft’s address for serving court documents? Those offshore staff ‘can’t provide that information’ as well.</p>
<p />

<p>That's not true at all and no where does it state you can't open your Xbox for repairing. &nbsp;Replacing or Repairing a disc read laser is NOT modding. &nbsp;It would only void any and all warranties if the repair was not done by a Microsoft approved repair center.
 &nbsp;If that was the case then everyone who has ever had a repair done to their console would have been banned including just about everyone I know. &nbsp;DES5IE try looking it up on Youtube, that is where the best info about repairs can be found.</p>

<h2>            Crashing on Windows 10 &#40;freezing&#41;</h2>
                    Its not much crashing but more of freezing and then having to force shut down, so that I guess is a form of crashing. Don't get me wrong I like windows 10 but it is really starting to get on my nerves. I downloaded the update to windows 10 from windows
 7 about a week ago and throughout that week I have been in the middle of things and guess what it freezes I don't know if this is a system wide thing or it is just the windows team not really caring about the free upgrades. Or it is a machine problem I don't
 know. But if it is then sorry windows.

<h3> bethflorida  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 not recognizing added RAM.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Studio 1749, i3, 2.27 GHz, 64-bit OS, Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I kept receiving low memory messages, and wanted to be done with defragmenting RAM. &nbsp;I purchased a 4GB RAM module and installed it without a problem. &nbsp;On booting, my BIOS recognizes the RAM without a problem, but Windows will not load. &nbsp;After automatically
 rebooting about three times, I receive a Windows message that it is preparing "automatic repair." &nbsp;Nothing happens for 5 or 10 seconds, and then the rebooting cycle starts to repeat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that this could be a BIOS issue, but I have the latest BIOS from Dell. &nbsp;The problem is it is dated 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to summarize: &nbsp;installed new RAM module with no problem, running latest BIOS (2011), Windows won't load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts/suggestions?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Actually, I did say that the laptop is a Dell Studio 1749, although I'm not clear as to what difference that makes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the memory matches my existing memory, but--again--that's not really relevant because I have the problem loading Windows whether I use both old and new modules, or just the new one. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the computer itself recognizes the module and its size without a problem. &nbsp;I have verified that in the BIOS. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem comes in loading Windows. &nbsp;There is no evidence that it is a hardware problem.</p>

            <p>Hardware is relevant because different brands and models of ram have specific and different latencies and such. &nbsp;Mixed timings is always a possibility to explore when issues like yours apprear. &nbsp;The BIOS enumerates the amount of ram but does not guarantee
 compatibility under load. &nbsp;I'm not saying you have a hardware problem. &nbsp;What I am doing is starting at the first point to check in any troubleshooting which is hardware. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What was the results of the mem test?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What BIOS rev. are you using? &nbsp;Is this the latest? &nbsp;(I realize that the latest doesn't necessarily address a specific issue, but might)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you explored the Dell Community forums?</p>

</p><p>I really do appreciate your effort to help. &nbsp;However, you are asking questions I have already answered and/or are missing facts I've already detailed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand about mixed timings. &nbsp;That is why I detailed attempting to boot with&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">only</span> the new memory in place. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as I said, I am running the latest BIOS from Dell. &nbsp;Unfortunately, Dell is apparently not updating BIOS and drivers for this computer. &nbsp;The latest BIOS update is from Nov 2011.</p>

            Yes, probably A11. &nbsp;The manufacturers commonly only update a BIOS for the first year or so after the model comes out. &nbsp;What does Dell support say about the issue? &nbsp;Windows 10 has some memory management enhancements that could be uncovering an issue.

 code 43.But all my other usb devices like mouse keyboard,pendrives are working perfectly fine on both the ports and I am using a Lenovo laptop.I even have another enter gamepad joystick and it is working perfectly.I tried reinstalling,uninstalling,updating
 that universal usb controllers list in device manager, but nothing is working and the problem is still there.I even installed a cd driver that came along the joystick,but still its not working.So please help.</p>

<p>Hi Hrishikesh,<br />
<br />
The "Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems (Code 43)" error message occurs if one of the drivers controlling the device notified the operating system that the device failed in some manner.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Based on the information you have provided, considering that you have done reinstalling, uninstalling, and updating the driver and the issue persisted, then you can consider reinstalling the drivers from the disk the installation disk that comes with
 it. If the issue persists, you can downloading the previous driver manually from the manufacturer's website. You can also ask help from their support team for assistance in installing the right driver for your device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards.</span></p>

<p>Maam,</p>
<p>Thanks for your help, but the option about rolling back driver is grayed out.There is no previously installed driver for that joystick.And the problem is still persisting.The thing I am not getting is that joystick was working perfectly with 1703 version.But
 once I updated to 1709 it is showing like this.So if there is any other way,please help.Just one thing I need to tell u.that once I purchased joystick,along with joystick I also got a cd containing driver(usb vibration) I&nbsp; installed it but still its not working.So
 help.</p>
<p>Thanking You</p>

    <title>Strange WIFI password problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> revjessemeyer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strange WIFI password problem</h2>
                    <p>After moving to a new town, my computer will not let me send my password to connect to the WIFI.&nbsp; It sees all of the networks, and gives me an option to enter a password, however, upon entering it and hitting "NEXT" it does nothing.&nbsp; The password stays filled
 out, but no other action is taken.&nbsp; If I right click and select "CONNECT" it clears the password entry box.&nbsp; I have tried the following solutions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reset computer.</p>
<p>Reset router.</p>
<p>Reset modem.</p>
<p>connected to network with another device (android phone, Smart TV, other PC, all worked).</p>
<p>Quintuple checked the password.</p>
<p>Delete old networks from my list.</p>
<p>Reset Network settings.</p>
<p>Updating drivers (no update required)</p>
<p>Hooking up to Ethernet cable (works, and how I am visiting the forums, had no effect on wifi)</p>
<p>Searching forums and asking other tech savvy people for advice - No one seems to have heard of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best I can tell, I have narrowed it down to a software issue, but have reached the limits of my tech skills.&nbsp; Anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p>You might lack write-access to the registry key where the password is held. I would do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a Command Prompt with cmd.exe.</li><li>Type these commands and press Enter after each:<br />
netsh wlan show profiles<br />
(to see a list of all existing WLAN profiles)<br />
netsh wlan delete profile "SeaBreeze"<br />
(to delete the profile for the "SeaBreeze" SSID)<br />
</li><li>Create a new connection for your WLAN.</li></ol>

            update.&nbsp; I installed a brand new driver for my USB WIFI.&nbsp; I used it to bypass windows connection and was able to connect that way.&nbsp; It has not resolved the issue with windows connection (stil lwill not accept passwords) but allows me to connect via other
 means.&nbsp; More of a work-around than a fix.

            Since the Microsoft Answers forum does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of
 resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you can reliably reproduce it at will, that is good.&nbsp; Then if/when you make any adjustments and if the failure condition is resolved, you can feel good about it.<br />
<br />
Now there are certain runtime error 216 messages (similar to yours)&nbsp; you can see if your system is afflicted with a certain malicious software, so before troubleshooting anything, it is a good idea to make an effort to first make an effort to be reasonably
 sure your system is free of malicious software, so I would do this:<br />
<br />
No matter what else you are using for malicious software protection, do this:<br />
<br />
<div>Download, install, update and do at least one full scan with these free malware detection programs:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a></div>
<div>SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>They can be uninstalled later if desired.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When the scans run clean, reboot your computer and <span style="font-style: italic">
</span>troubleshoot remaining issues.<br />
<br />
After the scans run clean, if you still have the problem and can reliably reproduce it when trying to view videos then do this:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.<br />
<br />
For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.<br />
<br />
This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork.<br />
<br />

<p>At the time Microsoft Flight Simulator X was released, it was built around .NET Framework 2.0.</p>
<p>Always ensure you have the latest video graphic card drivers.</p>
<p>You may want to try downloading <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0856eacb-4362-4b0d-8edd-aab15c5e04f5&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Redistributable</a> and see if this works.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may want to uninstall any new updates to .NET Framework that have been installed.</p>
<p>You may want to try running the application in compatibility mode, if you have not tried this already.</p>
<p>You may want to go so far as to try running it in a virtual machine, such as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
XP Mode</a> or convert the XP Mode image so that it works in <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/player/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
VMWare Player</a> or <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">VMWare Workstation</a> (good support for DirectX now)</p>
<p>Flight Simulator is among the best Microsoft Games ever to have been released. It is a pity that we have not seen a new one in some time. I remember long hours of leaving my Boeing on auto-pilot while traveling from New York to Hong Kong :) In some cases
 I am not sure if the strange lights in the sky I sometimes saw were the aurora-borealis&nbsp; or a technical glitch with my old graphics card! Nonetheless, I believe these steps may help you try to resolve your problem.</p>
<p>If this is needed for legitimate training use, my latest tests of VMWare Workstation 7.1.1 show that there is only a 1.0 Windows Experience Index improvement drop from the host machine and the guest machine. You may be able to successfully run the game,
 with DirectX compatibility, in a previous version of Windows, using virtualization. I have not tested the game in Windows 7, but would be surprised to learn that it may not be working in this environment.</p>

<p>I do run fsx in compatibility mode. I tried installing the Dotnet framework you posted there, but I got this error.</p>

<p>I just think it has to do with dotnet framework, and if I have to go as far as running it in virtual machine, i will, but not now.</p>

Installing .net 2.0 is not possible, because it is already part of Windows 7.<br />

<p>The version in Windows 7 is .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 (now updated to 4), which includes the pre-requisite components necessary to run native .NET Framework 2 applications. However, what you have failed to mention to the OP in this instance, is that the program
 may in fact need to recognize this difference. 2.0 SP2, 3.0, as well as others, are all rolled up into one package, and may require the specific version reference for the game to run properly. Even if 2.0 is referenced, but changes made with the service packs
 are causing conflicts with the code, this could cause a crash-to-desktop scenario. I am of the belief that after this many roll-ups of the distribution itself, some manner of compatibility problem exists within the game that is causing issues. At the time
 the game was written, it is very possible there was no understanding as to how .NET Framework would evolve as a standard and provide backwards compatibility in this manner. Every indication I see shows that people started having problems with Flight Simulator
 X after the release of newer .NET Framework versions, including even Service Packs for 2.0 which were resulting in CTDs.</p>
<p>If it is trying to use, by default, whatever version is the latest&nbsp; ".NET Framework", but calling old object types or variables, this may be causing it to crash. Until the game is patched, there is really no solution. So it is true, I am in error in the
 fact that you cannot run this program unless you go back to the conditions the operating system was expected to be in the year the game was released and last patched! Unless someone out there has got it to work.</p>
<p>The tragedy of this scenario is that it is used by pilots-in-training and at the time, was one of the most detailed oriented simulations ever created of flying an aircraft. But that is for discussion, I suppose.</p>

<p>Thanks Mike, I just tried re-installing my OS; I cleaned everything out, and made a clean install of almost everything I had on the old one, and got the same error again. Is there really any good way to fix this?</p>

            The information shows that Flight Simulator X is expecting .NET Framework 2.x but it was patched in the cumulative update to 3.5 in Windows 7. Unless there is a patch to the game, or unless you are able to run the game on something like Windows XP using
 XP Mode or virtualization such as VMWare, you may be unable to use the game in Windows 7. Because .NET Framework 2 was patched but the game was not, this seems to be wherein the problem starts.

            You are correct, this is a REX issue. I had the same problem, i updated the REX weather engine and was able to resolve it. No errors anymore.<br />

    <title>My Start Menu is Completely Dysfunctional - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cinosweive  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Start Menu is Completely Dysfunctional</h2>
                    My Start Menu is not well behaved at all.&nbsp; I used to be able to drag my most frequently used programs and weblinks to the Start Menu.&nbsp; I even had entire folders of related programs or weblinks pinned there.&nbsp; Now with Windoze 7 it almost seems like the
 guys at Microsoft said "hey, people are getting more use out of this than we had intended - how do we put a stop that?".&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Now I can drag weblinks to the Start Menu, but more often than not they vanish.&nbsp; Windows will behave like the drag was successful, but nothing shows up in the Start Menu.&nbsp; If I drag a folder of links or programs to the Start Menu, the folder opens as a separate
 folder in Explorer - not as a menu folder.<br />
<br />
Instead now we have this ridiculous "pin to Start Menu" function that only works in a very limited fashion.&nbsp; It is as if Windows 7 is nothing more than "XP Light".<br />
<br />
The search function on the Start Menu is a nice improvement - but why did we have to sacrifice almost all of the functionality of the old Start Menu just to have that?&nbsp; I'm not sure that I understand the reasoning here.&nbsp; Can anyone explain?&nbsp; How many thousands
 of lines of code did it take to make the Start Menu less functional?<br />
<br />
Sorry for the rant - this has just been an incredibly frustrating experience.&nbsp; Perhaps if I understood why Microsoft decided to cripple the interface I would appreciate the changes more.

<h2>            Customer complaints e-mail address&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, Microsoft has ruined my laptop, and i want it back. Short story, had Windows 7, but ages ago lost the disc with the key on it, but had registered it with windows. Asked for a Windows 10 upgrade, and an agent took control of my laptop. It failed, and
 after 4 attempts will not intall. They wiped my backup, and now won't put 7 back on my laptop unless i buy another key.</p>
<p>I want to complain but there is no contact info, i wonder why.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>This laptop, did it come pre-installed with Windows 7 or did you purchase Windows 7 separately and install yourself?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 7 was an OS where the end-user was responsible for keeping up with the product key (really, the only important part in the end - the media could
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
usually be gotten</a>.) &nbsp;After you 'lost' the product (I guess you wrote the product key on the disc or something?) did you ever try and get the product key from the installed OS?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contact Microsoft:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please detail your "backup" method (what was it stored on, how often was it updated, was it just YOUR data or was it a full system image?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You paid for the Windows 10 upgrade?</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for reply, laptop came with Vista, we purch'd the disc and key about 3 years ago, as i had the key on my laptop, and a back up on an external drive, i lost it.</p>
<p>When the failed windows 10 install happened, the agent told me to format the drive, so i lost the backup.</p>
<p>Again on the advice of an agent, all the drives on the laptop were formatted, so now i have nothing.</p>
<p>I am responsible for keeping the key, that i understand, but my point is that before the upgrade i had a perfectly working laptop with windows 7 home premium on it, now they are asking me to buy a new product key, or not have a laptop.</p>
<p>Not happy.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>While I understand your 'not happy' state, it seems you understand that if you had an external (say a USB drive) backup (full system image) before you started doing anything as drastic as changing the operating system completely - you would not be in this
 situation. &nbsp;You say you had 'an external backup' but - was it (for some reason) connected to the system while all of this was going on? &nbsp;If so - why? &nbsp;You have not mentioned anything about attempts to restore from backup - which would be one of the two times
 such a thing would be connected to the system itself... (The other would be while making the backup.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had backed up the Product Key for the Windows 7 you purchased ~3 years ago (25 characters that could have been written down and stored in a drawer, wallet, lock box, etc. or emailed to yourself and left on a Microsoft or Google email account indefinitely,
 etc.) - you wouldn't be in this situation. &nbsp;As I linked to before, you could have
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
downloaded the installation media for Windows 7</a> with that product key and installed Windows 7 cleanly (at worst.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still have the Windows Vista product key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still have proof of purchase for Windows 7? &nbsp;How did you purchase it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Windows 10 installation: you PURCHASED Windows 10? &nbsp;Yes or no?</p>
<p>(It's been a LONG time since Windows 10 was a FREE Upgrade - so I assume that before you started installing Windows 10, you purchased it? &nbsp;I cannot imagine stating the installation without purchasing it first.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is is sounding more like perhaps you were talking to someone other than Microsoft when doing this upgrade... &nbsp;I am unsure why, at this point (given the age of the system) you would even want to upgrade Windows 7 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can and will you start the story at what made you decide to upgrade Windows 7 to Windows 10 on this system that came with Windows Vista originally? &nbsp;How did you then obtain Windows 10? &nbsp;What point did you get in contact with Microsoft? &nbsp;Did you get your
 case number (as they should be able to confirm (in their notes) what you were upgrading from so that you can at least get back to that state...)?</p>

<p>Hi, thanks again for getting back, just to clear up a few things, no, I don't have the original proof of purchase for the windows 7 home premium upgrade, yes, I did have a backup image, both on an external drive (which was used to download the installation
 for windows 10, so was formatted on instruction by an advisor, I had a backup on the laptop, which was formatted, on the instruction of an advisor, The windows 10 upgrade came as a result of a live chat with Microsoft, who offered it to me free. I do have
 the vista product key, and going back to my original question, does anyone know of a contact address via e-mail of customer services? or are you a Microsoft employee?</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

    <title>When will MS bring back audible alerts which were available in Classic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alibaba40  say:</h3>
<h2>            When will MS bring back audible alerts which were available in Classic V7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Version 7 included audible alerts when a contact logged on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was particularly useful for those using a desktop PC who may be away from their PC when a contact logged on.&nbsp; We were able to select our own audible alerts which could then alert us to an incoming message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not everyone uses smart phones so MS need to consider PC users who may have less than perfect hearing - the current 'bubble burst pop' when a contact makes their first post is pathetic and often cannot even be heard over anything being streamed at the same
 time (even when in the same room).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why was this function removed from V8?</p>

            Hi  alibaba40 
<br />
<br />Skype engineers are constantly adding and restoring new features to Skype 8, so, it might be in the works. 
<br />
<br />Please keep in mind, we are fellow users volunteering here and we try to help with the product within in its current state. There is not much else we can do in regards to functionality and design or support for upcoming features. 
<br />
<br />If there is a feature change you do not like or area of the product you would like to see improved, its best you as a user submit feedback to the engineers so they can consider it for improvement of the product.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44e95d98-777b-42bd-898b-d588b1db62e5?upload=true" />

<p>Thank you for the courtesy of your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very much aware that responders here are volunteers, giving of their own free time to try and assist other users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is rather like EBay Community Spirit (moderated by Lithium) on steroids.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that Microsoft established this forum, I believe it would have been wise for them to allocate MS employees to respond - given I have seen some contribute here on occasions - when a controversial new programme had been introduced, particularly when
 users had no alternative BUT to upgrade if they wanted to continue using Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So often I have read volunteers contradict other volunteers' advice - this does nothing to instil confidence in the advice - given freely or not.</p>
<p>

<p>I got an email asking me to update the community about this. Thanks for the reply Cmdr.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is much faster when I search from file explorer&gt;D: drive, so that is helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nonetheless, I still consider the problem unsolved since my preferred [most convenient] way of searching is to hit the Windows key and start typing. Indexing the NAS requires keeping a local copy of the files, which isn't feasible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it is already set to not search contents in a non-indexed location, and is still too slow.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yeah, I don't understand why that has to be a requirement. My company uses many network shares and every day the "Offline Files Cache" syncs a giant portion of it to my hard drive unnecessarily.&nbsp; Which shouldn't even be needed if the files themselves are
 being served by a Windows Server that already indexes the files itself.</p>

    <title>Wired Xbox One Controller Not Working On Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> haiden bowling  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wired Xbox One Controller Not Working On Windows 7</h2>
                    I had recently gone to Walmart to buy a new Xbox controller for my Windows 7 home premium. I had recently had a rock candy Xbox 360 controller until It had been damaged. When I got to Walmart I saw a PowerA Wired White Xbox One Controller and decided to
 buy it. When I got home, I tried to plug in the controller into a port, and it came on, but the light below the Xbox symbol started flashing white. The laptop made the sound that indicated that something has been plugged into one of the ports but said that
 it couldn't recognize it. I thought it had been because&nbsp;I had not recently updated my laptop, so I tried, but It still did the same thing. I tried to auto search my laptop for the right drivers but nothing was found. I really need help,&nbsp;<em><strong><span>please
 tell me what to do.</span></strong></em>

            I got mine to work. One very crutial part that seems to be left out is you need to plug it into a micro usb port. Otherwise it will just recognise it but not work at all like it was doing to me. Tried it, and hated the new feel of it. Switched back to
 my 360 rock candy controller, much more comfortable.

<h2>            Skype 8 doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>When I downloaded to my desktop version 8 a couple of months ago, the new version would not work - no contacts, no picture, no sound. And no guidance. Skype could offer no assistance but thankfully someone advised how to re-instate version 7.&nbsp;Now Skype threaten
 to stop 'support' from Nov 2018.</p>
<p>Has Skype got the new version to work reliably? Or can someone recommend a user friendly alternative to Skype? Many thanks PeterOver</p>

</p><p>I apologize to know about your experience. Please be advised that the system doesn't have the option to automatically remove your contacts, picture etc. The account owner is the only one who can make changes on his/her account. If this is happening on your
 end, there is a big possibility that you might have signed in to a different Skype account. You need to make sure if you have used the correct
<strong>Skype name </strong>(username)&nbsp;when you sign in. If you are not sure of your Skype name, you can ask your friends on Skype to check on your account profile. Let me know if you have updates.</p>
