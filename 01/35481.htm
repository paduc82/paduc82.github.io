                    The links that I have visited in search responses used to change color so I could tell I had already tried that link.&nbsp; I remember being able to set the colors myself.&nbsp; Lately it is hard for me to differentiate on Google search and I have been unable to
 find where to correct this.&nbsp; All questions involving this subject involve Chrome when searched on Google.&nbsp; I use Firefox, am running on Windows 7.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Jeanette,<br />
<br />
<br />
Please provide the answers to the following for us to be able to learn more about the issue you're experiencing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you experiencing the same with your Internet Explorer or you're only experiencing it with your Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers?<br />
</li><li>What are the changes made or the things you've done before the issue start?<br />
</li><li>Have you tried refreshing or resetting the affected browsers?<br />
</li><li>Have you also tried clearing your web browser's cache and cookies, and still got the same result?<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you're experiencing the same issue with your <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>, you can reset it by following the reset steps found on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/923737/how-to-reset-internet-explorer-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. This will return the settings to the state they were in when it was first installed on your PC.<br />
<br />
But if you're only experiencing it with your Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, and resetting still didn't work, it would be best if you contact their support websites.<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your update.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Why is Netflix Crashing my laptop&#63;</h2>
                    So I updated my display adapter to Intel(R) HD Graphics 520 and now I can't watch Netflix. &nbsp;Whenever I try right when the show would start it crashes to the blue frowny face screen of death and I get the System Service Exception Error. &nbsp;How do I fix this?

            <p>Hey SuperBoss. Try these in order...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Windows updates</p>
<p>2. Update runtime software (Java, Flash, Silverlight)</p>
<p>3. Roll back to previous driver version***</p>
<p>4. Run automated driver update from Intel's website</p>
<p>5. Update BIOS</p>
<p>6. Throw laptop into volcano</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** I can help with the driver rollback if you send laptop model/type info. I like Windows 10 personally but ive had trouble with display drivers often. Usually rolling back to the most recent Windows 7 driver (fron the manufacturers website) does the trick.</p>

            Well I might be screwed cus the reason I updated the driver was so that fire wouldn't flip stuff upside down in dark souls and it fixed that plus I like Windows 10. &nbsp;I tried the windows update and I have chrome so I guess flash updates itself and I updated
 chrome so idk. &nbsp;When I tried updating flash it was like white blurred over and stuck on the ask me first option. &nbsp;Is there a way to make it not blurred so I can change it to check for them which is recommended?

            <p>I don't know why the option to change automated updates is not available at the point of install&nbsp;but you do have another way of controlling that after you finish the install.&nbsp; You should be able to find a Flash control center utility in the Windows Control
 Panel after the initial Flash install completes.&nbsp; Open that Flash utility, click on the&nbsp;Updates tab up top and make the change there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel &gt; Flash Player &gt; Updates tab &gt; Adjust things to your liking</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this doesn't help write back with your laptop model type/number and I'll help you get an older driver installed on Windows 10.&nbsp; You don't have to uninstall&nbsp;10 to get a stable Windows 7 driver to work for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, updating BIOS may solve all your problems.&nbsp; Have you tried that?</p>

            <p>One of the Dell updates was updating BIOS. &nbsp;Are you saying the Windows 7 Driver will work together with Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what you told me to do with Flash is exactly what I was referring to. &nbsp;When I click on the updates tab, everything in the window is blurred over white and I am unable to click on the "Allow Adobe to install updates" option. &nbsp;Do I need to reinstall flash?
 &nbsp; I tried looking under "Control Panel" as well and it wasn't there. &nbsp;The only place I was able to find Flash was from typing flash in the bottom left hand corner of the screen. &nbsp;Should I be looking somewhere else?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's weird because the problem is only with Netflix. &nbsp;Do you happen to know what about the interaction between Netflix and my laptop is different from when it accesses other things such as Twitch or YouTube?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>1. Did you make any software changes to the computer recently?</p>
<p>Method 1.<br />
a. Start your computer in Safe Mode (tap F8 about once a second while your computer is in the process of booting up until you come to a screen that allows you to boot into safe mode).<br />
b. Once there, go to your C:\WINDOWS\ServicePackFiles\i386 folder and copy the file ntdll.dll (right click on the file itself and select COPY)<br />
c. And then go to your C:\WINDOWS\System32 folder and click EDIT and then PASTE. <br />
d. Click YES to the warning about overwriting the files and then reboot your computer and check.</p>
<p><br />
Method 2.<br />
I would recommend you to install the free security software from Microsoft. This is easy to install and updates automatically.<br />
Here is the link to download it.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/securepc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/securepc</a></p>
<p>Also I would ask you to install the Windows Xp Service Pack 3 for a stable performance.<br />
It improves the reliability of Windows by installing the latest software updates - new drivers for the hardware and more.<br />

<h3> mark w chase  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Store and apps close immediately</h2>
                    <p>I have a new installation of Windows 10. Whenever I open the Windows Store, or any app such as Weather or Email or Calendar (which I've never opened before), the store or app window opens for a brief second then closes. This is a brand new installation,
 not an upgrade from 7 or 8, and very little has been installed. I am logged in on the machine with my live account, although I did set it up as a local account initially because the Windows installation could not detect my network connection until after I
 installed the network adapter drivers for my motherboard (I don't know if that matters, but I thought I would mention it since it was a little bit of an oddity).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have scoured this support site and Google, and found a half-dozen solutions, none of which work. Just so no one re-post those other solutions, I will briefly detail what I have tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Date &amp; time and timezone fix:</strong> No, my date and time and timezone are correct. I cannot make it anymore correct.</p>
<p><strong>Clearing the Windows Store LocalCache:</strong> The solution to clear the files in

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>WSReset: </strong>
Running wsreset.exe did not work (I think that's similar to the above). In fact, it gave an error,
</span>"ms-windows-store:PurgeCaches. The application cannot be started. Try reinstalling the application to fix the problem".
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>System File Checker:
</strong>Running sfc /scannow did not detect any problems and did not fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong>Re-registering Store App: </strong>Running the powershell script to re-register the
<span><span>AppxManifest.xml did not fix the issue.</span></span></p>
<span><span>AppxManifest.xml did not fix the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Windows Updates:</strong> All the latest Windows updates are installed.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Every time I start Windows Store or any "metro" (or whatever they call it now) app, an error is logged in the event viewer. Here's the error, though I don't think its actually very helpful.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Anyway, none of the solutions I have found so far work, though they appear to work for everyone else. I have no idea what to do now short of re-installing. I will probably do that later today if no other solutions come to light, but I thought I should at
 least ask if anyone knows of any other solutions before I take that step (and if a fresh install doesn't work, I don't know what I'll do...).</p>

            <p>I guess I forgot one of the solutions I had found on line. Yes, I had tried running the Windows Troubleshooter on the App Store as you describe. It found no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first opened the store, I was running as a Local Account, so it did not even work at that time. I then converted to a Windows Account and the store still did not work. I suppose I could switch back to a local account again and try again, and then
 switch back to a Windows account once again, and try yet again, but since it did not work as a local account the first time, I doubt it will again.</p>

            <p>Me as well. Tried all you listed, nothing works. Already downloaded Windows store apps just instantaneously crash upon launch. One awesome example is the Windows Photos app (Microsoft's own). I can't open any photos at all. Just instacrash. There are many
 others as well. On my desktop computer (different than this laptop) the Windows Store itself won't launch. Instacrash as well.</p>

<p>Same problem.&nbsp; Uninstalled&nbsp;the app I was having problem with&nbsp;and somehow reloaded it the first time it happened. Seemed to work for a week or so. Now all apps open and then immediately close. Reset will be an effort for me to try, but I see no other workable
 option. Hope I don't loose other programs sorry apps.....</p>

            Considering the # of people, myself included, having this issue, why isn't Windows doing something to figure out what's Wrong to provide a&nbsp;fix, or if they are, why not let us know? frustrating that we're required to spend hours Seeking solution when it's
 clearly not a problem with every one of our computers. Even more frustrating is your suggestion to reset our computers.

Most certainly agree with your comments. For me the average user, I don't want to have to go through some complex process that can ony be performed and understood by a computer engineer. Very disappointing that all the high paid smart people that Microsoft
 hires cant make apps work.

            <p>I've tried these steps and it didn't help me.... and I'm having this problem having just done a refresh then a reset on this computer (an i7 Surface Pro 4). For context: I did the reset (yeh, that's a complete re-install with complete erase) as I couldn't
 open the start menu and found a powershell script here that was supposed to fix it... it did give me access to the start menu again but it ruined the windows store and all the apps (including maps, people, surface app, etc) I had from there (they had no icons
 and weird names). I ended up doing a reset which has now left me with a completely wiped PC but with all the default apps and app store icons... but none of them open. Clicking on any of them flashes up a window very briefly, then it vanishes. Running wsreset.exe
 as mentioned elsewhere also just yields an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it works, I love the Surface and Windows 10, but this is a £1800 Microsoft built machine that currently has less functionality that the Pro 2 it's supposed to be replacing. I've had it just less than a month now but already I've had to do 4 total resets
 because of Windows 10 updates that have rendered it useless - yeh, it was following a forced restart after an update that my original start menu problem started.</p>

<h3> cyclicaluser01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dragon Age 2 Online Pass Activation</h2>
                    Hello everyone. I bought Dragon Age 2 and was quite surprised to see it included a free download of the Black Emporium via online pass code. I have my XBOX connected to the internet already and when I try to redeem the code through the Marketplace it then
 asks me to sign up for XBOX Live. After entering all my information I get an error message saying "locale not supported". The question is, just because there isn't any Xbox Live coverage of sorts here in the Philippines does that mean any online content I'm
 already entitled to can't be accessed and downloaded? Isn't that a bit unfair? I mean, here I am able to access any site using the internet, watch all the game demos and yet my Xbox is being blocked to access stuff I've purchased already just because they
 don't have any service here? Can I just try to sign up for another Windows Live ID and just choose the US as country? I'm sure they can tell through my ip address where I really am though, right? I'm really getting frustrated here.

<h2>            Havig issues to play monster hunter world on a xbox one but not any other game.</h2>
                    <p>So they changed the "MH:W" disc game twice ( i was thinking the issue could be with the game not with the console), the first time i introduced the first purchased disc my console wasnt able to recognize or read the game. Then i got the disc out and tryed with battlefield 1 (witch worked perfectly). Then i tryed again with "MH:W" and the console reads it!? I install it, start a new game and tada, just music sound, no voices or animation sounds. I delete all the data uninstall game and repeat the proces i did before. Same result, I change the disc and this time wont even read it no mater what i do. Soo, i was wondering if this is some kinda programmed obsolescence stuff you guys do these days. It means a considerably old console cant play 2018 games or somthing? im confused, do i have to buy a ps4?(at least has EXCLUSIVES)</p>

            <p>Every time i introduced a monster hunter world disc on my console it would make strange noises and, stop trying to recognize it or read it very quick. But this wont happen with batttlefield 1, dark souls 3, gta5, or AC origins. I went to the store to change the disc for "MH:W" and the results were the same or worst (game wont even be rocognized by the console)</p>

    <title>Surface 3 cracked screen, whole unit replacement - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mackmanuk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface 3 cracked screen, whole unit replacement - What&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So, I purchased my Surface 3 which is now out of warranty.&nbsp; Although out of warranty I was carrying in my back pack, in a surface case, and I knocked my bag against a wall slightly, yet I discovered when I got home from work that the screen is cracked slightly
 on the bottom left corner.&nbsp; I checked online with MS service centre back then that a screen replacement would cost £155. I was happy to pay this is I knew I would get my own unit back. (this was a while ago admittedly, but now I could afford a replacement
 ) Since then the screen replacement service has been pulled, and I would need to send my unit in, and it will be replaced with a reconditioned unit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly: I know my unit has been well looked after (apart from the accidental screen damage), The back case looks brand new, and iverall it's in as new condition. So what guarantee do I have that the unit I get will not be one that children have abused,
 dogs sat on, used as a placemat, dropped many times etc.</p>
<p>secondly, do MS offer any guarantee for unit replacements, as in this forum I've read all sorts of problems with units customers have had which have been replace.</p>
<p>Thirdly, If I had an I pad, I can go to the local phone shop and have the screen replaced in 20 minutes at a fraction of the cost with a 12 month guarantee. - Did MS make a product so badly in design that they say a screen can' be placed? Please.. Of course
 it can...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'd known I'd have issues and difficulty in replacing a screen I'd have brought an IPad instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I refuse to pay £29 for a call from MS to tell me nothing!</p>

            <div>There NEVER was a screen replacement service. Microsoft has always replaced with</div>

<p>Of course I'd never shoot the messenger. I appreciate your time to reply. I checked the service repair webpage from MS itself, (Although a long time ago), hence where I got the £155 price from. Anyway...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do however have one other question. I have no choice but to go ahead with the replacement service, but seeing as the touch screen don't work...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've followed the restore function to see if that helps... however as one would expect from MS, I've hit a very large wall..</p>
<p>
</p><p>there's no mouse pointer, and I can't touch any buttons...&nbsp; so what happens now?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Of course I'd never shoot the messenger. I appreciate your time to reply. I checked the service repair webpage from MS itself, (Although a long time ago), hence where I got the £155 price from. Anyway...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do however have one other question. I have no choice but to go ahead with the replacement service, but seeing as the touch screen don't work...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've followed the restore function to see if that helps... however as one would expect from MS, I've hit a very large wall..</p>
<p>
</p><p>there's no mouse pointer, and I can't touch any buttons...&nbsp; so what happens now?&nbsp;</p>

            The MANUALLY_INITIATED_CRASH1 bug check has a value of 0xDEADDEAD. This indicates that the user deliberately initiated a crash dump from either the kernel debugger or the keyboard.<br />
<br />
<br />
We need the DMp files to be more specific<br />
<br />
We do need the DMP file as it contains the only record of the sequence of events leading up to the crash, what drivers were loaded, and what was responsible.<br />
<br />
If you are overclocking STOP<br />
<br />
You may be able to get the DMP files without crashing by booting into safe mode (F8) with networking.<br />
<br />
Please follow these instructions to collect data from the crashes and upload them here, to your Skydrive or a file sharing service like Rapidshare.<br />

<p>"Can I make additional copies of a disc I just burned? <br />
&nbsp;Windows does not include the option to make another copy of a disc you have just created. The easiest way to make more than one copy of a disc is to copy all the files you want to burn to a temporary folder and then repeatedly select these collected files
 for each disc you want to create.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;How do I copy a disc? <br />
&nbsp;In order to copy a disc, you need to copy all the files on that disc to your computer, and then choose those files for burning. In general, you can only copy personal data discs, because they are not copy protected."</p>

<h2>            False Reporting on Overwatch Leads to Avoid me &#40;HELP&#41; I CANT PLAY ANYMORE PLEASE FIX MY REP WITH ROLLBACK</h2>
                    
<p>I am a top player on the game overwatch and with being a top player i win alot. Many people report/avoid me after i win against them multiple times them so they dont play against me again. After playing this game ALOT and climbing the leaderboards my reputation
 became needs work....... I never send any messages talking trash or cheat so i didnt understand why this was happening until i checked my friends (also TOP players) and noticed they had the same thing. The next day (a week ago) my friend got avoid me and it
 literally made it impossible for us to play overwatch together. He called xbox support and they told him they couldnt do anything but send him to the forums and he said he pmed a guy who got rid of his avoid me (which is gone to this day). Today i was playing
 and was on a 5 hour winstreak when all of the sudden 5 friends and I couldnt find a game for 30 MINUTES. We all restarted our xbox and then realized my profile changed to avoid me. I now cannot play the only game i currently enjoy because of false reporting
 due to difference in skill. I would like to also note im not cocky but this is exactly what is happening and there is no other way to word it. I would appreciate if someone on the forum team could look at my past messages or game to see I dont deserve this
 reputation and reset my 4 YEAR OLD account to green because i 100% do not deserve this. I have kept this account in green rep status CONSISTENTLY since before overwatch came out being a member since 2012. &nbsp;My gamertag is (Purrf) i have almost 200 hours into
 this game and as a customer would appreciate a roll back on status. MICROSOFT PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUES ASAP -From a customer of xbox live since Original Xbox</p>

<p>I'm sorry to hear this happened, can you let us know if your gamer tag is currently blocked or are you blocked from getting into games in Overwatch? If you cannot join games in Overwatch AKA the game shows a window that you have been banned you may need
 to contact Blizzard. Also have you been sent any Xbox messages that are negative?</p>

<h2>            Forgot Admin Password and Pin, usually use fingerprint but now requires pin&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I usually use my fingerprint to log into the admin account which I do so rarely.&nbsp; I have a few other non-admin accounts on the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to log into the admin account today with the fingerprint it asks for my pin as well?!&nbsp; This seems to be an issue with some new update.&nbsp; So now I cannot access the admin account since I do not know the pin or password (although the fingerprint
 is recognized and requires an extra pin to be approved)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is entirely retarded, do I no longer have admin access for Windows 10 and I DO NOT WANT TO WIPE OUT MY COMPUTER TO RESTORE ADMIN ACCESS BEFORE ANYONE SUGGESTS THAT.</p>

            Hey Bropper.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you. 
<br />
<br />
<br />The point of having all other sign-in options that are available to you on the Log-in Screen is so you can use them if one fails.  Why do you not remember your password or PIN?  This inability may make it necessary to take extraordinary steps including reinstalling.  So if it needs to go there, it is only because the most important thing to remember to avoid such extraordinary steps, wasn't. 
<br />
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try so that at least something will work:
<br />
<br />First see the various troubleshooting steps here: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-10-account-password-from-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-w...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Next try enabling the Hidden Administrator account to log into and set up a new Local Administrative Account to sign-into, move files over and set up, using Option Five here:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>
<br />
<br />To do this you'll need to access a Command Prompt in repair mode using whichever method works here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  You can also try the option to System Restore.  If you don't have the password this may be limited to using the booted media.   
<br />
<br />If necessary you can  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options to try System Restore, or if that fails the Command Prompt to enable the Built-in Admin account .  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the Troubleshoot Options try a Reset, saving files.
<br />
<br />If this fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope having the full range of options helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply, I will try your suggested ideas and feedback.&nbsp; The reason I don't remember the password and pin is because I try to set a different one on each computer and I have quite a fair bit.&nbsp; Furthermore, I never expected the fingerprint
 to not work or suddenly require a pin so the last time I actually typed in the pin or password was probably more than 2 years ago....&nbsp; I do remember the non-admin password and login since for those I use a similar one for each computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the requirement of a pin along with the fingerprint was due to some recent update?&nbsp; (Which seems pointless to me because then I would just use the pin direct and not have to use the fingerprint PLUS pin)</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 insuffient memory Issue - 32 GB ram and 256 GB system drive CPU 5930K</h2>
                    <p>First, i do run a lot of applications at once jumping from business to person, usually one or two IE or edge browsers, outlook and other office apps as needed i generally run into this when installing an application, am i wrong to thing 32 GB of memory should
 be able to handle that with no problem. &nbsp;I simply have a lot going on at a time, however they commit never hit's more that 8GB . &nbsp;I had this happen occasionally in win 8 and 8.1 - however didnt experience it in win 7 unless i was truly close to making out
 the limit. &nbsp;I dont know if this is related however sometime i will have an app just unavailable, click it, nothing. &nbsp;click it multiple times it freezes. &nbsp;let it alone for a minute - it self resolves. Memory? utilization of the processor cores?</p>
<p>

            This issue is not resolved - particularly when in Microsoft Outlook. &nbsp;I did a full online repair on outlook and a scanpst against all pst files and it still hangs - with the repair it prompted me to sign into my Microsoft account i couldn't recall the
 password and it took me over 10 minutes to actaully get the field for the code to come up. &nbsp;I have tested all memory and disk. &nbsp;Please Help

<p>About 4 years ago I bought Windows 8.1 Home for my PC build, which I then used to upgrade to Windows 10. Recently, I decided to change the Motherboard &amp; CPU on my computer as it was getting old, but now Windows isn't accepting my Product Key(Or atleast I
 believe it to be) for activation</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d3c2e4a5-83a9-4aec-a634-62aae2cfdec9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d3c2e4a5-83a9-4aec-a634-62aae2cfdec9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Troubleshooting hasn't work for me and I really don't want to have to shell out another $100 for Windows. Will I have to contact Microsoft about this?</p>

            Hi Bonkity
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Did your Windows 10 upgrade originate from a retail store bought Windows 8.1 license or was it a preinstalled OEM license? 
<br />
<br />It depends on how Windows 10 was originally configured on your computer.
<br />
<br />	If its a full retail store bought license online or offline, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a retail store bought Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a OEM preinstalled Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is NOT transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	Learn more about transferring your license: 
<br /><a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/transfer-windows-10-license-new-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/transfer-window...</a>
<br />
<br />If its a retail license, learn how to reactivate:
<br /><a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/activate-windows-10-license-microsoft-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/activate-window...</a>
<br />
<br />You could try chatting with support agent and explain the situation in detail and they might be able to activate it. We were able to confirm with Microsoft under some circumstances, OEM licenses can be reactivated even under the free upgrade offer. Its not guaranteed every support agent will do it though, but you can try your luck.
<br />
<br />Microsoft's view is, as long as you are not abusing the license, you should get a pass.

            Hi Bonkity 
<br />
<br />Since you purchased Windows 8 and then upgraded to Windows 10, your Windows 10 inherited the retail licence status and does carry transfer rights, your best and only option is to contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10

<h2>            Plextor LLC PX-LB950UE Blu-Ray Drive</h2>
                    I have a HP Laptop DV-7 laptop and for some reason it will not recognize the new Blu Ray Plextor PX-LB950OUE external Burner. Microsoft says it is compatible with Windows 7/ 64but it Windows will not load the External drive. Has anybody run into this problem
 or can offer me any advice? This has happened to me with other things and I'm not sure why. Something tells me that it has something to do with my Laptop Windows settings but just not sure what it could be. I have checked to see if the Windows setting if the&nbsp;
 loading hardware is on and it is set for Automatic. So it has to be something else. Any advice would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            I get No error messages at all. It does nothing. It shows no signs of it trying to load the drive. I have tried using the other USB ports on my laptop and there was no difference. I have plugged my printer to the same USB ports and the laptop did see and
 loaded the printer with no problems. So I know the USB ports are working. Yes, I did try loading the Blu Ray drive to my desktop computer and Windows XP found the drive and loaded it with no problems. So there is a problem with my laptop that it will not load
 hardware all the time. This is Windows 7 upgrade from Vista 64. I;m wondering if that could have anything with my problem.<br />
Thank you,<br />

            Hi, <br />
Please tell us what other devices have had this same problem, and also what anti-virus software you have.
<br />
<br />
Could you also please try booting the computer into safe mode and then try plugging the Blue-Ray drive in. The drivers may or may not be able to install, but hopefully the drive will be seen at least.
<br />

I recently upgraded to Build 10240 on Windows 10. Everything has been pretty good so far, apart from one thing... Search and Cortana won't work. Now, I looked up my problem on the internet, and it suggested I should make a new User Account to see if it works
 over there. So I did just that, and lo and behold it works. So, I log back into my account and it stopped working again. I narrowed down the problem to one thing: SearchUI.exe. I went back on to my Test account and it seemed to startup automatically and ran
 perfectly. When I went back to my account, that wasn't the case. I tried to manually start it as an Admin where it's located (C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.Cortana_cw5n1h2txyewy), yet that did nothing. Help would be great.</div>

            <p>I'm having the same (or at least a similar) issue.&nbsp; Cortana does not work.&nbsp; The start menu is fine, but clicking in the search box changes the color for a split second before it reverts back.&nbsp; Clicking on the Cortana app displays only the gray rectangular
 area where Cortana is supposed to be, but nothing ever appears in the window.</p>

            <p>I think I accidentally stumbled upon at least part of my problem.&nbsp; While trying to scan a document to PDF file, I discovered that I didn't have write permissions to my pictures folder.&nbsp; After poking around a bit, I found a few more folders within my user
 directory that were also mysteriously missing permissions.&nbsp; So, I granted myself full control to everything within my user folder and magically Cortana started working.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>She/It still isn't completely functional.&nbsp; For example, clicking on Settings within Cortana still doesn't do anything at all and clicking the search field itself doesn't do anything.&nbsp; I have to click it, open the Start menu and then click in the search field
 again to get it to come up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, I think it's safe to say that the upgrade wasn't as smooth as I would like.&nbsp; Some of my file permissions didn't survive the trip (though&nbsp;the upgrade itself gave no indication that anything was wrong.)&nbsp; Obviously, there's still something that
 isn't quite right, but at least I feel that I've made some progress - as frustratingly slow as it has been.</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's interesting that the permissions didn't seem to be maintained following the upgrade. However, I did a clean install then attached my machine to our corporate domain and Cortana/searchui.exe stopped working. If I login with a local user account the search
 performs perfectly...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure your on the right lines though that it's a permissions issue which isn't allow searchui.exe to start or have access to any of the files it needs to index. I did check the index log though and it is showing a large number of files have been indexed
 - I just can't see the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

            This happened to me on two computers (and will probably happen on my third) after changing my Microsoft Account password. Despite telling Windows my new MS account Password, Cortana or regular Windows search still won't start and crashes out leaving similar
 event log entries.
