    <title>Mass Effect 3 Crash on Main Menu Xbox 1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mass Effect 3 Crash on Main Menu Xbox 1</h2>
                    <p>I remember&nbsp;this issue being prevalent back in the Xbox 360 days, but I can't remember how I got around it back then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essentially, whenever I start up ME3 I wait for it to go through all of the DLC checking and EA connecting and so forth. The main menu comes up and I am able to select between New Game, Load Game, Multiplayer, and Extras. If I take more than about 2 seconds to make a choice the game freezes consistently. If I choose quickly the game often freezes in the exact same way a few seconds into loading the content. I am installing the game from the disk, and the disk appears flawless and undamaged.&nbsp;I am the original owner, it was not bought secondhand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a problem anyone else has knowledge of? I have at least one friend who also experiences this issue on both the Xbox 360 and Xbox 1.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey there! I have never noticed this myself, its always worked well for me.</p><p>I would suggest trying to uninstall the game and reinstall it, this usually solves a few bugs within games and if your installing it from a disc first install it with the console Offline before going online to check for updates</p><p>Hope this Helps! If not don't hesitate to message!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now my windows is not activated, I have tried the troubleshooter but it doesn't seem to work. I cant find a way to activate the windows despite having a valid key</p>

            Hi  HaroonAhmad169
<br />I'm Wilfredo S an Independent Advisor
<br />
<br />If your license was pre-installed on your PC, when changing the motherboard you can not use the license on another motherboard. OEM licenses are integrated into the equipment that was purchased, if the equipment dies (or changes Motherboard), the license also dies.
<br />
<br />If your Windows edition is RETAIL, you can use the license for the activation of Windows 10, you must install Windows 10 on the new Motherboard, which is recommended to use the telephone activation, to guide you correctly with the installation
<br />
<br />Here are the phone numbers of Microsoft

            Hi HaroonAhmad169 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />1. If Windows was preinstalled i..e OEM version, then you can not use the license on another hardware. OEM license is tied to motherboard and if motherboard is changed, you can not reuse the same license on new motherboard.
<br />
<br />In this case, you need to buy a new license.
<br />
<br />2. But if it was Retail license, then you can follow the below process
<br />
<br />To Reactivate Windows 10 after a hardware change, refer to following Microsoft Help - 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />3. If above doesn't work, To analyze the cause, I need the screenshot of following output
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click on either Powershell (Admin) or Command Prompt (Admin) 
<br />Copy below and paste into Powershell / Cmd windows and Enter 
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Ho Haroon,
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence based on an OEM licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new Motherboard or PC, if it is OEM it will not . .. 
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence a Retail licence?

            It did come preinstalled on my PC but I've been upgrading it throughout and it was never deactivated. Well, The option did show up but as soon as I signed in, Windows got activated automatically.

</p><p>It came preinstalled. So not a retail license but I haven't had this problem before. I've upgraded my PC 3 times ever since I got it and 2 of the upgrades were the motherboard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Vijay,</p>
<p>I have the same problem as the original post.&nbsp; After reading your post above and following your suggestion, I decided to ask my question as a reply, hope that is ok.&nbsp; I have two computers now, both of which should be running fully legal and correct copies
 of Windows 10, but neither now are activated.&nbsp; I say your note here re: powershell, and I did copy &amp; paste the command you mentioned, what it gave me was:</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">Machine 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>HP Envy x360 notebook. &nbsp; I put my 1tb PNY CS1311 SSD in this laptop when I bought it 11/2017.&nbsp; Everything was always ok until recently, have running Windows 10 Pro x64 Insider
<span>in the Skip Ahead ring.&nbsp; Back in Nov/Dec 2018, laptop had water damage, sent it in for repair to HP (have their 3 yr care pack w/accidental damage).&nbsp; To send in, had to remove my SSD and reinstall another HDD, no problem.&nbsp; Got the laptop back in January
 2019 (!), they replaced system board, etc, and flashed to a bios (f.19) that virtually rendered my laptop useless due to serious problems with the graphics drivers and the Ryzen 5 2500u apu.&nbsp; So finally sent it back to be fixed again, so again removed SSD
 and put an HDD to send it to HP.&nbsp; Got it back yesterday finally, again they have changed the system board, RAM, battery, etc, and so when I try to reinstall my SSD with a fresh install of WIndows 10 Pro x64 build 1809 it now will not activate.&nbsp; Installed without
 entering a key since it always activated fine before.&nbsp; Gives me the 0xc003c004 error code.&nbsp; Tried troubleshooter many times, clciked on the hardware change link, and I do indeed see the machine listed in my devices, but when I select the device and hit activate
 it still says no.&nbsp; HP support via chat told me to do the "Reset my PC" recovery option, still no change.&nbsp; What should I do? &nbsp; I did notice that the visible portion of the product key as listed in Settings under activation (=same as in window pasted above 3V66T)
 is not the same as the key I get via Powershell command:&nbsp; </span></span><span><span><span>wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey
</span></span></span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Now for the other machine my desktop, had not been working (hardware failure) but because I was shipping off my laptop I went ahead and installed a new motherboard &amp; better apu.&nbsp; Same hdd's as before.&nbsp; = Same problem, exactly.&nbsp;
 Would not activate, would not allow me select it after doing the troubleshooter and clicking on the "changed hardware recently" link - despite showing up still in my Microsoft Account as a device and selecting the machine/trying to activate it that way.&nbsp; Can
 you please advise?&nbsp; Thank you very much for your time helping people here!</p>

&nbsp; The first troubleshooting option you can try is Microsoft's own Windows 10 Troubleshooter for Windows Update. In the Windows 10 Creators Update, you can find it in Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot, click Windows Update then click Run the
 troubleshooter.&nbsp;<br />
If you are running Windows 10 Anniversary Update or an earlier version of Windows, click Start, type: troubleshooting, hit Enter then launch the Windows Update troubleshooter.&nbsp;<br />
You can run the troubleshooter a couple times to see if it helps.&nbsp;<br />
<br />

</p><p>So my picture (The one below) was my gamerpic, and for some reason the enforcement team removed it and suspended me from changing it for a day. I went on the enforcement page to try and get it reviewed, but it said I am not eligible. I want my picture back
 and I don't believe it breaks any rules. How should I proceed?</p>

<h2>            Skype for Macbook air &#47;10.7.5</h2>
                    I am a frequent Skype user. Skype worked well on my MacBook Air (bought it 2012) - until last week. Now I get messages that my Mac OS X 10.7.5. is old&nbsp; and I should have 10.9. I find it unfair that I should have to buy a new computer, suppose that what
 it all mounts to.... There are friends and familiy with Macbook Pro who use even older programs together with Skype. What is your solution? Johanna

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to the Skype Community forum.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I do understand the inconvenience you have faced. But to be honest with you, the only other way to use Skype on your
</span>Mac OS X 10.7.5 is to update it to at least <span>
Mac OS X 10.9 or higher. Otherwise, using a <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10328/what-are-the-system-requirements-for-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
supported device</a> is an option. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Skype is always making improvements, such as enhanced quality, better reliability, and improved security. Because we want everyone to experience the best Skype has to offer, it's sometimes necessary to retire older versions of
 Skype, and Skype enabled devices. Unsupported Skype enabled devices, and platforms may experience problems with calls and chats, lost or dropped calls and instant messages, or could stop working completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please let us know if you have questions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Regards,</span></span></p>

                    <p>We are using Windows Live Hotmail as our email provider. &nbsp;We are receiving emails &amp; are able to read &amp; delete them but we are not able to forward or reply to any emails. &nbsp;We also cannot initiate a new email. &nbsp;When we hit the button to reply, forward or new
 the screen blinks &amp; we get a pop up message that Internet Explorer has stopped working. &nbsp;We then get another pop up that says "A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. &nbsp;Windows will close the program &amp; notify you if a solution is available."
 &nbsp;Then when you click on button "close program", it goes through the whole scenario again until everything shuts down. &nbsp;We have not been successful finding a POC for Windows Live Hotmail. &nbsp;Any suggestions from anyone?</p>

<p>
</p><p>For the fourth time I have gotten the error message Machine_Check_Error. &nbsp;I upgraded to Windows 10 3 or 4 months ago, but this just started happening in the last couple of weeks. &nbsp;It says that it will restart but just freezes there and I have to manually
 reboot the computer. &nbsp;It is a HP Model HPE-380t. &nbsp; How can I correct this?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before assisting further. I would like to ask you few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Did you make any system changes in the last couple of weeks that might result in the issue?</span></li><li><span>When exactly do you get the error message?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The <strong>MACHINE_CHECK_EXCEPTION</strong> error indicates a fatal machine check exception has occurred on the computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to boot your PC in
<strong>Safe mode</strong> by following the steps from the link below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Safe mode</span></strong><span> is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers necessary to run Windows.
 The words <strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear at the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Expand the options to boot into
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>:</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Reboot</span></strong><span> the PC to exit from
<strong>Safe mode</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To know more about
<strong>Safe mode, </strong>following is an article on <strong>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)

            Hello Martin,<br />
<br />
There is a neat utility called nircmd that lets you change your graphics resolution as well as do many more things using the command-line. Simply
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">download this executable</a> to "C:\windows" and then start command prompt by pressing winkey+r or clicking start and run or starting a new task in task manager. Once you have your command prompt opened, type
 in<br />
<br />
nircmd.exe setdisplay 1024 768 32<br />
<br />
and press enter.<br />
<br />
More information on this program is found <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Thank you but this doesnot resolve the problem. I possibly should have told you my font size is set to 200 and i need to reduce this. I tried to put the resolution but to 1280x800&nbsp; to compensate using this program and its still not quite there but cant go
 higher cause my screen/graphics card will not take it .</p>

            I see you have mentioned that it's so big that you cannot reach the apply button. If you could change the font size then pressing "enter" on your keyboard will have selected "OK" which is the same as pressing apply and saving. Could you tell me where you
 found out that your font size is 200? That way I can think of another way of setting it for you or find a registry key that has it set.
<br />
<br />
There is a key fontsize at HKEY_Current_User\console\<br />
On my computer its set blank. Although this might just be a font size for cmd.<br />
<br />
Another thing you might be able to try is to use a larger monitor or perhaps plug your Television in as a monitor. The TV might be wider than your screen's resolution and the extra cut-off area may be displayed.<br />
<br />

<h3> amieparker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start button doesn&#39;t bring up any apps or programs, and searching didn&#39;t work either on Windows 10 Computer.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 10 isn't working</p>
<p>It took me a while to realize that I was missing key features of Windows 10 - and it wasn't just that it was completely un-user friendly.</p>
<p>Long enough that I can't revert back to windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally, the problem was that the start button doesn't bring up any apps or programs, and searching didn't work either.&nbsp;&nbsp; I pinned all the exe files I use to the task bar to continue to function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now however, it's degenerated to the point where my administrator account is inaccessible.&nbsp; Upon login, it never loads - black screen.&nbsp; Other account load, and I can find some programs, but no apps on any of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried resetting my computer - keeping the files, and received an error message saying an error occurred, and no changes were made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade has rendered my computer virtually useless.&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I fix this and get going again??</p>

    <title>Project Scarlett Speculation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ambassador kingz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Project Scarlett Speculation</h2>
                    <p>I know there have been a few posts asking about hype or other areas on Project Scarlett but I've been thinking over some of the key announcement details given and have come up with a few ideas/areas of speculation.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>It was announced that Project Scarlett would be able to play any Xbox One game ever. (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/18/xbox-project-scarlett-to-support-4-generations-of-games-e3-2019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/18/xbox-project-scarlett-to-support-4-generations-of-games-e3-2019</a>)<br />
<br />
If this is the case would that mean Project Scarlett has Kinect compatibility or even a new motion tracking system on the way?
<p>
</p></li><li>
<p>Project Scarlett will support the last 3 generations of consoles plus the announcement of Game Pass Ultimate/Game Pass PC
<br />
<br />
In this case we could expect more total coverage of the game selection coming to not only Xbox/Project Scarlett but the PC selection as well. Would this then cause a greater push for cross-play and/or cross-progression type games and could Microsoft make a
 push for such with its first party developers or partnerships? Bonus thought, could Microsoft develop software to bridge those capabilities for developers?<br />
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Several of the games announced at this years E3 were pushed to 2020 or late 2019 and Scarlett has a tentative Holiday 2020<br />
<br />
With this in mind couldn't we expect to see similar game releases as we have with the Xbox 360 to Xbox One? Meaning, we'd have an Xbox One version of CyberPunk 2077 and an Xbox Scarlett version. But, if they're going to support full backwards compatibility
 would you need to buy a different version or are we looking at a future where you pay for 4/8K textures as an add-on to your games that came out for last gen instead of buying the whole game again?</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>These are just a few of the ideas that ran through my head. I thought it would be fun to share and see what everyone else thoughts were on this. If you have any of your own speculations feel free to share!</p>

<p>I agree, I think the new console will be an awesome addition. I do think they should be careful on the support for&nbsp;<span>the last 3 generations of consoles games.&nbsp;Don't get me wrong, I would love to have this feature, but
 if it takes away from&nbsp;performance, I can do without.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As for the Kinect&nbsp;support, I thought Microsoft was not going to&nbsp;develop kinects anymore, since they were not selling.. I could be wrong.. I&nbsp;personally&nbsp;like them, it adds to the fun factor. I wish my current once had
 a zoom&nbsp;feature.. :(&nbsp;</span></p>

            I read there will be two project scarlets.&nbsp; One with a disc drive and one without.&nbsp; The all digital version will be called anaconda and the price will be much lower.&nbsp; Also they want all xb1 games to be playable but it all comes down to licenses.&nbsp; Why the
 second console will be called anaconda not very sure, kind of weird but thats one rumor online.

<p>As of this point I'm already in a mode where I'm expecting between £500-600 price point on release &amp; preparing for that eventuality, that way I can save enough that it's not going to be a really sore one on release day!&nbsp; The specs as given so far are intriguing,
 from an engineering standpoint I'm interested to see how using the SSD as virtual ram will work out, the 8K side of things doesn't really bother me (I'm still not on 4k yet!) but the backwards compatibility part does interest me a lot as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all it's a moderate upgrade for me as the owner of an X as opposed to the giant upgrade it has been in the past - however the proof of the pudding will be in the cost.&nbsp; If they announce at roughly in line with X on release day it'll be more acceptable,
 if they announce above what I'm expecting my guess is it's going to be difficult to come back from that as anything over the £600 mark and well, you're into PC territory!</p>

            I think the game options would come down to what the dev's have agreed to. I'm not sure how that's gonna work. I can't see them bringing back the Kinect.. I mean it would be cool but unlikely I think&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I think that's why having Jason Ronald and Bill Stillwell stating the focus is to bring every Xbox One game ever to the next generation is a really interesting statement. (Linked the article I found in OP.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>@Albert X @Koods</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure everyone is wondering what the price point will be. I've personally just started saving with the expectation of $400-600 range. I really hope they put some effort into year one bundles or even limited editions but that's pretty rare in early cycles.</p>

<h2>            Trying to get 3ds max 2009 work in windows 7</h2>
                    Hi, I have a 13" mac pro, I recently just installed windows 7 professional on the boot camp. I followed instructions about boot camp, and installed the drivers from mac install DVD, and I updated windows, too.&nbsp; Everything is fine except I can't use 3ds
 max 2009. It won't show the view ports, so I can't see what I am drawing. I suppose it's the graphic driver problem? So, please, help me out!

            Hi Claudio, I would wait for a couple of days . . .
<br />
<br />A new version of Windows 10 is being released at the moment (1803) 
<br />
<br />That is not yet available on the Microsoft Website just yet, but will be shortly 
<br />
<br />Your best option is to wait on that release and install that, rather than having to go through the whole process twice, wasting your time and data . . .

            Go into Update History. We need to know the FULL and EXACT error message text and error code. You will probably have to resolve those error codes before you can install 1803.

<h2>            Lexar FlashDrive 16GB</h2>
                    
<p>I have issues with keeping my games organized. &nbsp;I have a ton of flash drives 8GB ones. &nbsp;I also have a 16GB one for awhile. &nbsp;I found a 16GB Lexar Twist drive at Target for $7.99. &nbsp;I moved a ton of stuff by copying it and it seemed OK until I shut the system
 down. &nbsp;Everything was gone so I reformatted it and tried transferring the data. &nbsp;It worked for a few days then boom it was all gone. &nbsp;I lost a lot of saves but not too many. &nbsp;I have them backed up on the cloud and other flash drives. &nbsp;Does anyone know if there
 are any issues with that drive? &nbsp;</p>

<p>I'd suspect the drive as well. Some brands, such as PNY, even if they pass the compatibility test just don't get on with the 360.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The two I use are an old 4gb HP USB stick, which gets me a warning that it doesn't meet the speed requirements but I can use it anyway if I want, and a Sandisk 32gb drive.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Since Sandisk make the official Microsoft USB stick it is a fairly safe bet that their products are going to give the least problems.</p>

<p>It's nice that they now allow you to use 32gb of space on a USB drive. I guess with them dropping the 20, 60, and 120gb hard drive allowing more space on a USB drive wasn't going to impact their sales.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 , I have the location feature enabled so I can get local weather information from the default metro weather app. But I have seen the location symbol appear at some odd time like when I am doing nothing on my laptop and when I open up iTunes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to find out which application is trying to find out what my location is ?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the location service is on, Windows, apps and services can use your location, but you can still turn off location for specific apps. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>Location </strong>and select <strong>Location privacy settings</strong>.</li><li>Scroll down and you will find the apps that uses your location under <strong>
Choose apps that can use your precise location</strong>.</li><li>Here you can specify which app can use your precise location by toggling the option
<strong>On </strong>and <strong>Off</strong>.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know if you need any other assistance. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Is it possible to get the Charms bar back in Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> judaz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to get the Charms bar back in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to turn of the Activity field in Windows 10 and replace it with the much more useful Charms bar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it at least an option to turn on the charms bar for a more effective use of the computer, or are you ignoring all people that actually like Windows 8, and ignoring tablet users with windows 10 ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a tablet specially the Charms bar is really useful, I cant use Windows without it on a 8" tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a great tool, just because some don't understand it or don't use it does not mean all agree. I use it all the time

<p>Is it possible to turn of the Activity field in Windows 10 and replace it with the much more useful Charms bar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it at least an option to turn on the charms bar for a more effective use of the computer, or are you ignoring all people that actually like Windows 8, and ignoring tablet users with windows 10 ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a tablet specially the Charms bar is really useful, I cant use Windows without it on a 8" tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a great tool, just because some don't understand it or don't use it does not mean all agree. I use it all the time

<p><strong>I'm pretty sure the Charms Bar isn't included in Windows 10. It's in Windows 8 and 8.1 but i find it pretty annoying to be honest.</strong></p>

            <p>Thank you , I 'm well aware that I can continue using Windows 8.1, of course I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just find it strange that Microsoft is ignoring Tablet users completely with Windows 10 and basically releasing Windows 7 again, but with ugly hamburger menus and Cortana added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People fond of the past and start menus can continue to use windows 7 until&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">January 14, 2020 as well, not really the point.&nbsp;</span>Why not add the option to have the charms bar if we want to ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a really useful tool to do fast and easy changes, to share a screen, to change settings and most of all on a small tablet reach the start button. On smaller tablets the start button usually is placed in a strange place and not at all convenient, in
 those cases the Charms bar really is useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I take it that the answer to the question "Should I upgrade to Windows 10?" is officially from Microsoft : If you like Windows 8.1, &nbsp;No &nbsp;don't do it?</p>

            <p>I use tablet with 8.1 and find the charms bar really useful.</p>
<p>Easy to quickly play something to devices (Xbox), to print or projector, share and even get to settings easily.
</p>
<p>If win 10 has an easy way to do these things then great, if not then its a step back for tablet users.</p>
<p>Also, I'm quite happy with 8.1 on my laptop too (needs a start menu that's all.</p>
<p>Saying that win 10 is awesome on desktop.</p>

            <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the charms bar also&nbsp;very helpful. Now with Windows 10 I have to use both hands where I needed only&nbsp;one in Windows 8. Of course I could stay with Windows&nbsp;8 on my tablet, but then I could also stay with Windows 7 on my desktop. There is no need for
 Windows 10 to exist. Yes, it is a nice face lift, but no more. on tablets it is a step backward. It looks now like Android and I switched from Android for many reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings fellow Windows user!</p>

            <p>I too liked alot of the slide in menu's and thought it was perfect for tablets. Windows ten now neglects tablets users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the simple screen brightness slider is gone. Replaced withe preset high, medium and low. Long press only reveals at link to settings. So dumb. It should be long press to reveal the slider in tablet mode. Now I've got to wait for settings to open, then with
 a big white page glaring at me, I navigate to the slider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tablet mode is a joke in windows 10. Ok let me tap on the tiny taskbar icons for things.... who designed this junk for tablet mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>log in is not allowing me to use my pin, even though it is set for the pin. Half the time the keyboard never recognizes I've tapped into the login field.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the new wonder of the edge browser lacks all the slick modern ie 11 UI. Web pages had great sliding menus and articles could be placed in to reading mode with one tap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tablet mode in windows 10, should just be windows 8.1. </p>
<p>so back to windows 8.1 I go with my ThinkPad tablet.</p>

            I think&nbsp;I might&nbsp;be going back to 8.1. The multi tasking is longwinded and clunky, the 'play to' function only works from file explorer. Theres no Skype app just a fake app that links to website to download Skype for desktop. Windows 10 feels rushed or
 unfinished, and seems like its just windows 7, less than windows 8.1

            <p>It's not just tablet users that found it useful.&nbsp; It makes no sense to me that they removed it entirely instead of simply making it optional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then again they made a lot of concessions when they gave into the start menu whiners at the expense of the new customers they had finally convinced to give them another chance.&nbsp;
