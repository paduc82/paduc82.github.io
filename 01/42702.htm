<h2>            Multiple Error code issues</h2>
                    
<p>Okay so my xbox&nbsp;slim has been working fine for the past couple months and all of a sudden I have been having issues with the xbox live market place. I first found out about my problem when I tried to get the new Black Ops 2 dlc and it came up with an error.
 But now I have mutiple errors and its getting old. So i'll list them all now:</p>
<p>1) Status Code: 8015000a-00b96084-1ed9e66e</p>
<p>This one comes when I attempt to access my account settings</p>

<p>2) Status Code:&nbsp;3F4A - 0000 - D080 - 0200 - 8007 - 2F76</p>
<p>This one comes when I attempt to update my netflix app</p>

<p>3) Status Code: 8007000B</p>
<p>This one comes when I attempt to download the new Revolution dlc off the store in Black Ops 2</p>

<p>4) Advertisements on the dashboard are greyed out, and I can't watch any videos on xbox live<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can tell you that I have removed my harddrive's, I have erased all system caches and marketplace temporary files, I have restarted my modem and router multiple times. So if you guys can help me that would be great. Thanks.</p>

    <title>Driver Related Issues Regarding and Using Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kennethsmith715  say:</h3>
<h2>            Driver Related Issues Regarding and Using Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>One major problem I have found over the years is Driver related issues when upgrading an older device to a new Operating System.</p>
<p>With Windows 10 upgrade, from a PC Laptop already having Windows 8.1 installed, this has caused this IT professional many headaches; not with just my own PC but others as well, and different manufacturers.</p>
<p>My Display Adapter is an Intel HD Graphics 4600 driver.</p>
<p>Several times Windows 10 has attempted to download and install the latest driver software, dated July 2015 after the 1st release of Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Things ran smooth for a time until the 1511 version of Windows 10 rolled out in November.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The odd thing though is that the upgraded driver now only has compatibility issues with some in-store apps. And other apps are fine. I've since had to roll back my driver to Driver Date 9/16/2013,(pre Windows 8 release) Version 10.18.10.3308 to get some
 apps to function properly.</p>
<p>Disabling the driver of course is not an option.</p>
<p>Upgrading as I said is not an option, although without the upgrade, then other in-store apps do not work.</p>
<p>I have chosen to run a Troubleshooting Pack Cabinet called wushowhide ,diagcab and keep those driver downloads from occurring automatically for the time being.</p>
<p>Personally and professionally it is my opinion that there needs to be a better solution to this problem.</p>
<p>New devices put on the market when a new OS is released have no compatibility issues; so why should a device, that is only one OS prior to the new one, so difficult to get to function properly?</p>
<p>If companies such as HP, Toshiba, Aspire, or Dell manufacture PC's and or tablets with the new OS pre-installed, why does it take a milennium for these manufacturers to upgrade, patch and fix issues with older devices?</p>
<p>Again, all I can do myself and for those whom I assist with troubleshooting, is to inform users to keep checking back in support websites with their device manufacturers regarding the latest updates. Hopefully, soon since the release of 1511, for me Toshiba
 will catch up to present time.</p>

<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026956/windows-change-screen-resolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi Lilina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the frustration, when you are unable to login to access your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cause for this issue could be a third party conflict. To isolate the issue I suggest you to follow the below methods, and check if it helps to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to boot the computer in safe mode by following the below steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Safe Mode is a special way for Windows to load when there is a system-critical problem that interferes with the normal operation of Windows. The purpose of Safe Mode is to allow you to troubleshoot Windows and try to determine what is causing
 it to not function correctly. Once you have corrected the problem, then you can reboot and Windows will load normally.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Use Win + R to pull up the Run dialog box, and type msconfig.exe. This will launch the System Configuration Utility.</li><li>In the Utility, click the <em><span>Boot</span></em> tab and under
<em><span>Boot options</span></em>, check the
<em><span>Safe boot</span></em> box. Hit
<em><span>OK</span></em> when done.</li><li>You will be asked to reboot your computer. The next boot will put your machine into Safe Mode.</li></ol>
<p><span>If the error doesn’t appear in Safe mode, then put the computer into clean boot state and then try to eliminate the error.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow method 2 to perform a clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows
 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the link below to perform clean boot.</span></p>
<p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot" under more information to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get back to us with the result, we will be glad to help you further.</p>

            You need to use a tool such as Rufus, learn how:

            Hi Arthur, if you already have the ISO, click the link below to download Windows USB DVD Download Tool
<br />
<br />It is a very reliable utility to create bootable media from the Windows 10 ISO
<br />
<br /><a href="https://wudt.codeplex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://wudt.codeplex.com/</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If you do not already have the ISO:
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool

<h2>            Windows 10 installation usb not recognized by computer</h2>
                    <p>I've just built a new PC and bought a retail copy of Windows 10, but when I go to do a fresh install of Windows (I'm reusing an old ssd), the installation usb isn't recognised by the computer. My usb ports themselves are working fine, they work with my keyboard,
 mouse and other usb drives, but my official Windows 10 installation usb doesn't do anything.</p>
<p>I don't know if I'm missing something obvious or I just manage to buy a non functioning Win 10 usb.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that there is a problem with the USB since other USB drives are working fine. To assist you with your concern, we suggest that you download the
<strong>Media creation tool</strong> on a working computer <strong>to create an installation media.
</strong>You can refer to this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> for reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>I've tried to create an installation usb twice now. My computer can recognise that there's a usb drive there but gives me the an error message that there is no operating system on the drive and to press any key to restart the system.</p>
<p>So I guess I'm one step forward, but not at the finish line yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: Back to the starting line. I had a BSOD while trying for a third time, this time trying to download an iso and now the media creation tool won't even run. It gives me an error telling me to restart my computer and try again, which I have with no success.
 I've also tried redownloading the creation tool which didn't help either.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guessing that your machine is mostly current hardware... in particular the motherboard...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Newer motherboards are UEFI Bios capable and may be configured that way by default... How you install Win 8-10 varies by whether the motherboard is set for UEFI or Legacy, and also how the flash drive and SSD are configured...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect your used SSD may be formatted as a MBR drive... If so, it will not work on UEFI BIOS... It needs to have everything deleted and initialized as a GPT drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The flash drive you purchased should be compatible with UEFI Bios, but again there may be a trick involved... Selecting it as a boot device in Bios may not be good enough...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to select your machines Boot Options at Startup with F2, F9, F11, F12, ESC, DEL, or whatever it uses...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The flash drive may be listed twice... Once as a Flash Drive, and again as a UEFI Flash Drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think you have gotten far enough to get to the point you may get an error concerning how your SSD is formatted...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were to decide to not use UEFI Bios, but Legacy, you would need to select just the Flash Drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you select the wrong type of flash drive for the way the machine is setup or the Flash Drive is formatted, you will in fact get boot errors...</p>

<p>Yeah, I've got new hardwear, an i7 7700k on an Asus strix z270e mobo. The bios default mode was "other OS" and before the media creation tool stopped running for me I had tried both "other OS" and the uefi options. Both reported no operating system on the
 flash drive created with the media creation tool and neither recognised that the original usb installer I bought was even plugged into the computer.</p>

    <title>Major Video Hitching Issue across multiple apps Including Flagship - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Major Video Hitching Issue across multiple apps Including Flagship Movies &#38;amp&#59; TV app on Xbox one </h2>
                    
<p>There is a major hitching issue on multiple video apps across xbox one. &nbsp; Netflix appears to be fine, but the Movies &amp; TV app, Hulu and Media Player seems to have video hitching issues. &nbsp; Watch as your video moves or pans you'll notice split second pauses
 in motion. &nbsp; This has nothing to do with your internet speed.</p>
<p>This has been tested on multiple ISPs, &nbsp;xbox one consoles and videos. &nbsp;The easiest and variable free test is using the Movies &amp; TV app on a windows machine vs the xbox one using the same video. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It was reported during the beta by several users but has yet to be fixed.</p>
<p>My sources indicate a news story from a reputable 3rd party might be running soon on this issue. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Getting error message &#34;Task Scheduler service is not available.  Task Scheduler will attempt to reconnect to it.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Task Scheduler Corrupt?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a new computer (two months old) that runs Windows 7 Professional (64-bit), and, after customizing it a bit to suit my needs, I'm now having a bit of trouble with the Task Scheduler. I do NOT get error messages when I open it; and, according to the
 Task Status list (in the middle pane), it SAYS it's performing the tasks successfully. And I even see the hard drive's little red light blinking when a scheduled task is being performed. But I can't be sure the tasks are really being performed -- b/c the one
 I care about the most (the automatic creation of System Restore Points) doesn't seem to be working: When I run the System Restore GUI, none of the new System Restore Points allegedly "created successfully" by the Task Scheduler are listed -- just the ones
 I'd made manually. I downloaded a (great) 3rd-party Restore Point creator that does this task for me automatically, but I'd still like to get to the root of my Task Scheduler problem. Among its errors:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) When I click on Display All Running Tasks in the far right pane of Task Scheduler, I get the message, "Task Scheduler service is not available.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Task Scheduler will attempt to reconnect to it."</p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>Task Scheduler will attempt to reconnect to it."</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) When I click on certain individual tasks in the Task Scheduler Library (far left pane), I often get a blank screen in the middle pane, where the detailed data should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried numerous solutions proposed online, including deleting certain files lists in the registry. On my computer, the key at:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache\Tasks</p>
<p>lists 94 Tasks (!)...</p>
<p>and the key at </p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache\Tree</p>
<p>lists 23 tree files.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But none of my attempted "fixes" corrects the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read about five dozen online tech board entrees about this, and still can't figure it out; and I've been on the phone with Microsoft three times, and they, too, are clueless about it. Meantime, I don't have any System Restore Points from before the
 problem began. Ordinarily, I'd just reinstall Task Scheduler from a distribution disk -- or from my wife's computer, which also runs Windows 7 Professional -- but Task Scheduler isn't a stand-alone file that can be copied -- it's a "snap-in" for the Microsoft
 Management Console (MMC). So I don't know how to replace it.</p>
<p>Finally -- if it's any clue -- the problem seemed to have started around the time I installed Microsoft Security Essentials (which I have since removed), which was also the time I backed up my entire computer onto an external drive.
</p>
<p>So...any suggestions/responses to the above? </p>

<p><br />
Method 1: All options for Task Scheduler on System Services are grayed out on my computer. A Microsoft phone tech told me that's normal, and I've read others online who say their options are grayed-out, too. But the GUI says the service has started, and it's
 on automatic. Meantime, I tried a clean boot, and it didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method Two: I've tried System File Checker scan several times, and come up clean every time -- no integrity violations.</p>

</p><p><strong>a:</strong> Try starting Task Scheduler from the command line:<br />
Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
<strong>b:</strong> Click <strong>'Run as Administrator'</strong><br />
At the Command Prompt, type: <strong>net start task scheduler </strong>and hit enter.

            <p>Hi,&nbsp; Jessen.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried what you suggested and it changed nothing. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to seem ungrateful for the attention you've given my issue here, but it seems you keep asking me to perform these small executions without explaining the rationale behind them. (Why, for example, would opening Explorer through Task Manager help
 my issue with Task Scheduler? I don't see the connection.) </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, here's the basic problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>--My Task Scheduler seems to perform some Windows tasks successfully, and bomb on others.</p>
<p>I've scanned my system repeatedly, and it shows no integrity violations;</p>
<p>--All of my permissions seem to check out OK (at least to the best of my knowledge)</p>
<p>--None of the tasks seems to be corrupt (though I can't be sure if Microsoft Security Essentials has somehow interfered with Task Scheduler's operation -- I uninstalled it and the problem persisted, so I reinstalled it).</p>
<p>--When I press the "Display All Running Tasks" button, I get the message "Task Scheduler service is not available. Task Scheduler will attempt to reconnect to it."</p>
<p>--And "Task Scheduler" seems to be running fine in Windows Services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be that my Task Scheduler snap-in is corrupt, and if so, how do I replace it?<br />
<br />

 the malware’s dll file is a scheduled task is actually “good news”, because it means that you don’t have to edit your registry, or use Autoruns, or uninstall/reinstall any program in order to remove the error message – all you have to do is delete the BackgroundContainer
 scheduled task. I originally used a link for the removal procedure because that’s where you’ll also find the “authorization” and testimonials for the procedure. So here’s the proof that this procedure will work:</font></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 pro COA with xp downgrade</h2>
                    <p>My son had a serious problem with his HP Pro 3010 MT PC which had previously been happily running windows 7, so he used the restore partition to get his pc running again.</p>
<p>Somehow he's ended up restoring the pc but now its running windows XP, there is no option to restore to restore to windows 7. Whether he selected the wrong option when he first did it I don't know?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a Genuine COA on the HP case which states "Windows 7 Pro OA HP" and the code, I've also burned a windows 7 installation DVD but don't want to overwrite the hard drive with xp on it if the code isn't going to work. I have read on the internet that
 the codes from HP don't work with Microsoft install disks only HP disks, is this true?</p>

            <p>as usual on these things people were missing the point in my first post and latching on to unimportant details.&nbsp; I believe you can't use MS installation disks with the codes on HP COA stickers. Luckily we use HP computers at work, I borrowed some HP Windows
 7 Pro installation disks from IT tried a couple and was able to reinstall Windows 7 Pro and get the PC pack to how it originally was. I've not needed to enter the code at any stage and have had no problems with the computer in the past 4 months.</p>

<blockquote>How can you record DVD movies onto the computer so I can watch them later without using the DVD disc?</blockquote>
=================================<br />
Be aware that copying commercial DVDs is illegal.<br />
<br />
You need the Video_TS folder from the DVD.<br />
<br />
If this is a commercial DVD with copy protection you will <br />
have to rip the DVD...you can find software on the net that <br />
will do that. <br />
<br />
Once you have the VIDEO_TS folder saved on your hard <br />
drive...you can play it with the free VLC Media Player.<br />
<br />
VLC Media Player<br />
<a href="http://www.videolan.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videolan.org/</a><br />
<br />
Once you have VLC Media Player installed...open it and<br />
go to...Media / Advanced Open File / Disc tab / tick DVD / <br />
Browse to the VIDEO_TS folder / OK / Play.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10. Cannot download mail app</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10. Toshiba laptop. Mail would not start. Clicking on the mail app icon caused the program to flash on the screen , then go away. So I removed the mail app. Rebooted the system,&nbsp;then tried to download and reinstall it.</p>
<p>But when I go the Microsoft store and click on the mail app download button again I just see a screen flash then it goes away and I do not have anything downloaded.</p>
<p>Also now I find that when I click on the Microsoft store Icon I see the edge screen flash then go away. So the store Icon no longer works.. What is wrong?</p>

<h2>            &#34;Access is denied&#34; - Again&#33;  &#58;&#40;</h2>
                    <p>A very long story over 14 days with HP support on how to install the software for my HP 4050 scanner -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Their final suggestion - re-format my hard drive and install the software.&nbsp; That's NOT going to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Used scanner about a year ago and not since.&nbsp; Unpacked it, set it up and the software would not recognize the scanner.&nbsp; Scanner works from native MS scanner found in Printers/Devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Un-installed the HP program and tried to set up using the G4050 CD - get "access is denied" error.&nbsp; Downloaded the file from HP - same result, "access is denied".&nbsp; I CAN run other HP files - just the scanner files are a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed through several suggestions about changing settings in regedit - still get error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ONLY files this comes up with are the HP scanner files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. - jb</p>

<p>A very long story over 14 days with HP support on how to install the software for my HP 4050 scanner -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Their final suggestion - re-format my hard drive and install the software.&nbsp; That's NOT going to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Used scanner about a year ago and not since.&nbsp; Unpacked it, set it up and the software would not recognize the scanner.&nbsp; Scanner works from native MS scanner found in Printers/Devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Un-installed the HP program and tried to set up using the G4050 CD - get "access is denied" error.&nbsp; Downloaded the file from HP - same result, "access is denied".&nbsp; I CAN run other HP files - just the scanner files are a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed through several suggestions about changing settings in regedit - still get error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ONLY files this comes up with are the HP scanner files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. - jb</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>OK, I think first you will need to make sure that your system is clean.</p>
<p>I highly recommend to perform scan using: Malwarebytes and superantispyware</p>
<p>https://www.malwarebytes.org/</p>
<p>http://www.superantispyware.com/</p>
<p>
</p><p>and I also recommend Avast Free anti virus. Please consider to install it instead of bitdefender.</p>
<p>http://www.avast.com/en-gb/index</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that scan also using Hitman pro http://www.surfright.nl/en/products/</p>
<p>No installation required and remove anything it finds using trial license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, After you did above steps, consider running CCleaner to get rid of junk files only</p>
<p>http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/builds</p>
<p>Download portable version so no installation required!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that your system is clean repeat above solutions again. (e.g. the fix it tools and my other reply)</p>
<p>See if it make any difference?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it did not,Consider or try creating New Admin user account and try installing there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also highly recommend to run System File Checker through cmd by running it as admin then type
</p>
<p>sfc /scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
Consider performing clean boot
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796/en-gb</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After performing clean boot which involves disabling all start up programs and NONE-Windows Services through msconfig, try installing the software&nbsp;again. If problem resolved then you will need to find out which program or service is causing the problem by
 re enabling them again.</p>

<h2>            Atheros AR9002WB-1NG adapter update driver error in windows 10</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>I upgraded my Toshiba Satellite laptop from win 7 to win 10 last year. Everything
 was fine but now my internet stopped working. It shows limited access and when I run diagnostic IT shows the error "Problem with driver of wifi adapter". I have qualcomm atheros ar9002wb-1ng wireless network adapter and when I update It says driver is updated
 but internet still does not work. I have uninstalled drivers, rebooted system, ran drivers in compatibility mode but nothing works. I also ran microsoft troubleshooter and it gives the error number 68309.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Kindly help me out.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for reading.</span></p>

<p>I went to turn on my xbox and it will turn on but my tv says no signal. There is no red ring, the plugs in the xbox (and TV) are in all the way. The controller wont connect to the console, and the RPM's will b normal for about 2 1/2 seconds before it increases
 for a short (.4 milli-seconds, yeah, that short) and the no signal will go away during that and then return and continue. This has never happened before and i tried restarting it several times now. So what should i do because my warranty ended 1/20/10. SO....
 can some plz help? THX!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wow! Yeah a year and no answer. Thats crazy LOL Anyways it kinda sounds like a E74 error which I beleive was the graffics card issue. No warrenty? You can still send it in and I think they charge 100 or 150 to fix anything not under warranty on the Xboxes.
 I may be wrong though :-)</p>

<p>I agree 100% I think this is one of the things that the old Ghost Recon games was already using in many ways. The campaign in Future Soldier is extremely linear and static. The core gameplay is awesome but the play space is lacking what previous titles mastered.</p>

<p>I love it and hope something comes of it. &nbsp;Spooking wild life to give away your position.............uhhh Yes Please! &nbsp;I never thought of that before, very cool. &nbsp;The issue with the gaming industry today is it wants to cater to all gamers, which is fine
 but when you keep producing 'run of the mill' games it tends to get old very quick. &nbsp;But the reality of the matter is one game that I like might be disliked by another vice versa so hopefully this is offered to those who are interested.</p>

<p>Sorry I did not mean to come off as a jerk.......</p>
<p>I agree with the maps and environment of that new game, but how ever I do not like FPS so I would not be interested in this.</p>
<p>Making maps and environments like that would be great but lets face it, ghost recon has the tactics of the game right.</p>
<p>GRFS can use bigger maps like the DLC has but other than that I don't really play shooters &nbsp;because they bore me.</p>
<p>But Ghost Recon Future Soldier &nbsp;has me hooked like crack... =) </p>
