    <title>Admin status - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barb morris  say:</h3>
<h2>            Admin status</h2>
                    <p>This question is for Windows 10. Before the upgrade, I was shown as the admin on users when you log in, I was trying to download photos to a file. First it said I couldn't down load to that file, then it said I needed admin approval. I am the only user on
 this computer. How do I get recognized as the administrator again?</p>
<p>While trying to set up Corcana it kept asking for an older password. Someone figured out it was the pw for logging onto the computer. My name had nothing to do with any program installed in W-7.&nbsp; Do I have to turn off the computer and log back on w/my Microsoft
 pass word? </p>
<p>When I first updated to W10, it said welcome! you will be able to manage things much easier. Now I can't find the freakin' start button, can't find where to ensure I am the Admin, and worst of all I can't load pictures anywhere!</p>
<p>Please help!!!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>R </strong></p>
<p>Type <strong>control userpasswords2 </strong>and press <strong>OK</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Check what type of user account is create. Is it a local or administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the user account is already an admin account, run the following command to enable hidden admin account and then check the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong> and click<strong> Command Prompt (Admin)</strong></p>
<p>Type the following command and press <strong>Enter</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>net user administrator /active:yes</strong></span></p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply, but this did not fix my problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did the first part:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;"I would suggest you to first check if you have the Administrator privileges on the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>R </strong></p>
<p>Type <strong>control userpasswords2 </strong>and press <strong>OK</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Check what type of user account is create. Is it a local or administrator." My account did say administrator, which surprised me because no where else on the computer does it say Admin by my name.&nbsp; Except where I wrote it in myself when I first set up my
 account.&nbsp; My husband was the only admin, and he passed away two years ago. I knew his password and was able to get in and disable it, and then removed his user account completely.&nbsp; Now this built in admin just showed up on the sign in screen one day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second part is where I had trouble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong> and click<strong> Command Prompt (Admin)</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>To disable it add "no" at the end of the command.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When I selected Command Prompt (Admin) the window that opened already had something written on it that I can't remember exactly, except it referenced Program Files 32X.&nbsp; But I typed in what you said and it basically came back with an error and said
 I should go to the Control Panel and change the user accounts there. And of course that didn't work.</span></p>

    <title>Calendar app on Windows 8&#47;8.1 is missing appointments which are - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darren45  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calendar app on Windows 8&#47;8.1 is missing appointments which are older than 3 months</h2>
                    <p>Hopefully someone can help me here. I have an Outlook.com email address and I also use the calendar on Outlook.com. This way I have it on the web at
<a href="http://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.outlook.com</a> and have the calendar synced to my Windows 8.1 laptop through the Calendar app on my Start Screen.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, in the Calendar app on Windows 8.1, I wanted to have a look at some appointments which happened in May and June this year, so I navigated to those months only to find all of&nbsp;the appointments missing. The only appointments visible were&nbsp;the ones&nbsp;which
 occur every week. All other appointments are missing. I have looked through my calendar and it seems the Calendar app on Windows 8.1 is only syncing appointments from 3 months ago to present. Anything older than 3 months is not visible.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If I go to <a href="http://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.outlook.com</a> and view my calendar from within there, all of my appointments show, but the app is only showing 3 months, which is&nbsp;no use to me. If anybody could help, that would be much appreciated.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Thanks for your help, although the issue still remains. Are you able to confirm whether this is normal in the Windows 8/8.1 app, as I see other people have had this. Does the Windows calendar app only hold appointments for the last 3 months by default,
 unless they are recurring?<br />

<p>I am getting this as well. &nbsp;Any manually input appointments are disappearing on the app after 3 months. &nbsp;If I login to outlook.com through my browser and go to calendar the older appointments are there. This leads me to believe it's an app setting but I
 can't find this within the app anywhere?</p>

            <p>Yep, I have come to the conclusion it is the same for everyone who is looking at their calendar in the Calendar app. I think most people don't know of this limitation, but when they need to check when a previous doctors appointment was for example, like
 I did, if it was more than 3 months ago you would not see it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution is to go onto Outlook.com, like you said, where all appointments show,&nbsp;however you can't perform a search. Or like I do now, is just share the calendar and have it open in Thunderbird or Outlook for example, and you can search for appointments
 from within that program.</p>

            <p>I've been using the Win 8.1 calendar app now for a few months. And just realized that I can't see any events older than three months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This "feature" makes the calendar app unusable! I've been a Win 8 advocate for a few months now, but I'm turning back. I see comments about this dating back months, and while it's probably one of the easiest things to fix, nothing is done with it. Even worse,
 MS employees here don't even seem to know that this is a "feature" of the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on, a calendar is one's memory. Important notes are stored with appointments and I regularly need to go back there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also switched to a windows phone about a month ago and my appointments are gone from there as well. Unusable!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My data is mine! Don't remove it without my explicit consent. There is no setting, nothing to indicate that I have requested you to delete my appointments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see any reason, any reason _at all_, to not keep data like this on the device indefinitely. This goes for both the Metro app /and/ the Windows Phone app.</p>

            <p>Yep, it is frustrating that Microsoft don't wish to sort this out. Just so others know, I'm running the Windows Phone 8.1 Developer Preview, with the new Calendar (week view etc) and unfortunately that still only shows the last few weeks of appointments.
 I was hoping WP8.1 would get this sorted, but unfortunately not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Roel, your calendar appointments never get removed, which is one good thing I suppose. If you visit Outlook.com or load your calendar in Thunderbird, you will see all of your appointments (even from years ago in the past, if you were using it back then).
 If you have Office like I do, you can load your calendar in Microsoft Outlook and view, search and create appointments. Just a shame no native built in app in either Windows 8.1 or Windows Phone has this capability. Thanks for replying, the more people that
 mention this, the more chance Microsoft might get this sorted :)</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply Darren.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that the appointments don't get deleted from MS's online services, but they do get deleted from my device(s). And that bothers me. I don't want to be dependent on the availability of online services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't make sense (at all). How did a software engineer come up with the need to remove these? Let's assume that storage of these entries is done in a sane way and indexed on date. Now displaying a day, month or year has time complexity N' * O(N) with
 N being the number of stored appointments and N' being the number appointments to be displayed. Clearly, it doesn't matter how many events are stored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the amount of storage. Let's say a real power user has 10 appointments per day, each day, from the age of 15 up to 80, or 75 years. And all those events need to be stored. This is way above average, but let's just calculate this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A single event compromises of:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start date/time/tz: 7 bytes (this can probably be taken down to 4 to 5 bytes as we only need minute-precision, but let's be easy on the programmer)</p>
<p>End date/time/tz or "full day" flag: either 7 bytes or 1 bit (in which case the start date only needs day-precision, but hey, easy on the programmer again)</p>
<p>Status: a few bits</p>
<p>Description, location, etc: average of 50 bytes per appointment</p>
<p>Alarm settings: a few bits. Lets say one byte</p>
<p>Source: a few bits to 1 byte</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's just round this up to an average of 20 bytes of static data per appointment, and on average 50 bytes of user description/location. That's 70 bytes per appointment. Let's be easy on the programmer and round it up to 128 bytes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10 appointments per day * 365 days * 75 years * 128 bytes = 33MB</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, a whopping 33 megabytes for a lifetime of calendar data for someone who uses their calendar to the max, their entire life. Who ever thought it was even neccessary to think about removing data?</p>

            <p>You're not far out there. I make a backup of my calendar quite frequently, just in case I'm unable to get online for some reason or&nbsp;it gets corrupt some how. My backup is only 1.2MB and I've been using mine for about 2.5 years roughly. It must be some other
 reason than the data amount I would think. They give away 7GB of free OneDrive storage to everybody, so I doubt they're running low ;)</p>

</p><p>Must be some reason, as it is a strange move to make. Maybe someone from Microsoft would be kind enough to let us know the reason for this :)</p>

            <p>I too cannot figure out how to search within the calendar, whether that be via the web, app, and even on windows phone. I am actually on hold with microsoft support right now. The guy I just spoke with said it isn't possible then transferred me to someone
 else whom I just spoke with. He said the same: it's not possible. He was very apologetic and was very nice but I ended up ending the conversation because his English was so bad, we both got tired of him having to repeat everything multiple times.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT, NO CALENDAR SEARCH IS INEXCUSABLE! I AM TRYING MY HARDEST TO STAY WITH MICROSOFT ( I ALSO USE WINDOWS PHONE) but missing VERY BASIC and VITAL features is horrendous. Google has the search option available via app or web. This should never have been
 omitted from the calendar but hey, things happen. However,&nbsp; ONCE THEY WERE AWARE OF IT, THEY SHOULD HAVE FIXED IT IMMEDIATELY! THEY DON'T SEEM TO CARE AND THEY WONDER WHY THEIR PHONE MARKET SHARE IS SO LOW.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE MS, I am literally BEGGING you to properly compete with your competitors!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is only 2 possibilities for this feature missing: Incompetence or flat out don't care. Either way, it should be easy to fix</p>

                    After I installed windows 10, my disk usage is around 95%-100%. My CPU goes around 30%-50% in idle. Anyone know what would cause this or how to fix?

<p><span>Hi Ratty69,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Disable your anti-virus completely and then try to run the backup</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Your virus scanner might be preventing you to run the backup. Disable your antivirus software and see if you can re-run the backup.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong><em>Running the computer without firewall or the anti-virus software is a potential threat to the computer; make sure to
 enable the security software after completing the troubleshooting steps and after identifying the issue.</em></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: To execute a command</span></strong></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click on Start; in the start search type cmd</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right click on cmd.exe and ‚ÄúRun as administrator‚Äù</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type the following command and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>net localgroup administrators NetworkService /ADD</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now try running the backup and check if you‚Äôre able to run the backup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: Perform a system restore to the date when the backup was working fine</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Additional information:</span></p>
<p><span>When you receive this error ‚Äú<strong>Windows Resource protection could not start the repair service</strong>‚Äù
 during system file checker scan, then you need to check the status of the Windows Module Installer Service in Microsoft Services Console. The service should be running and the service type should be set to manual.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if this worked.<br />

<p><span>Hello, Ratty69</span></p>
<p><span>Ensure that the date and time are correct on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Check if the services required exist or not: go to Start, type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>services.msc</strong> in the search box and press enter. In the Services list, locate the
 following items:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Volume Shadow Copy</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Windows Backup</span></p>
<p><span>If they exist, under Startup Type, both should say Manual. The status will most likely be blank, if this is the case, right click each and choose Start.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if there are any errors starting the services.</span></p>
<p><span>After they are started try going into your backup settings once more.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if the services do not exist.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi Ratty69,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Probably some application or service is blocking when you try to change the settings on the backup utility. I would suggest you to put
 the computer into a clean boot and then try to change the settings to see if you‚Äôre able to.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Hi lynnetopping,
<br />
<br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />In order to perform a disk clean up, follow this procedure:
<br />
<br />1. Open "File Explorer"
<br />2. Click on "This PC"
<br />3. Right click on "C:"
<br />4. Click on "Proprieties"
<br />5. Click on "Clean-up disk"
<br />6. Click on "Clean up system files"
<br />7. Select every option in the list, but not "Download"
<br />8. Click on "OK"
<br />
<br />The two line you reported are about previous Windows Installation (the previous build, that was 1809) and the update data files. If your system is running correctly you can delete those files and free some space, other than let your system be faster.
        </p>

            Hi Lynn
<br />
<br />Before you delete those items:
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer and navigate to your C drive
<br />
<br />If there is a Windows.old folder, check inside the Users folder in that Window.Old folder, to make sure none of your personal files are located in that folder . . .
<br />
<br />Once that is done, it is perfectly safe to remove everything suggested by Disk Cleanup, with the exception of your Downloads folder, if you happen to store data in the folder . . .

<p>It sounds like a licensing issue. When you download something it is tied to the gamertag it's download on as well as the console it's downloaded on. So if you switch consoles you have to do a license transfer so the license will be connected to the new console
 so other accounts can have access to the content and it can be used offline. You can do a license transfer here -

<p>I didn't switch consoles. &nbsp;It works on the very same console with the purchasing gamertag. &nbsp;It does not work with another person signed into that same console.</p>
<p>At one time I did have the red ring problem and Microsoft swapped out units (I held onto the hard drive) but that was some time ago and I haven't any issues since.</p>

<p>Actually that is what would happen with a licensing issue. The way the licenses work is it's tied to the gamertag that purchased it and the console it was purchased on. So if you bought it with your gamertag you would be able to play it on any console as
 long as your account is signed into Live, but other users wouldn't be able to play it unless you switch the console license to that console. You can read this for more info -

<h3> nikolaspullen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Task Manager Won&#39;t Open, Taskbar Disappearing, etc.</h2>
                    <p>A few months ago I got some sort of virus, but went through all the usally scans, CC Cleaner, Malwarebytes, etc. and presumed I had gotten rid of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently this is not the case since it completely killed my antivirus service (it disabled it and prevented me from turning it back on), so I had to switch to a different free one. Additionally new viruses continue leaching through that into my system
 (Malwarebytes found 70 trojans just today).<br />
<br />
Additionally it seems to have caused some major corruption issues. In addition to the issues in the title, I can't run the options to refresh my PC without affecting files, or follow the settings built in reinstall Windows feature. Clicking on the buttons prompts
 a short loading circle then nothing happens. I attempted running <strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong><span>, and get the "There is a system repair pending which requires reboot to complete. Restart Windows and
</span>run sfc again.", yet restarting Windows does nothing to address this and I get the same error upon restart. I think I've triangulated it down to an issues with the Microsoft C++ packages, as when installing a specific game it always hangs up on a step
 to try and set up C++ packages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oftentimes also I have issues trying to shut down my computer when other errors begin to occur. Clicking shut down anywhere doesn't do anything but run the graphic of the button being clicked, so manual restarts are often required. When booting up, the "Scanning
 and Repairing Drive C:" message occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs:</p>
<p>Memory: 16 GB RAM</p>
<p>Processor: Intel (R) Core (TM) i5-4670K CPU @ 3.40GHz</p>
<p>System type: 64-bit OS, x64-based processor</p>
<p>C: is a SSD which holds mostly just Windows itself<br />
E: is a hard drive with mostly games and other files</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Tbh I would clean install Windows unless you have files which haven't been backed up &amp; you need them.
<br />You can always try this first.
<br />Try running these programs:
<br />MBAM free: <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br />Eset online scanner:  <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/</a>
<br />Adwcleaner:&nbsp;<a href="https://toolslib.net/downloads/viewdownload/1-adwcleaner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://toolslib.net/downloads/viewdownload/1-a...</a>
<br />
<br />If these do not fully remove the virus/malware then it will be wise to register with a malware removal site to receive dedicated malware removal instructions, an expert will remain with you throughout the process until confirmation that your PC is 100% clean.

            Hi Nikolas.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />With an infection that persistent I would wipe the drive down to bare metal and do this Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />Don't reimport any files which should be put in quarantine until they scan clean three times with free Malwarebyes from <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a> and AdwcCleaner from <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a> which are the most powerful scanners out there right now and good tools to keep on hand.  
<br />
<br />If you want to try to keep chasing down the infection then use those tools, uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, best Windows performance, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.  
<br />
<br />If you do ever get it cleaned up then check System Files for corruption as it's unlikely they will escape serious damage and that involves at least a Repair Install to fix them.  But you can check to be sure by running System File Checker first:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Microsoft won&#39;t let me add&#47;change email addresses</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Live is not accepting my main personal emails as valid. I've waited 6 weeks for one new email address to become associated with my Microsoft account and it still hasn't happened. No word from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I tried to associate a second email account and the webpage won't even consider that one because the message says it is a school or work email. It is not - both the emails I am trying to add are my personal emails. My internet provider is a very large
 Australian company - why are Microsoft so poorly informed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The email that I have associated with my Microsoft account right now has been compromised and is being used to try to scam me in various nasty ways. I will be deleting this email address by the end of next week at the latest. What use will my Microsoft account
 be to Microsoft if they cannot contact me anymore?</p>

<h2>            Screen display adjustments won&#39;t save</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a new laptop - HP Pavillion with windows 10. The display looks washed-out. It seems it's mostly the gamma settings. When I go to calibrate the display (Settings: Display: Advanced Display Settings: Color Calibration), I can get it look good
 (especially changing the gamma). I go through the whole process - even adjusting the text appearance. But the dang adjustments won't stay. Eventually it reverts back to the way it looked out of the box. How can I get my settings to save?? Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to help you better, could you please confirm a couple of things:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the graphic card?</li><li>Have you done the settings in graphic card firmware?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>This issue occurs because some laptop graphic adapters only support two displays at one time. When you attempt to configure the display settings to use a third monitor on a laptop that supports only two monitors will check the hardware to confirm compatibility,
 then display the error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you are using a laptop that is running Windows&nbsp;10 that supports only two monitors, configure the display settings to use only two displays at one time.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<span><strong>Note</strong>:</span> You can also choose to disable the laptop screen, then use only the two external monitors.
<br />
<br />
When changing from Duplicate mode to Extended mode, you may note that this error message does not occur. This setting is designed to break up the Duplicate mode configuration prior to changing it to Extended mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information was helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.

<h2>            People app does not sync</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My L640 (official W10M, but on insider preview also the same issue) does not show my Outlook contacts in the People app. I tried the following things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Device recovery tool -&gt; W8.1 -&gt; same issue, no contacts</p>
<p>2. Hard reset on W10: same issue.</p>
<p>3. Tried manually update the contacts on phone, with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On people.live.com I can see all of my contacts. I can also see my Skype contacts on the phone.
</p>
<p>It's very irritating, because I can not use my phone without contacts...</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to sign out and sign in again with your Microsoft account and check.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, try doing Soft Reset and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Soft Reset</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The soft reset is the same thing as pulling your battery (on devices where that is possible). This method will not remove anything at all from your phone and is completely safe to attempt in any problem situation.</span></p>
<p><span>You perform the soft reset by having your phone turned on. Then press and hold the
<strong>volume down + power</strong> buttons until your phone vibrates and restarts. Note that you should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Get back to us for further queries. We are happy to help!</p>

            I haven't found the solution. I think that problem is with MS servers. I installed W10 on PC yesterday and I haven't all my contacts like on my phone. And my skype contacts didn't appear too.

I did that and it didn't work for me. New account isn't good solution... I have this problem on my PC too, where I reinstalled win 10 three days ago.
