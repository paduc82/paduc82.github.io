<h2>            OneNote Sync Problems &#40;0xE000078D&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I'm having troubles syncing my OneNote Windows app since yesterday (May 21). Error code&nbsp;0xE000078D keeps appearing since today, making it impossible to even access my notes as it would show up every time when opening OneNote.I checked my internet connection
 &amp; the help page (https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Resolve-the-0xE000078B-Server-Timeout-error-in-OneNote-630327af-ec7b-4904-9ffa-90eadca8ba57). I also checked the OneDrive status overview but there have no server outages been announced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: The app seems to be outdated, the (auto) update fails though. Error code in Windows Store:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">0x8004264b</span></p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>thanks for your response. The first link you posted is exactly the one I mentioned in my original post saying it didn't help. The second one doesn't help as it's about OneNote Desktop, not the Windows App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fixed my problem in the meantime, many different problems added up:</p>
<p>- OneNote stopped syncing (0xE000078D)</p>
<p>- Windows store wouldn't update the OneNote app (Reset didn't help, hard uninstall of the OneNote app using PowerShell didn't help) (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">0x8004264b)</span></p>
<p>- Windows update wouldn't load any update anymore (Reset neither with Diagnostics nor with other tools helped, Manual installation of updates using update catalogue failed) (0x800705b4)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turned out that for a long time no update was done, so even the Windows 10 build (1511) was outdated. I tried to upgrade to the newest Windows 10 build, but not so easy without a working Windows update:
</p>
<p>- Windows Update standard way obviously wouldn't help</p>
<p>- Windows 10 Upgrade tool didn't work, process failed after installing ~70%, reason: incompatible app or driver (<span>0xC1900208), unfortunately it didn't specify what was incompatible. Several tries to fix it by uninstalling unneeded or outdated
 stuff didn't help</span></p>
<p>- Windows 10 Media creation tool (option "install on this computer") didn't work first. It would work until the tool checked for the latest updates in addition to the downloaded upgrade. Maybe because it would try to use the internal &amp; not working Windows
 update module, but anyway it failed again and again.</p>
<p>The solution was rather a hack and I was lucky to have this idea: After the media creation tool downloaded the Windows 10 image, I disabled all internet connections so that the update step would skip. That finally worked, although the tool tried at least
 5 times again and again to download updates. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After having upgraded to 1703, I could install the OneNote app again as the Windows store seemed to be updated. However, Windows Updated still didn't work. But this time, the installation of the latest cumulative update from Windows Update Catalogue worked.
 I also ran the "Reset Windows Update Agent" Tool (https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Reset-Windows-Update-Agent-d824badc) with all options given in the tool, including the DISM check/repair options. After this last step and a restart, it started
 working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, that was a quick one. Hope this or parts of this may help others solving their Windows Update issues.

            I don't really understand what you're asking. If you mean what file, I was trying to reinstall knights of the old republic 2 (which I had no issues installing the first time around; I don't know what changed.)

<p>Now I know what file you were in as you never said before,&nbsp; The more information you provide helps.</p>
<p>If you are reinstalling did you completely uninstall the original?&nbsp; Some times this requires an uninstall program from the maker.</p>
<p>Also ti yo just deleted the folder it may not have cleared the details that were not included in the folder.</p>
<p>Did you go Apps and features and then to Programs and Features and uninstall there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>After it is completely uninstalled yoshould not have a problem reinstalling.</p>

<p>I uninstalled and reinstalled it through steam. I didn't go through programs and features at all and it wasn't there anyway after I uninstalled. When I go to steamapps I could still see a file labeled knights of the old republic II but I couldn't delete
 it because I need permission from my account. Which I'm signed into and has admin permissions enabled (at least it should.) Edit: Just checked; it does</p>

<p>So, if what you are saying is that the 3rd party software maker/developer/distributor is directing you to&nbsp;the user to user, administered/moderated largely/mostly by a&nbsp;separately owned and&nbsp;hired as a&nbsp;subcontractor&nbsp;by the&nbsp;OS maker for supplying&nbsp;a forum site&nbsp;for
 basic users&nbsp;for support of their own 3rd party&nbsp;products performance or lack thereof and&nbsp;they have the audacity to claim that that is viable support to their customers rather than admitting that either they are not, and/or have no intention of, are not able
 or refuse to do so&nbsp;due to profitability criteria, or just have no clue how to support their own&nbsp;product for the most recent version of the OS that they advertise that their product is compatible with and for. Well, unfortunately that sort of thing is nothing
 new, but it does seem to be rearing it's ugly head yet once&nbsp;again, and especially even perhaps&nbsp;more so, yet once again,&nbsp;these days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Inhale, exhale, ahh, that's better, ha.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, in the past when confronted with such I have had some success searching the C: drive and manually deleted everything that I could find related to the "uninstalled" using their supplied uninstaller that I could find (this is assuming that
 the software in question does not offer a clean uninstall app on there support website) and then reinstalling the "Product". If that is also not successful then I would repeat using Windows control panel uninstall first this time and try again. If this proves
 to also be unsuccessful I would then repeat once again and then use something I would never recommend, in fact I would normally recommend against this, and that is a registry cleaner app then cross my fingers and restart, then try the reinstall again. Sometimes
 this works,&nbsp;sometimes it does not. I do not recommend or endorse any particular 'brand" of reg. cleaner nor the use of except&nbsp;due to&nbsp;extreme circumstances, pick your own if you choose to go there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, the alternative is a full and truly clean disk wipe and reinstallation of Win 10 and then try the app install again, will it then be compatible without an update or version upgrade to the app,&nbsp;sounds like one way to find out in this case.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The clean install option may not be the popular answer but it is the truth nonetheless.</p>

            Hi  azizaziz4, are you getting this error on a Blue Screen?
<br />
<br />1.
<br />
<br />If so, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .
<br />
<br />2.
<br />
<br />If not, please provide a screenshot or photo of what you are seeing on your screen . . .       
        </p>

            If it's a retail license - yes, you can move it to another computer as long as it's only installed on one computer at a time. The previous Windows 7 installation must be formatted/deleted. You might have to call Microsoft and explain what happened to complete
 the activation. Activating it on the second computer will automatically deactivate the license for the first computer. The key will work with both 32 and 64 bit, but only one can be installed at a time.<br />

            If needed you would contact them by phone, not email. When you install the 64bit version:<br />

If you have trouble activating Windows 7 open the Windows Activation Wizard while in Windows 7 to use the phone and activate Windows:<br />
While installing Windows 7 at the enter your product key page, do not enter your key and uncheck "Automatically Activate When Online"<br />
1. When you have reached the desktop, Click Start, then in the Search box type:&nbsp; slui.exe 4<br />
2. Press Enter on your Keyboard<br />
3. Select your Country.<br />

<h2>            Windows Vista won&#39;t connect to Internet.  Shows full signal strength on Airport Express, and directly connected.  Help me fix this...</h2>
                    Hey everyone, <br />
<br />
I need help fixing a Windows machine.&nbsp; I use Apples, l I really know nothing about troublshooting Windows, I know how to use it just fine, but thats it.&nbsp; In all honesty, I don't even know if this is a Vista problem, or a hardware problem.<br />
<br />
My girlfriend has a 2 year old HP laptop with Vista.&nbsp; She just got Comcast internet.&nbsp; I hooked up my Airport Express, got my MacBook connected, and her HP Vista machine connected.&nbsp; They both worked fine for 2 days.&nbsp; Then 2 nights ago, her machine just shut
 off for no reason, she booted it back up, and now no internet.&nbsp; My Mac works fine, so I know its not the Airport.&nbsp; I unplugged the Airport, reset the modem, and the HP, plugged it in directly, still no internet.&nbsp; I plugged the MacBook in directly, works fine.&nbsp;
 So I isolated it to the HP laptop.&nbsp; The wierd thing is her computer shows full signal, excellent connection, when connected to the Airport, or directly -- it just doesn't work.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So, tell me what to look at or check for.&nbsp; Any help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!<br />
<br />
Jesse

<p><span>Hi Jesse,<br />
</span><span><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Windows Vista Forums.<br />

To reset the TCP/IP stack go to this article and either click on "Fix it for me" or follow the instructions to fix it yourself:<br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357</span></a><br />
<span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
Disable IPv6:<br />
Try uninstalling IPv6 on all interfaces, removing any IPv6 virtual adapters, and resetting the TCP/IP stack. To remove IPv6, go into the properties for each network adapter and either uncheck the box next to the protocol "Internet Protocol version 6 (TCP/IPv6),
 that will disable it, or select it and click uninstall, which will remove it off the computer. Then go into device manager and remove any 4to6 adapters, WUN miniport adapters, or tunnel adapters.<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
NOTE: You should do this for each network connection.<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
Disable the DHCP Broadcast Flag:<br />

<span>Important This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow
 these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the
 article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:<br />
322756 (</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/</span></a><span> ) How to back up and restore the registry
 in Windows<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
Windows Vista cannot obtain an IP address from certain routers or from certain non-Microsoft DHCP servers<br />
To resolve this issue, disable the DHCP BROADCAST flag in Windows Vista. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
Click Start, type regedit in the Start Search box, and then click regedit in the Programs list.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
Locate and then click the following registry subkey:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\{GUID}<br />
In this registry path, click the (GUID) subkey that corresponds to the network adapter that is connected to the network.<br />
On the Edit menu, point to New, and then click DWORD (32-bit) Value.<br />
In the New Value #1 box, type DhcpConnEnableBcastFlagToggle, and then press ENTER.<br />
Right-click DhcpConnEnableBcastFlagToggle, and then click Modify.<br />
In the Value data box, type 1, and then click OK.<br />
Close Registry Editor.<br />
By setting this registry key to 1, Windows Vista will first try to obtain an IP address by using the BROADCAST flag in DHCP Discover packets. If that fails, it will try to obtain an IP address without using the BROADCAST flag in DHCP Discover packets.<br />

            So, I reset the TCP/IP stack, and now the problem is appearing a little different.&nbsp; The Vista machine connects to the Airport just fine, excellent signal strength.&nbsp; When I am in network settings, it shows a good connection between the computer and the
 Airport, but it shows the Airport is not connected to the modem.&nbsp; I know the Airport is working fine because I am sitting here replying to this on one of the two Macs on this network.&nbsp; I am about to try disabling IPv6 and the DHCP Broadcast flag, or does this
 just seem to be looking like a hardware malfunction?&nbsp; The internet was working for two days, and then it just stopped.<br />

I did everything recommended in this thread up, and realized the problem is not with the network.&nbsp; I connected directly to the modem, restarted the computer and modem, obviously no internet.&nbsp; So I went into control panel, and the computer says it is connected
 to the internet.&nbsp; It won't let me diagnose anything if the computer thinks there is a connection.&nbsp; Is it possible that when the computer crashed, it took out a piece of hardware in such a manner that Vista knows its connected to the net with a good signal,

Okay, I ran into this issue only with Machines running vista and with wirless and wired connections And they did see full connections and said limited connectivity or access it was confusing the ____ out of me ! the computers seen the router but didnt want
 to go past it this is a dns issue and THIS ALL HAPPEND AFTER A FEW UPGRADES AND I BELEIVE ITS IN SERVICE PACK TWO !!!!!!, What i did was went into the router and wrote down the dns servers and staticaly put in the ip add and dns servers in the network cards
 ip proporties .it worked fine.got on line and the neowrk discovery was a.o.kay &nbsp;but it wasent good enough the router should do this on its own being that dchp is enabled on the router.&nbsp;going into the registry and enable and disable the dhcp brocast flags didnt
 seem to solve the problem. &nbsp;being that vista per say does not like non microsoft dhcp/routers. Being that its designed to run very efficient in a Full microsoft&nbsp;environment pulling&nbsp;packets from microsoft dhcp/dns servers. The poblem is the router it might
 need a firmware upgrade being that Vista uses newer protocols over the basic TCP/IP&nbsp; that most routers older than vista&nbsp;use . So&nbsp;staicaly placing the ip add and dns servers seemed to do the trick . . Your firmware upgrade might accept these protocols and avoid
 the issues with vista not accepting the dhcp packets request. Or you could just go to the network and security center and then go to manage connections right click on the connection go to properties and then to tcp/ip version 4 then to proporties click the
 button for Use the following ip adress and do the same for the dns servers put in the ip adress its prob gonna be like this ip 192.168.1xx. netmask 255.255.255.0 gateway 192.168.1.1 and then dns servers 8.90.2.3. 8.90.2.4&nbsp; dns example dont know your servers
 those dns numbers are for illustrate purpose only do not put those in . then click okay.&nbsp; then you should be on the internet........ you will see that you will have full connection to the internet with in the networking and sharing center.&nbsp;You could leave
 it this way it will work just fine. But&nbsp; once i got online i then i&nbsp;found &nbsp;the firmware upgrade for my Linksys router downloaded it and then installed it and then went back&nbsp;to &nbsp;put all nics wireless and wired back to full DHCP and everything is running fine.....&nbsp;
 now..........no problems......<br />
<br />
ip&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 192.168.1.1xx<br />
sbnt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;255.255.255.0<br />

            My vista machine woke up one day from hibernation and decided it could no longer identify my wired network. &nbsp;I've tried a number of other fixes, including modifying my registry, and they do not work. &nbsp;How can I get in to see the DNS servers (I'm hooked
 up to a Motorola (don't know exactly what model, I'm not home at the moment to look) cable modem)? &nbsp;Will I have to borrow someone else's computer and hook it up to see this?

<p>Good Afternoon Everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an old Vista Gateway laptop (9 years old) that hasn't been able to connect to the internet since October 2016.&nbsp; I didn't give it much thought since I knew Microsoft was killing support in a few months.&nbsp; So last week before I moved iTunes to my new
 Dell Inspiron laptop I tried going online one last time to update everything but still nothing; even now as I write this, nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, does anyone know what happened back in October 2016 (some update perhaps) that may have caused this problem?&nbsp; I'm willing to give this Registry edit a try but I would rather use a confirmed process rather than some off-the-cuff attempt that works for
 some but not for others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I don't need is someone pretending to be a Microsoft Engineer or someone with no know-how giving help that isn't the solution but more of the problem.&nbsp; I apologize for the snarky comment but I've grown very tired of being led around on wild goose chases
 on these forums by people who don't have a clue to what's going on but continuously pat themselves on their backs with their impressive Microsoft credentials and useless help from the comfort of their parent's basement.</p>

If you want to run any particular program always in administrator mode, then I would suggest you to try the following steps.<br />
<br />
a. Create a shortcut of the program that you want to run as administrator on desktop.<br />
b. Right click on the program shortcut and click on properties.<br />
c. Click on compatibility Tab.<br />
d. Under settings Put a check mark Run this program as an administrator. <br />
e. Click on Apply and OK.<br />
<br />
Post us the results after you try the above steps.</span>

<h2>            Steelseries Siberia V2 Microphone Not Working</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, I recently purchased my xbox one, and was disapointed by the fact that any microphones other then the standard one are hard to get working. I can hear sound through my headset, but cannot speak. I have tried many solutions, I have bought a convertor
 to plug the two jacks into one into the stereo adaptor in the bottom of the controller, however that does not work, I have tried plugging the audio jack into the TV, and the mic jack into the stereo adaptor, however that does not work either.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any solutions as to how to get my headphones to work with the XBOX One?

<p>as far as I've been told, this is literally the wayt eh software is set up in the console. You have to use a headset that is officiated by Microsoft unfortunately. There aren't many third-party headsets that will work. Most are simply Turtle Beaches.</p>

<p>Without knowing the name of the program that has triggered the error (or what you were doing at the time), it is difficult to advise.</p>
<p>Is the message still there, if you reboot your computer? </p>

<p>I suspect that when you boot your computer, one of the programs in your start-up configuration is failing to load properly.</p>
<p>Before you do anything else, I would check whether your computer has been infected with malicious software.&nbsp; Run a full scan with your usual anti-virus program.&nbsp; You could also run an online scan at www.eset.com/online-scanner.</p>
<p>Next, I suggest you download and install the free versions of Malwarebytes and Superantispyware.&nbsp; Then, perform a full scan with Malwarebytes, followed by a full scan using Superantispyware.</p>
<p>I hope your computer has not been infected with any "nasties". Provided it seems to be clean, the next step is to identify the program that is causing problems.</p>
<p>Open Task Manager.&nbsp; To do so, press CTRL+ALT+DELETE together. The 'Applications' tab will show the tasks that are running on your computer.&nbsp; If it shows a task that is 'not responding', then that task may be the culprit.&nbsp; For further information on Task
 Manager, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/323527." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/323527.</a></p>
<p>If Task Manager doesn't help, the System Configuration utility might help to troubleshoot the problem.&nbsp; See<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310560." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310560.</a></p>
<p>Otherwise, I'm not sure what to suggest.&nbsp; However, one of the MVPs may be able to recommend other steps to identify and resolve your problem.</p>

<h2>            Non-friend can see my location&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Alright, I am a very upset xbox live user now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have explicitly set my privacy settings to:</p>
<p>profile - friends only</p>
<p>I have saved and exited (yes and after the reboot too).</p>
<p>Now some guy I don't know sends me a message:</p>
<p>"bla bla bla your_country bla bla bla" where your_country is the country that I live in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have specifically set my profile to visible to friends only so why can other users see my location?!</p>
<p>He says "all that I can see is your gamertag and location".</p>
<p>I don't want this!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what is going on here? I have reverse checked both my xbox live profiles on xbox.com to see if I could see my location, but I couldn't.</p>
<p>I was signed in with one profile at a time like it should be and when I tried to visit the other profile, all it said was:</p>
<p>- location</p>
<p>- bio</p>
<p>with no specifics. Neither location nor bio were mentioned. Just the labels. So how can this guy see my info!!!</p>
<p>This is really not good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I hide everything?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Just a couple guesses here: he's a friend of one of your friends messing with you, he guessed, he talked to you in chat and heard your accent/language, etc. I'm checking your profile and cannot see any of this information, so I believe you privacy settings
 are sound.<br />

If you really feel this user is a threat to you, or you just don't want him communicating with you, you can file a complaint against him and/or block communication with him.

<p>Sorry should of been more specific. If your on Xbox Live and lets say you view a person gamercard, very breifly where the motto should be located you'll see that persons region or country. You can't hide that from poping up but what you could do for now,
 (untill it is addressed in a system update) is go to locale on the dashboard and change it to different country/region. If you don't want people to know where your from.</p>

<p>I did not say a single word in-game. My country is not very known and he nailed it, so he must have seen it. I have set my profile to 'blocked' (by the way, I am posting on here with a different account than the account I am talking about - for privacy sake).

<p>Darker Reaper, that seems like a very good idea. I will try that later on, but as far as I remember, I can not change my locale. Maybe I'm wrong and it's the language I can not change (only two available).</p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
Since the Laptop and the Vizio are connected through Network Wireless they can only connect with whatever is available through Network interface.
<br />
<br />
If the Vizio is capable to output its Visual TV content through the Wiereless connection, then it would be possible to view the pic on the laptop.<br />
<br />
Check with Vizio support if such output it available<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Installation Failure</h2>
                    <p>I am installing Windows 10 from Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; I have had multiple failures installing from the update.&nbsp; I also downloaded the ISO and attempted to install from this.&nbsp; Every time I attempt to install I get the failure code C1900101.&nbsp; I have gotten
 additional codes 0x80070057 (2015-08-06-T-10_31_41p) and C1900101-0x20017.&nbsp; On the last install from the ISO I got the message the installation error occurred during SAFE_OS Error During Boot Operation.&nbsp; I have tried running a reg repair tool, and going to
 msconfig and turning off unnecessary start up application.&nbsp; I have not tried to install in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anybody has any ideas, I would appreciate the feed back.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regrets the inconvenience caused. Let me ask few questions to help you in this regard:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Make and model of your PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the issue might due to malfunctioning or incompatible drivers on background. In some cases the running anti virus might causes the issue. Check and install the compatible Windows 10 drivers for your device from your device Manufacture's website
 before starting upgrade. Check and let us if it fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also try to disable any running anti virus till the upgrade completes. Meantime keep windows defender turn on.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> Antivirus software can help protect your computer
 against viruses and other security threats.&nbsp; In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet
 or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></p>
<p>

 driver is taking and sometime it is not taking.This I am facing on daily basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not solve then you have to go to win 8.</p>

    <title>Prepaid 12 month subscription cancelled&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Prepaid 12 month subscription cancelled&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I received an e-mail today notifying me my 12 month pre paid subscription was cancelled. &nbsp;I have been out of town and nobody has been on my Xbox. &nbsp;I tried to see if I can re-activate my account with that prepaid subsciption, but there's no option for it,
 it will only let me pay for a new subsciption. &nbsp;It hasn't even been 1 month into the prepaid time period and it was cancelled on its own, why would I cancel a prepaid membership? &nbsp;I'm getting tired of all the problems I encounter with my 360, I will NOT be
 buying any more games for 360, i'm only going to buy new games for PS3... I'm debating on whether or not to sell it, I don't want to as I do wanna play the games I own on live, so please fix this problem ASAP... &nbsp;I don't want to have to contact the BBB because
 anytime I've had problems the customer service provided was horrible, and I've just let it go, until now... This is unacceptable you guys are losing a loyal customer over this.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time,&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Yeah, let's take the most extreme approach before doing the reasonable thing, like actually contacting Xbox and asking them for a solution. &nbsp;You're not going to get any solutions to you problem here as it involves personal account
 information that should not be revealed on this PUBLIC forum.<br />

<p>Well like Zen said, support agents can't post account/personal information on these forums, so you need to contact support via the phone. &nbsp;If a subscription cancelled early they should be able to find out why, how much time you had left, and depending on
 the circumstances of why it was cancelled early, they may be able to provide tokens for the remaining time you had.</p>

<p>Agreed, you need to call support. &nbsp;The most common cause of an early cancellation is the cardholder cancels it. &nbsp;If you have a card on your account that belongs to a parent or someone else, they probably cancelled. &nbsp;The subs just don't cancel themselves
 unless it's expiring or someone else has access to your account (they don't have to be at your console to have access).</p>

            <p>Hey there MING - I can certainly see what you are reporting. Unfortunately, as others on this thread have mentioned, this would be something only our Phone Support team can resolve for you. Since this is a public forum, we're not able to share some details, especially when it comes to billing and subscriptions. I'm very sorry I can't assist you more! However, you can request that you get a call from our Phone Support team (no waiting in queue! :D ) by visiting: support.xbox.com/contact-us</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t install the impossible creatures 1.1 patch</h2>
                    <p>I had to run Impossible creatures in compatibility mode to get it to work.&nbsp; Now, when I try to install a patch for it, the patch starts, makes no progress, and closes prematurely. I'd Really like this to work so I can patch in more creatures to use in-game.</p>
<p>I am running Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>

            Yes, Only the "Run in compatibility mode for: Previous Version of Windows" pops up.&nbsp; All Others are grayed out.&nbsp; I followed instructions on the Windows 7 forums to do a registry edit so I could run it in compatibility mode for Win XP SP2, that worked but
 it still wont run the installer.

<p>ok. have&nbsp;you tried installing it in safe mode? try first without compat mode then with compat mode in safe mode. if that doesn't work then there might be another way if you have another computer running a different OS. you can try installing the game to
 the other computer running the different OS then update it on that computer. when you have the game updated and running on the other computer, just copy that whole folder over to the 7 64-bit system and don't reinstall it, just run it.</p>
<p>hit me back.</p>

            I tried the safe mode bit, but it wouldn't run the patch installer.&nbsp; It claimed it couldn't do that in safe mode.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I don't currently have currently have an XP computer... wait, maybe I do.&nbsp; I'll try something later.
