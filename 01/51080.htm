    <title>Windows 8.1 U1 hiding taskbar in multi-monitors setup bug. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sfairat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 U1 hiding taskbar in multi-monitors setup bug.</h2>
                    <p>I've already asked about it on technet forums, but without success, unfortunately. So, here I am trying my luck here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, the bug is with incorrectly disappearing taskbar - taskbar "hides" not in the bottom of the screen, but "taskbar height pixels" higher (see the images in onedrive folder below). It hides in such a way only when you go to start screen with visible taskbar,
 wait until it disappears and return to desktop in any way (by pressing the win key, by selecting desktop on startscreen or by clicking the windows logo in the lower left corner);&nbsp; this bug only appears with two monitors setup and heavily depends on monitors
 position - the secondary monitor bottom should be below primary monitor bottom (I mean not physical location, of course, but monitors' relative location in "Screen resolution" menu). The bug didn't appear before Update 1; I can't confirm whether it is reproduceable
 only on my PC at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reproduced the bug across several computers with 100% success rate: two macbooks pro retina, lenovo laptop, two desktops (on one of them I reproduced the bug via teamviewer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This bug is really annoying - when it happens, you need "to cast some magic" - move the mouse to the bottom of the screen, activate/deactivate several applications, etc. in order for taskbar to reappear properly, let alone the fact that it looks unaesthetic.</p>
<p>Will be grateful for any suggestions about how to fix it (without changing monitor positions, of course :).</p>

            <p>It was hard for me to see what the video showed it was doing.&nbsp; The video is too fast and is covered by the play options.&nbsp; It did seem as though I could see a line where the taskbar had been, so maybe that is what you mean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But on my system, triple monitor, the center monitor, set as default, is the only one that hides the taskbar, and it is hidden until I go to the bottom of the screen and unhide it.&nbsp; This of course will depend on whether you have it set to automatically hide
 the task bar.&nbsp; But the different options on my system seem to work as expected.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just so&nbsp;I can make sure I am using the same settings as you, what do you have for a setting for the show taskbar on all screens, and automatically hide?&nbsp; Also, descriptions of the setups for the different systems and what type and manufacturer of video output
 they are using, might help.&nbsp; Are you using an Extended desktop or duplicate desktop?</p>

            <p>Yes, it's about that line. I was kinda "lucky" when recording that video, because the taskbar reappeared really easily, it's not that easy usually.<br />
</p>
<p>The desktop is extended to all monitors. The taskbar is shown on all monitors, and it's set to hide automatically.
<a href="http://1drv.ms/1lARAZb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here</a> are the screenshots, that'll help you to understand the problem better. On third screenshot there you can see another bug with partially hidden taskbar, which happens sometimes when you rearrange monitors.</p>
<p>Video outputs of affected pcs include geforce's and intel hd's, to I think it's unrelevant.</p>
<p>Try to disable the third monitor (I'm not sure it'll work in triple monitor setup) and move the secondary monitor below the main one in "screen resolution" menu; by "lower" I mean that secondary monitor bottom line should be below main monitor bottom line.</p>

            <p>I use the Nvidia control panel to adjust my settings and my monitors are matched so they use the same resolution and frequency.&nbsp; Even with the adjustments you indicate, mine still seem to operate normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screenshots are dark and a little hard to see exactly what you mean.&nbsp; But I do see a line on the side monitor that looks some type of writing.&nbsp; I have a background on my system where I can just see the top of the description of the photographs used for
 the background, but that does not move with the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"It hides in such a way only when you go to start screen with visible taskbar, wait until it disappears and return to desktop in any way (by pressing the win key, by selecting desktop on startscreen or by clicking the windows logo in the lower left corner)</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to the Start Screen using the Winkey, the Task Bar is not visible until I move the mouse down to the bottom and it only comes up on that one screen.&nbsp; But it seems to go away normally..&nbsp; If your taskbar is showing initially, without going to the
 bottom of the screen, that might indicate there is a problem with your install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Taskbar was not available on the Start Page until one of the recent changes.&nbsp; I think you are saying you have not duplicated the problem on other computers, so possibly it is limited to something about your install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About all I could suggest right now would be to update or reinstall your Video Driver or try changing your background.&nbsp; You might even try making the second monitor primary.&nbsp; I don't run my Windows 8 install very often, but I will keep and eye out to see
 if I come across anything relevant.</p>

            <p>I have now seen part of what you describe.&nbsp; But it happened only on the center monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had raised the Taskbar on the APPs screen and then went back to the Start Screen and selected the Desktop.&nbsp; The line was there, but it was because the Taskbar was still up, just everything was invisible except for the very top line, the one you can see
 at the bottom of the monitor when the Taskbar is hidden.&nbsp; Rolling the mouse just below the line allowed the Taskbar to become visible and then retracts normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This situation was not related to any monitors being offset in the multi-monitor setup.</p>

            <p>Oh, I'm so happy you've managed to do it :) I was preparing a step-by-step guide with screenshots at the moment. Try to do it several times more, and you'll trap into situations when taskbar doesn't want to reappear. Even without it, it looks "broken".</p>
<p>By the way, in my case it seems to be&nbsp; strongly related to monitors offset.</p>

            You can boot the system with one of the rescue CDs offered by various antivirus companies and see if that will remove the trojan so you can get into the computer. Or you can pull the hard drive and scan from a different computer. I don't normally like
 to do this since there is a chance of infecting the host machine. Another alternative is to create a Bart's PE with antivirus/antimalware plugins and boot the computer with it to try and remove the trojan.<br />
<br />
Some rescue CDs:<br />

<br />
Another alternative is to back up your data to an external hard drive by booting to the Bart's PE or a Linux Live CD such as Knoppix and then do a clean install/factory restore of the computer.<br />
<br />
If you can't do the work yourself (and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea), take the machine to a professional computer repair shop (not your local equivalent of BigComputerStore/GeekSquad).

            Then how did you know you received a trojan when you first posted? In any case,
<span>if you have another user account with administrative privileges you can log into that account and change your original user account's password from the User Accounts applet in Control Panel. If you don't have another account like
 this set up or don't have the password to it, you'll need to log into the built-in Administrator account. In XP Home, boot the computer into Safe Mode. Do this by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting up. This will get you to the right
 menu. Navigate using your Up arrow key; the mouse will not work here. Once in Safe Mode, you will see the normally hidden Administrator account. The default password is a blank.<br />
<br />
In XP Pro, you do not need to go into Safe Mode. At the Welcome Screen, do Ctrl-Alt-Del twice to get the classic Windows logon box. Type in "Administrator" and whatever password you assigned when you set up Windows. If you have XP Pro or Media Center and were
 using the built-in Administrator account for your regular work and it is therefore the only user account on the system, there are ways to change the password for that account to a blank. Microsoft doesn't permit us to tell you how in these forums. Their house,
 their rules. Use Google or ask a local computer tech (not a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place).<br />

<p><strong>The good thing is that you can beat this.&nbsp; Just restart your computer into safe mode using the default "administrator" login user name with no password unless you created one during installation.&nbsp; Once you click on restart, Press the F8 Key and at
 the menu go into safe mode with no networking (internet).&nbsp; Log into the administrator account as mentioned above, then do these&nbsp;three things.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp; Disable the restore feature by right clicking my computer and clicking the advance tab and go to system restore and disable it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp; Click on My Computer and Right Click the C:\ Drive and&nbsp;&nbsp;click the Cleanup Button under the pic and&nbsp;Check every box not checked and then OK.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp; Lastly, Goto Control Panel and then User Accounts and Disable the simple logon feature and then apply.&nbsp; close all windows and then restart the computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Finally, you will log into the "administrator" account again and download the microsoft security essentials suite from microsoft.com and run the scan.&nbsp; It will update the software and then will ask to choose the scan.&nbsp; Choose Full or Complete scan
 and this should repair the problem.&nbsp; After the repair, restart the computer and login with your credentials and don't click on any pop ups offering antivirus, spyware, or malware protection.&nbsp; Most are fake and if you did not want to go there, don't believe
 in a internet annointed one knowing what you want to do before you know you want to do it.&nbsp; Thank You for your time.&nbsp; Misterehead</strong>&nbsp; COFFEE COMPUTER SERVICES</p>

<p>Registry cleaning programs are <strong>all</strong> snake oil. Cleaning of the<br />
registry isn't needed and is dangerous. Leave the registry alone and<br />
don't use any registry cleaner. Despite what many people think, and<br />
what vendors of registry cleaning software try to convince you of,<br />
having unused registry entries doesn't really hurt you. <br />
The risk of a serious problem caused by a registry cleaner erroneously<br />
removing an entry you need is far greater than any potential benefit<br />
it may have. <br />

http://www.edbott.com/weblog/archives/000643.html</a></p>
<p>And also<br />
<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/archive/2005/10/02/registry-junk-a-windows-fact-of-life.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/archive/2005/10/02/registry-junk-a-windows-fact-of-life.aspx</a></p>
<p>Let me point out that neither I nor anyone else who warns against the<br />
use of registry cleaners has ever said that they always cause<br />
problems. If they always caused problems, they would disappear from<br />
the market almost immediately. Many people have used a registry<br />
cleaner and never had a problem with it.</p>
<p>Rather, the problem with a registry cleaner is that it carries with it<br />
the substantial <strong>risk</strong> of having a problem. And since there is no<br />
benefit to using a registry cleaner, running that risk is a very bad<br />
bargain.</p>
<p>Regarding the Show Desktop icon, create a text file in Notepad as<br />
follows:</p>
<p>[Shell]<br />
Command=2<br />
IconFile=explorer.exe,3<br />
[Taskbar]<br />
Command=ToggleDesktop</p>
<p>Save it as Show Desktop.scf then drag it to the Quick Launch bar.<br />
Or just click on this link:</p>
<p>Restore/Add Show Desktop to Quick Launch (Line 61)<br />
<a href="http://www.kellys-korner-xp.com/xp_tweaks.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.kellys-korner-xp.com/xp_tweaks.htm</a></p>
<p>Also note that you can do the same thing with a keyboard shortcut<br />
rather than a shortcut on the Quick Launch bar: the combination of the<br />
Windows key + D or the Windows key + M.</p>

If system restore cannot bring back the desktop icon, here are 2 tutorials to fix that :<br />

<br />
As to registry cleaner, bottom line : in the hands of computer experts, it can be an useful tool. In the hands of reguler computer users, it is a time bomb.<br />
An artcle about why not using registry cleaner.<br />

<h2>            Windows updates fail, Windows Activation Technologies &#34;Not Genuine&#34; pop-up</h2>
                    <p>So I have been browsing the blogs and forums for the past few months trying to fix my issues, and nothing seems to help. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have about 45 important windows updates that fail to update. &nbsp;I also get an annoying pop-up at seemingly random intervals telling me that my version of windows is not genuine (it definitely is, I bought my PC from best buy with windows pre-loaded). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also of note, my Apple iphone device driver seems to be having issues now. &nbsp;The USB driver had the ! triangle next to it in the device manager, and when I uninstalled and attempted to reinstall the driver I got the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows found driver software for your device but encountered an error while attempting to install it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple Mobile Device USB Driver</p>
<p>Windows cannot verify the digital signature for the drivers required for this device. &nbsp;A recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software from an unknown source (Code
 52)."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would greatly appreciate anyone's help, as I can't find any new ideas to try!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I am not <em>completely </em>computer illiterate, but I am certainly not an amateur enthusiast either. &nbsp;Please don't be afraid to treat me as the lowest common denominator to make sure that I haven't skipped a simple but important step.</p>

</p><p><span>Your operating system is damaged. To eliminate the problems on your computer you need to restore to factory settings and rebuild your computer system.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A System Recovery partition contains a copy of the operating system as it was when the computer was purchased new. Using the copy of Windows 7 you can restore the computer to factory settings. Of
 course you should back up your data files to external media before restoring as the process reformats the drive thereby erasing all existing files before writing new files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you have restored to factory settings you should set up an internet connection, install anti-virus software, update all drivers from the&nbsp;Samsung web site and install all Windows Updates. Run
 Disk CleanUp and defragment at intervals. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You should then be in a position to reinstall programmes. With that in mind make a list of programmes to be installed and check that you have the means to do it. Check that you have the necessary
 information to recreate your internet connection on the new system. Make a list of what you need to do and the order in which you intend to do each task. This will help you considerably when you carry out the operation. If you have a second computer available
 when you rebuild your computer system, this can help if you hit a problem and need to check online.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please note I am way on holiday after 19.8.15 23:00 GMT until Tuesday 1.9.15.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Crimson Skies Original Disc Failure to be seen in Xbox one</h2>
                    <p>First, I&nbsp;own the original Crimson Skies original xbox disc, my original xbox finally had laser failure and I&nbsp;tossed it but kept my games. So I&nbsp;decided to try the backwards compatibility for it, inserted disk and it acts as if there is no disk. No scratches, no defects, just nothing. Am I&nbsp;missing something?</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Insertion of the Crimson Skies disk shows nothing at all, but every other game I&nbsp;own is shown, as well as DVDs. I did a full reboot of console, then a HARD reboot. Same issues. Xbox One S unit. Disk has light scuffs but no scratches. It is the only original xbox game I&nbsp;own that is BC, so I&nbsp;cant test others from the Duke era, but my other xbox 360 games are shown and work fine as well as the 15 xbox one titles I&nbsp;own on disk. Tried to clean disk with light buff and cleaner still no life at all.&nbsp;</p>

            This is a very common problem. The Photo Gallery program is part of your HP printer software. Put the HP printer CD in the drive when requested and the problem will go away.

<h3> ksoiza5  say:</h3>
<h2>            W10 Error - BIOS isn&#39;t supported.</h2>
                    <p>I'm running a Dell Inspiron N5110. After days of making sure everything is up to date, downloading any and all updates (Important, Recommended and Optional ones) and cleaning up my system somewhat in preparation for the new W10, I know open the app to find
 a message stating that my BIOS isn't supported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've come across previous posts from other users with the same problem however these seemed to all be from before the full launch of W10. Has this been fixed somehow? Is there any way at all to actually upgrade my system to W10?</p>
<p>

            <p>My BIOS is fully updated and Dell have said in multiple occasions that they will nit attempt to solve this issue as it says in the link your provided. Instead they have said that they will be reliant upon Microsoft providing a fix. Is this true? Is something
 currently being done to solve this issue?</p>

<p>UPDATE: &nbsp;Hi. &nbsp;I spent several hours on hold and on the phone with Microsoft yesterday. &nbsp;They did a remote access of my computer, checked a few things, deleted a lot of things, verified my computer and possible compatibility issues with 3rd party programs,
 and got the download re-started. &nbsp;We left the conversation at that point, as it takes a couple of hours to complete. &nbsp;It failed once again with a different error code: &nbsp;C1900101-20004. &nbsp;I tried the link you provided and once again - FAILURE. &nbsp;This time the
 error code was: &nbsp;0xC1900101-0x2000C. &nbsp;It did give me additional information though - "The update failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during the APPLY_IMAGE operations". &nbsp;12 hours spent on this yesterday - will try again today. &nbsp;I would appreciate any
 other fix ideas. &nbsp;Thank you!</p>

            <p>If you are using a laptop computer then hopefully the following will be useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had an identical problem with a Toshiba Satellite laptop i.e. machine would power itself down during the installation phase and then my previous Windows 7 OS would be restored when the machine was powered back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading MANY different potential solutions my problem ended up simply being that the machine was overheating presumably due to the high disk / processor tasks during installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After failing to upgrade 4 times I simply placed my laptop in a position where I could have a cheap fan blow cool air to the underside of my laptop during the entire installation phase. I did not make any other changes to the installation process that had
 failed the previous times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 upgrade finally completed successfully without any additional problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps some of you out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
Chris</p>

<h2>            Red Screen upon startup.</h2>
                    I have a HP Pavilion laptop, 5 years old, W 7 S. 1. I did a restore a few weeks ago and now when ever I start the PC it starts with a red screen with black lines. Once it gets to Windows opening screen it is ok and also my main screen. However, if I go
 online to a news feed (CNN, MSNBC) the photos have the red/black combination in them. Test show the drivers are all up to date. I calibrated the color many times. Any ideas of solving this issue?? Thanks!

                    I would like to change the font on the Windows Calculator -- the current font makes it very difficult to read some of the operator symbols.&nbsp; I'm guessing that it follows the "system font" selection.&nbsp; Is it possible (even by using regedit) to change what
 font is used with the calculator?

<h2>            HP Laserjet 2100 and Windows 10 &#40;1809&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think starting with 1803 the printer disappeared from the list of available printer drivers (even after pressing "use Windows Update"). So how can use my Laserjet with Windows 1809 ?</p>
<p>When searching for a printer driver on the HP website I get directed to something called HP Printer Administrator Resource Kit.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to use this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>regards Edmund</p>

            Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps, Connect your Printer to the computer and Switch it ON. In case of Wireless printer, Switch it ON and connect it to the Wifi network.
<br />
<br />1. Run printer troubleshooter
<br />HP provides a tool for HP printers to troubleshoot - HP Print and Scan Doctor. Download it, launch it and follow the onscreen directions to locate problems and fix them
<br />
<br />Download Link - <a href="http://ftp.hp.com/pub/printers/hppsdr/HPPSdr.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ftp.hp.com/pub/printers/hppsdr/HPPSdr.exe</a>
<br />
<br />2. Update Printer Driver
<br />Download printer driver from printer manufacturer's website and reinstall.
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall and reinstall the Printer (Credit to Andre Da Costa, MVP for providing steps)
<br />A. Uninstall Printer
<br />Click on Windows Key+X &gt; Apps and Features &gt; Scroll down and click Programs and Features &gt; Select your printer &gt; Select Uninstall
<br />Type Printer in Windows Search box &gt; Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Select your printer &gt; Remove device
<br />Type Printer in Windows Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Scroll down and click Print server properties under Related settings &gt; Under Driver tab, look for your printer &gt; Select it and click Remove button at the bottom
<br />
<br />B. Install Printer 
<br />Go to the Printer manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers &gt; Reinstall the Printer driver &gt; Reboot the computer
<br />Type Printer in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; On Right side, Click Add a printer or scanner &gt; If Windows detects your printer, it will be listed &gt; Select the printer and follow on screen directions to set it up (In case of Wifi printer, your computer should also be logged into Wifi network)
<br />If Windows doesn't detect your printer, then you will get a blue message - Click The printer that I want isn't listed
<br />If you are using Bluetooth / Wirelss printer &gt; Select Add a Bluetooth, wireless or network discoverable printer &gt; Choose the printer &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions
<br />If you are using wired printer &gt; Select Add a local printer or network printer  with manual settings &gt; Select Use an existing port &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions

<p>Original Title: <span>Sidebar search not working</span></p>
<p>My side bar search is no longer working. While attempting to search, the window above is blank and nothing appears no matter what I search for (files, programs, etc.). How do I resolve this issue? This feature has worked for me in the past, that is, until
 now. I am running Windows 7 Ultimate.</p>

            delete it ,stamp on it kill it and run virus scan etc,previous posts are right as they are experts,you do not get to be mvp's,mcc or community stars etc for giving bad advice.i dont&nbsp;know&nbsp;anything,but i know that.it is probably scam to load your system
 with virus/trojan to collect credit card etc details.good luck

            They are all at the Toshiba website!&nbsp; The M35 came with XP (or 2000) so what you will have to do is find a recent Toshiba notebook with approximately the same hardware as you have, look up that model and see if it has Windows 7 drivers.&nbsp; Or even Vista
 drivers which should work.&nbsp; You have an Intel 855GME chipset... you might also want to check the Intel website and see if you can find something there.<br />
<br />
Link for Toshiba is <a href="http://www.csd.toshiba.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.csd.toshiba.com</a> and Intel is www.intel.com<br />

<h2>            No Sound&#33; Need help ASAP</h2>
                    I recently bought a wireless earphones. When I used Skype at that time, my friend could not hear me when I used the earphone. Skype then prompted me, "do you want to use this wireless earphone for Skype now?" and i clicked yes because if not my friend
 could not hear me. However, now when I want to use Skype with other earphones or without an earphone entirely, my friends can't hear me. How do I solve this? How can I switch from one earphone to another and to without earphones without having this sound problem.
 Thanks<br />

</p><p><span><span>Make sure that the audio device you want to use is properly listed on the Skype application and make sure that you un-check the auto adjust on the volume and do a test call using that specific device. You may also refer to the articles below

<p>Hi, all</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have received an increase in the number of reports from&nbsp;users who are experiencing the same issue, and our developers are now diagnosing the cause of this. For the meantime, please use another Skype account temporarily to continue using the service.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are working to fix this issue, but do not have a time estimate of when it will be
<em>fully&nbsp;resolved</em>. Rest assured a fix will be rolled out once it's available.</p>

<p>Try to sign out of Skype and then sign in again with the same account. This may fix the connection issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just switching Skype off or re-installing will not help.</p>
