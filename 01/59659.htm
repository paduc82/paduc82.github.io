            My friend has an old xp laptop running paradox 5.0 and it is not being baced up. It only contains customer information, about 4700 customers.&nbsp; How can you save all of the data in one file? Like csv? Could that not then be imported to MS access&gt;?

<p>Might be worth it to spend $30 US on it for you, might not.</p>

<h2>            MS 1080p camera has never worked properly</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I purchased a MS 1080p LifeCam Studio model 1425&nbsp;from MS a couple of years ago.&nbsp; It has never worked properly.&nbsp; When I turn it on there are always green and pink shadow lines or shapes on my screen and &nbsp;they will not go away.&nbsp; I have tried setting
 it up outside with regular daylight, with a camera box that we use at work etc.&nbsp; The lines never leave.&nbsp; I have tried this with a couple of computers.&nbsp; My laptop now is a widows 10, it didn't work with my 8.1 either.&nbsp; I just put it away.&nbsp; But I need to use
 it.&nbsp; Once again MS seems to be a boondoggle and waste of $.&nbsp; please advise.&nbsp; thanks, Dennis</p>

<p>Hi Dennis, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Basing on the description of your issue and considering the steps you've taken to determine its root cause, the issue has something to do with the camera itself. Having said this, we suggest that you check the warranty of the item on the physical or online
 store where you purchased the item from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your reference, see this <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/webcams/lifecam-studio/q2f-00013#specsColumns-testCarousel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link
</a></strong>(go to <strong>Specifications </strong>and look for the "<strong>Three-year limited warranty</strong>" information on the right side of the page).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any questions and/or clarifications. <br />

<li>&nbsp;You bought a Microsoft product "a couple of years ago."</li><li>&nbsp;It didn't work properly.</li><li>&nbsp;You didn't save the receipt.</li><li>&nbsp;You "set it aside," apparently for "a couple of years."</li><li>&nbsp;You made no attempt at the time to get an adjustment, because "...it was just MS crap as usual."</li><li>&nbsp;You bought the product under the belief that Microsoft products are "crap."</li></ol>

<p>Yes, It does make perfect sense,&nbsp; aren't you ever overwhelmed by the constant drone and crush&nbsp;of having to deal with yet another small obstacle??&nbsp; This was not a big purchase, it cost less than a hundred dollars.&nbsp; So, after fooling with it for several hours&nbsp;
 a day for &nbsp;a few days I had to get to something else. I went and purchased&nbsp;different bulbs to try with it, did that and played around some&nbsp;more and still &nbsp;didn't help.&nbsp; I tried a different computer, that didn't help.&nbsp; I was fed up so I put it aside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now,&nbsp; after a pause, I had a bit of time and a different computer to try.&nbsp; So now the new attempts.&nbsp; It does seem to be working better with a Window 7 that I&nbsp; jut got from a friend.&nbsp; I do have some hopes for it&nbsp; now.&nbsp; But this weird pink green haze is&nbsp;the
 issue and what I &nbsp;want to address.&nbsp; There are no booklets anymore with MS products, you can't google this problem and get any answers. &nbsp;We are supposed to wade through MS massive website that for me is such a hassle to decipher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry that I am&nbsp;not someone&nbsp;who loves to play on the computer, sorry that I don't know how to navigate through the piles and piles of stuff that are put in our way to deal with.&nbsp;This one huge site is kind of ridiculous, try looking up cameras on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can be sarcastic if you want, glad that you are so clever that you are never overwhelmed and are always on top of your life.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have little time to play on a computer, I like most older folks still have to work a normal real job.
</p>
<p>I didn't buy it thinking that MS products are crap, we use a different older model at work and don't have problems with it, so I bought it trusting MS.&nbsp; &nbsp;I said it was MS crap because I spent literally 40&nbsp;hours, I kept a log, &nbsp;with tech support trying to
 install&nbsp;WIndows 10 being told&nbsp;over and over that it would work.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, they admitted that it wouldn't and they gave up and had to reset my computer back to 8.1. I do have&nbsp;window 10 as a factory install and it works fine.&nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<p>So, MS makes a lot of mistakes and we are all the ones who pay for them.&nbsp; My ex brother in law worked for MS for 17 years and left in disgust&nbsp;due to&nbsp;the direction away from customer service that MS decided to take.&nbsp; Ask a friend&nbsp; was a joke and insult to
 their customer base, us.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is why I didn't put much more effort into the camera. &nbsp;I am worn out with MS and&nbsp;hope to never buy another&nbsp;MS product.&nbsp; I use CAD though and so far that is the only OS that will run my program.&nbsp;Thanks so much for your help.

            Hello, In closing, I purchased this camera in March of 2015 had not thrown the receipt away.&nbsp; Just filed it away. .&nbsp; I did solve this problem yesterdaymm which was all I wanted.&nbsp; Got no help there, guess no one else has every had issues.&nbsp;I played around
 with lighting again and found the three small LED lights placed&nbsp; outside of the light box has taken ALL of the green and pink ghosts away. So, if anyone else has issues maybe this will help them.&nbsp; thanks, Dennis

<p>It's 24 kills only if you're using Hardline or are using the Specialist package and thus earn Hardline when you get all perks at 8 kills. &nbsp;Otherwise, it's 25 kills.</p>

<p>Its a kill streak "built within the game", meaning you dont have to equipt it. If you get 25 kills (weapon, equiptment, knife, grenade, etc) NOT including kill streak kills of the KSRs you are currently running, then the MOAB will appear and you set it off.
 Its like a mini tactical nuke. It will kill the whole other team and leave an EMP effect, but the other team will spawn in and the game continues. Its NOT a "game ending" KSR. Jagriff has a great video of obtaining one (No camping).</p>

<h2>            My computer keeps turning off at random points and I have no idea why. </h2>
                    I have performed virus scans I've had it about 2 months and it used to stay on longer. I thought it was because of heat since my fan is small and doesn't seem to work very well, but now it's turning off when it's not so hot. It's a compaq laptop with windows
 7 and cox&nbsp; Mcafee suite.<br />
<br />
<br />
and I have no problem turning it back on afterwards.

            Do you see a blue screen with an error message on it? &nbsp;My HP Laptop has started doing this randomly and I have not been able to get the error written down before it disappears and the computer is restarting. &nbsp;It has been really random. &nbsp;I tried to restore
 Windows 7 to an earlier, stable setting, but it didn't work. &nbsp;I am now keeping a paper/pen near the computer in the hopes of getting the error message written down so I learn how to fix it. &nbsp;I am about to go into a couple of weeks of teaching classes all day
 from my laptop, so I need to get this thing to quit shutting down.

<p>See if appears anything when you execute the Startup Troubleshooter.</p>
<p>To start Xbox Startup Troubleshooter, follow these steps:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Power off your console, and then unplug the power cord to ensure that the console is completely powered off.</li><li>Wait 30 seconds, then plug the power cord back in.</li><li>Press and hold the BIND button (located on the left side of the console) and the EJECT button (located on the front of the console), and then press the Xbox button&nbsp; on the console.
<strong>[Note The Xbox One S All-Digital Edition does not have an EJECT button. You can bring up the Xbox Startup Troubleshooter on this console by holding only the BIND button (steps 3 &amp; 4) and then pressing the Xbox button.]</strong></li><li>Continue holding the BIND and EJECT buttons for 10-15 seconds.</li><li>Listen for two ‚Äúpower-up‚Äù tones a couple of seconds apart. You can release the BIND and EJECT buttons after the second power-up tone. The console should power up and take you directly to the Xbox Startup Troubleshooter.</li></ol>
<p>If this troubleshooter starts, and you can see the image is not any issue with HDMI, then if that happen we can help after, so see if it appears.</p>

            By chance, is your console still under warranty? If so, or even if not though, you may want to look into service options if the troubleshooting doesn't work. Sorry to hear about this. Is the console older or relatively new?

            So I started seeing this issue on my Xbox One X in just the past week and while I was able to get it back up and working after messing around with it I found that I was somehow able to replicate the issue if I watched any 4K content on the Netflix app
 specifically. At the time I was running the May 2019 Xbox One System Update and so I tried doing an Offline Update to the June 2019 System Update and that seemed to help a little bit but I am still noticing some hiccups here and there.

            Hello Jan. I am a fellow Community member here to help. I'm sorry to hear your face in this difficulty. I know it is very frustrating.<br /><br />This is a common issue with the new version of Skype. Unfortunately, the new Skype is still under development and as such as lacking many of the features and functionality of the classic version of Skype. It also has quite a few bugs that have been identified.<br /><br />While there is not yet and ETA, it is expected that Microsoft will begin rapidly releasing updates for Skype in the very near future. These updates will add features and functionality and address any known bugs.<br /><br />In the meantime, Microsoft has decided to continue support for classic Skype into the foreseeable future. If you are interested in returning to Classic Skype please see the following link<br /><br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>

            When someone signs in to Skype, their status will show them as being online.
<br />
<br />However, sometimes they may not be visible straight away or they may have set their status to Invisible.
<br />
<br />If the contact is online, you can call them or send them instant messages even if their status has not yet been updated. If you do call or instant message them, their status will usually be updated immediately, unless they have chosen to be invisible.

            Andre - what you said is so NOT true.....my contact is not invisible and does not get the IM....the contact has switched back to the old Skype (while Windows is trying to straighten things out) and she now hears me calls.

<h2>            Image&#47;Video Posting Rules &#91;07&#47;08&#47;11&#93;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, my peeps. We got a fun <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/forum_faq/f/6/p/35286/209149.aspx#209149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forum update</a> today from DMZilla, the community manager:[quote user="DMZilla"]<span> The ability to post multimedia content is a privilege and new to the xbox.com forums. Here are general rules for posting images/video in posts and signatures:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>General Image/Video Posting:</strong></p>
<p>- Cannot be offensive. If there is any question, then don't post it. Moderator decision is final.</p>
<p>- Cannot violate the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Legal/LiveTOU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(119, 187, 68, 1)">Terms of Use</span></strong></a>&nbsp;or Code of Conduct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- One image per post unless you are providing examples/repro steps for an issue in the Support Section.</p>
<p>- 600 pixels wide or less.</p>
<p>- Cases of nudity, extremely offensive content such as racism, and spam/thread hijacking can result in punishments extending beyond just access to the Xbox.com forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Posting Images in Signatures:</strong></p>
<p>- Same rules apply as above&nbsp;</p>
<p>- No animated .GIF images</p>
<p>- 125 pixels or less height. There may be some leniency here if you are over by a couple pixels. This rule is in place to limit thread hijacking threads with large signatures. Mods may edit your signature. Failure to comply after that can result in a suspension.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;<span>No use of the official Xbox, Xbox LIVE, or Microsoft logos ‚Äì These logos are trademarks or registered trademarks of Microsoft Corporation, and all rights are reserved. We appreciate that many of you want to show your love of Xbox, but the logo in
 the signature could be mistaken for official representation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just like other rude and abusive behavior that breaks ToU/CoC, if you come across any posts that contain offensive images please use the tool at the end of the respective post to report as abusive so our Moderation team can take action as necessary.[/quote]So
 what does this mean? It means we are giving you the lovely privilege of posting&nbsp;pics and vids in posts and have images in your sigs. [:D]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, please follow the rules closely. It's a big responsibility and I'm sure you guys and gals are responsible enough with showing your
<em>Halo</em> pride in your sigs as before.</p>
<p>But, if you see anyone break these rules, don't hesitate to report the post, user, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please ask either me, Bogeh, or any other moderator, Support member, or Xbox Staff here. Thanks much. Happy Gaming. [Y]</p>

<p>UGH! I'm getting really sick of this website. I can't edit my above post because I get a server error from the website, and I can' edit my signature because it refuses to save. I delete the "[Image Removed]" and press save, it says "Changes Saved. May take
 up to 10 minutes blah blah blah", yet the "[Image Removed]" is STILL in the box. Why is this website still so buggy?!</p>

<h2>            Logitech c920 and Camera app</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a problem with my Logitech c920 and the Camera app. The camera works with the Logitech software, and the Camera app also works. However, the Camera app doesn't seem to be able to find the camera. Instead, it uses the camera that's built in to
 my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This just started two weeks or so ago after several months of flawless performance, so I'm very confused. I've already checked the drivers, and they're up to date. Not sure what else the problem could be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for your help.</p>

<h2>            what does &#38;quot&#59;You can use this app for now or buy it to own forever&#38;quot&#59; mean&#63; I already bought it&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi! So, I bought the digital version of Dragon Age Inquisition GOTY Edition &amp; I noticed that when looking at the DLC (in the digital store) even though it says "This product is installed", right beneath that it says "You can use this app for now or buy it
 to own forever" &amp; there is also an option to "Buy a copy" &amp; I'm curious as to what these mean? Do they imean that I only have access to the content for some limited time (perhaps only as long as I am a gold member?) Or is there another meaning?</p>
<p>I also notice this when I look at the DLC for Fallout 4 (in the digital store). I have a physical copy of Fallout 4, I bought the season pass &amp; all the dlc is installed but when I went to see if there was a new dlc released I noticed that now right below
 where it says "This product is installed" is the sentence "You can use this app for now or buy it to own forever" &amp; again, just like with DA I GOTY there is also an option to "Buy a copy"</p>
<p>what gives?</p>

            <p>Hey I0NZEU5 -</p>
<p>Do you currently have an EA Access subscription? Or did you at any time in the past? If so, you may want to uninstall your Dragon Age: Inquisition DLC and reinstall it to see if that helps resolve the issue.</p>
<p>As far as your Fallout 4 Season Pass, could you please Private Message me a screenshot of your purchase confirmation for the pass so we can look into things further? You can check your&nbsp;<a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Commerce</a>&nbsp;page then use <a href="https://onedrive.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneDrive</a> or any other popular image hosting website to host your image.</p>
<p><span>To private message me, click the tiny envelope below my post.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks! :)</span></p>

<p>Evil I think its because the update caused some DRM issues. A year or 2 ago I had 3 xbox 360 games that I had bought digitally &amp; then after an update I was unable to play them UNLESS my 360 is connected to Live. No Live, no games. M$ never fixed the problem.
 This is why I should've learned my lesson with digital purchases.</p>

<p>I've been seeing this on some of my games as eel recently. I assume it's yet another update hiccup, much like how when you are looking through the game store now on Xbox One it stops scrolling and you don't get to look at all of the games available...I thought
 when I upgraded to the S I simply wouldn't install the preview program again to avoid these foolish issues, but I guess the problem is with the design team.</p>

<h2>            connecting surface pro 2 to an imac via thubnderbolt</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Can anyone help me? I want to connect my surface pro 2 to a imac via its thunderbolt so I can use it as a second screen but I am unsure what cable to use. I know the 27" imac uses a mini display but on my 21.5" it only has a thunderbolt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

            The problem has been resolved.&nbsp; After much effort on the Microsoft Support Team, they determined that a program from the Microsoft Store had downloaded a file "
<p><span>HEVC Video extension app".&nbsp; They could not find this in the store.&nbsp; However, after removal, the update (KB4041994) was not offered again through Windows Update.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>During the process, downloaded the Microsoft Program to hide this update until a resolution was found. &nbsp;</span>"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3183922/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-windows-update-from-reinstalling-in-windo

            <p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing this may require more advanced steps than simply copying a file from the AppData folder. Kindly answer these questions so we can assist you better:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will you be doing this for different users on the same computer, or for different computers in a domain?</li><li>Did you find a suggestion worth trying? How did it go?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You can follow these steps if you will be applying the changes to multiple user accounts on a single computer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Customize the Start menu for one user account on the computer.</li><li>Right-click on the <strong>Windows </strong>icon on your home screen.</li><li>Choose <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Yes </strong>if you are prompted for access.</li><li>Copy and paste this command in the window: <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>powershell export-startlayout ‚Äìpath
<span>%UserProfile%\Desktop\Default_Start_Screen_Layout</span>.xml -as xml</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You will find a file on the desktop named <strong>Default_Start_Screen_Layout.xml</strong> (you can rename it or move it to another location).</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>Start</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type <strong>Edit group policy</strong> then press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Open all the user accounts you want the changes to be applied to.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Expand <strong>Start Menu and Taskbar</strong> and double-click on
<strong>Start Screen Layout</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>Enabled.</strong></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type the full path of the .xml file you created in the
<strong>Start Layout File</strong> field.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click <strong>Apply </strong>then <strong>OK</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>Let us know how the steps above work out for you.</p>

<p>Hello, I was trying to find answer to this as well and looks I found it finnaly. I would also like to copy Start Menu to Microsoft Account and Desktop Icons, PC Settings, Colors, TaskBar Layout to another Account. Right now I am using Local Account and I
 want it deleted. Reason I created Local Acc is that if I Logged In to Microsoft Acc during installation of Win 10 name of User Account folder would have 5 letters (taken from my E-mail). A lot of people hates that and they don't know what to do. But I made
 huge mistake back at the they when I installed Win 10, I totally forgot to enable Microsoft Acc in NetPlwiz&gt;Advanced&gt;lusmgr and switch to Microsoft Acc and just disable or even delete Local Acc, instead of that I totally configured Local Acc and if I switch
 to MS Acc I would need to configure everything all over again. So to make this shorter, how to copy all layouts (Desktop, Start Menu, Taskbar, Action Center...), Settings, Colors (from Settings as well) to another Acc (Microsoft Acc)? Reason I would like to
 do that is because I have problems with installing programs on my PC so I need to switch to MS Acc to successfully install software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you will understand what I want to do. I just have problems with installing sofware while Logged in to Local Acc and I don't even know why is that happening. I set this Local Acc to Admin Acc, but just nothing helps. And I would like to move everything
 to MS Acc and delete this Local one that is making me a lot of trouble because I just wanted to have a correct name on Root User folder. Some users really have problems with this 5 letter user names, for example my E-mail is strahinja... and if I logged in
 to MS Acc while installing Win 10 my name would be Strah. In Serbian that means Fear. Strah=Fear. It maybe sounds funny but it will be awesome if Microsoft fix that. :)</p>
<p>

Asus z77 motherboard<br />
950w PSU<br />

2.I have not had any recent changes to the computer besides the usual software and driver updates through windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.Mostly Titanfall<br />
<br />
4.Apart from games it looks like another common system error is OneDrive crashing or failing.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
On a side note I actually have disabled the intel 4000 graphics driver because when it was enabled my computer would not display on my monitors through my GTX 670. I have indeed though re-installed Nvidias graphic drivers without any luck. &nbsp;</p>

<br />
Thank you for the details.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Did you try to boot the computer in clean boot?<br />
<br />
I‚Äôd like you to know that the issue is being caused by ‚Äú<span>Intel(R) Common User Interface‚Äù and your NVidia graphics card seems to be working fine.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to run hardware and devices troubleshooter and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a) Press the ‚Äú<strong>Windows + C</strong><span>‚Äù<strong> </strong>
</span>to activate the charms menu.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b) Click on ‚Äú<strong>search</strong><span>‚Äù<strong> </strong></span>and select ‚Äú<strong>settings</strong><span>‚Äù<strong>
</strong></span>and type ‚Äú<strong>Troubleshooting</strong><span>‚Äù<strong> </strong>
</span>and select ‚Äú<strong>troubleshooting‚Äô</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c) Click on ‚Äú<strong>Hardware and Sound‚Äù </strong>and select ‚Äú<strong>Hardware and Devices‚Äù
</strong>and click on next to run the troubleshooter.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may also try to update the Intel drivers using the </span>

            Ran troubleshooter<br />
<br />
It suggested I enable intel's 4000 igpu<br />
<br />
I selected yes and my computer froze. Rebooting the pc resulted in a black screen as the computer tried to output off the motherboard igpu instead of my gtx 670.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Booted into safe mode and disabled the igpu again as I have before and now my computer again boots off my gtx 670. Freezing game still persists with this error&nbsp;

            clean boot could not duplicate the issue as games in safe mode run terribly. I flashed my BIOS and the intel hd 4000 drivers are no longer on my system but the game still crashes.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can configure OneDrive's sync data now that you have Windows 10. There is an option to choose which OneDrive folders you want to sync online. Here's how you can open the settings available in the OneDrive app:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the OneDrive icon on your notification area.</li><li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Go to the <strong>Account </strong>tab.</li><li>Click on <strong>Choose folders</strong>.</li><li>Uncheck the folders you'd like to stop syncing to the OneDrive server.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the steps provided above help you about the concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post your questions if you have any.</p>
