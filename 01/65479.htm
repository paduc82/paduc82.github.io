<h2>            Windows 10 Dual Monitor Background Slideshow sometimes image is split between the monitors</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Windows 10 PC I have a dual monitor setup. I use a slideshow option for my background images and really like how it puts a different image on each monitor. However, sometimes an image comes up and half of it is on the left monitor and half is on the
 right monitor. Almost like it thinks the two monitors are actually one and the image is centered. Is there an image size that tells Windows 10 when to do this? If not, what would be the reason for this happening and how can I stop it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>David Endsley</p>

<h2>            Which guns are best&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am on chapter 6 and have the regular plasma welder (sorry don't know the actual names), the **** rifle, the ripper blade, and the lance i think it is called, but it looks like a bigger version of the plasma welder. I didn't know what guns you choose
 during the game, and which ones have more a kick now that the game is getting harder?</p>

<p>First I want to say you're the man for playing the first game first.&nbsp; So many people bought the second game first because it's what's hot.&nbsp; Despite what some people say the story is important.&nbsp; Shame on all of those who started with the 2nd game.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The weapons you mentioned are called the Plasma Cutter, Pulse Rifle, Ripper, and Line Gun, respectively.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It all comes down to personal preference.&nbsp; But, you should always carry the Plasma Cutter.&nbsp; The ammo is cheap and plentiful, and it's pretty strong when fully upgraded.&nbsp; It's a great all purpose weapon.&nbsp; The Pulse Rifle is great for fast moving things small
 or large.&nbsp; Besides those any will do, but I prefer two which you didn't mention.&nbsp; Weapon spoilers will follow so stop reading now if you don't want to know.&nbsp; When you discover the Force Gun, keep that forever.&nbsp; That's your best friend.&nbsp; It's essentially a
 shotgun.&nbsp; You don't even have to aim.&nbsp; Just shoot in the general direction of the enemy.&nbsp; It's great for things that come out of nowhere or things that are coming at you fast.&nbsp; The secondary function is essentially a grenade.&nbsp; The last gun I always kept with
 me is the Contact Beam.&nbsp; It's does a great deal of damage.&nbsp; You can also keep it for collecting the ammo and selling it for a good price.&nbsp; I personally hate the Ripper, and the Line Gun is a bigger version of the Plasma Cutter.&nbsp; So to recap my favorite layout
 was always the Plasma Cutter, Pulse Rifle, Force Gun, and Contact Beam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind that most of guns you get aren't that strong until you upgrade them.&nbsp; They're all pretty effective when they're upgraded.&nbsp; When you beat the game, you can start a new game and start with the equipment you had when you finished the game.&nbsp; It's
 a good way to get achievements, if that's your thing.&nbsp; When you beat a game, it will ask you to save.&nbsp; Whatever you do, DO NOT overwrite this save or delete it. You load that "Cleared Game" save to do as I said above.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to post as many questions as you can think of.&nbsp; I think I'm the only person who checks this forum often lol.</p>

<p>Im gonna &nbsp;sell the ripper for maybe the force gun or the contact beam. That's the one you have to charge before using right ? Im really carefuland always look behind me whenever i am being attacked so IDK about the force gun. Are there gonna be a lot of
 big enemies where the contact beam will be useful towards them? But Im gonna switch things up a bit anyway.</p>
<p>I couldn't jump into the second game without playing the first one. The story to me is a big point and is why i bought the game other than the horror aspect.

<p>There aren't really any big enemies that you need the contact beam for. &nbsp;It does help with the last boss, but the Plasma Cutter fully upgraded makes short work of most things. &nbsp;You really should try the Force Gun. &nbsp;It's the best gun in both Dead Space 1,
 and Dead Space 2. &nbsp;It got me through Impossible, Zealot, and Hardcore with relatively no problems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If I were you I would upgrade two weapons, maybe the PC and the FG. &nbsp;If you haven't already upgraded your health and stasis, it makes the game much easier. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks Thookins, I've ignored the Force gun due to it's description...I'm gonna give it a try tonight. I have to say though that the line gun is really handy for the oncomming threat. If you keep it upgraded, one shot to the legs of a sprinting enemy will
 drop it to the ground and then you can pick off another limb with the PC....that's been my tactic so far, but I'm definitely going to bring the force gun with me into chapter 11.</p>

<p>The force gun was my favorite in this game and the second one as well. Even though it's range is far less than the other guns, once fully upgraded it's a beast when you got to get up close and personal with some annoying necros lol. I bought the steam punk
 force gun and I used that and the plasma cutter on my impossible playthrough. </p>

<p>The Plasma Cutter is all you really need in my opinion. BUT if you really wanted to epically OWN enemies, some fun weapons are the Force Gun and Flamethrower. But I mean really... who uses anything other than the plasma cutter to beat the game?</p>

<p>&nbsp;But I mean really... who uses anything other than the plasma cutter to beat the game?</p>
<p>[/quote]I only used the Plasma Cutter when I had to hit something far away or when I need some pinpoint accuracy.&nbsp; The Force Gun is the best gun imo in both DS1, and DS2.&nbsp; It made Impossible, Zealot, and Hard Core super easy.&nbsp; Made getting 1000/1000 and
 1250/1250 not too hard.&nbsp; Plus the secondary fire is different in both games, and cool in both games.&nbsp; Personally I got tired of using the Plasma Cutter.&nbsp; Just got bored with it.&nbsp; I like the Force Gun because if anything jumps out at you or gets too close,
 just fire once (with or without aiming) and they're dead or far away and almost dead. &nbsp;</p>

<p>the listings can be updated as above.Also,if it is a desktop pc,remove MB battery for 12 minutes</p>
<p>or so,repllace,start pc,enter BIOS and reset date/time etc,this clears the CMOS.Also,dell has a boot</p>

<p>in basic mode,within 5 minutes it'll say ok,or problems exist.Otherwise as it states,it could run 24</p>

<a href="http://www.crucial.com/systemscanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Crucial System Scanner software to find out what type of memory is in your computer.</a>&nbsp; They also have competitive prices so that it makes it unnecessary to buy elsewhere and take a chance the spec's will be
 off.&nbsp; But if you want, you can copy the specs into Google to compare prices from other vendors but just make sure none of the specs change at all.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you didn't spec your RAM correctly, most seller's will let you replace it and might even help you confirm the correct specs.&nbsp; Any decent seller will stand behind their RAM such that I've never heard of anyone being stuck with RAM that doesn't work or
 is wrong for their PC's.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Some maker's have better Support like Kingston who back their RAM for life and will help you spec or correct it, make it right no matter what it takes.</p>

            The download went well, but no change in the problem. &nbsp; By a hunch, I thought the viewer might be the HP program [printer] I have. &nbsp; I re-installed their Image thing and the document viewer problem went away ! !! ! ! &nbsp; &nbsp; The window showing the need for
 a windows installer did not show any relationship to a manufacturer or brand. &nbsp; &nbsp;Problem solved until the next time. &nbsp; This one occurred during restart after downloading a Win update. . . . &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks !

<h3> jodierobinson20885  say:</h3>
<h2>            Your update has completely screwed up my laptop&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Several times I rejected the &nbsp;Windows 8.1 update as the first time I attempted the update it mucked up both the laptops in our house and I had to factory reset them both. Then it automatically tried downloading to one of our houses laptops even though
 I have automatic updates switched off. The update did not work properly, an error message appeared and it said it was converting back to the original Windows 8. An error then happened with this and now my laptop is completely unusable. It won't let me factory
 reset either as I then get another error message. I am very angry and upset with Microsoft for forcing this on me when my laptop worked fine before the update. I bought a Windows 8 laptop which is what I wanted, not a Windows 8.1. And looking at the feeds
 it seems your update is causing all sorts of trouble for a lot of people. Is there a ombudsmen or trading standards person we can complain to because there does not seem to &nbsp;a place to complain on your site.

            As stated in my original post, my laptop is unusable!!!! The update to 8.1 failed, the revert back to my original windows failed and it will not let me do a system restore or factory reset. How then would you suggest I upgrade to 8.1??? Everytime I have
 tried on any of the 3 laptops in my house it has screwed them up and now my main laptop can not be used. You have no complaints line or any useful help system. I have complained to Watchdog about your company and will be taking things further. I think Microsoft
 have ruined enough peoples laptops.

 by this forced, unwanted update and they don't seem to be doing anything to fix the problem.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the laptop-in-question?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Did the computer come with Win8 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win8, or did you upgrade a (e.g., Win7) computer to Win8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c. When (exact date) did you do the factory reset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your currently-installed <em>third-party</em> anti-virus application or security suite&nbsp;(i.e.,
<em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>), if any, and <em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. What third-party anti-malware applications (i.e., <em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>) are installed, if any? &nbsp;What third-party firewall, if any?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer<em>&nbsp;since you bought it?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em>when you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>6a. Is&nbsp;KB3049563, KB3045171, KB3046002, KB3023223, KB3035489, KB3055642, KB3050514, KB3051768, and/or KB3061518&nbsp;listed in

<p>
</p><p>6c. Has Windows 8.1 ever been offered to your computer via the Windows Store <em>
since you did the factory reset?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>7a. What Update Version &amp; KB number are displayed in the <em>second line of text</em> in IE10's Help | About [<strong>Alt+H+A</strong>] tab; e.g.,

<br />
8. Is Adobe Flash Player <strong>v17.0.0.188 </strong>installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>1a) The laptop is only 1 year and a few months old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b) Windows 8 was already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c) I can not reset it as it is giving me error message. The unwanted windows 8.1 installation is what screwed it up and I didn't even ask it to install (rejected installing it several times after the first time it installed itself on my laptop and I had
 to reset the whole thing, as windows 8.1 kept crashing my laptop). This second (unwanted) install failed due to error, it said it was reverting back to windows 8, then it said there was an error doing that and now the laptop will not let me factiry reset it
 as it </p>
<p>error message and all my restore points are gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2/3/4/5) Mcafee is on my computer, nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6a/6b) If I could get into the update bit without the laptop crashing I would check those numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6c) Yes windows 8.1 was offered several times after I had to reset my laptop, after the first time it installed. I kept rejecting the offer but it the went and forcefully attempted installing itself on my laptop which then failed which now leaves my laptop
 I the unusable state its in now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7a) Again if I could look up those update numbers and version without the laptop crashing I would.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7b) Only internet explorer is on the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8) Cant test Adobe without it freezing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9) I don't even know what a registry clean is so no I never done</p>
<p>
</p><p>so all in all my laptop is ruined because of Microsoft. I hope they end up getting investigated and all the hundreds of thousands of people who have had their laptops ruined sue Microsoft.</p>

    <title>Win 8 &#58; Windows update download doesn&#39;t progress beyond 0 KB - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Win 8 &#58; Windows update download doesn&#39;t progress beyond 0 KB 0&#37;</h2>
                    I am struggling with the Windows updates on a new laptop with pre-installed Win 8.<br />
The Update process and associated tasks seem inconsistent and asks for more thorough (re-)testing.<br />
<br />
Among the many issues I face (1: see below) I noticed like many the lasting "Download progress (0KB - 0%)" in the Windows Update window.<br />
I thought first that the server was too busy or my internet connection was bad.<br />
I also pointed out that the Windows Update troubleshooting fixed some bad configuration at no avail.
<br />
<br />
Finally I further noticed that, though 0% progress is displayed, there was some activities linked to the update process :<br />
<ul>
<li>disk very busy</li><li>Windows Modules Installer Worker (TiWorker.exe) quite busy</li><li>C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download directory showing creation and deletion of directories</li></ul>
So, what is going on in the background at that time? Why does Win 8 behave that way? What is it actually doing?<br />
<br />
After a long time, 15 minutes or even more depending on the number of pending updates you select, the update process finally downloads some files and the installation takes place.<br />
<br />
I would appreciate a comprehensive explanation of the whole process which looks different compared to Win 7 behavior.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
(1) : <br />
<ul>
<li>failed updates with undocumented error code</li><li>lost of update history within Windows Update interface followed by re-installation</li><li>sfc /scannow command showing errors ...</li></ul>

<h2>            Epson Workforce545 offline- Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Hello- I have a fairly new&nbsp; Toshiba and Windows 8. My Epson Workforce 545 has suddenly gone 'offline'. The status report from the printer reads as connected and the wi-fi light is on. It is still checked&nbsp; as the default printer but in the control panel is
 offline and will not print. One error message from the printer said it was not connected to the computer but the link status has it connected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am not sure why-it has been working fine and there have been no changes. I went in and allowed sharing just in case that was the issue and turned off airplane mode (both suggestions were online) and have reached the peak of my technical expertise-any
 help would be appreciated thanks-Lisa</p>

<h2>            Xbox App &#40;Win10&#41; Crashes on initial open</h2>
                    <p>Hi. This is more of a nuisance than anything else. The first time I&nbsp;open the Xbox App on my Windows 10 Pro x64 system, it crashes. I&nbsp;can then relaunch the app and it runs pretty fine. I've noticed that sometimes messaging doesn't stay up to date; inbound messages are reported by Windows but do not always show in the app. I&nbsp;figured I&nbsp;would report the app crashing though and maybe it is something the developers can do something about, or maybe there is a fix I&nbsp;am unable to find.

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming to the forums today. I'd be happy to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does it say when you try to sign in manually? Do you get any error message or codes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you connect to the Internet via cable or wireless?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go ahead and do a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console">
 turn on the Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help, you may need to try a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
soft factory reset</a>. You can keep your game and apps installed while getting the console reset, but make sure to have your account login information ready and also make sure to select Manual set up when it asks you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give those a try first and let us know the results.</p>

            I dont get any error codes. The console goes through the motions of signing in but after about 5 minutes of waiting I always just restart it. When i turn the xbox back on, it signs me in automatically. This is a new issue, it started about 3 weeks ago
 but it is every time i turn the xbox on.&nbsp;

<p>Hi there Messy, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out. I'm sorry to hear about the issue with the Xbox&nbsp;signing in on the Xbox.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend to try the troubleshooting steps provided by XBF Javier. Sounds like it can either be the network connection to the Xbox One or the operating system of the console.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. </p>

<h2>            Error Installing Sea Of Thieves Anniversary Edition on Dell Precision 7730...</h2>
                    I purchased the game Sea Of Thieves from Amazon and received a code to redeem in the Windows store.&nbsp; I successfully redeemed the code and showed the game in my library.&nbsp; When the program started to download, it would go for about 3-5 seconds and then fail.&nbsp;
 The error code that is given is Code: 0x80080206.&nbsp; I have reinstalled the Microsoft Store and still the same error.&nbsp; I have tried downloading the game from two different internet sources and same error.&nbsp; I've loaded the latest feature version of Windows 10
 to see if that would help, but still the same error.<br />
<br />
Anyone offer any suggestions or help so I can play the game I paid for?<br />
<br />
Thank you!

            Hi i'm Peter an independant advisor, please try the following:
<br />
<br />This error code is usually displayed when windows is unable to determine if you are using a genuine version of Windows. Since, you are getting this error when trying to install an app, I would suggest you try these steps and check:
<br />
<br />Method 1: Modern app troubleshooter
<br />
<br />This issue could also be caused due to an app error. So, I would suggest you to download and run the Modern app troubleshooter to fix any app errors. You can download it here:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F2...</a>
<br />
<br />Method 2: Reset store cache and check
<br />
<br />If you are unable to install any apps, you can try resetting the store cache and then try to install and check. Refer these steps:
<br />
<br />a) Press Windows key +R, type “WSReset” and press enter
<br />b) Check if it takes you to a store page which displays that the cache has been reset
<br />c) Now try to install the app and check.

            I have done both of these according to google searches and neither one have helped.&nbsp; I have a valid version of windows since it is supplied by my company and checking the Activation setting shows it's valid per the organization.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate, Acer Aspire E15 laptop built in camera problem.</h2>
                    <p>I have an odd problem. <br />
<br />
I'm running</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dcc60d30-df99-489a-a371-e4dacff50635" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop model is <br />

<p>
</p><p>and First of all, as You can see - Acer only provides drivers for this Laptop model for windows 8 which is crazy because for ex I'm running windows 7 on it or what if I wanna downgrade to windows XP , how will I get drivers for my laptop?
<br />
<br />
So my web cam driver has automatically installed with windows BUT there is a problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My camera only work with Skype and Firefox/Chrome. <br />
<br />
Skype normally recognizes it : <br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>but no other software can find and use the camera. <br />

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66b8c4af-a1a9-47cb-a2b3-aeeb0b5fa454" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>even webcam7 after choosing the webcam as a source just gives out a black screen :
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b1c831f3-3289-4d88-a9d4-7b316c3a701c" /></p>

<p>
</p><p>on top of that, the usual windows software that normally comes with the windows called Camera -&nbsp; doesn't exist.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The Camera does show up under the devices.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5fa9e577-c2d3-4f31-bef5-d25af474a5b8" /></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling the driver. Installing a new one. I've tried everything I could find online and NOTHING seems to work.
<br />
<br />
It's almost a new laptop and it's crazy that I can't use such a common feature as the webcam.
<br />
<br />
I will send the same message to Acers Customer care and see what will they say but I have reached a wall and don't know what next can I do?
<br />
<br />
Tnx for taking the time to read this and for any effort to help in the future :) </p>

    <title>Element not found 0x80070490 error when trying to create a backup - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Element not found 0x80070490 error when trying to create a backup</h2>
                    When I try to create a backup in Windows 8 using File History, I first get the message "Windows 7 backup is currently configured&nbsp; and must be disabled to configure File History" with a link "Configure Windows 7 Backup" (even though I am on Windows 8)<br />
<br />
However I do not wish to use File History because I want to create a full partition image in case the entire disk dies.<br />
<br />
I click on "Configure WIndows 7 Backup" and click on "Backup up now" and I get a popup saying "Windows could not launch the automatic backup job for the following reason: Element not found. (0x80070490) Try again."<br />
<br />
When I click on "Turn off schedule" I get the same error, and the 'turn off schedule' link dissapears afterwards. However when I close the Windows 7 File Recovery window and open it again, the link to turn off schedule is there again. I also looked in Windows
 Task Scheduler and there does not seem to be any backup scheduled.<br />
<br />
How do I resolve this?<br />

            <p>Hi DarioVolaric,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and we are glad to assist you.</p>
<p>I would like you to answer few questions.</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you have two operating systems installed on your computer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you trying to save the back up in the place where Windows 7 back up is already there?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow these methods and check.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p><b>Check if the Volume shadow Copy Service is Automatic.</b></p>
<p>Follow these steps.</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press <b>Windows key+R</b> and type
<b>services.msc.</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Search for Volume Shadow Copy Service and check if it is automatic.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If not, then Right click on the service and select
<b>Properties</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Select the start up type to be automatic from the drop down list and select apply.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p><b>Run sfc/scannow and try</b></p>
<p>The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions. When the scan is complete, the System
 File Checker tool indicates whether integrity violations were found. If integrity violations are found, the System File Checker tool lets you fix the integrity violations.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to run sfc/scannow.</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press the Windows + X keys and click/tap on Command Prompt (Admin).
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the elevated command prompt, type sfc /scannow and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><b><span>NOTE:</span></b><span> This may take a while to finish running.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Place the system in Clean boot to disable all third party applications and try</span></b></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to place the system in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>

c) Click the <b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option (if checked).<br />
d) On the <b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option
<b>Load startup items</b> check box.<br />
e) On the <b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click
<b>‘Disable all’</b>.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I have no dual boot. I have upgraded from Windows 7 and purchased an online download for Windows 8.
<br />
<br />
I have tried Method 1. Results; Shadow copy was set to manual, I have changed this to automatic. Tried to start backup service again (from system tray because message center is asking me to create a backup) with same error result.<br />
<br />
Tried Method 2. Result; found and fixed some corrupt files. Rebooted and tried backup again, same error.<br />
<br />
Tried Method 3. Turn off all non-windows services and startup items, tried backup but with same result.<br />
<br />
Could this also have to do with me disabling UAC ? I also cannot seem to change my account picture. It gives me the error 'cannot change account picture, please try again'. I have tried with various image sizes and format. I also cannot seem to change my lock
 screen background. When I click on one of the available backgrounds, it gives me an error 'setting the lock screen failed, please try again'.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I need to reinstall Windows 8 from scratch (format and install from DVD). However, since I purchased an online installer of Windows 8, I do not have anything to burn to DVD. I also cleaned up previous installation of Windows 7 and installation files
 of Windows 8 using this procedure: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/delete-files-disk-cleanup<br />
<br />

            I guess I will just re-install Windows 8 and have it do a clean install instead. I found the download link here: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows-8/upgrade-product-key-only<br />

    <title>Internet cuts out at times on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Internet cuts out at times on Windows 10</h2>
                    Once I updated to Windows 10 everything has been working pretty well so far besides the fact that my internet goes down constantly with windows 10. What happens is I am normally in skype calls or playing minecraft and my internet will stop working for
 15-30 seconds or I can disconnect and reconnect and it will be back up. It never did this in 1.8 and it ruins my gaming experience when I constantly get disconnected and die in my games. What are the solutions to this?

            I am also having the same issue even after the update on August 4th. I also notice my internet is getting throttled after this happens. This computer is the only one with windows 10 and it is the only one experiencing any kind of network throttling or
 bottle-necking. It may not seem like it is being throttled but my other computers are getting 90 mbps down and 15 mbps up while my windows 10 computer is getting 10 mbps up and down.&nbsp;

                    <p>Sorry all if this has an obvious answer,&nbsp; I spent awhile looking around and came up blank.&nbsp; Anyways I have a upside down video problem that seems different than all I found.&nbsp; Relevant system specs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win10 Pro (Fully updated -- as well as I can tell)</p>
<p>Skype app (just reinstalled while trouble shooting)</p>
<p>Logitech C920 Pro webcam&nbsp; (latest drivers installed)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here is the thing... This problem ONLY occurs in the skype desktop app.&nbsp; Windows Camera app... video is fine, Skype web app, video has the right orientation.&nbsp; Hangouts,&nbsp; all is well... It's literally just the damn Skype desktop app.&nbsp; The funny thing is
 that when I click test video, you can see the first frame or two have it the right way then it seems to flip for some damn reason. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Restore a closed Microsoft Live Account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> esmeet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restore a closed Microsoft Live Account&#63;</h2>
                    For years, I used a Hotmail.com address as my Xbox Live account User ID with no problem.&nbsp; About 8 months ago, I purchased a Windows 8 desktop and - during the machine setup - had to enter an e-mail as the User ID.&nbsp; Since I only used the Hotmail.com account
 for the Xbox Live access, I entered a Gmail.com account as the User ID for my desktop.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
About a week ago, my Xbox Live account started confusing the two Microsoft Live accounts and wouldn't let me sign in.&nbsp; After talking with Xbox Live support, I decided to close the Gmail.com Live account and continue using my Hotmail.com account to access Xbox
 Live.&nbsp; This solved my Xbox Live problems, but then I discovered that I could no longer sign in to my Windows 8 desktop computer.&nbsp; It won't accept the PIN or password at sign-on, and I can't "recover" my password because Windows 8 suggests that the Gmail.com
 Live account no longer exists.<br />
<br />
I didn't have any other User IDs using the desktop, and I can no longer access all of the files and programs that I was using with my Windows 8 desktop.&nbsp; (I tried creating a second user and giving it admin rights, but I need to enter the Gmail.com Live account
 password before doing anything like that.)<br />
<br />
I'm stuck and don't know how I can get back into my Windows 8 desktop.<br />
<br />
Please help!<br />

            Thanks for your response.&nbsp; I clicked on the "Recover Your Microsoft Account" link you mentioned.&nbsp; When I enter my Gmail.com address in the first field (the Microsoft account you're trying to get back into), I receive the following error message:<br />
<br />
"The Microsoft account you've entered does not exist."<br />
<br />
As such, I'm unable to recover this account.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If my Windows 8 desktop uses this e-mail account as the Windows account name, how does it "not exist?"&nbsp; Is it eliminated because I've closed the account?&nbsp; If so, how do I make it "exist" again?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help; I still need more!<br />

<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I used the recovery drive tool to create a backup file on an external hard disk of the size 2000 GB. Having created the backup file I notice that the size of the hard disk is shown as 32 GB only. Where is the rest of the space? Is this normal or is there anything
 wrong with the hard disk that is brand new.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
Has this anything to do with the recovery partition on the hard disk? How do use the remaining space on the hard disk for storing something else Can I remove the backup? If so, how do I do it please?</div>

            Join the club. This can happen to anyone. You made the mistake of thinking a recovery disk contains backups. It doesn't. It is just a boot disk to
<b>access</b> the backups on an external drive or the recovery partition on the internal hard drive. It is useless now so go ahead and reformat it. A recovery disk should be on a large thumb drive or a cd or dvd, not a 2 tb hard drive. If you read the warning
 when making the disk, it says "everything on the disk will be deleted." That is easily overlooked.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Win 8 has built in recovery with Refresh and Remove &nbsp;in t PC Settings. That will access the recovery partition on the hard drive. What you should do is make a System Image using Windows 7 File Recovery included in win 8 or better still-- a 3rd party cloning
 software. Win 8.1 preview does not contain win 7 file recovery so that might not be available in the future..</div>

            <p>Hi Mary</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks for your helpful advice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However having reformated the hard drive, the capacity of the drive is still shown as 32 gb. What has gone wrong? Is it possible that the hard disk is faulty? I only bought it new few days ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise and thanks again for your help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Datta.</p>

    <title>Keyboard getting stuck at random intervals &#40;software problem I - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidcolussi747  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard getting stuck at random intervals &#40;software problem I think&#41;</h2>
                    <p>The issue is: After I have been using my computer for half an hour to an hour (sometimes less)&nbsp;my keyboard will get stuck on whatever key I happened to be pressing at the time (ex. ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss) or just freeze if no key was being
 pressed. The only way to get my keyboard working is to restart my computer. In the process of typing this question I've had to restart my computer twice. Luckily it just froze both times&nbsp;rather than getting stuck on a key otherwise I would not have been able
 to save my work because vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv is constantly being entered. When that happens I have to manually press the shutdown button because I can't get to the start screen with a key constantly depressed (electronically). It's a really disruptive
 problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>-unplugging my keyboard does not work. Characters continue to be entered constantly even with the key board unplugged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-I tried uninstalling the software that came with my keyboard but the problem persisted even with the software uninstalled
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-The keyboard is a: Logitech G110</p>
<p>
</p><p>-I can't do a system restore. I don't have any restore points set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-The problem seemed to occur shortly after I made a new user account on my computer. Previously my computer only had one user account. I deleted the new account but that did not fix the problem.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on the Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your description, this looks like a hardware problem or a third-party program conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these methods and check if that helps fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong><br />
If possible, connect another keyboard to the computer and test the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 2: </strong><br />
You may also boot the computer in a clean boot state and check </span>the result.</span></p>
<p><span>When you start Microsoft Windows, typically there are several programs that start automatically and run in the background. These programs may include antivirus and system utility programs. When you perform a clean startup procedure, you prevent these
 programs from starting automatically.</span></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>When you install Microsoft Flight Simulator X, you may receive the following error messages:</font></font></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">This issue may occur if third-party DVD movie players or DVD disc creating programs, such as InterVideo Launcher or Nero 7 interfere with the reading of the Flight Simulator X disks. The DVD discs for Flight Simulator X are formatted
 as Universal Disk Format (UDF) Volumes. Typically this kind of DVD disc is read by a UDF volume reader that is installed with Microsoft Windows. However, third-party DVD movie players or DVD disc creating programs may prevent the UDF volume reader from functioning
 as expected.</font></p>
