<h2>            Microsoft Flight Simulator X Deluxe Edition DVD won&#39;t load</h2>
                    At one point had it installed and was having fun, but later he other day I got an error that said the FSX.Cfg could not be written, so I uninstall it and pulled out my product that I haven't used since 2010, and tried to re-install it, now the DVD are
 not working at all. Tried cleaning them as well. <br />
<br />
I even tried the DVD in another system and they still wouldn't work. Is there something else I can try before purchasing another one?, or can I send this one back to Microsoft?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
Hence you tried it on another computer there is nothing much we can do to get it installed. It looks like the DVD is corrupt and cannot be read hence I would refer to contact the product replacement team from Microsoft who can help you to get a new copy of
 the product.</p>
<p><br />
I would suggest you to follow the steps provided in the Microsoft KB article below regarding replacing the product and check if it helps:</p>

                    Hello. I have a problem with my&nbsp;internet.&nbsp;Every&nbsp;since the arrival of my new pc my internet has disconnected me (And also to every other device in the household, barring those directly connecting to the modem) and on attempting to reconnect does not allow.
 This means i have to restart my router every time this happens...
<div>I find the internet begins to go really slowly before a crash. Does anyone know of any solutions?</div>

<p>Is the Drafts folder completely empty? If yes, while in Drafts: View | Current View. Make sure Show All Messages is the only option checked.</p>
<p>Still not there? Did you check in Deleted Items? If you still can't find them, read this.</p>
<p>The two most common reasons for what you describe is disruption of the compacting process, (never touch anything until it's finished), or bloated folders. More on that below.</p>
<p>Why does OE insist on compacting folders when I close it?:<br />

<p>Recovery methods:</p>
<p>If you are running XP/SP2, or SP3, and are fully patched, then you should have a backup of your dbx files in the Recycle Bin, (or possibly the message store), copied as bak files.</p>
<p>To restore a bak folder to the message store folder, first find the location of the Message Store.</p>
<p>Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</p>
<p>In WinXP, the .dbx files are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options | View.</p>
<p>Close OE and then in Windows Explorer, click on the dbx file for the missing, or empty, folder and drag it to the Desktop. It can be deleted later once you have successfully restored the bak file. Minimize the Message Store.</p>
<p>Open OE and, if the folder is missing, create a folder with the *exact* same name as the bak file you want to restore but without the .bak. Eg: If the file is Saved.bak, the new folder should be named Saved. Open the new folder and then close OE. If the
 folder is there, but just empty, continue on to the next step.</p>
<p>First, check if there is a bak file already in the message store. If there is, and you removed the dbx file, go ahead and rename it to dbx.</p>
<p>If it isn't already in the message store, open the Recycle bin and right click on the bak file for the folder in question and click Restore. Open the message store back up and change the file extension from .bak to .dbx. Close the message store and open
 OE. The messages should now be back in the folder.</p>
<p>If the messages are successfully restored, you can go ahead and delete the old dbx file that you moved to the Desktop.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you do not have bak copies of your dbx files in the Recycle Bin, then:</p>
<p>DBXpress run in Extract From Disk Mode is the best chance to recover messages:<br />
<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/DBXpress/Default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.oehelp.com/DBXpress/Default.aspx</a></p>
<p>And see:<br />
<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#4</a></p>
<p>A general warning to help avoid this in the future:</p>
<p>Do not archive mail in default OE folders. They will eventually become corrupted. Create your own user defined folders for storing mail and move your mail to them. Empty Deleted Items folder regularly. Keep user created folders under 300MB, and Default folders
 as empty as is feasible.</p>
<p>Turn off e-mail scanning in your anti-virus program. It is a redundant layer of protection that eats up CPUs, slows down sending and receiving, and causes a multitude of problems such as time-outs, account setting changes and has even been responsible for
 lose of messages. Your up-to-date A/V program will continue to protect you sufficiently. For more, see:<br />
<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3</a>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hiya my netbook is Samsung N145 plus Netbook, The mobile is HTC One X. My netbook is recognising the other usb devicess connections ie memory card usb device.</p>
<p>I checked the hardware and device&nbsp;troubleshooting and it says&nbsp;for HTC that&nbsp;it is missing a driver. I am awaiting a reply from HTC website using their email section. I also clicked on fix the problem and my computer checked online and cannot find a driver
 for HTC, my phone can connect to my netbook as when i plug it in it opens the HTC sync manager but cant connect to it due to the&nbsp;HTC is&nbsp;missing a driver.</p>
<p>I dont know whether to uninstall it and attempt to reinstall it as i installed it when my phone was connected to my netbook i dont know if this is a mistake to do so and reinstall it again without my phone being connected to my netbook.</p>

    <title>Volume up&#47;down buttons on Surface RT seem to stick on. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rwhepburn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Volume up&#47;down buttons on Surface RT seem to stick on.</h2>
                    <p>Pressing the physical volume buttons twice very quickly on the Surface RT causes the volume to get stuck and either raise the volume&nbsp; to the maximum or minimum volume level.&nbsp;This problem is very similar to what would happen if you pressed and held either
 the&nbsp;up or down volume buttons.&nbsp;I have to very slowly click the up or down volume buttons to avoid this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happens with or without the touch keyboard&nbsp;attached to the Surface RT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have applied all the latest updates as of 14 Nov, 2012.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else seen this problem? How can this be fixed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>I have experienced this issue on a number of Surface units that I have handled. After quickly pressing the volume rocker in rapid succession, the volume slider will act similarly to the automatic-down function of the power windows in modern cars wherein
 it continues going down until reaching the bottom or to max if raising the volume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not a hardware issue as the button is not sticking and it's possible to get it to stop by pressing the volume rocker in the opposite direction but since pressing the volume rocker once only decreases volume by two points with each press the most
 convenient method of changing the volume is by rapidly pressing the button. Another issue with this is that when this occurs and the volume slider reaches full or zero it will not leave the screen until you press the volume rocker in the opposite direction.
 While the slider remains displayed on screen it tends to affect the functionality of the touch screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what I've found and I honestly haven't a clue what is causing it. It is not a hardware issue and, with any luck, will be addressed in an upcoming update. I find it more convenient to change the volume on our Surface devices by using the volume slider
 that is available through the <strong>Charms bar -&gt; Settings</strong> screen down at the bottom. This allows the ability to quickly change the volume to the levels I want without running into this issue.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you haven't already then please call the local authorities/police to see what they can do and possibly retrieve the console.</p>
<p>Regarding your accounts, I suggest changing your passwords to ensure that the thief can't use your accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the console itself and locking it down, I don't think you can do such a thing. The only option you have is to contact Xbox Support to see if they can do anything like that, but I'm afraid that they can't do anything without the authorities asking
 such thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To contact Xbox Support use the Phone or Microsoft Support Chat options at <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            How do I install Silent Hill 3&#63;</h2>
                    I just need to know how to install Silent Hill 3 on my laptop. When i put the disk in the slot, all it does is pop up a folder and has links that say "sound_0.cab" and when i click on them they give me nothing. This is my first pc game so I don't know
 if it because i dont know this or if its because its just not working. If this helps an answer, the disk says " PC CD ROM", so if anyone can help thanks a lot.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your query to Microsoft forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you don't see the setup file to run the installation of Silent Hill 3 game, possibly it is because if the CD is corrupted or not&nbsp;written properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may either replace the DVD/CD or download the setup file&nbsp;manually from their
<a href="https://us-support.konami.com/.../15044/ArticleFolder/102/Silent-Hill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support website</a>.</p>

</p><p>Please check if the game&nbsp;is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/compatibility/Error/Index#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
compatible </a>with Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the game is not compatible with Windows 8, try to run the game in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps :</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on setup.exe in Disk 1 and go to "Properties."</li><li>Select the "Compatibility" tab.</li><li>Under Compatibility mode, click "Run the program in compatibility mode for" and select from the dropdown menu: Select Windows 7.</li><li>Click "Apply" or "OK,".</li><li>Run setup.exe the file.</li></ol>

<h2>            Windows 10 concerns</h2>
                    <p>Last night on August 2, 2015 I&nbsp;finally got told I could download the new Windows10 from my computer, and I was so exited and was like wow Awesome! Woohoo! so I downloaded it after it said my computer was compatible.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started at 8:28 pm and it completed by around 11 pm. After all that time I finally&nbsp;got to the desktop where my files and stuff are and the screen kept blinking for like 30 minutes the one thing different was the the bar was black but nothing was working
 I couldn't even access the start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to pull the plug and set my computer back to the original factory settings loosing all my programs, files, school files, videos, music,everything is just gone. So why did your app say my computer was compatible to go ahead and download if that wasn't
 the case? Which caused me to be forced to do 'restore to factory settings' because my computer was no longer working. I feel like I got screwed over. I wish I never had download Windows 10. In the future when I am able to purchase a computer I will go with
 Apple.</p>

            Apple? Lol.... No.. I'll just go back to Windows 7. Windows 10 looks like a toy for children. Little sliders, stupid tiles and the freaking folder layout is just complete ****!! Shortcut keys do the unexpected, such as windows key + 'S'. Expected result:
 search my computer for files. Result: Cortana. Who actually wants to use this junk? Windows 10 came packed with useless junk I will never even want to use. Windows key + 'E' will take me to "Quick Access" rather than 'My Computer' (renamed now to "This PC")
 then you click "This PC" and a list of freaking folders come up instead of where I actually want to be- the C drive and other storage devices which appear at the bottom of this group. Icons are hideous, boot times are insufferable, you might as well take a
 minute to just look it up on your phone. I can go on and on, Windows 10 is a bad joke and no one's laughing- except the little sliders and tiles that no one liked before, slowing down your computer with garbage.. I think they look pretty f

            After wasting time trying to fix Windows 10 for a week, I am going back to 7 Ultimate. No more boot up blue screen error, freezing, black screen, WIFI and wireless device cuts in and out. 6 minutes boot to desk top screen. So much frustration and anger.
 Good bye Windows 10, you suck big time!

            I installed Windows 10, and what a disappointment!&nbsp; GUI is plain jane.&nbsp; Very little customization.&nbsp; However, I could live with the plain jane GUI if the advertised speed increase had been real.&nbsp; Windows 10 actually runs slower than 7 on my Acer netbook.&nbsp;
 By the way Microsoft, I don't like your strong arm tactics/this is it like it marketing strategy.&nbsp; I may decide to switch to a Mac, if you don't fix 10 soon. &nbsp; Uninstalled&nbsp;and back to 7 for now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            (If within 30 days of installation) hit the Windows key and begin typing "go back to windows 7" and it should automatically pop up where you can follow the on-screen instructions. Or use this method: http://www.howtogeek.com/220723/how-to-uninstall-windows-10-and-downgrade-to-windows-7-or-8.1/
 which is essentially the same thing, just more work to get there.

            Going back to 7 screwed up my driver for Windows Backup and the calculator. &nbsp; Do NOT "upgrade" to 10 it's horrible and you can never really go back. &nbsp; You can't use "easy transfer" to move your files to a new computer, Microsoft forces you to purchase
 "Laplink" software if you want to move your programs along with your files. &nbsp;it will destroy your laptop, it's unstable and you &nbsp;have to "sign up" or sign in to your Microsoft Account to do most everything. &nbsp;Cortina is useless. Just don't "upgrade" it's horrible.&nbsp;

            <p>Windows 10 is a piece of garbage.&nbsp; I think it is worse than Vista when it first came out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Printing is horrible (sometimes clicking print does NOTHING), start button doesn't respond, edge is slow, and whoever created the Windows 10 mail app should be fired.&nbsp; I had to reset my installation 4 times in 6 months to "fix" these bugs.&nbsp; What a pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you EVER going to fix any of these problems?&nbsp; You continue to create new apps and features for 10, but ignore the OBVIOUS issues that need to be fixed.</p>

<p>Right click does not work. Even if it works after many many attempts then any submenu items of right click doest not work. Leave it as it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my all earlier questions posted on Microsoft I got excellent reply from Microsoft's MVP, this time it is not the case in my two attempts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow thank you for your effort in trying to resolve the issue.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Lost Windows Themes after upgrade from Win 7 to Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian1951  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost Windows Themes after upgrade from Win 7 to Win 10</h2>
                    <p>When I was running Windows 7 I had a Theme of Castles of England or was it Ireland. When I upgraded that theme disappeared. I looked under Win 7 Compatible themes, not found. I checked all the categories and could not find it.&nbsp; I really liked that theme.
 Where may I find it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>Hi Brian - there was a theme called Castles of Europe which no longer seems to be available on the MS site (it may be hiding!) but it has been uploaded here... I'd check it out with a site advisor before downloading though... Ric.</p>

            <p>you said upgraded to win 10.</p>
<p>open your C: drive&nbsp;</p>
<p>look for a folder named windowsold (may be there)</p>
<p>If it is, open it</p>
<p>IF you can see users, you may be in luck</p>
<p>
</p><p>the rest will only help if the users folder is available, and you have turned on show hidden folders</p>
<p>so it's:- users/yourname/appdata/local/microsoft/windows/themes</p>
<p>
</p><p>In win10 to select that option</p>
<p>type in search: control panel,,, open it, then look for ,, file explorer options,, open this and select the view tab,,</p>
<p>click,, &nbsp;show hidden........... followed by clicking OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this will help you</p>
<p>if not I apologize for wasting your time.</p>

<h2>            Issue with Fight Stick on Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am having an issue with my fight stick on the Xbox one. Switching controls for the stick (DPad, Left- or Right-Stick) is not recognized by the Xbox. The system will only recognize the stick as a DPad. I tested this with the controller tester in the Xbox
 settings. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else experiencing the same issue? Are there any solutions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Hori RAP One Kai Fighting Stick on the Xbox One X. The Fight Stick has a small switcher for changing the controls of the stick (DPad, Left- or Right-Stick).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi Emmmmrich,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found some info on the configuration of that particular controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(13, 31, 45, 1)">The right side of the stick also houses a switch that lets you swap between Xbox One and Xbox 360 modes. Another
 nearby toggle lets you set the joystick to act as a D-pad, left analog stick, or right analog stick, which can come in quite handy depending on the game you're playing. Pressing the Xbox button allows you to remotely wake up an Xbox One that's in Sleep mode.
 Unlike Hori's Real Arcade Pro 4 for PlayStation 4 and the Qanba Q4 RAF, the Kai lacks a turbo button.</span></p>

            Hi Dr.
<br />
<br />You can remove Avast from Settings App - Apps
<br />
<br />However Avast provide a specific tool for removing their software from your PC and that may be a more successful method to remove all remnants of Avast from your PC

            Hi Lala, 
<br />
<br />When all else fails, the manual approach is your best option to transfer the files, the built in Photos App can be a bit unreliable, and you will have more control over the files are transferred . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Windows Fie Explorer (folder icon on your Taskbar) 
<br />
<br />On the left click 'This PC' 
<br />
<br />On the right double click your device or the DCIM folder (whichever shows up) 
<br />
<br />Then simple select the files you want to transfer and drag them into the Pictures folder in the left pane of File Explorer 
<br />
<br />That's it!       
        </p>

            Hi,&nbsp;
<br />My name is Ernesto. I am an Independent Advisor. Thanks for contacting our support.
<br />I understand the inconvenience that you are unable to import photos from camera, we will help you to resolve this issue.
<br />
<br />Please provide us additional information to understand the issue and assist you better:
<br />
<br />Is the camera recognized by the computer? 
<br />How are you transferring the photos to the computer?
<br />What is the specific location on the computer, where the folder is being created?
<br />Have you logged in as administrator user?
<br />This issue normally occurs due to faulty connection of the device to the computer or if you are saving the picture to default location of the computer, the pictures folder in library is not accepting the photos that should be added and needs to be repaired.
<br />
<br />Method 1: I would fist suggest you to check the connection of the Digital Camera to the computer, make sure it is firmly connected.
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 2: You can import photos and videos without leaving the Photos app.
<br />
<br />1. Connect a camera or memory card to your PC.
<br />2. In the Photos app, swipe up from the bottom edge or down from the top edge, then tap Import. (If you're using a mouse, right-click anywhere in the Photos app, then click Import.)
<br />Note: Import isn't available if you're looking at a single picture in full screen view.
<br />3. Tap or click the camera or memory card you want to import from.
<br />4. Swipe down on or right-click each photo or video you want to import to select it.
<br />Note: If you’ve already imported some photos from this camera or card, the ones you haven’t imported yet will be selected by default.
<br />5. Enter a name for the folder you want to put the files in and tap or click Import.
<br />6. When your files are finished importing, tap or click Open folder to see them in the Photos app.
<br />
<br />Reference: Photos: Frequently asked questions
<br />
<br />Method 3: I would suggest you to perform all the steps mentioned in the article.
<br />What if a wired device isn't installed properly?
<br />
<br />Additional reference: Photos app for Windows help. Refer to (Import photos and videos)
<br />Note: The above mentioned links applies to Windows 10 as well.

            Hi Lala.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See these methods:  
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-photos/complete-guide-to-importing-your-photos-in-windows/d8258fff-729e-45df-8afd-1f1195d7b6c5">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

<br />
<br />USB is not a very stable method.  In that case I'd install iCloud or OneDrive to wirelessly upload your Pictures in the background.  This will always work better.

<p>Hi Ann,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can simply take a screenshot from the video and print it. To take a screen shot, press
<strong>Print Scrn</strong>. After doing so, open <strong>Paint</strong>. You can open Paint by searching it in the
<strong>search box</strong>. After opening Paint, press <strong>Ctrl + C</strong>, then press<strong> Ctrl + V</strong>. After pasting the screenshot, crop the photo for finishing touches and save it. You can now print the saved photo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have more concerns, free free to post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            Hi Ken
<br />
<br />Please explain this in more detail . . .
<br />
<br />The error you are seeing is a coding error, usually thrown by some new Windows application and generally a PC restart will resolve this error.
<br />
<br />If a restart does not resolve this, please provide the name of the application you were using when this error was thrown . . .

    <title>Windows 7 task bar icons stopped normal mouseover functions. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomvaillencourt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 task bar icons stopped normal mouseover functions.</h2>
                    Usually when you mouse over or hover over&nbsp;the "show desktop" without clicking you should see the desktop with transparent window frames visible. This has stopped working. Usually when you mouse over the internet explorer icon on the taskbar, you can see
 miniature viewable pages of all you have open. Now this only produces a list view&nbsp;of said pages. I have tried looking at the taskbar settings, but do not see how I could change these functions.
