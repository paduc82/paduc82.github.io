<h2>            Xbox live accout stolen and migrated to Brazil 4 months ago&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>So my account has been hacked, spent money on and moved to Brazil. I reported the issue to microsoft and was give ban expectation of 25 days for resolution. It's now been 4 months and nothing. I contact xbox live support on a regular basis and get nothing.
 I tell them it's been a ridiculous amount of time and they say there is nothing they can do. They tell me that they will have someone contact me with an update that I never get. They have tried to blame me, say it's my fault it was stolen. They have told me
 to just create another account. They said for compensation they have given me months of xbox live for free. Well what good does that do when I USE the content I purchased on xbox live. Also I would have to rebuild my friends list. Any work I've put into a
 game like call of duty to level online and have access to weapons and what not. I mean the brazillian theives had control of my account in less than 24 hours and now me, the paying customer, has had to wait for more that 3 times the alotted time of resolution.
 Is there nothing that can be done? Will this need to become a legal matter? Should we start a class action suit against microsoft for negligence? I mean it's out of control. The responsibility that take place when someones credit card info is on the line goes
 without saying. Then you create this migration tool and thoughtlessly forget that there are people in this world that can and WILL misuse it. Now no one is to suffer except the consumer and no good outlook for a resolution. Is there no one that can help me?
 I'm no opposed to creating a new account but I want reimbursed for all the purchases I've made at least. If there is something that I've missed or someone that can help let me know. I used to praise xbox live as (at the time) it was far superior to PSN but
 now I'm eating my own words. I thought well I'm going with Xbox since you ahve to pay for it the support and security should be much better. Well looks like I might be buying a PS3 since it's not any better I might as well get the free version.</p>

<p>Hey TFS Toasty, first off, let me say how sorry I am to hear about your situation. Four months is a long time to go without being able to game on your personal GT, and to not have access to your content. That being said, the UA team is working to resolve
 all of these cases, and they will resolve your issue. Unfortunately, petition-type threads are against the forums Code of Conduct, so I must act that you do not try and create one, or this thread will need to be shut down. Again, I wish there was more information
 I could provide here, but please know that the UA team is working to resolve each and every case in this state.</p>

<p>OH. MY. GOD. Thank you Toasty, Thank you BIllowypanther! I feel like I have been living in a twilight zone episode! I just counted the days since I reported my exact. same. issue. My account was stolen from me and migrated to Brazil. Purchases were made
 after I had reported the account stolen to xbox live. Money was taken out of my bank account by thieves, via purchases made on my stolen account. It has now been 100 days today since I reported the problem on August 28th. No resolution. No contact from MIcrosoft.
 I call in regularly and can not even reach a supervisor. Now me, a paying, loyal Microsoft consumer has been hung out to dry while the multi-billion corporation who was in custody of my identity and debit card information (which I had registered with them
 over the phone directly through Microsoft support) is taking 100 days to chase some punk in Brazil and sticking me with a bill like I can afford it.

<p>I did not know these forums existed until now. MIcrosoft has given me no point of contact other than basic tier 1 level xbox live support. They have never reached out to me. I just glad to find out that I am not alone here. I feel like I am going crazy trying
 to be patient when I don't even know if anything is happening with my account. Also I can't change my account language back to English from Portuguese. Minor annoyance.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 only edge can access the internet</h2>
                    I recently upgraded from windows 8.1 to windows 10, and everything worked fine with my apps for 2 days, until suddenly&nbsp;no apps would connect to the internet<br />
I am using an Ethernet connection and all my drivers are up to date, it says that my connection is there and I can access the internet, the troubleshooter can find no problems at all with my internet settings, but only Microsoft edge actually connects<br />
Other apps like firefox recognise that I am connected to the internet but just operate at all<br />
I've checked windows firewall for any network exclusions but I can't find any issues there<br />
I've even tried using a wireless network instead, but the same issues still persist<br />
Everything was working fine with windows 10 until an update/reboot, and I experienced both these problems above and some sizing issues with some text and&nbsp;windows

            <p>Hi, thanks for the reply</p>
<p>The SFC didn't come up with any issues at all, and I uninstalled the updates that I believed caused the issues, but still&nbsp;nothing can access the internet<br />
Internet explorer won't connect to the internet either,&nbsp;and neither will windows update, it just gives me error code (0x80080005)</p>
<p>Exclusively edge will actually access the internet&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firefox doesn't say that I'm not connected, it just gives me a blank page with [new tab] on the header, no matter what url I try to access

            <p>Same here. None of the suggestions so far have done anything for me. I've also run a complete scan of computer for malware using Defender and MRT&nbsp;and it seems to be clean. This just happened all of a sudden. Actually I was using Windows 10 for a while (right
 when it got released) and then this happened about a week ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No&nbsp;third-party apps&nbsp;will connect to the Internet. Some won't even open (Skype, Spotify) anymore.&nbsp;Spotify used to&nbsp;open on startup but now it doesn't.&nbsp;I also&nbsp;can't seem to install an application (.exe)&nbsp;after it's&nbsp;downloaded. Tried downloading Malwarebytes
 and the installation failed with "Internal Error: Expression error 'Runtime Error (at 112:109): Could not call proc." Tried installing Chrome and it failed saying it could not access the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ping google.com from CMD seems to be normal though.</p>

    <title>Can I merge avatars&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blopez5293  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I merge avatars&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So here's the deal:</p>
<p>I had an avatar on my xbox 360. When I signed up for xbox live I was forced to start a new avatar and now my old one is just hanging out on the box. &nbsp;My 1st avatar has all of my game data and achievements saved to it. &nbsp;So my question is this:</p>
<p>Can I merge the 2 avatars and save my data or am I just screwed?????? &nbsp;Please help me. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

<p>Do you mean a local user on the Xbox itself? No, there's no way to merge them as far as I have ever heard. When you register you have to pick a gamertag that isn't used yet, and the local one on your Xbox probably was used already. You could try to sign
 into that one and create a new account using that profile...and to see if that username isn't taken anymore. Sorry for the probably semi bad news. :/</p>

<p>Avatars? You mean the little human on your account? Or do you mean your gamertag itself? Could you maybe elaborate your question?
</p>
<p>If you mean can you use a different save game from your old gamertag to your new one (example, you've finished the campaign for halo 4 on one gamertag and got all of the achievements, you CAN'T transfer that stuff to ANOTHER gamertag) I hope that answers
 your question!</p>

<p>you can't transfer it, but you CAN go back into your other account (your offline profile) sign into it, and convert that to an online profile (once signed in to your offline profile, you can then select "join xbox live") which will then carry all of your
 savegame data and avatar info to that online profile. </p>

<p>Well....this thread is depressing.</p>
<p>My old Avatar contains the same name, same tagger ID, and ALL my game stats...Halo, Halo2, Halo 3...and so on. And yet, I cannot get it to sign in into Xbox Live, and I cannot transfer all my hard work over....On top of that my login is my old email address
 that no longer exists...can't change that either. Sounds like that the Microsoft clan is just getting lazy with all that technology at their hands. What we need should be as simple as copy...and paste....even if its something we get tech support online to
 ensure no shananagins takes place. Just legit consolidations to existing accounts that need to keep up with the mighty corporations changes.</p>
<p>In the interim I now have TWO avatars with the same name, same look, same tagger ID, and one has all my stats, and the other does not.</p>
<p>Depressing.</p>

<h2>            Does Surface GO support OpenGL</h2>
                    <p>I checked the details description in Intel website and confirm that the Intel HD Graphics 615 supports OpenGL.</p>
<p>Howerver when I launched ON1 Photo RAW 2019 a error occured said: OpenGL 3.3 and later is required for this application to run.</p>
<p>Does Surface GO really support OpenGL? Or is there any way to turn on it?</p>

<p>Voilà, il y à quelques minutes j'ai démarrée ma Xbox et j'ai vue l'annonce du Pack Annihilation en première page j'ai donc cliqué afin de me le procurer avec mes Microsoft Points mais je n'ai pensé qu'a la langue à la dernière seconde mais avant que le pack
 ne s'installe j'ai donc tout annuler afin d'aller me procurer celui en anglais mais lorsque j'ai tenté de télécharger ce dernier je n'avais plus assez de Microsoft Points! Le pack FR n'est même pas installé mais il est déjà payé! Et mon jeux est Anglais donc
 comment faire pour simplement avoir le pack Anglais au lieux de celui en Français? Car je rages en ce moment!</p>

    <title>Multiple errors in System Event Log&#58; svchost, Windows Driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rmtek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple errors in System Event Log&#58;  svchost, Windows Driver Foundation, IPX Traffic Filter Driver</h2>
                    
<p>The Application popup: (Event ID 26) Application popup: svchost.exe - Application Error : The instruction at "0x7c91b21a" referenced memory at "0x00000010". The memory could not be "written". Click on OK to terminate the program Click on CANCEL to debug
 the program -- appears every time the computer boots.<br />
Computer: Dell Dimension 9100, XP media center sp3 with all current updates, IE7<br />
Unit has been experiencing multiple errors for several months, mostly due to the failure of McAfee Security Center to recognize an updated subscription. The McAfee issue has been solved.<br />
The svchost error message references no Process ID but the Task Manager Processes tab shows instances of svchost for System (PID 2548), Local Service (2512), System (1612), Local Service (1568), System (1412), Network Service (1384), System (1300), Network
 Service (1204), System (1080), System (596), and Local Service (264). This message has been appearing since 7/9.<br />
Clicking the 'Cancel' button does not seem to result in another instance of svchost starting. If it is, in fact, debugging the problem, it seems to only apply to that session; the message reappears on the next reboot.</p>
<p>2. TLS 1.0 will not remain enabled. The home page (aol.com) seems to want it and will not load when IE is launched. If TLS is reactived manually in Internet Options&gt;Tools&gt;Advanced, the home page will come up. I can alternatively navigate to another page
 such as Google, then click the Home icon and AOL will load.</p>
<p>3. Since 7/31, another error shows up in the System Event log at every boot --<br />
Event Source: Service Control Manager<br />
Event Category: None<br />
Event ID: 7000<br />
Date: 7/31/2009<br />
Time: 5:27:37 AM<br />
User: N/A<br />
Computer: HQ<br />
Description:<br />
The IPX Traffic Filter Driver service failed to start due to the following error:
<br />
The parameter is incorrect.</p>
<p>4. The System Event Log also shows recurring 7023 errors --<br />
The Windows Driver Foundation - User-mode Driver Framework service terminated with the following error: A device attached to the system is not functioning.
<br />
There is no indication WHAT device is not functioning and reference to Device Manager shows everything operating fine. This is possibly connected to other error messages (2481 and 7023) which say the UPS is not properly configured... but the machine is not
 currently connected to a UPS and the errors keep occurring.</p>
<p><br />
5. Image files stored on the computer will no longer open in Paint, Picture It, Picassa or Jasc Photoshop. These include .jpg and .mix files. I have been able, however, to retrieve the .jpg files by attaching the hard drive as a slave on another machine and
 using Picassa.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if or how these errors are related but it would appear to be an OS problem, possibly corrupted files. Security scans with McAfee, Antivir, Malwarebytes, Spybot, IOBit Security 360 and the Eusig and Glary registry utilities have shown no malware
 infections.</p>
<p>I have been advised to do a chkdsk /r, rebooting with the XP disk in the drive.&nbsp; There is no CD, only a recovery partition and I'm not sure how to point the repair function to this partion.&nbsp; But before I repair, I'd like to know what is causing these problems.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point you really need to run the SFC.&nbsp; If it is possible to borrow a disk or contact your PC manufacturer to obtain a replacement disk.&nbsp; This will help determine if any of the system files are corrupt or not.

<h2>            Xbox Profile Creation Showing Wrong Birthdate</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I wanted to make an xbox profile, but struggled a bit with my birthdate, as it was set to 1-1-2011 for some reason. Anyway, we took care of that and my birthdate is now correct on my Microsoft profile page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when trying to make the Xbox profile now, it still uses my old birthdate. Tried relogging, refeshing and waiting ~15 minutes for it to update, but no luck. http://prntscr.com/npymwp</p>
<p>
Anyone knows what's going on? Is this just a bug or am I doing something wrong?</p>

<p>Hey ViktorvX</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to post this on the Xbox Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You age for your Xbox Profile is directly linked to your Microsoft account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still being shown an age that is not currently your own, you may have to
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4090292/microsoft-account-age-verification-for-parental-consent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
submit proof of age</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two ways of doing this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Adding a payment instrument to your account.</li><li>Submitting official identification documents that includes your photo, birthdate, full name, and an expiration date.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Go ahead and give this a try and let us know if you are able to fix up that birthdate.</p>

</p><p>The age of my xbox profile is indeed directly linked to my Microsoft account. I just needed to wait a bit for the xbox profile age to update after changing my microsoft account's age.</p>

<h2>            GTA 5 ring damage on disk</h2>
                    So, the other day I was playing GTA 5 and what do you know, my nephew knocks over my xbox and my disc gets the ring damage. So I put it in my disc tray again and see that it just keeps playing the loading screen with the flashing police lights over and
 over. So my friend takes some eye glass cleaner to it and we try it again and it goes through the loading screen with the flashing police lights twice, then starts the game and I had to start all over on one of the heists that I already had done. So I play
 for a little while and when I quit, I notice that the saving wasn't working. I then deleted all of what l installed from disc one from my hard drive and re-installed it. And the saving worked again and my game started up just fine. But today, I've noticed
 while I was playing it would go back to that loading screen when I was trying to do this mission. So I'm wondering if I downloaded a clean copy to my hard drive and used my disc and it would still work. Also my friend said you could ex

<p>Hey there, </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Yes, if you donwload disk 2 to the Xbox hard drive, it should work. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The answere to your other question 'Also my friend said you could exchange it at walmart'. Yes you can if you have the recipt and if they have coppys of the disk left after the mad rush of gamers wanting the game.</p>

<p>Hi there GGK Nuts</p>
<p>I wouldn't recommend that you install the play disc to your hard drive.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p><a href="http://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/200155686-Grand-Theft-Auto-V-Xbox-360-and-PS3-Installation-Requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.rockstargames.com/.../200155686-Grand-Theft-Auto-V-Xbox-360-and-PS3-Installation-Requirements</a></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I did however install the install disc to my hard drive and the play disc to a PNY Attache USB flash drive and the game plays fine.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If you do install the play disc to a USB flash drive there are minimum requirements</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If using a USB flash drive it must be at least USB 2.0 with a minimum 15mb/s read speed and formatted for Xbox 360 use. A new USB flash drive is recommended to ensure optimum performance.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 64bit &#43; Intel HD Graphics 5500 &#58; External Display Not Working</h2>
                    <div>
<p>My HP Pavilion laptop is barely 3 months old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to connect another Acer monitor to my laptop via HDMI port without any issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week, when I plugged the monitor again, the laptop cannot detect the extended display anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I right-clicked the desktop and went to Intel HD Graphics but the option to extend/clone display is gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I re-installed the latest Intel graphic driver several times but to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I browsed countless forums already and downloaded several installers for graphics drivers but it is still not working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope somebody can help.</p>

            Thanks for your reply.
<br />
<br />If you're using Microsoft account to login, reset your password online here, using another device:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/password/reset</a>
<br />
<br />After resetting password online, see if you can login with new password on original device.
<br />
<br />If you're on local account, refer this support article:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4028457/windows-10-reset-your-local-account-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402845...</a>

<p>I followed the link, and on this page it said that the Windows Media Format 11 Series Runtime Files are for those people who do not want to install and run Windows Media Player on their computer. So I'm going to try and install AVS4YOU software WITHOUT installing
 the Windows Media Format 11 Series Runtime Files, because I DO HAVE Windows Media Player installed on my Windows Vista 32 bit computer. I'm not sure if it's Windows Media Player 11, because I'm not sure where to find out which version I have. I'm not sure
 if the AVS4YOU software will function properly, but I'm going to try it without installing these runtime files.</p>

<p>I could not find any "Help-&gt; About" in my Windows Media Player. However, I went back out to the microsoft website, and found this :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-media-player</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, it said that Windows Media Player 11 is included in most Vista 32 software, including Home Premium, which is what I have. So, my answer is that I do have Windows Media Player 11 installed on my computer. I have not tried Windows Media Player 12, since
 it says it is for Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I have the correct version of Windows media Player, and my other "reply" said that the runtime files are for people who do not want, or are currently not using Windows Media Player 11 on their computers, I am NOT going to install the runtime files
 when installing the AVS4YOU software. Thanks for all the help.</p>

<h2>            Windows Photo Viewer froze &#38; won&#39;t close</h2>
                    On Friday, May 10 Windows Photo Viewer froze while opening a file &amp; froze my&nbsp;network. The network came back but&nbsp;I couldn't close the program. Today, May 13, WPV&nbsp;came up with the network and is still frozen.&nbsp;&nbsp;The file cam from my office network so I can't
 use Task Manager to close it because that doesn't affect things in the network. I can't download "Fix It" solutions because I don't have network administrator rights. Is there a way to close it?

            Hi Sylk,
<div><br />
1. Are you able to access pics from the same computer without any issues?<br />
2. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</div>
<div>3. Is the computer on Domain?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have provided steps to run SFC which scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions. If it fails let’s check in clean boot to find the conflicting program. Also check the event viewer logs for details.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: Perform a System File Checker (SFC) scan</strong></div>

            <div>Thank you for the reply.</div>
<div><br />
It would seem better if you could consult the Network Administrator to check whether the issue is occurring only at your computer.
<br />
<div>I would request you to provide the event viewer logs to find out the cause of the issue.<br />
