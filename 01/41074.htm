<h2>            Outlook Express 6</h2>
                    
<p>For some reason Outlook Express 6 has started sending email's about 10 to 13 times in succession. I have no clue why. There is a message referring me to "Details" and there are no details to read.</p>

<p>Tools | Accounts | Mail | Properties | Advanced. Uncheck: "Break apart messages........".</p>
<p>If that does not cure it, you have some dbx file corruption.</p>
<p>Move most of your messages out of the Inbox and then create new Outbox and Sent Items folders after you move any messages you wish to save to a local folder you create.</p>
<p>Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</p>
<p>In WinXP, Win2K &amp; Win2K3, the OE user files (DBX and WAB) are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Windows Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options Icon | View, or in Windows Explorer
 | Tools | Folder Options | View.</p>
<p>With OE closed, find the DBX files for the Outbox &amp; Sent Items and delete them.&nbsp; New ones will be created automatically when you open OE.</p>
<p>After you are done, follow up by compacting your folders manually while working *offline* and do it often.</p>
<p>Click on Outlook Express at the top of the folder tree so no folders are open. Then: File | Work Offline (or double click Working Online in the Status Bar). File | Folder | Compact all folders. Don't touch anything until the compacting is completed.</p>
<p><em>General precautions for Outlook Express</em></p>
<p>Do not archive mail in the Inbox or Sent Items. Create your own user defined folders and move the messages you wish to save to them. Empty Deleted Items folder daily. Although dbx files have a theoretical capacity of 2GB, I recommend about a 300MB max for
 less chance of corruption.</p>
<p>Information about the maximum file size of the .dbx files that are used by Outlook Express:<br />

<p>Turn off e-mail scanning in your anti-virus program. It is a redundant layer of protection that eats up CPUs, slows down sending and receiving, and causes a multitude of problems such as time-outs, account setting changes and has even been responsible for
 loss of messages. Your up-to-date A/V program will continue to protect you sufficiently. For more, see:<br />

<p>Note that for some AV programs, it may be necessary to uninstall the program and reinstall in Custom Mode and uncheck e-mail scanning when the option arises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compact often as specified above.</p>

<h2>            Epson PowerLite Home Cinema 5040UB with Denon S720W having issues with 4k</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very confused. My Projector says it supports 4k HDR10 and so does my reciever. However, when I go to display settings 4k detail it says my TV setup doesn't support 4k 10-bit at 50hz, TV setup doesn't support 4k 10-bit at 60hz, TV setup doesn't support
 Dobly Vision, TV setup doesn't support HDR10 for gaming, and TV setup doesn't support HDR10 for video capture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it supports HDR10 for video and 4k 10-bit at 24HZ as well as 4k UHD (60Hz). Yet when I call the companies that make my reciever and projector they say it does indeed support HDR10. Also when I look at the Signal output, it says the color depth is 8-bit
 4:2:0, the people at Epson said the Xbox should be output 4:2:2. Anyone know what I need to do so my Xbox and project give me the support it is suppose to?&nbsp; The color format is also showing up as BT.709 But if I switch to my 4k fireTv it says the color format
 is BT.2020 HDR. I also tried plugging my projector directly into the xbox, bypassing the reciever and still get the same data from the 4k details screen.&nbsp; Anyone have any ideas?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi, the projector has two HDMI inputs according to the spec sheet only one of which supports HDCP 2.2. You do have the Xbox connected to the port that supports HDCP 2.2 ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The receiver seems to support HDCP 2.2, so you must ensure that whatever cabling configuration you use has the Xbox connected to whatever input supports HDCP 2.2 otherwise you will have problems.</p>

<p>I take it you have enabled the settings on the Xbox for 4k and HDR. What happens if you use the cable your firetv is currently connected to the Xbox with ?

            That is correct. The cable is part of the FireTv and not removable. I tired plugging in the project directly to the Xbox and it made no difference. My PS4 PRo also has no issues when I connect it through my AVR to my Projector. It seems to only be the
 xbox that thinks th projector doesn't support HDR10.&nbsp;

<p>The singal coming form the XBOX is 4k 60hz but for color depth 8-bit and 4:2:0. From what I understand 8-bit is fine, but the 4:2:0 should either be 4:2:2 and 4:4:4, which makes me wonder if I need to get a HDFury Linker and connect that to my Projector
 which then connects to the AVR, for the Xbox to detect that it does indeed support it. UGH Wish I knew more about 4k technologies. Still super confused why PS4 Pro, Roku, and FireTv all send the right stuff but Xbox doesn't.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Did some more research and it looks like I need to get a HDFury Linker, as the Projector has a processor that is a little too slow for the Xbox one X, which is why everything else works but the Xbox. URGH, considering the price of the proejctor and Xbox,
 I now need to dish out another 150 - 200 bucks. Sigh. Well at least I have a solution.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Has Microsoft changed the UEFI driver requirements for Secure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saltgrass  say:</h3>
<h2>            Has Microsoft changed the UEFI driver requirements for Secure Boot&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a system which was able to use Secure Boot without problems.&nbsp; For the last year I have been running it without Secure Boot so I could boot my Win 7 install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I decided to re-enable secure boot for the Win 10 install.&nbsp; When I disabled the CSM I got a message pointing out I needed to get a Microsoft certified UEFI driver for my M.2 AHCI PCIe SSD.&nbsp; Since disabling the CSM has always worked in the past
 I ignored the message and rebooted.&nbsp; The system would only boot to an Orange Screen and go no further.&nbsp; Enabling the CSM again repaired that problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I would have been running Secure Boot at the time a change had been made, I would have had no idea what might have been wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering, since there have been several bios updates on this system, has the specifications changed and caused the UEFI driver to be not usable with Secure Boot?&nbsp; As far as I can tell, there are no drivers available for the AHCI M.2 drive.&nbsp; Possibly
 I need to move to a M.2 PCIe NVMe drive to get this to work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading..</p>

<h2>            &#91;Pro 3&#93; WiFi Adapter error&#58; &#34;No Networks found&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Goog morning.<br />
<br />
I literally spend the whole night trying to resolve my current problem, but even though I found numerous posts about the Marvell AVASTAR adapter and how to fix it, it's still not working and I'm getting quite desperate. My Microsoft Surface Pro 3 can suddenly
 not find one single network (it doesn't even show one when being in the "Network" section).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
General information about the network:</p>
<p>- The WiFi network itself works fine, I have other devices (a Mac OS, an iPhone, another Windows with 8.1 and my TV) connected to my WiFi and they all work, so it cannot be a modem/router problem.<br />
- Yesterday at lunch, my Surface was able to connect to the internet, I visited some sites for research, went home in the afternoon and as soon I was home, there were no networks available anymore. The last time I was online is nearly 24 hours past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Information about my Surface:</p>
<p>- Surface Pro 3, bought around 15 month ago<br />
- Running Windows 8.1 Pro (not sure if an update to 10 would fix it?)</p>
<p>- Last real Update from the Download Center was on February 03, 2016</p>
<p>- Using the "Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC Network Controller"<br />
- I have no other external adapter available</p>
<p>- My AntiVirus is telling me "your computer is at risk", but scanning for damaged files requires internet connection (very smart. ha ha)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some things I already found on Google and support sites I already did:<br />
- Airplane Mode is not on (obviously)<br />
- The adapter is shown and NOT deactivated<br />
- I rebooted my Surface numerous times so far, I stopped counting already<br />
- I already set back my Surface to a system backup from February 03, but the problem was still there<br />
- After the backup didn't work, I set it back again to today, problem was still there<br />
- I reset / uninstalled / reinstalled the Marvell adapter itself more than once</p>
<p>- I downloaded the newest driver version already and installed it on my Surface via USB device. Yes, the Device Manager tells me, that the driver version of the adapter is on the newest version. I already deleted the old driver and installed the new one
 over (after a reboot) and still not a solution.<br />
- I tried to updated my Surface manually to the update that was released two days ago via a .msi file and a .zip folder I found on another support site here on microsoft.com, transferring them over USB device to my Surface. But when I wanted to open the .inf
 file, literally nothing happened.<br />
- When typing "netsh interface show interface" in the CMD window, it tells me that the WiFi adapter is "activated", but "disconnected".<br />
- The troubleshooting for network problems only tells me that there is a "problem with the wireless adapter or access point" and advices me to reboot my router, which I already did as well.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After all that - I still see absolutely no network available. Sadly the Microsoft Answer Desk is currently closed, so I really hope that anyone out there had encountered similar problems before and can probably give me an expert advice what to do. And if it
 cannot be resolved, what would be my further step to continue with my Surface? Sending it for repair, set it up completely new or even buying a new one?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any reply!</p>

            <p>If uninstalling/reinstalling the network adapter and a two button reset didn't work (as well as the other steps you tried including System Restore), unfortunately, you probably need to use a recovery drive to reimage your Surface (Support would have you
 do this prior to discussing an exchange) <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If reimaging with the downloadable bits does not restore the wifi capabilities, you DO need to discuss an out of warranty exchange with the support folks.

    <title>Windows Error oxc0000225 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lash956  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Error oxc0000225</h2>
                    Ok so I am building a computer a for a client and I've run into a snag.<br />
<br />
Yesterday I had Windows installed and working 100% without any real issues except... The System Reserved partition installed onto a separate drive. Why Windows did this during the installation, I will never know. To correct this I disconnected the HDD, and
 tried to re-install windows... Now I get this error every time I boot up...<br />
<br />
Windows Error 0xc0000225.<br />
<br />
I looked up the solution online and it involves me having access to the CMD prompt in order to fix the issue or reinstalling windows.<br />
<br />
Neither option would be a problem with me... That is... If I could actually do either one...<br />
<br />
When I try to re-install using the Windows disk or a USB install ISO I get the error, 0xc0000225, and I am never allowed to actually re-install anything. I've reformatted the drive several times, I've even zeroed the drive this last attempt, and no dice. It
 just doesn't work.<br />
<br />
But.... When I install a Linux distro. it works just fine. I have no issues what so ever.<br />
<br />
I've tested memory, cpu, motherboard, everything. It all works just fine. I know the drive works just fine as well because linux runs off it and it does so with no problems.<br />
<br />
So now I am here... What do I do?<br />
<br />
I am going to connect the drive externally to a machine I am able to use the CMD prompt off of and try to run the suggested fix from there but we will see if it even lets me do that. I have also run diskpart, clean all on the drive, still gave me the error.
 I will update more when I get a response.<br />
<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows 8.1 upgrade won&#39;t accept my credit card address - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fuji kid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 upgrade won&#39;t accept my credit card address</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm English but&nbsp;live in Japan. I have a new&nbsp;laptop purchased with Windows 8.0 and upgraded to Windows 8.1 Pro. The system base is Japanese but all of my settings and locations are set to UK and the language is set to English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing missing is Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look at the system properties there's the option "Get more features with a new edition of Windows."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on it,&nbsp;The "Add Features to Windows 8.1"&nbsp;dialog appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click on "I want to buy a Product Key online" and it shows me "Windows 8.1 Media Center Pack" for 800 Yen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click on Choose and it shows me a dialog to enter the Billing&nbsp;address details. It says "Make sure the details match&nbsp;the address for the payment method you're going to use."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I enter&nbsp;the address details registered with my Credit&nbsp;Card Co. and click Next.</p>
<p>... My credit card is a UK credit card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dialog&nbsp;won't proceed. It keeps telling me to enter a Postal Code in the correct format ... I have done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only guess is that it's&nbsp;expecting&nbsp;a Japanese Postal Code because&nbsp;it's detected I'm in Japan.&nbsp;(It doesn't ask for country)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the Windows Store is country specific. My Windows store recognizes my settings and shows the UK store with prices in Pounds but the Media Center Pack isn't available in there. Windows 8.1 itself seems to be ignoring the location settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been through everything, languages, system locale etc. I can't find anything else to set as English. I can only assume it must be based on my IP address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched the online stores (UK and Japan)&nbsp;and the standalone Media Center pack isn't shown. It only shows the "Windows Pro Pack" at 99 GBP/14,400 Yen. I've checked the local retailers and likewise they only have the full "Windows Pro Pack" at 14,400
 Yen. That's nearly 20 times what I should be paying.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Does MS Windows 8.1 "Buy Online" not allow purchases with international credit cards?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If not where/how can I purchase the standalone "</strong><strong>Windows 8.1
</strong><strong>Media Center pack"?</strong></p>

            <p>Hi Basith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying but they were next to useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I spoke to Sales support. They told me that every copy of Windows 8.1 Pro has Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I explained my key was an old one from early last year when the Media Center pack was not bundled in with the Pro pack. He didn't seem to understand.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>He said could connect me to technical who would be able to connect to my PC and find out what was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I accepted and waited for about 10 minutes ... the guy came on ... he sounded like he was from another country and his English wasn't&nbsp;great ... I asked if he could give me a URL where I could purchase the upgrade but all&nbsp;he wanted to do was to help me purchase
 the upgrade&nbsp;online. He kept saying he was searching for the package.&nbsp;I suspected he was&nbsp;just going through the standard store website ... I kept telling him that the Standalone Media Center pack wasn't available on the store. He kept trying to sell me the
 full Pro upgrade pack at&nbsp;$99 instead of the roughly $8 (800 Yen) that it should be for the&nbsp;standalone Media Center&nbsp;pack. He told me&nbsp;the full pack&nbsp;was all that was available.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I explained I thought he was just looking at the standard store, I told him I'd already done that on the UK store the US store and the Japanese store I knew it wasn't available. The upgrade I was seeing was&nbsp;only shown as an available option&nbsp;by clicking&nbsp;"Get
 more features with a new edition of Windows" in the System&nbsp;Control Panel. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I explained the first guy had told me he was putting me through to someone technical who would understand and help me solve the problem. He said&nbsp;"I'm sorry I'm&nbsp;just a salesman but&nbsp;I could give you the address of the site&nbsp;I'm searching on"&nbsp;....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I said OK ... He said "microsoftstore.com ... that's all you need" ... I gave up.</p>

    <title>GMAIL folders missing from Windows Mail list of folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nosrednawf  say:</h3>
<h2>            GMAIL folders missing from Windows Mail list of folders</h2>
                    <p>This issue seems to have been going on for years.&nbsp; I've seen lots of posts on different sites but there does not seem to have been any resolution.&nbsp; Essentially, when adding a Gmail account to Windows Mail, not all of the Gmail folders appear, specifically,
 the Sent folder.&nbsp; &nbsp;When looking at the folder list; under [GMAIL] the following folders appear... All Mail, Drafts, Important, Spam and Starred.&nbsp; The key ones, Sent and Trash (from the Gmail server) do not appear.&nbsp; The Windows Mail app creates a Sent Mail
 and Trash folder but these are in Gmail as Imap/Sent Mail and Imap/Trash.&nbsp; When sending an email from the Windows Mail app it does not put a copy in the Sent Mail folder, but it does put a copy in the Gmail Sent folder.&nbsp; But since the Gmail Sent folder does
 not appear at all in the folder list of Windows Mail, you have no access to it without logging in to Gmail via a browser.&nbsp; This has been driving me crazy for about 3-4 years now and I've gone through 2 notebooks and several versions of Windows.&nbsp; I'm on the
 latest Windows 10 version.&nbsp; I've removed and added the Gmail account many, many times and it's had no effect.&nbsp; I've reviewed all my Gmail settings and the folders in Gmail are all set to be viewed (not hidden) so there just doesn't seem to be any resolution.&nbsp;
 Running a troubleshooter is useless as this has been a recurring problem with all versions of the Windows Mail app and Windows OS for as long as I can remember.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't believe this issue has not been resolved.&nbsp; If it has, I can't seem to find the solution anywhere.&nbsp; Does anyone know of a solution to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx.</p>

<p>This same issue was posted July 2017 (see link below).&nbsp; If you check the screenshot Boris posted it shows the [Gmail] folder list as I listed (minus the Chats folder which I don't use in Gmail).&nbsp; MS agents assisted at that time but it appears no resolution
 was made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As noted, there have been many posts across the Internet on this issue going back to 2012!&nbsp; Sorry, but I'm not wasting my time "reporting a bug" for an issue that has existed 'forever' and MS has to know it exists and is an ongoing issue.</p>

<h2>            Asphalt 8 Crashing at Startup &#40;And a few other apps like Candy Crush Soda Saga too&#41;</h2>
                    <p>All of the apps were working fine till a few days ago. but last week power failure caused power off without shutting down and the same day a few Windows Updates were installed too I don't know which one caused the problem but the games aren't starting since
 then. Asphalt crashes after Gameloft logo and Candy Crush Soda Saga after yellow screen.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Small Fonts in Dialog Boxes, Menus, Tabs</h2>
                    
<p>New machine with Windows 7 Home Premium 64-Bit.&nbsp; The font size on tabs and menu selections beneath them in various menu mindows and dialog boxes are too small.&nbsp; I refer here only to those found in Windows, IE8&nbsp;and other MS programs that come with a typical
 installation, not&nbsp;application software.&nbsp; How do I&nbsp;adjust them without using Magnifier and without&nbsp;increasing magnification?&nbsp; My screen resolution is at the recommended setting, dpi is at 100 percent, graphics card at recommended settings.&nbsp; I have already used
 the Personalization features to increase the size of&nbsp;fonts and&nbsp;other settings for items such as Active Title Bar, et al.&nbsp; Even here in this forum I find it difficult to read because of the small font size and I do not see a way to increase it locally or globally.</p>
<p>Separate but related question: Having increased font sizes, etc., using Personalization, now the text is too large for the boxes used in various Windows.&nbsp; For example, text entered into the search box in Help is too large vertically so the bottom of the
 text is cut off.&nbsp; How can this be corrected?</p>

            In terms of webpages, just click ctrl + scroll up. You can change the size that way. Maybe using it in combination with ronnies DPI change might look a little better?

    <title>How many Gigs needed to update Windows 10 Anniversary update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rubert mumps  say:</h3>
<h2>            How many Gigs needed to update Windows 10 Anniversary update</h2>
                    <p>My C: drive is partitioned and I have 10 gigs free on the main partition and 88 Gigs on the F:</p>
<p>I have another 500 Gig hard drive (not the bootable drive) also partitioned into 250 Gigs each. This drive has nothing on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will I have any trouble upgrading Windows 10 Anniversary update? I ask this because I read somewhere the 64 bit edition of Windows needs 32 Gigs of space to update. I know there used to be a small program one could download from Microsoft to check the computer
 to see if it was compatible with a new release. Does Microsoft have anything now to check for compatibility and also for what I'm asking. Please advise. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

            After Windows 10 has upgraded, does it still require that 20 Gigs (I'm thinking not of course) or since it's new, will it take much more than the older Windows 10.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your query: Yes, after upgrading to Windows 10 , it doesn't require 20 Gigs but I would recommend you create a free space on the&nbsp;drive on the Windows Operating system is Installed. Because whenever there are update installed it automatically install
 on the drive where Operating system are installed and also the computer will Function proper without any problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>

<p>Hi Fred,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that you are experiencing with your game can occur due to an outdated graphics card driver. It's also possible that some of its game files got corrupted during the installation, or your downloaded CDs are damaged/corrupted. We recommend that you
 update your graphics card driver by following the steps in this article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/15046/windows-8-download-install-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Download and install drivers in Windows 8.1</a>. If the issue still persists after that, we recommend that you download and install your graphics card driver from its original equipment manufacturer's website. If you're still experiencing the issue after that,
 we suggest that you try to reinstall the game to replace any possible corrupted game files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't hesitate to reach out to us if you need further assistance with your concern.</p>

<p>I just purchased a new computer in the UK for my Slovakian Inlaws. I was told in the shop that i could download from Microsoft a language pack for Windows7 Home Premium so my Inlaws could change the language from English to Slovakian. Unfortunately i cannot
 find a way to do this. Can someone please advise me how?</p>
<p>Thanks very much, Matthew, London.</p>

<h2>            Error &#34;One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it.&#34; when connecting Logitech M225</h2>
                    <p>Original title: &lt;Logitech M225 no longer recognized by Windows&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wireless mouse has been working just fine for the last 2 months, now all of a sudden it doesn't work at all.<br />
<br />
I am getting a notification from windows that says -<br />
<br />
"One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it."<br />
<br />
I have Vista OS 32 bit on my laptop.<br />
<br />
My desktop has Windows 7 32 bit and I am able to use the mouse on that computer, so the M225 has not malfunctioned.<br />
<br />
I tried looking for an updated download on the Logitech site &amp; only found:<br />
<br />
SetPoint 6.32.20 - This has done nothing to help.<br />
<br />
I have also tried moving the receiver to the other 2 USB ports w/ still the same results.<br />
<br />
Are there any other downloads or solutions that will help w/ this problem?</p>

<h2>            looking for a free &#40;or low-cost&#41; photo editor for 64-bit Windows 7...</h2>
                    i have a year-old computer, running the 64-bit version of Windows 7 Home Premium; it came with MS Office 2010 (the starter edition, with Word &amp; Excel) on board, but my version of MS Works Suite 2005 (with Picture It! premium), won't run.&nbsp; i'm kinda used
 to the Office/Excel software, but i miss the photo-editing software that Pictureit! provided.&nbsp; thus far, i haven't found a photo editor that is a) free (or cheap), b) easy to use (like the MS software was), and c) compatible with my operating system (if i
 had known there were 2 different versions of Win 7, i would've got the 32-bit, i think there's more software out there for it than mine).&nbsp; any suggestions?&nbsp; i don't do a LOT of digital stuff, but it's nice to add captions, text, etc right ON the photo, instead
 of under it, in a limited area; the software that came with my digital camera doesn't do much in that area either, so anything would be an improvement.

The freeware Picasa may be worth a try...<br />
it has options for adding text to the face of <br />

<p>As Barb Bowman has suggested Paint.Net&nbsp; <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.getpaint.net/</a>&nbsp;should do the trick. It is completely free. it is far superior to the windows version of Microsoft paint.</p>

<p>Hello Sofia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In line with your concern, I would recommend updating the Sensor I/O driver of your laptop. To do this, refer the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press <strong><em>Windows key + R</em></strong>, then type in <em><strong>devmgmt.msc</strong></em> and press
<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>.</p>
<p>2. In the Device Manager window, search for <strong><em>Sensor I/O devices.</em></strong></p>
<p>3. Right-click on it and select <strong><em>Search automatically for update driver software.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, it's also best to check for the latest driver from the <strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/support/home/ph/en/phbsd1/product-support/product/inspiron-15-5579-2-in-1-laptop/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">manufacturer's website.</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, you may need to modify the Registry to enable the auto-rotate feature of your device:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press <strong><em>Windows key + R</em></strong>, then type in <strong><em>regedit
</em></strong>and press <strong><em>Enter</em></strong>.</p>
<p>2. In the <strong><em>Registry Editor</em></strong>, window, navigate to the path below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AutoRotation</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Locate the key <strong><em>LastOrientation </em></strong>and double-click on it, add
<strong><em>0</em></strong> in the <em><strong>DWORD </strong></em>value data and click
<strong><em>OK </em></strong>to save changes.</p>
<p>4. Make sure that the value of <strong><em>Enable </em></strong>is set to <strong>
<em>1.</em></strong></p>
<p>5. Press <strong><em>Ctrl + F</em></strong> and search for the <em><strong>SensorPresent
</strong></em>key. If it's available, you'd also need to change the <strong><em>DWORD</em></strong> value data to
<em><strong>1</strong></em>. If it's not available, you may need to create it under
<em><strong>AutoRotation </strong></em>and make the value to <strong><em>1.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Note</strong></em>:<em> The method to fix the issue will have Registry modification. Before you modify the Registry, make sure to back it up and understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. Please refer to this link:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</a></strong>.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Daniel, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here are few things you can try to resolve the display issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Check if Surface can detect the monitor</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Connect the monitor directly to the Surface’s mini Display Port and test the connection (bypassing the Dock).
</span><span>After testing, connect the monitor back to the Dock. While doing so, check all connections, including power cables, adapters, and the Surface Connect cable. Unplug and reseat any display adapters and make sure that they are connected securely.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Undock and re-dock the Surflink connection</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This will re-establish the Surface’s connection.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Unplug the Surflink from the Surface Connect port.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Change the Surface Connect plug orientation by flipping the Surface connector 180 degrees and reseat it to your Surface device.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Make sure that the LED is lit.<br />
</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Make sure that Windows recognizes the external monitors</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Minimize all apps.</li><li>Right-click the desktop background and select <strong>Display Settings.</strong></li><li>Scroll down to <strong>Multiple displays</strong>.</li><li>First select <strong>Duplicate desktop</strong> <strong>on 1 (and 2)</strong>. For multiple monitors, repeat step with desktop (1 and 3).</li><li>Select <strong>Keep settings</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Extend to this display</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Keep settings</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Change the refresh rate of the external display</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the desktop background and select <strong>Display Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select the external display.</li><li>Scroll down and select<strong> Advanced display settings</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Display adapter properties for Display 2</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>Monitor </strong>tab.</li><li>Change the Screen refresh rate from the menu. Try a lower refresh rate first.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Clear the display cache</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Undock your Surface from the Surface Dock.</li><li><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/8/5/5/8554763F-DBF9-41B3-9F12-605FA0A99183/surface%20dock%20registry.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download the Surface Dock registry file</a>.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</strong></p>

 After running the toolkit, <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4036280/surface-force-a-shut-down-and-restart-your-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">force shutdown and restart your device</a></strong> to ensure all updates are

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Try a different cable or adapter</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>It may be that the cable or adapter is not functioning or is having issues.</span></span></span><span><span><span>We suggest that you use the shortest cable length available. The shorter the cable, the stronger the signal between monitor
 and Dock.</span></span></span></p>
<p>If none of these solutions worked, we suggest that you replace the Surface Dock.

                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it be possible to change a name on an invoice? I have made an order of software for my company laptop, but on the invoice only my name, not company name is specified. Our bookkeeper requires an invoice with a company name on it. How can I correct it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi Vladislav, 
<br />
<br />Your best bet is to reach out to MS directly, and they may be able to assist. I don’t believe there is an self serve option to change the name on an invoice. 
<br />
<br />I have 2 links below - MS support numbers, and the Microsoft Support Virtual Agent
<br />
