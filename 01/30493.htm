    <title>Unable to delete entry from Control Panel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to delete entry from Control Panel</h2>
                    <p>At one time, I had installed a program called UOTamer on my computer. When I no longer needed it, I deleted it instead of going through uninstall on the Control Panel. The Control Panel
 still shows UOTamer to be on the computer, but when I try to use it to get rid of that entry, I get an error message saying that it cannot find&nbsp; "ST6UNST.002."
<br />
</p>
<p>I now need UOTamer again, and have downloaded it. It now loads, but when I try to run any part of it, I get the error message:</p>
<p>"Run-time error '70':</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;
</span>Permission denied"</p>
<p>I can't properly delete this version because the Control Panel is looking for "ST6UNST.002." The new version does have a "ST6UNST" file but it is an .exe file rather than .002.
<br />
</p>
<p>If I try to run that file from Windows Explorer, I get an error message saying that it can "only be run from the Program Manager icon in Windows NT or the Control Panel in Windows 95. I'm
 using Windows 7, and even if I change the extension to <span>&nbsp;</span>.002, I cannot delete the program using Control Panel.</p>
<p>What must I do to cure this problem?</p>

            <p>The uninstall err msg is because its looking for the uninstaller file ST6UNST.002, which obviously it cannot find becauase you deleted the program files</p>
<p>In Programs &amp; Features is the date given for the UOTamer program the date on which you installed it?</p>

The date given is 8/12/2012. I believe that date is the one on which I installed the version with ST6UNST.exe.&nbsp; The version with ST6UNST.002 was installed several years ago. Apparently at that time I was using Windows 95.<br />

<p>Well that program is not win7 compatible, and any program that was origonally installed under win95, would not appear under your current win7 installation.</p>
<p>Or if you simply copied that programs folder from an earlier version of win to your current win version, that would'nt work</p>
<p>ST6UNST.exe is the uninstaller.</p>
<p>You can try the trial of <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.revouninstaller.com/</a>&nbsp;and see if that will uninstall it</p>

I understand and understood that the Windows 95 version wouldn't work. The problem is that there was no W 95 program on the computer, but the Control Panel was looking for the uninstaller that had been included in it. When I downloaded the new version, Windows
 7 wouldn't run it although it was created to run on Windows 7,&nbsp; The Control Panel listed only one entry for the program. The Control Panel continued to try to find the Windows 95 uninstaller, although (according to&nbsp;Windows Explorer) the Windows 7 uninstaller
 was there. and the Windows 95 uninstaller was not.. <br />
<br />
I installed revouninstaller and ran "Forced Uninstall" on UOTamer. This uninstalled the program, (according to Windows Explorer). Unfortunately, the icon remains on the Revouninstall "All Programs" screen, and the entry is still in the Control Panel. I also
 ran CCcleaner BTW, and found nothing relating to the problem.

<p>If you believe it to be win7 compatible, what site&nbsp;did you obtain it from?</p>
<p>There could have been no previous version on the PC.</p>

            Two applications I've used to clean an old version of an application in the past are Revo uninstaller and CCleaner.
<br />
<br />
If the application is still located in the windows registry, Revo uninstaller will show it within its application listings and allow you to remove not only the app but all its associated program files fully.
<br />
http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html<br />
<br />
Otherwise, you can try Ccleaner to clean your registry and windows temp files which may possible allow you to reinstall the application....more of a long-shot though.
<br />
http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner<br />
<br />
Both applications have free versions. <br />

I downloaded UOTamer from http://uo.stratics.com/xena/uotamer.shtml. That website says
<a href="http://uo.stratics.com/xena/UOTamer/UOTamer2.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">"Download UOTamer</a> - Version 2.1 - This program works with Win95, Win 98, Win2000, and Windows ME."<br />
<br />
I now have it running in comparability mode "Windows 98." So that's okay, but it put a new entry in the Control Panel, and I still can't get rid of the old one!<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For Internet Explorer 9, as with the command and favorites bars, the status bar is off by default. To enable the status bar perform the following steps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>A</strong>: Go to View&gt;Toolbars&gt;Status Bar. (To bring up the menu bar, press the Alt button.)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>B</strong>: Once the status bar is enabled Zoom will be available automatically. You can also use the zoom functionality by clicking on the tools button and using the zoom options there.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope that helps. <br />

<h2>            5 additional explorer.exe processes running under svchost&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    Hello... i was using my pc browsing the internet for some time now when i launched Process Explorer to see what all was running. What i saw was there were 5 additional explorer.exe processes running under svchost.exe.<br />
<br />
The screenshot is <a href="http://i450.photobucket.com/albums/qq222/ScaryKnight/explorer1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> .<br />
As you can see in the pic, each of these processes are verified Microsoft signed.<br />
<br />
I then checked out the processes' properties and saw this in the command line "<strong>C:\Windows\explorer.exe /factory,{75dff2b7-6936-4c06-a8bb-676a7b00b24b} -Embedding</strong> "<br />
<br />
A screenshot of the <a href="http://i450.photobucket.com/albums/qq222/ScaryKnight/explorer2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
properties box</a> .<br />
<br />
The svchost.exe process that had launched the processes was hosting the following 3 services, Dcomlaunch, PlugPlay and Power (<a href="http://i450.photobucket.com/albums/qq222/ScaryKnight/explorer3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">screenshot here</a> ).<br />
<br />
I am using Windows 7 ultimate edition with just one user account configured, running MSE as the antivirus program.<br />
<br />
Some information on these processes would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks!!! :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: None of these processes had any TCP/IP connections. There was one more instance a few days ago when there were 2 such processes running under the same svchost.exe.

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot adjust the brightness settings of my laptop, at all.</p>
<p>I also have no control of the Battery Saver thing</p>
<p>Yesterday, I had brightness control, via my FN keys and through various settings parameters.<br />
</p>
<p>I have checked a different profile.</p>
<p>I have checked a different monitor.</p>
<p>I have tried the Hardware troubleshooter.</p>
<p>I have tried the Power troubleshooter.</p>
<p>I have tried the Windows Update troubleshooter.</p>
<p>I have tried different power settings.</p>
<p>I have restarted more times than I can count.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what else to try.</p>
<p>I've seen several posts in various places about Battery Saver causing problems with Update, brightness controls, etc, and done all of the suggestions.</p>

            <p>First, I'm NOT an expert. I'm just throwing this out there so use my&nbsp;personal experience&nbsp;at your own risk. (but might be worth looking into)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows tablet running Windows 10 and I have my updates set to automatic, as well as the get other updates automatically thing checked in settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My tablet just ran an update check and a few updates by Intel asked specifically to be installed.&nbsp;Some of the update failed but one DID succeed enough to appear in my installed programs list and caused my brightness to lock and I had no control over it anymore.
 Another side effect was I lost my screen tilt ability, but that wouldn't effect you on a laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Anyway,&nbsp;the update was called something like Intel graphics (something) in the installed
<p>
</p><p>If you maybe got this update, check&nbsp;the date it was installed and compare&nbsp;that date with when you lost control. Uninstalling that returned my brightness and screen tilt.</p>
<p>

<h2>            how can i remove ms office professional edition 2003 from my computer&#63;</h2>
                    I had MS Office Professional 2000 installed on my computer.&nbsp; I get automatic updates.&nbsp; MS Office Professional Edition 2003 was automatically installed on my computer.&nbsp; When I scanned a document with Windows Fax and Scan, I was able to scan but I could
 not email the document.&nbsp; I have a permanent window (MS Office Professional Edition 2003) opened that I cannot close, delete, disable or remove in any way whatsoever.&nbsp; This is very frustrating. &nbsp; When I try to delete/uninstall MS Office Professional Edition
 2003,&nbsp; I keep getting a pop-up window telling me that I have to wait for it to be installation to complete.

            <p>No version of Office is automatically installed via windows update.</p>
<p>Office 2000 is not compatible with win7, particularly Outlook.</p>
<p>Office 2003 was withdrawn some years ago when it was superceded by Office 2007, which in turn has been superceeded by Office 2010.</p>

                    Today after restarting my computer following a routine update Microsoft Defender and Maps etc. has my computer location as 300 miles away. When I look for stores, restaurants, etc. it gives me options in the Bronx instead of Washington DC. Specifically
 it thinks I am at 542 Underhill Ave, The Bronx. My I.P. address still says I'm in DC.

<p>
</p><p>Okay, seriously:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even under the best circumstances, unless your computer has a built in GPS, Windows is taking a guess at where your computer is located, based on the data it has to work with. Some guesses are pretty and good, and some are ... not so good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows may be reading data from your browser's web cache or cookies, so one thing to try is to clear the cache and cookies in your browser (then close and re-open your browser, which may not be necessary but it's a good luck omen.) If that won't help, or
 in any case, you can tell Windows where you are from Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Location.</p>

<p>Whenever I start my computer, ipoint.exe (the software for the Microsoft optical mouse) keeps telling me to insert a disk, or that a disk is missing. This software does not require a disk. Is there a way to simply disable this pop-up window? (I have to close
 it half a dozen times before it stays closed.)</p>
<p>I attempted to fix this by uninstalling ipoint.exe (Version 7) and downloading and installing Version 8. It did not work.</p>

<p>Have a look at all the Sub-Keys in this location and see if you have any mention for Microsoft IntelliPoint 8.0?&nbsp; My Sub-Keys such as {563F041C-DFDB-437B-A1E8-E141E0906076} may be named differently than on other machines.</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\</p>
<p>With the MsConfig tool, if you want something not to start you must remove the tick from the box.&nbsp; I was hoping that you had more entries than just the normal "Microsoft Intellipoint", something more related to " insert a disk", because if you untick the
 main entry then the Mouse may not work correctly and become a standard Mouse, sort of like a lame duck.</p>
<p>If you go into Control Panel\ Mouse and open that up, there is a "Restore Defaults" button which may be worth a try?</p>

            Uninstall and then reinstall the latest Intellipoint version.&nbsp;&nbsp; There should not be an "Insert Disk" request when installed correctly (might be an anti-virus bug during the install.)

<p>I did that; it did not fix the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I expected to be delighted with all the new features of Windows 7; to date, it has caused only problems. Every time I start the computer (or, with ipoint disabled in msconfig, start ipoint manually), I have to click on the "insert a disk" box seven or eight
 times before it finally closes. Several programs that ran fine on my old computer (XP) work poorly or not at all on my new one, even with Compatibility Mode enabled.</p>

<p>If you had some mention of the Install Source, I'd love to know what it says.</p>
<p>When I search my Registry for a data entry of ipoint\setup it brings up multiple entries, how about yours'?&nbsp; Any of them should give us an idea of the install source as seen by your system.</p>

<h3> jonnogaming  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;HELP&#93; Static Screen when updating drivers</h2>
                    <p>Okay im new to the Community here so thank you for your patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 Laptop (Dell Inspiron 15 7000) has been working fine for a couple of months now. Last week i went to Support Assist and updated a couple of drivers as it was recommended. There was two drivers updated, not sure what they were exactly i think
 one was a Network driver. Since this driver update, every time i wake up my computer from sleep, there is a static screen. There is no keyboard response and mouse doesn't really do anything. I have been forced to do a hard restart each time to get my computer
 working again. So far i have run a full Windows Diagnostic Scan and a Windows Defender Scan. Nothing irregular has shown up. I have also gone through every driver through Device Manager to update each driver, incase it was some driver update issue and a bugfix
 was made, yet the problem persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Is there anyway i can have a log of all my drivers and when it was all last updated in order to backtrack and rollback the problem?</li><li>If the problem is not the driver, then what is?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>This wake-up-from-sleep static screen issue is really annoying and i don't want to do more hard restarts. Any help appreciated. Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Below is the static screen upon click on the power button to wake up the computer from sleep mode. The square static in the middle represents the mouse which can be moved but no response still.</strong></p>

<p>I would guess it's the video driver that updated. You can go to Device Manager and roll back the driver. You can also use System Restore to restore the whole device back to a point before the problem started.</p>
<p>Type system restore in windows Search and select the top result. Select System Restore and then Next and look at the restore point dates. You may have to select Show more restore points.</p>

<p>I think in your case you may need a recovery drive for safe mode. Here are 7 ways to boot into safe mode on windows 10. They have not made this easy on ssd's and the F8 does not work anymore. If you have HDD you can try F8.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/pro-tip-7-ways-to-access-safe-mode-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/pro-tip-7-ways-to-access-safe-mode-in-windows-10/</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To get out of safe mode once you have fixed .</p>
<p>Once you have <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/windows-10-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
fixed your Windows problem</a>, it‚Äôs time to restore original settings. Exiting Safe Mode from Windows 10 is a little more complicated. Here‚Äôs how to do it.</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong> Click the <strong><span>Start</span></strong> button and, in the search box, type (without quotation marks) ‚Äú<strong><span>msconfig</span></strong>‚Äù and press
<strong><span>Enter</span></strong>. This should open or show you the <strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> feature.</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong> Go to the <strong><span>Boot</span></strong> tab. In the lower right corner you should see, under
<strong><span>Boot opti</span></strong>ons, a number of choices for <strong><span>Safe boot</span></strong>, which should be selected (yes, this is a third option for activating Safe Mode if you prefer to do so from this window). Make sure that ‚Äú<strong><span>Safe
 boot</span></strong>‚Äù is <em><span>not</span></em> checked.</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong> With <strong><span>Safe boot</span></strong> unchecked, select
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>, and then <strong><span>Restart</span></strong> Windows 10 as you normally would. It should now open in its full mode.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 product key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nathan9876543210  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 product key</h2>
                    Well my computer is getting the automatic update loop, and the only tool I can use are the BIOS(delete key) and boot(f12 key) on my gateway NX4870. I didn't plan ahead too well and never burned a copy of my files on a disk. After looking at several threads,
 the only way I think possible to fix my problem is to repair my windows 8 files with a windows 8 disk. Problem is I bought my computer with windows 8 already preinstalled, so I don't have a product key to use to download windows 8 onto a disk from a separate
 computer but, I do have a labtop that has windows 8.1 installed. So I was wondering if I should make a back up of my labtops windows 8.1 and use that to recover my desktop or if it's a better idea to just buy a windows 8 disk and use that?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Since Windows 8 came pre-installed, it would be best to get in touch with the laptop manufacturer to know how to find out the product key that is used in your computer and also regarding the Windows 8 installation
 media. Once you get your product key, you can create an installation media for Windows 8. For that you may use the Windows 7 USB/DVD tool to make a bootable DVD/USB for Windows 8 using the setup.exe</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Refer to this link to do the same.</font></span></p>

<p>Which product key are you using on the laptop which is having the issue? </p>
<p>To repair the Windows 8 laptop you have to use the same product key provided by the manufacturer.</p>

            One addition&nbsp; thing. You can't download a digital copy of Windows * off the web. You must use the OEM copy that came with the computer. If you don't have the recovery partition still on your computer or disks you will have to contact The computer Manufacturer
 and have them send you the recovery DVDs/CDs. They&nbsp;often have a small charge for this. HP charge me $16.--.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to assist you.

                    I have bought a logitech keyboard and mouse.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have contacted support and as these work in another machine (vista) they say it is an error on this machine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When connecting the wireless receiver it shows up and installs in windows 7 64bit home premium however the logitech unifyier software cant see a receiver is connected and so I cant pair the keyboard and mouse to the pc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried various usb ports, front and back and usb2.0 and 3.0 but there is no change.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas how to get these to work on windows 7 I have checked and the devices are compatable with my version of windows</div>

<h3> cliff_roberts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 locks up after update.</h2>
                    
<p><span>I found my computer locked up with a screen stating something about configuring an update and not to turn it off.<span>&nbsp;
</span>After 2 hours I finally held the power button down and forced a re-boot.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I was able to launch windows and login.<span>&nbsp; </span>The system told me that an update had failed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I clicked on install the update and it completed fine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I went to lunch and when I returned my computer was locked up.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have restarted several times and when I get to the login screen it will lock up.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If I am fast enough to enter the password it goes to the ‚ÄúWelcome‚Äù screen and then locks up there.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have started in the safe mode and ran my Norton scans with no items found and reviewing the device manager no items appear to be having problems.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Whatever that update was seems to have damaged my system in some way.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Anyone have any ideas on how to repair it?<span>&nbsp; </span>I just went through a clean install of this system 2 weeks ago and I don‚Äôt look forward of reloading all my software again.<span>&nbsp;

<p>Hey CRLSinc,</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in Microsoft answers!</p>
<p>a. What was the update you installed? <br />
b. Did you make any other changes to the computer recently?</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Boot into safe mode and perform a System File Checker (SFC) scan on your system. SFC tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions.</p>
<p>To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. Click Start, and then type cmd in the Start Search box.<br />
2. Right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator.</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue</p>
<p>3. At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; sfc /scannow</strong></p>
<p>Check the below link for details:</p>
<p><strong>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</strong></a></p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>If the above method doesn‚Äôt help in fixing the issue, you may do a system restore to an earlier point when everything was working fine.</p>
<p>System Restore helps you restore your computer's system files to an earlier point in time. It's a way to undo system changes to your computer without affecting your personal files, such as e mail, documents, or photos.</p>
<p>Open System Restore by clicking the Start button, clicking All Programs, clicking Accessories, clicking System Tools, and then clicking System Restore. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>For more details, refer the below links:</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t start, 0xc00000225</h2>
                    Ok I'm using my 8 year old daughter's pc to post this post, because my $10, 000 computer won't boot. says 0xc00000225 error which turns out to be winloader. won't load. I looked online for the answer but found a heap of **** that didn't work. The last
 thing he computer did was an update from Mr Microsoft. I tried to roll back but not happening.Looks like a complete reinstall. I think Microsoft should cough up for lost data, if it is proven to be the update. Every forum has been locked so I can't add my
 comment. I figure that Microsoft's update **** the loader, so I guess a roll back of the latest update might help. Anyone else thinking the same way?

            Hi IzabellaBrew 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />Let us try repairing the existing OS.
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21284-enable-disable-fast-boot-uefi-firmware-settings-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21284-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html#option6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help, consider doing a clean install after rescuing your files.

<p>Short answer, after a lot of investigation. I found the update had a problem with my BIOs. So I loaded the default settings in the BIOs and made sure that the primary hard drive was going to boot first and restarted and everything worked for me, I hope this
 helps.</p>

            All you tech heads out there, this problem is starting to give me the ****, ok running a Gigabyte X299 Aorus motherboard, 128 ram, a NDIVDIA Getforce GTX 1080i graphics card, 3 x 8 Tb western digital hard drives, 3 x 4 TB western digital hard drives,
 the chip is an I core 7 ( what ever I forget ) I run occulus rift S ( problem started before the Rift) but I get an error ( changes every **** day ) I have done every update known to man. seems to be an edge problem.&nbsp; " your computer has run into a problem,
 blah blah blah" computer restarts sometimes. I have to turn the computer off for some time before the BIOs picks up the main hard drive again. I have done the updates on the BIOs. I only come home maybe every second weekend, and have to do this **** every
 **** time. This is ****, looking like a faulty hard&nbsp; drive done everything else. If this fails I'll be sending Microsoft a bill for the time and labour for the data that I lost

    <title>Homegroup removed but NO good alternative. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lawrence_microsoft  say:</h3>
<h2>            Homegroup removed but NO good alternative.</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft decided to reduce the abilities of Windows. The official reason is below, but clearly this is not the truth!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of us have more than one computer at home. Many of us share between computers and may of us do NOT want to upload all to controlled cloud storage and redownload again particularly in respect to movies and other large files which don't up and download
 easily or quickly (particularly in times of high internet demand).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, many of us are quite happy with our own many Gigabyte hardisks at home which WE control and access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since homegroup has been removed, the network access between computers has also been removed and files are no longer shared. Its back to the future with copying all to a drive and physically then re-copying to another computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The so called Sharing is now only for printers. I don't want all my content (even if I was willing to pay for the many Terabyte of data I would need) on Microsoft controlled servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;"Easily
 connecting to and sharing the important pieces of your digital life with those who matter most has never been easier with today‚Äôs Modern PCs and the cloud. Whether it‚Äôs connecting PCs and printers on your home network via the Share functionality in Windows
 or using OneDrive to share a photo album of your last vacation, Windows 10 makes connecting multiple devices and sharing content streamlined and simple. And it‚Äôs because of that evolution that with today‚Äôs build you‚Äôll start to see us&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/Windows-10-specifications#feature-deprecation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">retire</a></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;the
 HomeGroup service. HomeGroup was terrific for the pre-cloud and pre-mobile era, but today this functionality is built right into Windows 10 and apps. Starting with this build, the HomeGroup service is no longer operational in Windows 10. The user profile used
 for sharing and the file/folder/printer shares will continue to work"</span></p>
<p>BUT nothing else!!</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply Akheel Ahmed. But none of the above methods rectified my problem...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1 opens a command window and did nothing even after a long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 did not show any errors..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think if I am able to open the windows store I can get back the other apps.. hopefully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But store it self is not running..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please suggest me the appropriate fix ASAP.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Same here.&nbsp; I am having the same problem.&nbsp; I have just upgraded to windows 10 from windows 8.1, a couple of days ago, but the windows store doesn't even open, the photos app doesn't even open, the camera app doesn't open, and I think some of the other apps
 but I can't remember which.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the 'fixes' work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seems to be a lot of people having these issues.&nbsp; Has there not been a general fix rolled out as an update?&nbsp; Or can I not get that update until 30 days have passed and I haven't reverted back to windows 8.1?&nbsp; (which would be really rubbish if that
 was the case as this is a negative for windows 10)</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As there are dumb people here with MS employee tags, who will never care about the real problems customers face, Finally, I did the fresh install to my laptop. Now, it is working OK. If you are using the genuine windows version(I mean, if you registered
 with valid key) right now, I recommend you to go for the fresh install from MS site:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>--&gt;Just go to the above site, and <strong>download media creation tool</strong>(around 10 mb), then run it...
</p>
<p>--&gt;Follow the prompt(s) (quite simple steps like "want to update now? or want to create usb/iso to use later , which version? , etc" ).</p>
<p>--&gt;The good thing is you can straight choose "update now "( and it will <strong>
automatically download</strong> the update(around 3gb from MS site)).</p>
<p>--&gt; After that it will ask you to weather to install "update only( u will loose installed programs and other c drive data)" or&nbsp;"update by keeping the installed programs".. You can choose&nbsp;"update by keeping the installed programs".
</p>
<p>--&gt; Then it took around 1-2 hours to install it. (Don't worry , you can <strong>
get rid of all the errors without loosing even a piece of your data</strong>). </p>
<p>--&gt;The good thing is your new update (essentially the same what you have right now but a fresh copy of it) will get
<strong>registered automatically</strong> from the MS servers while updating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, overall it took around 4,5 hours in total( depends on your internet speed to download the update from MS server) ,
<strong>but the real benefits are:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>(1) No need to worry about loosing the data and programs that you are already instaalled</strong></p>
<p><strong>(2) No need to worry about the registration (it will done automatically from the MS servers, You need not to know about your windows OS key, true believe me.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>(3) fresh copy of the same OS.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps you...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please get back to me if you have any more queries. I can help you from the experiences I gained from the fresh installation. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thanking you, I followed your instructions &amp; everything is back running as new. Very disappointed with Microsoft support Australia who couldn't fix the problem with their operating system on a two week old computer that has been updated. They wanted to direct
 me to area where I had to pay to have their software problem fixed at my cost ?</p>

<h2>            Free upgrade fails even with ISO image - Will a clean install maintain my license&#63;</h2>
                    <p>HiI am eligible for the free upgrade from Win7 to Win10 and the process hasn't worked. I have followed the upgrade process several times, and the debug process has taken me to use the ISO file option, where I get to the error 0xC1900101-0x20017
 in the SAFE_OS phase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The troubleshooting for this error starts like this: "Repeat the same steps used for error&nbsp;0xc000021a and also apply the following:..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps for error 0xc000021a basically convert the drive partition from NTFS to GPT, wiping all the data, and thus starting with a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read everywhere that I shouldn't do a clean install without first performing the upgrade and activation first, which doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will a clean install maintain the license I am entitled to?</p>
<p>Please, confirm if this is the safe way to go...</p>

            <p>Hey Charlie -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good work.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Only one concern:&nbsp; Windows Boot Manager is what boots a UEFI install.&nbsp; If it is not&nbsp; then you must have an MBR install instead, since other wise the hard drive will never be set as first boot device unless it's a Legacy install to MBR.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe something
 else is up.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've solved this problem for myself on my N550JV!</p>
<p>One one of forums dedicated to some other notebook model, I saw someone said about re-flashing the same BIOS.</p>
<p>So did I. It worked!</p>
<p>One thing is that you have to start WinFlash with a command line, so that it could accept an "older" (actually, same date) BIOS 208: "WinFlash.exe /nodate".</p>
<p>This is it :)</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
