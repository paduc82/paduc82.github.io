<h2>            My computer randomly restarts. It does this without warning at completely random intervals.</h2>
                    &nbsp;It is not a heat problem (I have several good fans and it will still restart when one side of the case is off). I have disabled automatically shutdown if a problem is detected. I have run the "sfc/scannow" and that came up with nothing yet i am still
 having problems. I am using windows 7. i have found it will always shut down whenever I try to uninstall a programme or repair when. When I try to repair a programme while in safe mode it says "windows device installer cannot be found. This may be to it being
 installed incorrectly."

            <p><span>Hi Shakeel,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand the issue that you are currently facing, we will try the best we can to resolve your issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You might be aware that Windows Insider Preview is still in developmental stage, you may expect some compatibility issues as of now and some features or settings might not work as expected.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>As of now,&nbsp;I suggest you to follow the steps below and check if that helps.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Keep the Windows Phone on while&nbsp;performing the soft reset. Then press and hold the
<strong>volume down + power</strong> buttons until your phone vibrates and restarts.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">: You should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears).
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2</strong><span>: If you are still facing the same issue, then perform hard reset which will bring your phone back to factory settings, the same state as when the device was first turned on. All apps, messages, media, personal settings,
 etc. will be removed from the phone.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer to the following article on How to perform soft and hard reset your Windows Phone.
<br />
</span></span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Disclaimer</span></strong><span>: Resetting your phone will erase your personal content, including text messages and apps you've downloaded, and your phone will be restored to its factory settings. Create a backup before you initiate
 a reset.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Hope the information helps. Please keep us posted on Windows related queries and we will be happy to assist you further.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Nachappa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestions. However, I have tried the soft and hard reset maneuvers you mentioned, but the phone remains dead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Device Recovery Tool (v 3.1.5) does detect it, but does not have the emergency flashing package for it as of now.</p>

            <p>My lumia 950 is also bricked. No kind of reset works, it seems the phone is stuck in a loop of trying to boot and crashing. The screen remains black, WDRT 3.1.5 doesn´t find the phone and it is also not listed in the device list.</p>
<p>The crash happened while charging via Nokia DT-910 qi Charging Station.</p>

<h2>            When making a screen shot&#58; Can I change the resolution&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I was wondering if there is a way to change the resolution for a screen shot when I make one with Windows XP. I'd like to make a better quality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have noticed that when I make a screen shot and paste it into mspaint or my scanners image editing program: It might not matter since I can crop it and enhance the images a little. But sometimes I need a better shot.</p>
<p>Does anyone know the resolution of XP Home Edition - SP3 or Vistas Home Premium 64-bit - SP2's screen shots?</p>
<p>Would the steps, if there are any, be the same for&nbsp;Vista?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>==================================<br />
If your Desktop resolution is 1024x768 (for example) <br />
that's what&nbsp;a full&nbsp;screenshot will be. A partial screenshot <br />
will be a lower pixel count.</p>
<p>I find the following freeware to be useful:</p>
<p>Gadwin PrintScreen<br />
<a href="http://www.gadwin.com/printscreen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gadwin.com/printscreen/</a></p>
<p>Gadwin PrintScreen Download screen<br />
<a href="http://www.gadwin.com/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gadwin.com/download/</a><br />
(scroll down to : Gadwin PrintScreen 4.3 freeware)<br />
<br />
I have it set so all I have to do is:<br />
<br />
1) Press...PrintScreen...<br />
2) Drag a box around the content I wish to save...<br />
3) Press enter...</p>
<p>The shot is immediately saved as a .jpg in a<br />
folder of my choice.</p>
<p>Windows Vista has the 'Snipping Tool'..........</p>

<p>=========================================<br />
You're welcome.</p>
<p>Just to recap...if you increase your desktop resolution...<br />
your Screen Shots would follow suit. (This adjustment<br />
is found at :&nbsp; Control Panel / Display / Settings tab / <br />
drag the slider to change the resolution) these settings<br />
are limited by your Video Adapter/Video Driver...you<br />
may already be at the maximum setting.</p>
<p>FWIW...you can&nbsp;increase the resolution (pixel size) of<br />
any&nbsp;existing Screen Shot (digital photo) by Resizing. If<br />
you use an option called Resampling the result is slightly <br />
better.</p>
<p>The freeware IrfanView has the Resample option.</p>
<p>(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)</p>
<p>IrfanView and IrfanView Plug-ins<br />
<a href="http://www.download.hr/download-irfanview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.download.hr/download-irfanview.html</a></p>
<p>For instructions on resampling&nbsp;search IrfanView Help for Resample.</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<h2>            Different settings for USB mouse and touchpad</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just picked up a Windows 10 laptop yesterday and I'm having issues setting things up to my preferences. On my Windows 7 laptop, I have the touchpad buttons set to left-handed, while any USB mouse stays as the default right-handed. Trying to adjust things
 this way in Windows 10, I only have one mouse setting that changes both the touchpad and USB mouse, so I can't make one left-handed and the other right-handed. How would I go about doing this?</p>

            I'm not having any issue with installed hardware or software, I didn't install any of that. I want to give different settings to the touchpad and USB mouse, but the settings are merged into one, where on my Windows 7 laptop I can adjust them separately.
 How can I&nbsp;use different settings for the touchpad and USB mouse?

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do you change the context menu for web pages (.HTML, .HTM files) so when you right-click and select "Edit" the file is opened in another HTML editor (Dreamweaver, Visual Studio, Sublime Text, etc....) rather then Microsoft Word?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>
</p><p>Just got this issue. The System (PID: 4) suddenly have high Writing process and I have no idea what happen. I try to clear as much space as I could, but Windows keep using the HDD until reaches 16MB. Clearing more spaces again is useless and it eats up the
 space again. Try to restart and do troubleshooting but still no luck. First time I have ever experience this in Windows. I also already disable SuperFetch.</p>

            I resolved the issue by resetting Windows. Then I feel bad about it so I do clean install instead. I have no idea what was happening to the OS eating up the disk so fast. It seems what you have experience is similar to mine. My recommendation is just reset
 the Windows or clean reinstall.

<h2>            KB947821 does not fix 800B0001 error with windows update</h2>
                    The last time windows update ran for me was February 17th. Since then running Windows Update results in a 800B0001 error (Cannot search for new updates). I've downloaded and run the advised KB947821 (System Update Readiness) fix. Nothing changed. I still
 get the same error when running Windows Update. <br />
<br />
Any thoughts?<br />

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Multiple pictures in Settings likely occur if you've changed your user account picture several times. Windows 10 stores your user account pictures in a hidden
<strong>AccountPictures</strong> folder. To remove the unwanted picture, here's how: In the Search bar, type
<strong>%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\AccountPictures</strong>, then press <strong>
Enter</strong>. It will display all your account pictures, then delete your old photos.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you have further questions. <br />
</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 cannot boot external HP passport disk of Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Folk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello. I copied the hard disk of my laptop Windows 7 to an external HP Passport disk.
</p>
<p>The HP passport disk is bootable in another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought a new laptop Windows 10 that is working correctly. But after I plug in the Windows 7 HP Passport disk in laptop Windows 10 and start the machine, Windows 10 doesn't boot the Windows 7 HP passport disk and boot itself Windows 10 normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In laptop Windows 7, if we want to boot external hard disk after start the machine, we press esc key to get to Menu and select "boot the machine from external hard disk". But in laptop Windows 10, after start the machine and press esc key, there is no Menu
 coming up for me to select an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus my question is:</p>
<p>How to boot the external HP passport disk of Windows 7 in my new laptop Windows 10 ?</p>
<p>In another word, how to come up the Menu after press power button in laptop Windows 10 ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem most likely is being caused by the fact that your computer is "New"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost all new computers use UEFI Bios... It is almost guaranteed that the machine from which you copied Windows 7 was NOT a UEFI machine, but "Legacy"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as your Bios is configured for UEFI Bios it will not boot from the Win 7 drive..</p>
<p>
</p><p>A hard drive set up to run on Legacy Bios is configured much differently than one that is configured to run on UEFI Bios... They are actually "Initialized" differently just to start with...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your Win 7 was preinstalled on another machine, then it is not licensed to run on the new machine... That probably would not stop it from booting though...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not careful, you could mess up your new machine trying to modify Bios settings to boot from the Win 7 drive, but you may be able to reset your Bios to Defaults if a problem arises...</p>

    <title>Xbox classic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox classic</h2>
                    I was just thinking... What if Xbox tried to do what PlayStation and Nintendo are already doing? Making their original consoles as retros, I think Xbox should do that because there are many original Xbox games that people could play on it plus it would
 be a cool throwback for people I also think Microsoft should call the retro original Xbox... Xbox classic. Please upvote for awareness.

<p>Thanks, but I am getting rid of cable and going with netflix, on air antenna tv, internet tv, direct sports and Detroit Tiger games, ect. &nbsp;So, is there any way for me to get the Xbox One live TV &amp; benefits without having a cable box with HDMI Outlet? &nbsp;With
 so many people opting out of cable &amp; so many good alternatives, I cannot believe that Microsoft would create Xbox One so that a user has to buy cable. &nbsp;Smells like collusion to me.</p>

<h2>            USB port not working because of USB2.0-CRW&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It's really annoying how the USB port (the only one on the left side of the laptop) always don't work. I can't use my mouse, use USB devices, or connecting my phone as I'm using a Mobile Broadband Modem that is quite big and literally "occupied" 2 ports
 (the only two on the right side). I'm wondering if the USB2.0-CRW thing is the problem causing my other side's port not to work. I've tried to find the internet whether there's driver softwares for me to download, but of course, no. I've also tried to make
 Windows Device Manager to search online for drivers, but still, no.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Help please, this problem is really making me bogging the speed down of doing all my work if I need to use my USB disk to transfer files as I need to always disconnect my internet first.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>
                </div>

    <title>Asus Zenbook Pro UX550VD Front speakers don&#39;t work anymore. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Asus Zenbook Pro UX550VD Front speakers don&#39;t work anymore.</h2>
                    <p>Hello there, after the Spring update 1803 the front speakers don't work anymore but the bottom ones yes. I tried several methods playing around with the drivers but the speakers are still off.</p>
<p>In "device manager",&nbsp; under "audio input and output" and "sound, video and game controllers" I disabled and enabled the drivers, uninstalled and reinstalled them and nothing worked. I tried the "troubleshoot sound problems" and other troubleshoot and none
 of them gave me a positive result. I downloaded, on the Asus official web site, the audio drivers for my laptop and installed them. Still nothing.</p>
<p>The only thing I'm sure of is that with the previous version of Windows everything was working properly and my last move would be take my Windows back to the previous version.</p>
<p>Last thing I can tell is that after the update I had the playback issue with all the videos (streamed and not) and I partially solved the problem. In Chrome I disabled the hardware acceleration (setting--&gt;advanced--&gt;hardware acceleration) and for the videos
 on my laptop I downloaded a software that make my videos work but still all the Windows multimedia app aren't working at all. For example the "Film and TV" app give me a green screen and I can only listen the audio of the videos and Windows Media Player does
 the same.</p>
<p>The quality of the audio coming from the two working speakers is lower then before even when I set it with the "Realtek HD Audio Manager".</p>
<p>Is like if the Spring version killed the Audio and Video of my laptop.</p>
<p>At last, before to downgrade my Windows to the previous version, I thought that maybe you guys can give me a hand to solve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            Hi Marcello.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service tag from the sticker on PC.  
<br />
<br />While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by April Version 1803 update can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hello Greg, the major part of the advices you gave me I have had already tried yesterday following guides. I gave a chance to the few things I haven't tried yet but still nothing make the speakers work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice one important thing that made me believe the Spring update went wrong. In setting, I don't have the option to roll back even though is only three days that I installed the update. I read in several forums that the roll back option should stay there
 for at least ten days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm starting now the downgrade to the version 1709 using the recovery through USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy

<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install

<p>Hi Andre, sorry but I didn't read your message in time and now I have another problem that you could help me with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downgrade Windows to the version 1709 (stopping the updated 1803 with a little utility) and all the problems, I had before with the Spring version, are now gone. The problem now is that with this installation I lost all the Asus softwares and drivers that
 I normally would have after a reset. I updated all the drivers and I'm still having problems with backlight keyboard (solved it with Asus drivers) and I don't have anymore the option to change the display brightness. No where. Is like if the option disappear.</p>
<p>I was wondering is there a version of Windows 10 with all the Asus softwares and drivers that I can download, to take back my laptop like it was before?</p>
<p>Because really looks like the problems never ends and so I start to think to send the laptop to the Asus assistance.</p>
<p>I just would like a Windows 10 version for Asus Zenbook pro UX550VD to take back my laptop like it was before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Marcello.</p>

            <p>Using a restore point reverts your system software (not data) back to the state it was in when the restore point was created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would be the recommended procedure in the case you describe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hint:&nbsp; With some antivirus software installs, you can not restore a computer in regular mode.&nbsp; But, you can in Safe mode -- F8 on startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you muck around too much, before you use a restore point, it may not be able to restore, so do it soon.</p>

<h2>            Quckbooks not responding with Windows 08--blue circle of death</h2>
                    Is anyone else having issues with errors in QB running on Windows 08? We recently installed QB 2013 on Windows 08 and have had nothing but problems ever since. We get the blue circle of death with an error message of QuickBooks not responding..do we want
 to wait or close out. When we close out we have to shut the entire computer down to get back in. We are having to do this several times a day. I have been on the phone with QB tech supports more times than I can shake a stick at and our problem is still not
 resolved. Any suggestions?

<h2>            Getting a black screen on startup saying no OS is found</h2>
                    Original Title: Windows Start Up Error<br />
<br />
I have Windows 7 and when i started up, a black screen with while text came up. It gave me two options - 1. Start Startup Repair (Reccommended) 2. Start Windows Normally. When i started windows normally, it did startup repair. The startup repair did not fix
 it and the root cause found was "No OS files found on disk". I need to figure out how to fix this and i do NOT want to have to reinstall windows A.K.A. "Out Of the Box Experience". Please, someone help. P.S. I can not go to any normal logins or desktops so
 i can not install anything.

<h2>            Screen distorted in Windows 10 - Not alone - Since Mid-November 2017</h2>
                    <p>NOticed several responses to issue in Microsoft Community. Suggested MS correction is to update video driver(s) but no help.</p>
<p>Personally had same issue a year or more ago. Dell Tech Support corrected problem at that time. I don't remember the fix. It is very concerning. Occurs on Desktop and all Internet Webpages. I have Dell Monitor (Widescreen) originally with Vista (64) now
 Windows 10. Windows 10 works with some instability issues at times. But the screen was never out of proportion. Now circles are ovals. Icons are no longer round and squares are now rectangles. The Dell Tech who corrected my issue over a year ago knew exactly
 where to go and correct the issue. What to do now? Have appointment with Dell Support at 3:00 PM EST this afternoon. The support tech helping me now doesn't come to work until 11:00 PM his time. I'll post here again if a solution is reached. One person in
 the thread suggested restoring back to a point where the problem didn't exist. Haven't tried it but it sounds like a good idea. Stay tuned or please submit a solution to this issue.</p>

            Option 1.Try Rolling back if you have an option:
<br />See DaveM and Sumit Dhiman2 posts:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start-win_general/screen-stretched-and-resolution-options-dont-fix/20ce6b86-69ad-42d2-83ab-847df6ab9e5e#LastReply">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />Option 2. Remove AMD drivers completely and Install the legacy ones from the AMD site:
<br />What you need to do:
<br />1. Uninstall everything of AMD using this: <a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/AMD-Clean-Uninstall-Utility.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/...</a> and reboot
<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.
<br />4. Download the legacy driver from here(You might have to do a bit of exercise to locate the driver:
<br /><a href="http://www.support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.
<br />Option 3: See if Windows itself has some history of the Older Driver:
<br />Solution by Ken-C here:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/windows-10-set-display-resolution-to-1920x1080/8ad4adc6-7cc1-494e-b296-e6c4dd8caefa?messageId=913d5c97-7dd7-4780-b735-1026da383882">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />Please note all the steps need temporarily disabling of Windows update or driver updates so that newer driver doesn't install automatically.

            Hi Metro Rail, this is widely reported at the moment!
<br />
<br />The Fix: your Display Driver will need rolling back . . . Windows Update has lately been installing incorrect display drivers . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your graphics card, choose properties 
<br />On the Driver Tab, click 'Roll back Driver' 
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager and restart your system
<br />
<br />
<br />If there is no roll back available or that does not work, go to the Support page of the manufacturer of your PC/Laptop 
<br />
<br />Download the Device Driver they recommend for your Display Adapter/GPU and install that version, until Microsoft come out with a fix . . .       
        </p>

<h2>            Win7 Dual Monitor icons not on primary monitor</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>Today for no reason at all ....my primary monitor is on the left dual screen, but all of my icons are on the right second screen.&nbsp; If I reset an make the right be my primary screen, it happens but the icons&nbsp; go to the left and the blank desktop with must
 the start tray goes to the right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So regardless how this is set the icons are on the opposite side than the Primary with the tray.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This occurred on a start up all by itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried to select all the icons and drag the whole lot, but they stayed frozen in place.&nbsp; I later tried one at a time and a couple moved but others stayed and would not move.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frustrating .....please help&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dell Latitude 6430</p>
<p>

<p>Anyone have any random moments that left you laughing or scratching your head thinking WTF?</p>
<p>Feel free to share here.</p>
<p>I was in an Imperial camp with Lydia getting a mission. I decided that I was going to go solo so I disbanded with Lydia. As soon as she wasn'tt a follower I heard the Imperials threating her to leave.....moments later she is getting chased by about 4 soliders.
 I have yet to see her back at the castle or my residence since.</p>

<p>While i was doing Forbidden Legend quest (without spoiling it for anyone) the second dude you fight with the REALLY ANNOYING shout flew me onto the alter, tried to get past the invisible wall to get down for a good 5mins, turned around while in sneak mode
 and got an option to pickpocket the dude (without spoiling it for anyone again) inside the closed coffin.</p>
<p>Pretty random, had to reload a save to get off alter.</p>

    <title>Video TDR Failure since Windows 10 Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewbarnard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video TDR Failure since Windows 10 Update</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 forced an update in the last few days - the Anniversary update?</p>
<p>Since then I get a frequent problem waking from sleep with an error referring to Video TDR Failure and atikmpag.sys.</p>
<p>Video drivers are up to date, confirmed by Windows update and checking with AMD.</p>
<p>Microsoft need to fix this problem which has resulted from the update on what has otherwise been a stable machine - the problem is wasting my time and losing my work when the machine crashes. &nbsp;What's the fix? Thanks</p>

            <p>As I said in my posting, both MS and AMD report that the driver is the newest available.</p>
<p>Are you saying that the current version of the driver (the one apparently already installed) needs to be re-installed? &nbsp;Will this change anything?</p>
<p>Something has changed as a result of Microsoft's update to Windows 10 and therefore I suggest the problem rests with MS.</p>

            <p>OK, thanks but this only happened immediately after a MS update of Windows 10.</p>
<p>I haven't experienced any other driver problems on this PC<br />
I will reinstall the driver but emphasise that the problem follows the recent Windows update and therefore is a MS initiated problem - not one I should be having to struggle with or resolve myself</p>

            <p>First this is a peer to peer site staffed mostly by volunteers who have little or no contact to MS.&nbsp; I dont work for them and cannot comment for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drivers can become corrupt for literally hundreds of reasons.&nbsp; The update may have been the cause or it may simply have been a coincidence.&nbsp; In either case you are responsible for maintaining your computer.&nbsp; Microsoft merely licenses windows use on it.</p>

            <p>Apologies, I had the impression you were a MS person responding as a member of the community. &nbsp;I'm grateful for your help.</p>
<p>I still point a finger at MS however; I was problem-free with this machine until the recent update. &nbsp;My job is not to maintain my PC as a result of the actions of a large corporate that profits from the use of its technology whether on a bought or licensed
 basis. &nbsp;Licensing does not mean that MS can abdicate from the consequences of its actions.</p>
<p>Anyway....I've uninstalled and reinstalled the driver suite and hope that will fix the problem</p>

            <p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Video TDR failure usually occurs in either of the following scenarios:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Corrupted video or graphics driver.</li><li>Using programs that are graphics intensive such as games or similar applications.</li><li>Corruption in the Operating System.</li><li>Overheating of the video card.</li><li>Dust or physical damage on the video card.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue persists even after updating the video driver, please check if you have running applications that are graphics intensive. You may also let your computer cool down after a few hours of use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is still present even with minimal use of your computer, you may consider resetting or reinstalling Windows 10. Please note that doing this may delete your files and system settings, including partitions. Be sure to back up your files before
 resetting your operating system. For more information, kindly check out this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/4bf2674b-53b9-5fc5-7cd6-046a8eff49f2/reset-or-reinstall-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>The issue was resolved following a subsequent Windows 10 update which quickly followed the one that triggered the problem.</p>
<p>Please let's not forget that it's not always the user's PC or the way they manage their system that can result in frustrating problems which devour time and effort.</p>

<p>This has happened to some&nbsp; of my machines too. 4 to be exact plus two Win 10 tablets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It IS the update and MS should quickly resolve these issues of updating, before sending their scripts out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An absolute time waster which costs me money and wasted time and I am no happy about it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also, can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a link on using OneDrive:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.</p>

<p>The &nbsp;EasyAntiCheat.sys and &nbsp;FACEIT.sys drivers show up as potential problematic drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you uninstall the application that installed these drivers and see if the crash resolves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Afterwards you could try reinstalling the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the error persists can you also provide the following file which has more information on the crash:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The memory.dmp file will be quite large, you could zip and compress the memory.dmp file with a third party application such as 7-Zip.</p>

<span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft
 Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a question.&nbsp; Are you shutting down the computer, or are you restarting it?&nbsp; There is a big difference between Windows 7 and Windows 10.&nbsp; With Windows 10, you have to restart for changes to take effect.&nbsp; When Shut Down, the computer really never does
 so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you have Catalyst Control Panel open, doesn't it have an inbuilt setting to have the program to startup with Windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To run ASUS&nbsp;GPU Tweak, try using the Compatibility Troubleshooter in the Control Panel.&nbsp; Is your file one that's compatible with Windows 8.1?&nbsp; It should also run in Windows 10.

            <p>Brenda, I have restarted and shutdown the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The GPU tweak is windows 7 and it runs...It just doesn't start at startup. Also, in reading the download screen for this, the windows 7 and windows 8 versions are the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Catalyst control panel doesn't have a setting to start at startup. It is done in the setup. I have contacted AMD support also about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why they don't start. I will try compatibility when I can...I work on my computer and I can't shut it down just any time when I am at work.</p>

</p><p>The AMD catalyst control center has always been configured to automatically start up with Windows.&nbsp; That's how it installs.&nbsp; This is from the AMD website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"How do I disable the AMD Catalyst Control Center icon from loading in the system icon tray on start up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>By default, the AMD Catalyst Control Center runs at start up and displays an icon in the system tray area. To disable the AMD Catalyst Control Center from displaying an icon in the system
 tray, please follow the steps listed below:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Right-click on your desktopand select the AMD Catalyst Control Center</span></li><li><span>Click on the "Preferences" button in the top right-hand corner</span></li><li><span>Uncheck the "Enable System Tray Menu" option"</span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has this only started to happen after upgrading to Windows 10?&nbsp; Do you have a new computer with Windows 10 pre-installed?&nbsp;

            <p>I updated to GPU tweak 2.8.3 and then it stopped running at startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated Catalyst control to the latest version and it stopped running at startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I built this computer several years ago and it started with windows 7. I have figured out how to get some programs that I was having problems with to run like I want. The only programs I am having problems with now are GPU tweak and Catalyst control.</p>
