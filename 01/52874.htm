<h2>            How to change settings of which device is plugged into audio jack&#63;</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Whenever I plugged in my earphones, the notification would pop saying "You just plugged a device into the audio jack" With this, a window
 would pop up saying what kind of device I had plugged in and would give out the options: headphones, earphones, headphones with microphone, etc.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I clicked on headphones with microphone and ticked the box "don't show this message again". But now, whenever I Skype with someone, they can
 hear the videos and music I'm listening too even with my earphones plugged in.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">How do I change the device from headset with microphone to just earphones? How can I make this pop up window open up again whenever I plug something
 into the audio jack? How can I change the settings?</span><br />

<h3> famousturtle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Driver_Verifier_IOmanager_Violation Error on Startup</h2>
                    This is my first time posting here. I received this message every time I try to start my Windows desktop PC. There is a blue screen that prevents me from loading windows normally. I think this error may have been caused by a compatability issue with some
 of the older programs present on the computer before the Windows 10 update. I was on Windows 7 before and I updated to Windows 10 without any issues. It was only when I restarted my computer today that I can no longer load Windows. I have tried to reset my
 verifier settings already and I can still boot into safe mode. I have a link to the DMP zip file for more information about this error here:&nbsp;https://www.sendspace.com/file/pemlyg. I would really appreciate if someone could help me resolve this issue as soon
 as possible as this is the only Windows computer I have available. Please let me know if there is any further information I should provide. Thank you.

<h2>            Skype for Business will not launch from Outlook for Mac link.</h2>
                    I have lost the ability to launch a Skype for Business meeting. &nbsp;When I click on the link "Join Skype Meeting" a Safari window opens with a lync.com url and nothing happens. &nbsp;I have done a clean uninstall of Lync and Skype for Business and reinstalled
 Skype for Business. &nbsp;Launching Skype for Business just gives me a "Microsoft loop of chasing dots" until it times out with an error. &nbsp;It never even gives me a place to enter a password. &nbsp;I have deletes all Lync and Skype passwords in Keychain. &nbsp;I am using
 an Office365 work account. &nbsp;Being signed in on line makes no difference. &nbsp;Launching the meeting from the online calendar does the same thing.

<h2>            Windows 10 - WI-FI speed limited to 20Mbit&#47;s</h2>
                    <p>After clean install of Windows 10 my WI-FI speed is limited to 20Mbit/s. I tried all things I could find online. Setting up 0% to QoS, disabling updates over the LAN/INET &nbsp;all kind of router parametars etc. Im connecting to&nbsp;Cisco EPC3928S with TP LINK tl-wn722n
 adapter with drivers from Windows 8.1. <br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>My two friends connect to the same router model with same adapter and same windows 10 build and whit same drivers and they have full WI-FI speed.</strong></span><br />
<br />
I have reinstalled system TWICE and again my speed is 20Mbit/s. Also I did speed test from Samsung Galaxy S3 Neo to my router and I have full WI-FI speed of 40Mbit/s. Also when I look connection status it shows that link speed is 72.2Mbps as you can see at
 picture:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a648606d-9901-429d-9707-7008b8979217" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I realy like Windows 10 and it's great &nbsp;but Im seriously close to go back to Windows 7 because there is no solution to this problem... Any one can help?!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just to be clear I am talking about internet download speed, and yes I did called my ISP and it's all good...<br />

            Hi Philip, that is a keyboard language issue . . .
<br />
<br />If the @ symbol on your keyboard is above the 2, you have a US English Keyboard 
<br />
<br />If the " symbol on your keyboard is above the 2, you have a UK English Keyboard 
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Time and Language - Region and Language
<br />
<br />Make sure the correct input language is set at the bottom of that settings page       
        </p>

<h2>            Skype Numbers and Contact ID</h2>
                    I have purchased a Skype Number. When I enter it as the number that I want people to see in Contact ID, Skype says that it has sent an SMS, with a code, to that number. How do I receive that sms with the code so that I can activate my Skype Number?

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for answer. I guess my limited English skills are not helping here ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mouse and keyboard are working - It is that I want to press key on keyboard or mouse and turn on computer instead of using power button on pc case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I solved the issue - after Creators update Fast hybrid boot in Windows was enabled (it was off before update so update put it On by itself). I was thinking about this and remembered that I wrote how windows boot time is shorter than before.... fast boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After powercfg -h off its working again -(have yet to try that on another computer). Load time is still faster than before but not as fast as with fast boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you by any chance know that USB keyboard start is impossible with Fast boot on? I think it is.</p>

            We appreciate that the issue was resolved by turning off the fast boot feature in your computer. It would be best to disable the
<strong>Allow this device to wake computers </strong>option in Device Manager for the USB keyboard and mouse when the fast boot is turned on as it has issues with it.

<h2>            Ruido ventilador</h2>
                    
<p>Bueno, pues compr√© mi xbox one hace un mes exactamente y desde que lo compr√© note que el ventilador hacia ruido, pens√© que era normal, hasta que jugu√© con el de mi hermano y el de el no hace ning√∫n sonido.</p>
<p>Envi√© el xbox a centro de servicio, y al parecer s√≥lo llevaron mi consola a que conociera Zapopan (ah√≠ esta el centro de servicio), el mismo d√≠a que lo recibieron del camion de UPS, lo enviaron de regreso en el camion de FEDEX. Lo enviaron de regreso tal
 cual, EXCEPTO POR QUE BORRARON LOS JUEGOS QUE YA HABIA DESCARGADO, POR LO QUE LOS TENGO QUE BAJAR DE NUEVO, Y COMO SABR√ÅN, NO ES ALGO QUE SEA TAN R√ÅPIDO, venia con una nota diciendo que no encontraron ninguna falla despu√©s de someterlo a pruebas.</p>
<p>Yo no se si esto es una broma de mal gusto, o lo revis√≥ una persona afectada del sentido del oido.</p>

<p>¬øA alguien le ha pasado algo similar? ¬øalguna manera de resolverlo? Por que la √∫nica soluci√≥n que se me ocurre es acudir a la PROFECO.</p>

<p>Aqu√≠ hay un video del sonido exacto que hace el xbox, he le√≠do en el foro de US y all√° si se los han reparado/cambiado.</p>

<p>Hola, gracias por responder.</p>
<p>Ya intente conectarlo directamente en varias tomas el√©ctricas, as√≠ como en reguladores y extensiones. Le coment√© todo a la persona de soporte y me refiri√≥ lo mismo que me dices, que si el sonido no es muy fuerte, no har√≠an nada, pero el sonido es bastante
 molesto, si estas jugando o viendo una pel√≠cula a volumen bajo, se escucha perfectamente el ruido, y me parece que independientemente de que el t√©cnico considere que es o no un ruido fuerte, la consola no deber√≠a hacer ese ruido y me parece injusto que ni
 siquiera hayan reparado lo que me parece es un ventilador mal colocado. Yo no quer√≠a una consola nueva, solo que mi xbox no hiciera ese ruido. No se qie mas hacer, estoy bastante frustrado con el trato que me esta dando Microsoft.</p>

<p>But I get this error on Windwos 7:</p>

<div>I was getting this exact problem. &nbsp;It was because the .reg file was on my mapped H: drive, and when regedit ran elevated, it did not have access to the H: drive.</div>

<p>Long file names are permissible in most operating system, including Linux or Ubuntu, and are always treated the same: You surround them with double quotes, e.g.</p>
<p>regedit "d:\My files\My reg.reg"</p>
<p>This works every time and I suggest that it is someone other than Microsoft who has to catch up with his homework. By the way - you can
<strong>always</strong> add double quotes, even for short file names.</p>
Under Windows 7 most if not all registry modifications require elevated UAC privileges. I suppose this is Microsoft's answer to the countless virus and malware attacks that occurred under previous versions of Windows. To automate your registry modification
 process you probably need to invoke a batch file at boot-up time (to be run under the System account) that performs the registry modification. You might also be able do it with a domain policy too - ask in a server forum for details.

            Ciao, 
<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, a volunteer willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, please try the below:
<br />
<br />1) PERFORM A SYSTEM RESTORE OR A STARTUP REPAIR
<br />
<br />a) Power on and off your computer three times. On the third time, your computer will boot into WinRE
<br />
<br />OR
<br />
<br />b) In Windows 10, select Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; recovery &gt; Recovery &gt; under Advanced Startup, click Restart now.
<br />
<br />OR
<br />
<br />c) Boot to recovery media.
<br />
<br />OR
<br />
<br />d) You can configure a hardware recovery button (or button combination) to run a secondary boot path that includes WinRE. - <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/dn898475" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/dn898475</a>(v=vs.94)
<br />
<br />THEN
<br />
<br />Follow the instructions below under "System Restore" or, if unable, under "Startup Repair":
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/advanced-startup-options-2625805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/advanced-startup-optio...</a>
<br />
<br />2) GO BACK TO PREVIOUS WINDOWS VERSION
<br />
<br />If less than 10 days are elapsed from your upgrade, you can try the below under "Go back to your previous version of Windows"
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />3) If none of the above works, proceed with a clean install:

            Hi Lon.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What I would do is create the bootable media and do the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click System Restore, see if you can go back to an earlier time.
<br />
<br />If not, boot into the recovery environment again, then try performing a startup repair.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, boot into the recovery environment, then click 'Go back to previous version of Windows'
<br />
<br />If that does not work.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<h2>            Msconfig doesn&#39;t open, either does Regedit.exe</h2>
                    There are some programs that I wanted to close out of to try and make my cpu run a bit quicker. So I looked up on how to do so and it said get a scan from Uniblu and figure out what programs you need and don't. So I did (I've already bought uniblu so no
 problems there) and tried to open msconfig
<div><br />
<div>Well when i did, the msconfig asked for permission but as soon as I clicked OK nothing happens. I tried it a couple times more and nothing happened again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't remember what I was doing awhile ago but I tried to open regedit.exe and when I do, it opens and then closes before I can do anything.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried searching for answers and all I get is that it may be a virus. I've got avast though and it's caught nothing (it constantly updates itself and I've scanned throughly)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What is wrong? How do I fix this problem?</div>

<div>Taskmanager works fine...</div>

What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER

had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause
<br />
strange issues). Any others EVER besides Avast? (I use Avast as well.)<br />

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.
<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,
<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate
<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -
<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after
<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually
<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers
<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as
<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check <br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be
<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then
<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem about missing printers is due to the <strong>Print Spooler</strong> service being disabled or stopped. To get your missing printers back, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong>, type <strong>services.msc</strong>, and hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Locate <strong>Print Spooler</strong> and start the service.</li><li>Launch <strong>Control Panel</strong> and check if your printers will reappear.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>

Aileen Alf</a> wrote, the reason that Devices and Printers doesn't show any printers is because the Print Spopler service isn't running.&nbsp; This is also the reason you can't install a printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, simply telling you to start the spooler isn't likely to help because there is a reason that the spooler stopped in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from possible malware, the usual reason that the spooler stops is because you either have a corrupt print job stuck in the queue or a corrupt printer driver.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The procedure for cleaning out the print queue and corrupt printer drivers is below, but considering that you had 5 printers installed and you report that the problem started right after you installed Office 365, you might want to just clean out the queue
 and then repair your Office 365 installation following the instructions here:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/repair-microsoft-office-365-installation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/repair-microsoft-office-365-installation/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A. Clean out stuck print jobs --</span></p>

<li><span>Open an Elevated Command Prompt (search for "cmd.exe"; right-click and select "Run as administrator")</span></li><li><span>Type the following in the black Command Prompt window and press Enter after each line

                    <p>I got my PC upgraded to Windows 10 last week and discovered Windows will not let me open up a JPG by double clicking the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It asks "How do you want to open this file?" and no matter the program I choose or whether I check "Always us this app...." It just relaunches the "How do you want to open this file?" window without opening the file after I make the selection.&nbsp; If I click
 anywhere on the screen without making a selection the popup just goes away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can open the JPG is I right click and select "Open With" then choose the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The defaults program is set in the Control Panel.</p>

<p>Hello Alex,<br />
<br />
There may be several reasons why these JPG files are not opening unless you choose a default program to open it with. One of which may be due to a corrupted system file. To better assist you, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any significant hardware/software changes made on your computer prior to this happening?</li><li>What are the available programs available to choose from on the settings screen? A screenshot of the list would be much appreciated.</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, if you have a different program to set as default to open photos with, try to set it as default temporarily. Restart your PC afterwards for the changes to take effect and check if the JPG files would open normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 will not recognize my monitor or its resolution at random.</h2>
                    <p><span>i7 2600, 8Gb RAM 320GB 7200RPM HDD </span>with a clean install of Windows 10 Pro. At first the computer recognized the monitor an Asus VS247 and set it to its resolution of 1920x1080 @ 60hz and all was good then it updated and no more Asus VS247 but
 it now says its a Generic Non-Pnp Monitor and it locks the resolution to 1366 x 786. I tried a few suggestions they are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Rolling back the display driver. (This did not work as the option is greyed out)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Updating the display driver. (This also did not work)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Updating the display driver picking from one already on the PC. (This did not work the options only two "Generic Non-Pnp Monitor" &amp; Generic Pnp Monitor" had no effect on the issue.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Tried up dating the Graphics Driver Intel HD 2000. (this did nothing as well)</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Got fed up and reinstalled Windows (This worked... Until it didn't at the next reboot it reverted back to not recognizing the monitor correctly.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Checked and updated the Bios (While this is now up to date this also did nothing)</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Unplugging the monitor both from power and from the computer. (This did nothing)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note the monitor its self is just fine and is recognized by other PC no problem with any of its inputs, VGA, DVI &amp; HDMI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: Some times an update or a full restart will get it to recognize or even stop recognizing the monitor and its proper resolution this is insanely frustrating. Would love any help with this.</p>
